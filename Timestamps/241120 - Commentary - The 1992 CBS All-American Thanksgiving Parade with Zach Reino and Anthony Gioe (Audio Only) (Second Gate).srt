1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
hello second gators Michael here before you start this episode I just want to

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,380
make you aware that we recorded like live video of the computer as we were

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,280
watching the parade so we were able to stop and pause so I think the ideal way

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,340
to enjoy this episode would be to watch the video version of it but look do

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,660
whatever you want I'm not gonna tell you what to do I'm not your boss so enjoy

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,660
it either way but again there's a video version also that's been posted on the

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,700
patreon right now and I again I'm recommending doing that but again I

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:40,940
cannot tell you what to do so whatever you decide I am mostly happy with it

9
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:08,740
welcome to podcast the ride show where four men are out on a patio to keep it

10
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:13,620
wild and to keep it real as we explore some of the deepest and darkest crevices

11
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:22,340
of this our American nation's obsession with content is that right yeah so I'm

12
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,500
glad it worked out yeah that makes the show sound really smart like we're

13
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,580
really this is like there's a mission statement here to examine why we create

14
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,900
sometimes it's long conversations about the Disney app sometimes it's deep

15
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,980
delves into the history of this fine nation and it's celebration I think

16
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:52,340
today is one of those celebrations. That's Zach Greino and I'm Anthony Gio. That's right our special guest for this episode. We've never had a guest in the intro before I don't think. No it's kind of fun. Well hold on you two are our guests so Anthony keep going.

17
00:01:52,340 --> 00:02:22,180
So today we're going to posit what Alexander de Tocqueville meant in democracy in America and how long it would take to deteriorate as a country. Oh wow. And are we there yet? I think we've arrived. Well can you then introduce me please? We're here with our special guest. Father of loving father, husband, father of mine, our dad and yours it's my

18
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:46,540
Carlson. Hi thanks so much for having me here. I'm really excited. And also we have the captain of the ship that will never sink. Hold on. Old glory himself? Old hickory himself? Had he built the Titanic it would still be floating today. That's right it'd be a cross from the Queen Mary and you can stay there for cheap before you got on a

19
00:02:46,540 --> 00:03:16,380
cruise. America's historian, your dad and mine Jason Sheridan. Hi. Thank you. This is so exciting to be on our own podcast but not. Yeah we love having you guys. Thanks for coming to Mike's backyard. Yeah it's really good here. The first brisk night of the year as one of you said. That's right. As of record the time listener is 821 p.m. just to give you an idea. The sun set a mere six hours ago. You may hear some fluttering from the

20
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:33,660
tarps that Michael has constructed what I can only refer to as a human terrarium. We've got our little heat lamp. We're on my patio and there's a big tarp around. I felt like it was going to protect us from the wind. And it is doing that. It is doing that. But it is also making a little bit of noise. It is also putting the sails in Jason's ship.

21
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:49,660
It's really like the very sails of the Mayflower. That's right. When you were on the ship. When I was on the ship complaining about like the food. I also could see when you're talking about Mayflower. You could see a scenario where Jason's like oh have you ever been on the Mayflower and we're like what are you talking about.

22
00:03:49,660 --> 00:04:05,660
Mayflower Airlines. The official airline of Pennsylvania from 1985 to 1992. Or like I used to drive Mayflower moving trucks. Me and this guy who kept talking about painting houses. We would always drive these trucks.

23
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:22,660
We were here today to talk do a commentary which we haven't done in a while. Yeah. Like a live commentary. We did. We did one like six years ago but we haven't done it because I'll be honest I don't love doing it. Oh but I do. Jason loves doing it because you just get to hit play and relax.

24
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:36,660
But for me I was like well is there a way we can enhance the experience of doing a live commentary. And I decided to figure out a way to make it very complicated. So we're going to be able to do today is watch this. But if we want to stop we're going to stop.

25
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:50,660
OK. We're going to talk and rewind. We can do anything we want. But I'm going to be recording the video and audio as well. So you the listener can just watch along as we pause and stop and hear our audio. And if it doesn't work you won't hear this part of the podcast.

26
00:04:50,660 --> 00:05:05,660
So live in the sense that we are we are alive while we're doing it that we are alive. Yes. But the thing that we're watching is in fact quite old and not being aired. That is correct. We're not watching something live right. Right now while we speak the Tyson Jake Paul fight is happening.

27
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:20,660
We are not watching it though. Millions of young men across the nation sit down to watch Mike Tyson fight Jake Paul. We're sitting down to watch. We're sitting down to watch. Although let me find the official name of it. It is called.

28
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:34,660
This is true. Zach and I don't know. Yes I've only kind of hinted at it. There there is a there's a thumbnail on the on the projector. Yeah it looks like it is called about six pixels quite old.

29
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:51,660
It is from 1992. It is called All American Thanksgiving Day Parade. A CBS tradition where they show the Macy's Day Parade and other things. In 1992 happened to be a year where they show a bunch of stuff that was happening at Disneyland that year.

30
00:05:52,660 --> 00:06:07,660
So that's the tie in. So this is not the Macy's Day Parade. Well you will see some parts of the Macy's Day Parade on this special. It's like a mashup. So we're going to discover. I haven't. I've watched some of it but I haven't watched all of it. So we will discover things as we go.

31
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:21,660
It's a parade mega mix. Basically. But this wasn't this. Nobody put this together. This was actually the live broadcast because it has commercials from the era from 90 from 1992. And it starts a little abruptly. I wish it started with more of like the intro.

32
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:33,660
But I found a big chunk of it online and it starts just right to Disneyland right to a parade that I've only kind of heard of. OK. And I was blown away immediately by it. And I said well I guess this is what we're talking about.

33
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:57,660
So just to recap. 1992. This is on CBS. This is pre ABC Disney. Right. Pre. OK. Got it. When does that happen. I think the mid to late 90s. Too late. Yeah. Yeah. Whenever Michael Eisner had the premonition to do it whenever he had the feet like an angel spoke to whenever they traded Oswald the rabbit for Michael.

34
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:14,660
It was like 2000s. Is that right. I think so. It was like 2011 20 California venture like 2012. I think. Yeah. I feel like they traded within 12 years with 13 years is when Al Michaels broadcaster got traded for a character. Yeah. Which is true.

35
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:28,660
So we may have to cut here while I do this but I think we'll be all right. Don't cut. Leave it in. Leave it. OK. You guys talk while you. This video is a very complicated looking workflow graphic on screen. Sorry Michael. What is the.

36
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:37,660
What is the. This looks like it's how long. It's two hours and 48 hours and 40 minutes. We don't have to watch all of it.

37
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:49,660
We don't have to watch it. OK. The thing is two hours and 40 minutes. Welcome to part one of three of us watching. Maybe it's a yearly tradition and we watch it in parts.

38
00:07:50,660 --> 00:08:03,660
You don't have to watch all of it. We can zoom around broadcast television. That's strong. Everyone. There was one channel and it was this. Oh my God. Yes. Everybody was watching this in 1992. Can I. Before we even start. Yeah.

39
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:09,660
Say immediately Jason how excited are you to see a carnation instant breakfast sign in the background.

40
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:24,660
Look I lived on carnation breakfast during my summer theater years in high school. They made hot. They still they made hot chocolate long after they made that. They made breakfast. They still make the breakfast. Yeah.

41
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:39,660
I only know them from nutrients. But wasn't the chocolate the breakfast. Huh. There is chocolate in the breakfast. Is there instant breakfast a cup of hot chocolate. It is glorified vitamins and drink. It's fortified.

42
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:52,660
You dump it in a glass of milk and you laugh. But I lost a bunch of weight the one summer I was from carnation. From doing nothing but drinking hot chocolate.

43
00:08:52,660 --> 00:09:08,660
No. Every day from breakfast we're going into the summer theater camp where I was counselor. I would have a glass of carnation instant breakfast and a delicious piece of buttered white toast. And then I would do the elliptical before.

44
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:24,660
There was probably more that and less the toast. I think it was just cutting out soda. I think I largely did it. There were a lot of variables to that experiment. There were a lot of them. Well look. That is the breakfast of a GI unit in 1944.

45
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:41,660
Actively deployed overseas. Jason is eating rations for breakfast. Hardtack. This is pre-MRE. Space ice cream. Have you ever had space ice cream for breakfast.

46
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:53,660
So carnation. So let's see. This is going to we're going to start and if you want the video should be up right now and you will be able to watch along. But here we go.

47
00:09:53,660 --> 00:10:12,660
Here we go. Was that Pete's dragon. No. So there are a bunch of like people dressed like the Flintstones and goofy is singing.

48
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:26,660
So this is actually a couple of years before the Flintstones features. Why would this be happening. So we have wandered right into a goofy parade.

49
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:50,660
So let's do the first pause here. OK. You look blown away. There's so much going on. He is dressed like a caveman and the song is about the goofasaurus. And there are ladies dressed like Wilma and Betty with like a diner kind of like trays walking down Main Street.

50
00:10:50,660 --> 00:11:02,660
Is this though. Is this cross property. Are they supposed to be actually Wilma and Betty. No. Or are they just blatantly ripping off the Flintstones. They're stealing from the Flintstones. Oh really. You thought this was a Flintstones parade. I thought it was a Flintstones thing.

51
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:16,660
Because it looks exactly like. No this is not Flintstones. This is just goofy. So that big dragon thing was not Pete's dragon. That was the goofasaurus. That was the goofasaurus. Now this on the Thanksgiving Day parade.

52
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:28,660
They're showing a thing that they did in 1992 called the World According to Goofy parade. A parade all about goofy. Now I don't know what this has to do with Thanksgiving but they were showing it in 1992.

53
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:44,660
Goofy's first appearance was 1932. So this would have been his 60th birthday. So to celebrate Goofy's 60th birthday a bunch of people dressed up like Flintstones characters. OK. Does it make sense.

54
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:53,660
Yeah it does. There's an original song called Goofasaurus. So do you close your mouth. It's a gape. Because we're going back in. Button it up. I'm stunned.

55
00:11:53,660 --> 00:12:10,660
Well the other thing is you have children doing pattern. There are children. Wait till you see who that is by the way. Because that's coming up. So you have dinosaurs. You have Goofy dressed as a caveman dancing.

56
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:26,660
And there's like a early man playing drums with bones on the parade float. Now we have cut to a stegosaurus. OK. There is a like horrible looking goofy hybrid here.

57
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:35,660
Yeah this is we've seen a few abominations. Yeah. Imagine like the like the movie The Thing. But Goofy's head is on one of those creatures.

58
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:43,660
I know I like this one. I'm on board with this guy. You like this guy. This looks like Pete's dragon. This is like Goofy. This does look like a pre Pete's dragon Pete's dragon.

59
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:53,660
It's just a big green Goofy with a big stretchy green neck. Looks a little like Magellan from Eureka's Castle. It does look like Magellan from Eureka's Castle.

60
00:12:53,660 --> 00:13:03,660
OK. So there's a lot of like dinosaurs with dresses. I like these little freaks. They're good. That is tail. Yes. Well.

61
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:14,660
Tails usually are in the back. Yeah that one's sticking right out the front. That's a choice. I'm sorry. That's a choice. There's no reason there's no reason they couldn't have put this float the other way.

62
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:25,660
That's a choice. This took a long time to build. The Goofasaurus loves to fuck. It's Goofy's 60th birthday and the Goofasaurus loves to fuck.

63
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:35,660
And he's got a curved erection. For 14 seconds. We only have two hours 50 minutes to go. You paused it like three times. We only have two hours 50 minutes to go.

64
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:47,660
It's also impossible to do commentary over it while every 15 seconds a new child pipes in with some quip. Well that's why I think we may be not be able to get through this whole thing today.

65
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:58,660
That's what I'm saying. Isn't this a snake though? Is Goofy a snake? No he's a big dinosaur. Are you sure? He's on his back I think. Those are his hands though aren't they?

66
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:06,660
I guess so. Are they fins? Is he like a Loch Ness? I guess he is. I guess he's like a Loch Ness but he's on his back. That's why it looks like his tail is his wiener.

67
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:17,660
He's preparing himself for Amazon position. For what position? Amazon position. Did you elaborate on that Jason? Hold on raise your hand if you know what he's talking about.

68
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:33,660
Context clues I have a guess. Is there a sexual position called Amazon position Jason? Correct. That's where a fella lies on his back and hoists his legs up.

69
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:46,660
Hoists his legs up. Okay like you spread eagle? Yeah and then the lady mounts him. Clarabelle? Clarabelle what are you talking about?

70
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:56,660
Goofy? No he's talking about Amazon position Mike. Don't be ridiculous. I'm saying if Goofy was here in this position it would be like Clarabelle mounting him.

71
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:09,660
It would be too far. It would be first of all a Clarabelle dactyl because this is the Goofasaurus. Fair enough. It wouldn't be just Clarabelle Mike. It wouldn't be just Clarabelle Dyson is like a fuck a cow.

72
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:28,660
In Amazon position Jason is the man getting pegged or? No no he's like the lady like takes a position as if it was man. This is like a woman on top but the man's legs are up. Like in Amazon.

73
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:46,660
Right got it got it got it. Amazon position. Clearly Goofy is readying himself for his late wife Mrs. Geef. Jason what are you talking about? Goofy is a widower. What? Who is? From Goof Troop his wife died.

74
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:59,660
Is she canonically dead in that movie? What is he divorced in Goof Troop? How cruel would that be? In the 50's he has a spouse occasionally called Mrs. Goof or Mrs. Geef. So did Mrs. Goof die at the start of Goof Troop?

75
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:21,660
Well she's long dead. He's also connected with Clarabelle cow and someone named Glory B. Zanubia and Sylvia Marple. That's from an extremely Goofy movie. Oh I actually haven't seen all of extremely Goofy movie.

76
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:40,660
So that's who would be Amazoning. That's how Mrs. Geef died. She died Amazoning? Yes. You've got to prepare. Every time Jason says Amazon the wind just starts to whiff.

77
00:16:40,660 --> 00:17:03,660
And whips the tarps at us. Okay so these ladies are dancing. And Goofasaurus. And then there's this triceratops. So this parade just to kind of give it. Oh god. Goofy looks horrendous. He looks like a werewolf Goofy. He's so furry.

78
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:20,660
He's got a little bit of a. What's that little ugly thing from the Halloween? Fuzzbucket? It does look like Goofy merged with Fuzzbucket. Yeah. Okay so some context for this. I'm curious. Would this be happening on Thanksgiving at the park? Why would they show this?

79
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:35,660
That's a great question. Because they were trying to get. This was going to draw people to the park. This wasn't a Thanksgiving parade. This was just what they were showing on the Thanksgiving special. So like this year at the park. Right. That's the idea behind it.

80
00:17:35,660 --> 00:18:01,660
But this is a big. There's so many performers. Okay now here we go. Take a look. We have. Wait what? We have Nicole Dubuque from Major Dad. And on the right we have Clark Duke as a child. Wait. I assume so. Fill me in. Who is Clark Duke? Clark Duke has been on. What's the famous Clark Duke? I think Hot Tub Time Machine. Hot Tub Time Machine. Clark and Michael. Michael Cera and Clark Duke.

81
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:31,660
Had a web series 15 years ago. Greek? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. How old was he with that web series with Michael Cera? They were young I'm sure. Because this is 92. And this kid is already. This can't be the Clark Duke right? I don't know. We'll take a look. How old is he? There's no way to find out right? Hold on I gotta close this. I guess for the listener we've just paused on.

82
00:18:31,660 --> 00:19:00,660
The first shot of Nicole Dubuque and Clark. Clark Duke is born 1985. Easily is him. Could be him. Has to be him. Has to be him I think. Hell of a gig. Yeah. And I wish. So he's seven years old here. That looks right. May 5th. May the 5th be with you right? Star Wars day. May the 5th. It's May the 4th. What? What? Huh? What are you talking about? Yeah you know there's that that.

83
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:16,660
That overwhelming power in Star Wars. Called the 5th. Use the 5th Luke. Did you really think it was May the 5th? No I didn't. I was being silly. Oh okay. That was silly. Okay so they're hosting.

84
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:44,660
President elect Clinton. President elect Clinton. So Clinton had been elected recently. That was the only person. Okay now we get to our first commercial here. Lego Technic. Oh yeah. Sure. I never had any of these. The Legos I was not interested in.

85
00:19:44,660 --> 00:20:03,660
Yeah I wasn't interested in them either. No although I feel like they have tried to rebrand versions of this to this day still get made. They just call them other stuff. Yeah. Yeah. This felt a little too much like school to me. Yeah yeah. I know what you're saying. It didn't have the fun. Technically speaking it rules.

86
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:25,660
Oh Jason toothpaste commercial. What toothpaste brand were you as a family? I think we were a Colgate but I've been a Crest Pro Health man for a long time. You're a Crest Pro Health man? That's the yeah. Okay. Zach what about you? What? Sorry I'm watching in real time.

87
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:42,660
America discover toothpaste tubes where the top doesn't detach all the way and where you can stand it on it. Okay now we're at a Sears. Now George Bigelow from Sears is here. Yeah and he's going to sell you an old speaker.

88
00:20:42,660 --> 00:21:11,660
Looks like Ted Cruz. Yeah. Promise Ultra? The early 90s was all about. Promise Ultra Spread. Giving you the like the worst food and calling it low fat. Yeah. It's the Pillsbury Doughboy now. Oh Jason stood up and saluted. You saw the dope Pillsbury Doughboy. It's the low fat or the poppin' fresh.

89
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:29,660
Well you were standing already so it seems good. I was yeah. Jason what does this do for you? This is a brownie commercial. Oh a little fudge on that brownie. Yeah I like that. Yeah. Cool. Pillsbury Bake Tops.

90
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:57,660
No giggling. Commercials haven't changed. So okay now we have switched from Disneyland and we are now in New York City. Okay. And we have different hosts. I don't know that guy. I know that is Mary Lou Henner from Taxi. Who has the thing where she remembers every second of her life. Oh wow. Yeah so she has like a perfect recall of everything in her life. What a curse. What a curse.

91
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:11,660
Wow. Hey me too. I spent my honeymoon in Hawaii. Nice. Nice.

92
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:45,660
I mean I guess. So now we are going to watch a parade in Hawaii. So they are jumping all over the globe here. Okay so that was in New York now they are in Hawaii. With Jeffrey Meek and Cynthia Geary. Yeah Cynthia Geary. Do we know are they from. I don't know we have to look that up. I said Northern Exposure maybe.

93
00:22:45,660 --> 00:23:06,660
I just want to tell you guys in 1992 Clark Duke was one of the main stars of the sitcom Hearts of Fire starring John Ritter, Markey Post and Billy Bob Thornton. Wow really. Lasted 54 episodes. Clark Duke is fourth build. 54 episodes of a show I have never heard of.

94
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:25,660
1992 to 1995. The lowest staff writer has got a mansion in the Hollywood Hills from that show. Yeah currently buying off of council members so their house doesn't fall into the ocean. Good for them. Hearts of Fire. The creator has the sinister name Linda Bloodworth-Thomason.

95
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:55,660
Wait what? Linda Bloodworth-Thomason. No that's metal. Linda Bloodworth is cool. I mean it's pretty metal. Has she done anything else? Yeah some light vampire summonings. How much blood does she drink? She wrote on Designing Women. Oh okay. Pretty good. Have you ever watched Designing Women Jason? I really don't think I have. Maybe I saw like one episode. So I'm going to scan through. This is just a parade in Hawaii. This is just a parade that's happening in Hawaii and like it looks nice but I'm going to zoom so we can get more

96
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:24,660
to the Macy's stuff and back to Disneyland. There's more commercials. Okay so now we're back. So we're back in New York. Garfield's coming. Yes. CBS This Morning. Wow he worked it in nicely. Mark McEwen and Mary Lou Henner.

97
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:54,660
Chicago Airport. It's me too, Mary Lou. This is just the two of them. They're just talking. Stretching yeah. They have thrown to so many different hosts. Yeah wow. Over the course of 20 minutes.

98
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:22,660
We've had five sets of hosts. This is Toronto. So CBS still does this parade. They've changed the branding but there still is a parade special every year.

99
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:39,660
Oh yeah. The networks are using this to be like here's some new actors on our shows that we have. Right. Smart. There's some bagpipe thing happening behind them in Toronto. Oh there's a big duck. This is good.

100
00:25:39,660 --> 00:26:08,660
So now yeah they're in Toronto. In Toronto they don't have. This is not the budget of the Macy's Day parade but it is still pretty impressive. It is like a cuter version of like the penguins duck from Batman Returns. No they're saying this is a goose. If they say it's a goose I will believe them. It looks like a duck to me. Yeah. And there's some unhappy looking children sitting on the goose. Yeah they're freezing and they've been out for five hours.

101
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:31,660
So they're also like they must be like really like belted into the top because that goose looks precarious. Right yeah. They're locked and loaded into that goose. Yeah. Cheerleaders, drummers, bag fibers. Yeah. Oh they're doing Christmas songs. Jason we've got Peter Pumpkin here. Where is his face? He's leaning. I'm not quite sure where his face is.

102
00:26:31,660 --> 00:27:00,660
What is Peter Pumpkin eater is the. Oh my god. Okay. Oh my god. Okay. So Peter Pumpkin is I would say a Peter Pumpkin eater. That's who we're talking about? Yeah. But that's Peter. He's kind of resting on his room or something. He's a porcelain doll of a man. I guess. It cuts away. I don't know who this is but I've loved it.

103
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:19,660
This is a big pink snail. This is a big pink snail with a big green shell. And then there's somebody that people are waving from the shell. There's like windows in the shell.

104
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:47,660
What the fuck? I guess something called the snail started even earlier. You think this parade float is a commentary on the housing crisis? No they turned the shell into a Canadian housing crisis. Canadian housing crisis. Whoa. Look at that cow. Big cow now. Yeah. There's a lot of like big porcelain doll looking faces. This is all fairy tale. This is little boy blue. Oh that. What is that thing coming in and out of the haystack? I didn't realize what's going on. It's a sheep.

105
00:27:49,660 --> 00:28:11,660
Yeah what's going on bud? This is all public domain. Oh. It's Canadians cheaping out on you. It does feel like. Also none of this lines up. Like they couldn't even afford like Felix the cat. No no no. Felix was too expensive in 1980. They're playing an aggressive marching band version of Carol of the Bells. Is it public domain as well?

106
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:31,660
Nothing says Thanksgiving like Carol of the Bells. I'm trying to guess what it is before they say. Oh god. The cat in the boat. The boat cat. The owl in the pussy cat. 1883's cat in the boat. There's a bunch of pigs in this boat with them. There's four little pigs?

107
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:51,660
This is based on Chopin's cat? Honey. Some of these floats are based on old like classical music pieces. We're getting like Chopin trivia right now. We were shitting pretty hard on Goofy and it's looking good compared to this parade.

108
00:28:51,660 --> 00:29:19,660
Yeah they had Goofas. The song was really lively and it was a character that was only 60 years old. Yeah the Goofasaurus is looking. Mommy mommy there's Chopin's cat. You know Jason said that when he was younger though. Of course. Mother rewind the tape. I want to see Chopin's cat. Jason was at the Chopin concert where he played a new piece of classical music and the crowd rioted. You can look at two horrible elves and a dead horse. Oh my god. What the fuck.

109
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:43,660
Two pervert elves. One of them has got his lips pursed like he's like mmm I'm an elf. I thought my time signature that caused a riot was bad. Look at the horse's legs are broken. I'm sorry. Nothing we have seen has not been ugly. This is all so ugly. The snail is the only good one. This horse might not be dead but it was maybe giving birth.

110
00:29:43,660 --> 00:30:04,660
Just a quick update on Linda Bloodworth-Thomason. Thank you. She actually created Designing Women. Oh good for her. Among a number of TV shows like Filthy Rich that starred Delta Burke and Dixie. Delta Burke and Dixie Carter.

111
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:31,660
Delta Burke and Dixie Carter. But most importantly she created the TV show Emeril. Whoa. Wait like Emeril? Emeril Lagasse. Like garlic Emeril. His 2000 to 2001 only got 11 episodes. Oh man. We haven't done Emeril on the show. We've been talking about we've been threatening an Emeril episode for a while because Emeril had a restaurant. Yeah yeah.

112
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:51,660
So yeah we really should get on that. Jason have you ever seen an episode of Emeril? Oh I watched a number of episodes. We were very excited. Well that would likely be all of them. Yeah 11 episodes. I don't think I watched all of them. Were you as a family like very into Emeril?

113
00:30:51,660 --> 00:31:10,660
My brother really loved the Food Network so he loved Emeril and I think we're all excited. I mean I know he broke through. He kind of loomed large for a while. I liked him. I liked when he said bam. But I wasn't so excited about the sitcom. I learned in this moment that he had a sitcom. Okay.

114
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:31,660
I saw him on pasta sauce jars. Yes. Okay. He didn't have a big commercial presence. I mean he was supported by Sherry Shepard and Robert Urick. On the sitcom. Yeah. Was there another? He didn't need support in the kitchen. Is he the only chef?

115
00:31:31,660 --> 00:32:00,660
Yeah. You can keep playing this mic. I just wanted you to turn the sound down because I couldn't hear Jason. Oh sorry. I was too just like when I hear these people talking I'm too distracted by what they're saying. They're so beautiful. And they're not saying anything so you can turn this. So we got Lego. Lego is bad technically. Oh there's some dog butchers blend dog treats. Feed your dog meat from a jug. Probably poison meat in a jug. Toothpaste. The toothpaste that stands up.

116
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:17,660
Oh here we go. Macy's. Let's do some Macy's right here. Okay so we're horrifying turkey. So now we're back in New York. We're back in New York. The weather looks pretty tough. Sleeping Garfield is a good float. Yeah it's like he's sleeping on an invisible bed or something.

117
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:32,660
Jason what sex position does that resemble the most? Mike. What? Like prone? Prone. Prone bone. Prone bone did you say? Yeah. What does that mean? Like just a little line on your stomach.

118
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:56,660
Oh my god. Prone bone. So I just want to point out very similar characteristics. We got Garfield with a tail choice to put his tail in the back. Something that they did not do with the goofy. Yeah he's not on his belly. Also not sleeping just crouched lying down. Yeah he's wagging.

119
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:14,660
And then we have some. Big Muppet dog. So this is like a big puppet dog. I will say this. USA is flexing here. This is significantly better looking. That thing looks big. That's pretty ugly though. Oh there's two dogs there. There's two dogs.

120
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:42,660
Wait this is like a big robot. Those are good puppets. It looks like the back dog is giving the front dog dome. This is a body episode. Look at the faces. This is pretty ugly. I'll say most of the stuff we've seen is pretty ugly. Oh no. Look it's an angle then they're pushing a ball back and forth.

121
00:33:42,660 --> 00:34:01,660
I take back what I see. There's space between them. That one dog isn't going down on that other dog at all. Oh it's the Nestle Quick Bunny. Oh man I totally forgot about this dude. He's wearing his admiral's outfit. Reporting for duty sir. Jason's saluting him.

122
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:18,660
Wow hand to heart Jason. And that's hard for me these days. That was Jason's colonel when he was in the service. He served under the. Nestle Quick Bunny called for a coat red. I could do nothing to stop him.

123
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:37,660
Quick Bunny. That's the wrong bunny idiot. That's the Energizer Bunny commentator man. Wow this is great. I think also just a floating true like balloon float elevates it so much. Yeah I agree. Is it Donkey Kong? No this is the bottom of the Quick Bunny.

124
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:55,660
Oh he's got a drum excuse me. He's like marching in a band. That's why the other guy thought he was the Energizer Bunny. He's got a cue on the front of his drum. Huh? Right? Think about it. Yeah he sure does. Jason. Blue cue. Now a horrifying eyelash caterpillar. With a woman just sitting on its head.

125
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:13,660
Yeah she's like stuck there. Oh a doodle bug. Never mind I take it all back. What is that? It's a doodle bug. You know the famous bug with a lady on top. It's a doodle bug. I know that's a man I'm sorry.

126
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:39,660
Wow Mary Lou Hunter does speak as if she has like total recall. She remembers everything. That was incredible. That guy's a musical archivist. She didn't need any notes. Oh is it raining? Yeah the weather's really bad.

127
00:35:39,660 --> 00:36:07,660
Yeah this doodle bug is really. There's got to be like 50 people in that doodle bug making it move. All non-union. I think. Oh no there's wheels. I guess there's wheels. I think doodle bug's a car. Maybe the doodle bug is just a car. So to drive the doodle bug is that an honor you think? I think so but do you have to get like a tractor's license? It's a special license yeah for sure. I say this every year. This is the last god damn time I'm driving that doodle bug.

128
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:33,660
If this podcast has to end Jason you're going back to driving the doodle bug in the Macy's Day parade. Sorry. You hung up your doodle keys so many years ago. One more doodle ride. Oh the quick rabbit Nestle quick rabbit is coming. Are we going to see a float crash? Fingers crossed. The weather's pretty bad. They've cut to a camera that is covered in rain.

129
00:36:34,660 --> 00:37:00,660
Yeah. The Nestle quick rabbit that was doing pretty good. He looks good. Like so far so good. Jason did you ever have carnation for dinner and quick for dessert? As a breakfast food don't be ridiculous. I know he drinks it quick with dinner. It's Bart Simpson. It's a Nestle's car bomb. It's a weird Bart Simpson. His eyes.

130
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:21,660
If it's carnation and then you chase it with quick it's like a Nestle car bomb or something. Like what would be the name? Nestle quick bomb. Nestle quick bomb. Okay that works. Bart is going very close to the street lights. I can't tell if it's the angle. Yeah you're right. I can't tell if it's the angle. But also the most. He is almost tilting. The most forward part of Bart's head is his upper lip.

131
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:46,660
Yeah they teased. Now we are now. The CBS News is giving us a commercial. Eye on your children they said. Oh yeah they're doing a great job. Oh god. Dan Rather. ET. Wow.

132
00:37:51,660 --> 00:38:02,660
ET was on that night. Yeah you could watch four hours of this special and then two hours of ET. Well with commercials probably three right. That's a good point.

133
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:30,660
Hallmark Hall of Fame presents Brad Johnson and Kathleen Quinlan. Brad Johnson. An American story Sunday. CBS made for TV movie. Yeah yeah. It was Hallmark wasn't it. It seemed like a Hallmark the first CBS yeah. Alright let me zoom here. Join us for an original presentation on a one on one high community with an Eastern exposure. Eastern exposure. Oh that's a little play on Northern Exposure's popularity. Yeah I think that's right. Okay yeah let's go. Let's see what we got.

134
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:55,660
Oh Lego of course Technic is sponsored. There's a lot of commercials on this. Okay back to Macy's. Bart Simpson. The iconic Bart Simpson. Bart doesn't he look like he's getting close to the buildings. Yeah he seems out of control. His teeth and eyes are like about to pop out of his head.

135
00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:19,660
It is a good pose for a flow. He looks like he's like they blew him up a little too much. He's plump. He's got gout. Jason recently on an episode alerted us to a thing that I wasn't familiar with that's like an inflatable fetish. He has the proper name I think. But I didn't know about it. It's a fetish where people like seeing characters blown up like balloons. Yeah sure.

136
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:47,660
Yeah you guys have not heard of this? Adam Sass messaged me and he's like yeah that is a fetish. A lot of people defended Jason because the three people on the podcast were stunned. They'd never heard of this before. Myself included. Plenty of listeners have said this is real. Jason's right. I didn't think he was wrong by the way. Is there a term for it? I think just an inflation fetish. Okay so it's like. It sounds like something Biden has.

137
00:39:50,660 --> 00:40:06,660
Scott looked it up and people were accusing the animators of Tiny Toon Adventures for having this because a lot of the characters suck on helium and blow up. Which was not a thing. And we were trying to figure out what it meant and it's hard. Oh yeah Bart is getting close.

138
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,660
Bart is he going to crash? I can't tell. I don't know.

139
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:32,660
Oh Bart. He's alright I think. There are compilations of Macy's. Yes we've talked about balloon disasters on the show before. But I don't know from this year if we did 92. He hit something. Are you sure he wasn't just doing a wicked trick?

140
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:43,660
Oh my god who's that? Oh everything just went white. Everything. And now here comes the lord.

141
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:56,660
Oh my god all those figures from Tall Tales are coming to take over Gracie Mansion. Oh my god that's just like a statue.

142
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:12,660
Okay so this is a little closer to what we were saying. There's a guy on a horse. Yeah this is like Americana. Yeah kind of vague. Wax figure-esque although not wax. This is like an old steam train.

143
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:24,660
When do you guys think this stuff kind of expired? Because there came a time when they were like why the fuck are we putting Davy Crockett on the frame? At some point someone...

144
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:39,660
I think once we realized we could charge some company for IP and we're not going to put Davy Crockett out there if we can take money from whoever made Heathcliff and put Heathcliff on a big float.

145
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:54,660
Speak of the devil. It's Snoopy. I love Snoopy. Snoopy and we're talking about American IP. I see what you're saying. But there was something. What was the year when we had to stop?

146
00:41:54,660 --> 00:42:03,660
When they were like enough of this public domain. There came a point where someone was like we gotta ring it out. Every second of this needs to be profit.

147
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:15,660
I think that Davy Crockett TV movies were like split up multiple different ways and then I think they were re-aired on early Disney Channel just because they needed something.

148
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:30,660
I remember Davy Crockett being like I would see the hat in like a toy store or whatever. I knew what that was. I'm into that. It was still a popular figure. Although I think it was probably very much on its way out even then.

149
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:38,660
Yeah but I mean when we learned about him whatever that story of Davy Crockett must have been 150 years old already right?

150
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,660
Yeah born on the mountain top of Tennessee.

151
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:47,660
I share your question. Your curiosity about the question of what was the year when it was done. I'm not sure.

152
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,660
Yeah.

153
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,660
Snoopy was wearing a Macy's sweatshirt.

154
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,660
Maybe when Al Michael got traded.

155
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,660
Well they got some good deals at Macy's that sweater those earmuffs.

156
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:11,660
Did I say this about Macy's? I ordered something online and I never picked it up because I didn't want it and I'm like I'll just refund it or whatever and instead of just sending it back to the PayPal I used they sent me in the mail two gift cards with the amount.

157
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,660
Just taped to a letter that said here's your refund.

158
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,660
Go back to Macy's buy it again.

159
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,660
These are gift cards or Macy's gift cards?

160
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,660
Is this Dumbo or is this Clown Elephant?

161
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:27,660
I think it was like I don't think it was Dumbo but Cabbage Patch.

162
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:35,660
These are the Cabbage Patch you could take in the bathtub so they wouldn't their paint wouldn't run if you just got them soaking wet.

163
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,660
Oh my gosh.

164
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,660
They're splashing tan.

165
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,660
Probably glazed with lead so they could get wet.

166
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,660
We melted lead down and gave the Cabbage Patch a bath.

167
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:55,660
Not to backtrack but you know what I just realized is that Davy Crockett is unique and that he is a hero whose fiction exists within American lore.

168
00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:00,660
One of his things is that he patched up the hole in the Liberty Belt.

169
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:06,660
The Liberty Belt is cracked and in American lore Davy Crockett is the one that fixed it.

170
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,660
He's kind of a Forrest Gump like.

171
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,660
His fiction very much overlaps with.

172
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,660
They never fixed the Liberty Belt.

173
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:19,660
Well Davy Crockett patched up the hole in it though which is weird because it is a crack and not a hole.

174
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:22,660
But I guess there used to also be a hole.

175
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:29,660
So like Davy Crockett like if there was a Davy Crockett now in like 150 years it would be like Davy Crockett stopped 9-11.

176
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:33,660
Davy Crockett always said if he had been there that they wouldn't have gone down like that.

177
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,660
Yeah Davy Crockett would have stopped those steel beams from melting.

178
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,660
He would have held them together with his hands.

179
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,660
Right okay because he would have been in the building that's how he would have stopped it.

180
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,660
Yo stop it from the inside for sure not from the plane.

181
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,660
The plane still has it.

182
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,660
He just holds the building in his hands.

183
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,660
Is that what Mark Wahlberg meant as well?

184
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,660
He's got to get to the plane.

185
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,660
He meant he was actually in the building.

186
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,660
With the power of his Catholic faith.

187
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,660
Well stay prayed up he says.

188
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,660
That's right you got to get the app.

189
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,660
For $99 a year you can stay.

190
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,660
Yeah Jason's prayed up.

191
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,660
I text him every morning.

192
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,660
You prayed up?

193
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,660
One thing I like about prayed up is that if you get your prayer streak past a year.

194
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,660
What?

195
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,660
What about your prayer streak?

196
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,660
If your prayer streak past a year you go to heaven.

197
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,660
You go to heaven.

198
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,660
It's like Duolingo.

199
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,660
How long does that streak have to be?

200
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,660
You have to go a full year.

201
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,660
That's it though?

202
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,660
With no saves though.

203
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,660
What do you mean?

204
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,660
You can't freeze your prayer streak.

205
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:38,660
You can't hoard prayers for like one week.

206
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,660
You can't sin and break your streak.

207
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,660
And then like pay the owl.

208
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,660
Pay the owl?

209
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,660
I assume it's still the owl running it.

210
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,660
Well yeah God's an owl.

211
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,660
It's still the Duolingo owl.

212
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,660
God's owl.

213
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,660
Wait y'all don't pray to like owl, raven, crow, wolf.

214
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,660
Zach's religion is owl based.

215
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,660
The old gods.

216
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,660
The real ones.

217
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,660
This country's original gods.

218
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,660
So we're zooming through here and then

219
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,660
this is from, what does it say, New York?

220
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,660
And then there's just like ice skating going on.

221
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:16,660
But this isn't part of the parade because this is an ice rink.

222
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,660
This is an ice rink. This is not part of the parade.

223
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,660
This is outside

224
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:22,660
Central Park perhaps?

225
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,660
Yeah it looks like.

226
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,660
This doesn't look like it's live.

227
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,660
This looks like it was pre-recorded.

228
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,660
And they're just doing like

229
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,660
15 people ice skating.

230
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,660
One man and a bunch of women.

231
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,660
Yes.

232
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,660
Pretty good odds huh boys?

233
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,660
What? Pretty good odds huh boys?

234
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:42,660
Lower your eyebrows.

235
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,660
What? What are you talking about?

236
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,660
They normally wear Egyptian eyeliner

237
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,660
but they didn't want it to run in the rain.

238
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,660
Good commentary.

239
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,660
This is interesting.

240
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,660
There's only a couple people even watching this.

241
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,660
So this was just shot.

242
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:00,660
This almost feels like river dance ice skating in a way.

243
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,660
It is both river dance.

244
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,660
This is supposed to be Egyptian.

245
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,660
It does have

246
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,660
questionable music.

247
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,660
No this is traditional Egyptian music.

248
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,660
Traditional Egyptian ice skating.

249
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,660
That's right.

250
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,660
Done by traditional Egyptians.

251
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,660
Very pale.

252
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,660
Mike I'm curious as a

253
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,660
guy from the suburbs of Chicago

254
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,660
does Mary Lou Henner sound like every

255
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,660
mom you grew up around?

256
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,660
Because I can't stop hearing that.

257
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,660
She sounds a lot like

258
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,660
relatives of my mom.

259
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,660
Oh they're doing Walk Like an Egyptian now.

260
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,660
Oh yeah. No we're in an Egyptian mega mix.

261
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,660
The only song that has the word Egyptian in it?

262
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,660
Well you know Paul McCartney has an album

263
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,660
called Egypt Station.

264
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,660
Steve Martin's King Tut?

265
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,660
Although Paul McCartney's Egypt Station

266
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,660
came out like 5 years ago.

267
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,660
King Tut out at this point?

268
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,660
Oh yeah.

269
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,660
It's been out for years.

270
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,660
This is a third song.

271
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,660
Yeah I don't know what this is.

272
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,660
That was only a little bit of Walk Like an Egyptian.

273
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,660
They didn't want to pay the full

274
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,660
money.

275
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:16,660
They didn't want to pay the bangles money.

276
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,660
They did it one second before they had to pay him just to screw

277
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,660
him. Just to stick it to the bangles.

278
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:24,660
This is interesting. I think we should zoom through

279
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,660
though. Oh they went back to the bangles.

280
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,660
Okay okay. What is this?

281
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,660
We're getting to a commercial with a ventriloquist

282
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,660
and we need to watch it.

283
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,660
Alright so for the listener we're about 45

284
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,660
and a half minutes in.

285
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,660
Yeah something like that.

286
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,660
Man names were different back then.

287
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,660
Okay so now

288
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,660
a ventriloquist dummy

289
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,660
is sick. He's sitting on his

290
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,660
operator's lap.

291
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,660
Well me too. What's not complaining?

292
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,660
I'm not complaining. Somebody is complaining.

293
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,660
Then we'll take something.

294
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,660
Not that cough syrup makes me gag.

295
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,660
When you're all blocked up, Ludens helps.

296
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:00,660
Ludens helps.

297
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,660
Alright who

298
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,660
What in the ventriloquist dummy's

299
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,660
hands were you a Ludens family or

300
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,660
a Halls family? Jason?

301
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,660
Yeah we were a Halls family.

302
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,660
Do you have any Halls on you or in your

303
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,660
apartment? I do have Halls

304
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,660
in my apartment. Okay.

305
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,660
Is this the President and the United States

306
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,660
playing with a tank? That was Gorbachev

307
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,660
playing with a tank.

308
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:26,660
They're just showing people

309
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,660
like throwing batteries

310
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,660
carelessly away.

311
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,660
Oh these are rechargeable batteries.

312
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,660
These batteries

313
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,660
have not decomposed at all.

314
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,660
They are sitting somewhere on this

315
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:40,660
planet earth. These giant

316
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,660
disposable batteries

317
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,660
rechargeable batteries.

318
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,660
You know Ikea only sells

319
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:48,660
rechargeable batteries now. Is that right?

320
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,660
Yeah they don't sell single use batteries

321
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,660
anymore.

322
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,660
Oh yeah.

323
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,660
Wow. I remember

324
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,660
these. Yeah do you have these?

325
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,660
This is a Tiger Electronics Little Mermaid

326
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,660
handheld. These games were awful.

327
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,660
They were really bad.

328
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,660
Unplayable.

329
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,660
Even at the time. I had a number.

330
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:10,660
I did too. Tiger Electronics

331
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,660
made so much money on

332
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,660
unplayable games. Absolutely unplayable

333
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,660
plastic. Unfun

334
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:18,660
unplayable games that you were just excited

335
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,660
about. This is the height of your imagination. You could do anything.

336
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,660
You could go play in the yard with a fucking

337
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,660
stick all day.

338
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,660
Someone would pick up a Tiger Electronics

339
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,660
and you'd be like this sucks.

340
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,660
Ursula's fin would go

341
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,660
up and down, up and down. She wouldn't

342
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,660
move. She wouldn't animate at all.

343
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,660
They suck.

344
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,660
They're one of the worst products ever.

345
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,660
It's true.

346
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,660
I'm getting mad.

347
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,660
You know what sucked a lot about them is they

348
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,660
looked good.

349
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,660
The package was fun.

350
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,660
When I said they looked

351
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:52,660
good, I mean if you saw it in a toy

352
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:54,660
aisle before you turned it on, you'd

353
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,660
be like oh this is like more

354
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,660
colorful than any handheld game

355
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,660
system that would come out for the next like 20 years.

356
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,660
Because there wasn't really, I mean a Game Boy came

357
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,660
out late 80's but that's a high

358
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,660
premium, you know high price.

359
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,660
But like I had a Darkwing Duck one and it was

360
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,660
purple and it had the characters on it.

361
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,660
God I had one and I cannot remember what it was.

362
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,660
And the reason is because I played

363
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,660
it for two seconds and then threw it at a wall.

364
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,660
Of course it sucked.

365
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,660
It was not even, it wasn't, there were like

366
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,660
four things the characters

367
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,660
could do. You know like there was

368
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,660
nothing. It wasn't so much animated as like you

369
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,660
would hit up or down and like

370
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,660
the sort of black silhouette of Ariel

371
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,660
would like disappear from the bottom row

372
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,660
and reappear. You were basically

373
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,660
turning lights on and off. Yes.

374
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,660
You were turning little cell.

375
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,660
Alright I want to look up

376
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,660
the people that, whoever

377
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,660
created Tiger Electronics. We got to do a Tiger Electronics

378
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,660
episode. Oh we do it? I want to know if they ever went to

379
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,660
jail. Someone just uploaded a bunch

380
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,660
of scans from the Toys

381
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,660
R Us. What? Oh yeah yeah yeah.

382
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:54,660
From like

383
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,660
93 or 94 I think.

384
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,660
What happened? And half a page

385
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,660
of it is Tiger Electronics.

386
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,660
I swear. They had an X-Men one

387
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,660
that looks vaguely familiar to me.

388
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:06,660
Vernon Hills. Tiger, Vernon Hills

389
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,660
can we find the founder?

390
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,660
Okay so. Oh it says it's still

391
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,660
going. Tiger's still going. Listen

392
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,660
to this.

393
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,660
Tiger did all those shitty games and then

394
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:18,660
they just had a massive boon.

395
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,660
They created Furby.

396
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,660
Did they really? Wow. Tiger's

397
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,660
behind it Furby. Furby must have

398
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,660
saved them right? You would think so.

399
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,660
They created Harry Potter

400
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,660
Challenge one in 2001.

401
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,660
You can buy today

402
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:34,660
the Tiger Electronics

403
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,660
Marvel X-Men retro

404
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,660
inspired one player game.

405
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,660
From what I can tell

406
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,660
is the exact same game. It is 16

407
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,660
dollars and 50 cents.

408
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,660
That's new? You can buy that today. You can buy that now.

409
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,660
If you're buying that, I'm sorry

410
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,660
you're sick. You have a problem.

411
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,660
What are you doing?

412
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,660
If it's just a display piece I understand that. But if

413
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,660
you're looking for any sort of satisfying

414
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,660
gaming what are you doing? If you're looking to play it

415
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,660
something's happened.

416
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,660
Pick up your phone.

417
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,660
If you're looking to play it something's happened so traumatic

418
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,660
in your childhood that you're trying to fix.

419
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,660
You're trying to fix it.

420
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,660
Something bad, a divorce or something

421
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,660
worse. You played the Tiger Electronics game

422
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,660
and that trauma made you

423
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,660
bond with the Tiger Electronics.

424
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,660
When you lost it like

425
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,660
both of your parents died in a car accident

426
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,660
and you've been cursed ever since.

427
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,660
I'm arguing the trauma of playing the game

428
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,660
itself. Oh you're thinking the trauma?

429
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,660
We should

430
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:30,660
do a full because Tiger's still going.

431
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,660
It's still a company.

432
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:34,660
We need to go find these guys.

433
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:36,660
There's probably also a vaguely cursed thing when you hear

434
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,660
stories about people

435
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,660
burying them in the yard because it wouldn't

436
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,660
stop making noise.

437
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,660
Ten years later.

438
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,660
These guys have just been putting evil

439
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,660
items in people's homes for four decades.

440
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,660
I think these are all

441
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,660
soul jars.

442
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,660
Every single Tiger Electronics

443
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:56,660
product is a

444
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,660
prison for...

445
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,660
So they're like mini Ghostbuster containment units.

446
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,660
Yeah.

447
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,660
Here's the Tiger Electronics still in the blister pack

448
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,660
unopened for the

449
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,660
shadow.

450
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,660
The shadow. Fifty

451
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:12,660
dollars. Very affordable.

452
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:14,660
Buy it now. Click. Buy it now.

453
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,660
Yes. Jason give me your phone.

454
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,660
Send him the link Jason.

455
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,660
Okay fine. I don't want to buy it.

456
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,660
Jason give Zach your phone.

457
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,660
Wait a minute.

458
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,660
They also created a game called Brain Warp.

459
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,660
Do you guys remember Brain Warp?

460
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,660
Is that the little handheld thing?

461
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,660
It's like a Bop It type game.

462
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,660
Yes. I remember ads for it.

463
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,660
We're doing Tiger Electronics episode but not right now.

464
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,660
Oh wait. They

465
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,660
created the

466
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,660
Pokedex. The Pokemon.

467
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,660
Toy. That was just a very

468
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:46,660
That's the thing Zach likes.

469
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,660
Well hold on.

470
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,660
Do you remember that Zach from the late 90s?

471
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,660
Pretty rough.

472
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,660
I owned that.

473
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,660
What the fuck is that?

474
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,660
It was a really

475
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,660
unfunctional

476
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,660
size correct.

477
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,660
Remember this is like pre iPad.

478
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,660
It looked like a portable

479
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,660
dictionary. By the way

480
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,660
someone should take a Kindle and make

481
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,660
a real Pokedex right now. You make a billion dollars.

482
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,660
Because you could do it now.

483
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,660
I won't do it.

484
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:18,660
I refuse to do it.

485
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,660
That's a Tiger license product.

486
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,660
But no I had

487
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,660
that Pokedex.

488
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:26,660
Wow. Well I'm going to hit play

489
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,660
here.

490
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,660
I'm going to zoom through here.

491
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,660
Betty Boop.

492
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:34,660
Jason.

493
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,660
Woodstock's losing it.

494
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,660
There was a flash

495
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,660
of Betty Boop and we all had the same thought to start

496
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:42,660
revving Jason up.

497
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,660
Woodstock's going down.

498
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,660
I had to wipe the fog off his glasses.

499
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,660
Woodstock's

500
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,660
going down.

501
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:52,660
Woodstock has got a little hat on but he's

502
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,660
falling.

503
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,660
Woodstock's just a smaller balloon so he's really getting

504
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,660
blown around.

505
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,660
Snoopy's got a lot more heft.

506
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,660
I think I made the grave mistake of putting too few

507
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,660
handlers with him.

508
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,660
Jason. Betty Boop.

509
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,660
A smooth

510
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,660
round woman.

511
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:12,660
Jason before the engagement did you

512
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,660
write your list?

513
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,660
Your hall pass?

514
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,660
One of Betty Boop's

515
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,660
is the moon.

516
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,660
Jason's going to have a threesome with

517
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,660
Betty Boop and the moon.

518
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,660
Can't compete

519
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,660
with the moon. Jason's a third

520
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:30,660
in their relationship.

521
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:32,660
I mean that's a pretty good third to be

522
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,660
with Betty Boop and the moon.

523
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,660
I guess so.

524
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,660
Alright so I have a question.

525
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:40,660
She's got the kind of no pants that

526
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,660
Elaine Stritch has.

527
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,660
Oh no, Elaine Stritch wears a shirt.

528
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,660
I think she's in a rock hat.

529
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:48,660
She's not wearing no pants, she's wearing

530
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,660
a leotard.

531
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:52,660
What would you call it Jason?

532
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,660
Like a leotard or a body suit.

533
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,660
Were you saying something that cut you off?

534
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,660
I had a question

535
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,660
about Betty Boop.

536
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,660
Will lower the sound and maybe keep it playing?

537
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:06,660
You can let it play, just turn the sound down.

538
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:08,660
Okay so

539
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,660
this is kind of similar to Davy Crockett.

540
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,660
There came a time

541
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,660
where Betty Boop stopped

542
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,660
showing up.

543
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,660
Maybe in the Macy's parade.

544
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,660
Merch.

545
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,660
They would not give her airtime

546
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:24,660
nowadays.

547
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,660
My question though is

548
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,660
when Betty Boop came out

549
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,660
was Betty Boop meant to be

550
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:34,660
watched as a cartoon?

551
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,660
Or was Betty Boop

552
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,660
meant to be attractive?

553
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,660
Like a pinup.

554
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:42,660
I never really understood Betty Boop.

555
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,660
I think it was back when you would get

556
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,660
newsreel

557
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,660
and an animated short

558
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:50,660
and maybe a short comedy

559
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:52,660
before a feature film.

560
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:54,660
Do you think

561
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,660
people were like, wow

562
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,660
look at her.

563
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,660
I think the people that conceived

564
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,660
of the animation for

565
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,660
and drew

566
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,660
Betty Boop were attracted to Betty Boop.

567
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,660
Yes, I think so.

568
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,660
So there was, like there is a

569
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,660
Betty Boop was someone's OC

570
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,660
that they loved.

571
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,660
I said I gotta pause this. Betty Boop

572
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,660
I think that those

573
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:20,660
old cartoons are good.

574
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:22,660
The old Fleischer cartoons are good

575
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,660
and weird and interesting.

576
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:26,660
But in addition

577
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:28,660
people were supposed to be attracted to her.

578
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,660
The person that drew

579
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,660
Betty Boop was 100%

580
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:34,660
horny for Betty Boop.

581
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,660
She's too hot.

582
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,660
She's intimidating.

583
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:42,660
But cartoon character wise

584
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,660
as a child, did you like

585
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:46,660
Lola Bunny?

586
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,660
Were you often attracted

587
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,660
to old lady characters?

588
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,660
I don't think I was aware of Betty Boop as a kid.

589
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:54,660
Sure, I'm just saying in general.

590
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,660
Lindsay just walked into the perfect

591
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:58,660
conversation.

592
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,660
I'm just asking

593
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,660
whether or not Betty Boop was supposed to be sexy.

594
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:04,660
He doesn't like, he doesn't, he thinks

595
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,660
Betty Boop was attractive to you.

596
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,660
She's supposed to be pure sexy.

597
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,660
Lindsay says she's supposed to be sexy.

598
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,660
She's supposed to be horny for Betty Boop.

599
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,660
So at the time there were people

600
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,660
that were like, oh my god, Betty Boop.

601
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:18,660
They couldn't, yeah.

602
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,660
Husbands left their wives.

603
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,660
Think about who else they had.

604
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,660
They chased the airplanes that she was painted.

605
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,660
The 52 bombers

606
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,660
who was painted on them.

607
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:30,660
Oh my.

608
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,660
Is there a Mr. Boop?

609
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,660
They're in a modern

610
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,660
comic.

611
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,660
Oh yes.

612
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,660
It's incredible.

613
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,660
There's one guy constantly

614
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,660
aghast at his luck.

615
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:46,660
Oh, okay.

616
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:48,660
It's Alex

617
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:50,660
Robbins.

618
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,660
It's great.

619
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,660
Because Lindsay is not on

620
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,660
microphone.

621
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,660
I'm going to have to crank that audio level up later.

622
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,660
There's a lot of audio correcting for all the noises out here.

623
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,660
No, the noise is good.

624
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,660
The noise is good.

625
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,660
It sounds like we're on a ship and the waves

626
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,660
keep washing us.

627
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:10,660
I was thinking the same thing we could just say.

628
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:12,660
We could at the top say we're all on a ship.

629
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,660
Are you both out of your, why do you not think

630
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:16,660
that I said that Jason was America's captain?

631
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,660
He's the captain of the ship

632
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,660
that we're on right now.

633
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,660
Now we understand.

634
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,660
He's wearing a captain's hat.

635
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,660
He's the captain.

636
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:28,660
He's Heathcliff's

637
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:30,660
friend, Riff Raff's

638
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,660
girlfriend who was a cat when you were a kid.

639
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:34,660
No, I see what you're getting at.

640
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:36,660
I'm just wondering in general, did you have

641
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:38,660
a lot of crushes on cartoon characters?

642
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,660
The first and I think only cartoon crush

643
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:42,660
that I had as a kid was,

644
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,660
and I've said this before, is Maid Marian

645
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,660
from Robin Hood the Fox.

646
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,660
From Robin Hood the Fox.

647
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:50,660
That's the first one. I've heard lots of

648
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,660
women say Robin Hood.

649
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:54,660
Honestly, him too.

650
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,660
They look basically identical.

651
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,660
Yeah, sure.

652
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,660
Interesting.

653
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,660
No, it's a good question. Maybe

654
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,660
like April Neal.

655
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:06,660
I was like,

656
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,660
get out of here. I'm seeing my friends

657
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,660
at Turtles with April.

658
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,660
I think I also didn't care about April

659
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,660
in that way. But also I didn't care about

660
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:16,660
Maid Marian in that way. That was more of a like

661
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:18,660
she's the hero

662
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,660
and she's with him.

663
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:22,660
So if you're the hero, she's with you.

664
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:24,660
You know what I mean? Yes.

665
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:26,660
You'd be like, well, I would like to be Robin Hood.

666
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:28,660
So I guess that's my wife.

667
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,660
Maid Marian is my wife.

668
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:32,660
I think I pretty early on

669
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:34,660
fell in love with Kathy Ireland.

670
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:36,660
Okay.

671
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,660
That's a different story.

672
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:40,660
Anthony's like, look,

673
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,660
I don't need these cartoons.

674
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:44,660
I got Kathy Ireland at home.

675
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,660
On a magazine.

676
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,660
I was just home recently

677
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,660
and my mom, we had

678
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:52,660
some of my old school stuff.

679
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:54,660
Kathy Ireland posters on the wall.

680
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:56,660
My mom unrolled my old Kathy Ireland poster

681
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:58,660
so I could sleep well.

682
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:00,660
No, but we found

683
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,660
an old daily journal

684
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:04,660
where you'd go into class, and this

685
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,660
is in third grade, and

686
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,660
there would be a question on the board and then

687
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:10,660
you'd write in your journal, see ya Lindsay.

688
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,660
And

689
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:14,660
the question

690
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:16,660
was, if you could invent anything,

691
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:18,660
what would you invent?

692
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,660
Love machine.

693
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:22,660
Not far, not far.

694
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:24,660
My answer was

695
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,660
x-ray goggles so I could look through

696
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,660
Kathy Ireland.

697
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,660
In third grade.

698
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:34,660
So parent-teacher conferences.

699
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,660
My parents had to face

700
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:38,660
the music for me.

701
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:40,660
Did you get yelled at?

702
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:42,660
No, no, no.

703
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:44,660
No one brought it up.

704
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,660
I was like eight or nine.

705
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:48,660
Yeah, no, I wasn't expressing.

706
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:50,660
Old enough to have some ingenuity, I guess.

707
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,660
To make some x-ray goggles.

708
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:54,660
You know what's funny? I'm remembering this.

709
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:56,660
I've never said this on the show before.

710
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:58,660
I made another kid ask

711
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:00,660
my mom and his mom if I could buy

712
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,660
that Marvel swimsuit special.

713
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,660
Which they had it in like fifth or sixth grade.

714
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:06,660
They had the Marvel swimsuit special

715
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,660
which had both female and male characters

716
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,660
in like swimsuits. Obviously it was

717
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:12,660
drawn. But I made another kid

718
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,660
go up to my mom and

719
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,660
his mom and they just completely ignored the question.

720
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,660
We never talked about it.

721
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,660
Never got it.

722
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,660
So you told him,

723
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:24,660
hey, go ask them to buy this.

724
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,660
Go ask my mom if I can buy this.

725
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:28,660
Yes, because I was so embarrassed about it.

726
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:30,660
But I must have been in fifth or sixth grade.

727
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,660
And I never got it. I never owned that.

728
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:34,660
But I was obviously intrigued.

729
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:36,660
I think I really wasn't that attracted to

730
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:38,660
cartoon characters until the X-Men.

731
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:40,660
Man, all of this is so wild in the

732
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:42,660
context of today. This is all like

733
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,660
pre-the internet.

734
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:46,660
Yes, very early.

735
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:48,660
Well, I guess fifth or sixth grade. Yeah.

736
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:50,660
For me.

737
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,660
Yeah, this is like...

738
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:54,660
It was definitely pre-the internet because

739
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:56,660
I was renting

740
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:58,660
Necessary Roughness starring

741
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:00,660
Sinbad and Kathy Ireland and Scott

742
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,660
Bakula so I could see Kathy Ireland.

743
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:04,660
I need to go

744
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,660
through the grade. Anthony, you want to read

745
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:08,660
Necessary Roughness

746
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:10,660
again? I need to Google

747
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,660
Let's see. OK, we got Spider-Man here.

748
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:14,660
Let's zoom here.

749
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:16,660
We're kind of resetting now that I've calmed down.

750
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:18,660
We're 52 minutes in

751
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,660
to the listener. Oh, Spider-Man and

752
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:22,660
Woody Woodpecker. Yeah.

753
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:24,660
Spider-Man is almost an identical

754
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,660
to what Garfield was doing.

755
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:28,660
What, prone? What is this? Prone bone?

756
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:30,660
Prone bone, yeah. This would be prone bone.

757
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:32,660
And Woody Woodpecker

758
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,660
right behind. Yeah, what is that?

759
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,660
If Woody Woodpecker were to hit him with

760
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,660
his beak, what would that be called?

761
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:40,660
Fegging. Sorry, pecking.

762
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:44,660
Excuse me. Spider-Man

763
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:46,660
has Mary Jane. Woody Woodpecker has

764
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:48,660
Weenie Woodpecker. I do know this.

765
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:50,660
Because you've said it before many times.

766
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,660
Woody Woodpecker's girlfriend has Weenie Woodpecker.

767
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:54,660
Are they also both deceased?

768
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,660
I think they're alive. Well, Mary Jane is

769
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:00,660
uncertain. Woody Woodpecker,

770
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:02,660
you can...

771
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:04,660
We were just at Universal, Nicole

772
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,660
and I, and you could get a popcorn

773
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,660
packet for like $11 that was Woody Woodpecker

774
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:10,660
driving the Universal tram.

775
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:12,660
Yeah, I have one in my car, Zach.

776
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,660
It's much too cheap for what it is.

777
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,660
Yeah, because they made a ton of them because it's the anniversary

778
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:18,660
of the tram tour and they didn't sell well.

779
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:20,660
Which is crazy because it's so cheap.

780
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:22,660
I guess they were probably more expensive.

781
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:24,660
I think they were like $40 and now they're

782
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,660
like $8.

783
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:28,660
He goes left and right and if you hit it, it makes

784
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,660
a Woody Woodpecker sound. Yeah.

785
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,660
They're like $8 and they're giving him money.

786
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,660
Of course. It's a great

787
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:36,660
buff. Do you think children today

788
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:38,660
know Woody Woodpecker?

789
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:40,660
No. Do you think they know Davey Crockett or

790
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:42,660
Woody Woodpecker more? Neither.

791
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:44,660
Woody Moore.

792
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:46,660
Woody Moore because he's at Universal. Woody Moore, but they don't

793
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:48,660
know either. They don't know either.

794
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:50,660
But they know Winnie.

795
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:52,660
Winnie Woodpecker.

796
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:54,660
Also on Jason's list, Hall Pass list.

797
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,660
Well, they televised our funeral.

798
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:58,660
Oh my God. America

799
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,660
wept. All the former presidents

800
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:02,660
were there.

801
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:04,660
In their respect to Winnie Woodpeckers.

802
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,660
Sandy Carter was there. Animated.

803
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:08,660
Nixon was alive. That's right.

804
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,660
We all kind of softened because he spent so much

805
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:12,660
time in her casket.

806
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:14,660
Well, they ended up playing.

807
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:16,660
When she was in Hollywood, he was

808
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:18,660
in Orange County. He would drive up and see her.

809
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:20,660
Of course.

810
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:22,660
Winnie, you're the woman of my dreams.

811
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:24,660
That was something more like Lincoln.

812
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,660
That was pretty good.

813
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:28,660
All the presidents kind of sounded like that except

814
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:30,660
for LBJ. Is this a prisoner

815
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,660
that's freeze-framed right here?

816
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:34,660
That's commercial, Mike. I think this is Circus.

817
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:36,660
Because there was a guy with steam coming out of

818
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,660
his ears. Oh, whoa.

819
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,660
Oh, Circus of the Stars.

820
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,660
Zach, do you know about Circus of the Stars?

821
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:44,660
Well, I remember this. Put some motorbikes

822
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:46,660
in a big iron cage and watch them go

823
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:48,660
around in circles was a thing that the Circus did

824
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:50,660
for years. That's true, but this show

825
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:52,660
specifically, they would take sitcom

826
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:54,660
stars. Who was in it?

827
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:56,660
I don't know. Did they say?

828
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:58,660
Did they list? They listed one guy.

829
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:00,660
This file

830
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:02,660
is too big. When I try to scroll, it just takes

831
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:04,660
me back like 15 minutes, even though I

832
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,660
went about a half a millimeter.

833
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:08,660
The video quality is so bad, I would believe

834
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:10,660
it's three kilobytes.

835
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:14,660
Yeah, it's a JPEG

836
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:16,660
bigger file.

837
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:18,660
Go from there. Oh, is this the Back to the Future

838
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,660
cartoon? Yeah. Okay. I don't

839
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:22,660
know. This is hard to do. This is great.

840
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,660
This is great.

841
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:26,660
There's a person in a ship. Yeah, there's some

842
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:28,660
boat thing in front that they haven't talked about at all.

843
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:30,660
Yeah.

844
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:32,660
It's possible.

845
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:34,660
Okay, here we go.

846
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,660
Designing women

847
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,660
to 90210. Oh, it was Brian Austin Green.

848
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:40,660
Oh. The guy in

849
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,660
the stripes was Brian Austin Green. I think this is just a generic

850
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:44,660
thing. It wasn't promoting

851
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:46,660
the specific episode. And that's Tim Curry?

852
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,660
Yeah, I guess so.

853
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:50,660
Oh, Kid TV.

854
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:52,660
Do you remember that brand? Kid TV revival?

855
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,660
What is that alien show? What was that?

856
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:56,660
Oh, Ninja Turtles.

857
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:58,660
Wait, ew. What are those aliens?

858
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:00,660
Was that Tim Curry in the alien show?

859
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,660
I'm not really sure. What the hell is that?

860
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:04,660
Is that Gilbert Godfrey?

861
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,660
It looked like Gilbert Godfrey. Oh, maybe it was.

862
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,660
Kid TV. Jason, look up Kid TV

863
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:10,660
CBS. And what was that

864
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:12,660
alien show? You had to figure out those ugly things there.

865
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,660
Yeah. Okay. Oh, my God.

866
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:16,660
What is this? I feel like most of this podcast

867
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:18,660
has been figure out what those ugly things are.

868
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:20,660
Well, I wanted to go in front of

869
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:22,660
Arsenio, of course, 1982.

870
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:24,660
Arsenio Hall Show. All right. We're back to

871
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:26,660
the Macy's Parade. I wanted to see

872
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:28,660
if we can get back to. Oh, my God. This is terrifying.

873
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:30,660
Horrible pilgrims. Horrible pilgrims.

874
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:32,660
Oh, man.

875
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:34,660
Terrible presidents.

876
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:36,660
Well, Ben Franklin wasn't our

877
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:38,660
president.

878
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:40,660
In a way, Ben Franklin was our worst

879
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:42,660
president. Shadow president.

880
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,660
Yeah. He was like

881
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:46,660
Dick Cheney in his day. He was

882
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:48,660
never a vice president. He didn't do any of his presidential

883
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:50,660
duties.

884
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:52,660
Oh, is this the way the Statue of Liberty, but she's got

885
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,660
kind of like a different dress. She's got like a

886
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:56,660
sarong. She's wearing like an American

887
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:58,660
flag sarong. Yeah, which is disrespectful.

888
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:00,660
Yeah, because she's got a regular outfit

889
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:02,660
on underneath. Does that doesn't look like that?

890
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:04,660
Yeah. She didn't take off

891
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:06,660
her robes of liberty.

892
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,660
Can she? I guess she can't

893
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:10,660
take off her robes of liberty. Is she holding

894
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:12,660
a brick or is that her normal

895
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:14,660
tablet? I think it's a normal. I think it's a book.

896
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,660
It's not a tablet, right? It's not the Ten Commandments.

897
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:18,660
Yeah, it's a tablet.

898
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:20,660
She's holding her

899
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,660
Kindle, yeah.

900
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:24,660
I forgot they updated her.

901
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,660
It's so weird to just see her with

902
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:28,660
the bottom cut off. Yeah.

903
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:30,660
It is odd. What did they

904
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,660
put in the flame?

905
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:34,660
A big flower?

906
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:36,660
She looks wobbly.

907
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:38,660
Looks wobbly as hell. Yeah, I was going to say

908
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:40,660
it doesn't look good. Looks unsafe.

909
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:42,660
Spider-Man's chasing two eggs. Jason,

910
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:44,660
were you ever attracted to the Statue of Liberty?

911
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:46,660
I can't say

912
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:48,660
that I was. Although, it's funny

913
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:50,660
we were talking about cartoon character

914
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:52,660
crushes. Jane thinks

915
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:54,660
I'm nuts any time. I'm like

916
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:56,660
what cartoon character did you have

917
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,660
crush on? She's like what are you talking

918
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:00,660
about? It's cartoon. I'm like

919
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:02,660
Roxanne or Babs Bunny

920
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:04,660
or Lola Bunny? I guess I did like

921
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:06,660
Roxanne. No.

922
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,660
What did you tell her your number one was?

923
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,660
Probably Roxanne

924
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:12,660
from the Goofy movie.

925
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:14,660
That's a not uncommon one.

926
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:16,660
The movie starts with a sex dream

927
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:18,660
that turns into a nightmare.

928
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:20,660
In case you haven't seen it, it is a

929
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:22,660
he's having a sex dream. She's

930
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:24,660
in like a big field and

931
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:26,660
it's like magical and she's wearing like a dress and she's

932
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:28,660
making these eyes at him. And I

933
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:30,660
watched it recently and I'm like oh my god.

934
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,660
It's a romance dream for sure. Obviously it's not

935
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:34,660
explicit but and then it turns

936
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:36,660
into Goofy. It's Goofy's or Max's? Max's.

937
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,660
Not Goofy.

938
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:40,660
Son's girlfriend?

939
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:42,660
She's markedly not his girlfriend

940
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:44,660
Mike. Oh but he wants that. That's

941
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:46,660
what he wants.

942
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:48,660
For that to happen.

943
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:50,660
Shout out to Winnie. Rest in

944
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:52,660
peace.

945
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:54,660
Winnie is kind of like

946
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,660
he's all of his limbs are going out

947
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:58,660
like a star

948
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:00,660
almost. He looks low to the ground. That looks

949
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:02,660
dangerous. He's stepping on people.

950
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:04,660
He's concussing people left and right with

951
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,660
the heel of his feet.

952
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:08,660
Because the big balloon is so big

953
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:10,660
if it hits you at like

954
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:12,660
five miles an hour it's like it really

955
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:14,660
knocks you down. Man you really could just leave

956
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:16,660
nothing on TV for a long time in the early

957
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:18,660
90's couldn't you? That's right.

958
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:20,660
It was Thanksgiving Day that was on the

959
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:22,660
last day. We had insane attention

960
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:24,660
spans.

961
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:26,660
Bill Clinton had just been elected.

962
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:28,660
12 years of

963
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:30,660
Republican rule.

964
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:32,660
It's over.

965
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:34,660
Okay the marching band has

966
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:36,660
these big ponchos on.

967
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,660
Waving flags.

968
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:42,660
I'm still looking for kid

969
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:44,660
TV. Because CBS

970
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:46,660
has had so many kids programming

971
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:48,660
blocks. We are only an hour into this

972
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:50,660
so far. They did not hit the sweet spot

973
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:52,660
like Fox kids.

974
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:54,660
We're coming up on the hour mark.

975
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:56,660
Yeah

976
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:58,660
this is I like these

977
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:00,660
colorful ponchos back. Oh no they're not

978
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:02,660
ponchos they're like dresses. They're playing Phantom

979
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,660
of the Opera. Yeah they're playing Phantom.

980
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:06,660
Oh we might be getting a Phantom

981
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,660
coming. Is that what this float is you think?

982
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:10,660
I don't know there's all these women in like

983
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,660
very colorful big dresses.

984
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:14,660
Old school looking dresses.

985
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:16,660
There's no Phantom of the Opera

986
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:18,660
thing going on they're just playing it

987
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:20,660
for some reason. Okay now we've got like

988
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:22,660
some like people wearing red and

989
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:24,660
white and it looks like a kids show.

990
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:26,660
Yeah they're in school.

991
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:28,660
Treehouse. Oh but they went to commercial

992
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:30,660
to really tease us to stick

993
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:32,660
through Kodak. Let's scroll

994
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:34,660
through here. Woman throwing

995
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:36,660
a large penny commercial. Show of hands were you a Crayola household

996
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,660
or a Roseart household?

997
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:40,660
Roseart. What the hell is that?

998
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:42,660
We were Crayola. Roseart was another

999
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:44,660
brand over there. Can you turn the sound on it down even

1000
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,660
more Mike? Thank you.

1001
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:48,660
Crayola for sure. Yeah we were Crayola.

1002
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:50,660
That sounds exactly the same. Why is Woody so

1003
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:52,660
low?

1004
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,660
It seems dangerous.

1005
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,660
They're trying to get him up like that. Are we going to witness a disaster?

1006
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:58,660
Did you pick this

1007
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:00,660
like dessert hidden agenda Mike?

1008
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:02,660
Because it feels very

1009
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:04,660
You know what the agenda was?

1010
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:06,660
A couple weeks ago I go you know what we

1011
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:08,660
should do because we're Scott Free

1012
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,660
and Jason and I are like

1013
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:12,660
what are we going to do? What haven't we

1014
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:14,660
done in a while? Is that what these episodes are called?

1015
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:16,660
Scott Free? These episodes are called Scott Free.

1016
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:18,660
Oh Goofy's here.

1017
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:20,660
And I said oh you know what we'll

1018
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:22,660
do? One of those Disneyland Thanksgiving specials.

1019
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:24,660
I tasked Jason with finding one

1020
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:26,660
and I go done deal.

1021
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:28,660
And then he's like yeah there's none

1022
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:30,660
of them and I go what? They've been scrubbed?

1023
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:32,660
No in my mind they just existed.

1024
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:34,660
They never existed apparently.

1025
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,660
So I had to hunt and find something that was

1026
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:38,660
Disney and Thanksgiving.

1027
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:40,660
And that's the special here.

1028
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:42,660
So that's the reason we're doing this.

1029
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:44,660
We have not been back to Disneyland at all.

1030
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:46,660
No we've been on the Macy's Play.

1031
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:48,660
We have been back to Hawaii.

1032
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:50,660
And there are for some reason still playing Phantom of the Opera.

1033
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:52,660
And there are two hours to go Jason.

1034
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:54,660
And Goofy's back though.

1035
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:56,660
This is Goofy dressed as Santa. This is pretty good

1036
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:58,660
I gotta say. And he's got a wreath.

1037
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:00,660
Is he stuck in it?

1038
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:02,660
So I think the implication is he's tied

1039
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:04,660
he's got some lights

1040
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:06,660
tangled in some lights.

1041
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:08,660
Yeah he's tangled in lights and a wreath.

1042
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:10,660
It looks like the wreath is really

1043
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:12,660
like stuck on his

1044
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:14,660
like crotch area. Like he's stuck

1045
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:16,660
both legs. One leg is

1046
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:18,660
through the wreath. Cutting up the world according to Goofy

1047
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:20,660
parade. Oh we're gonna go back to that

1048
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:22,660
parade from the start.

1049
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:24,660
So yeah Goofy has got himself really

1050
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,660
painfully caught in this wreath. He's sitting in it like it's a tire

1051
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:28,660
swing. Right.

1052
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:30,660
But it looks like it's wrecking his groin.

1053
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:32,660
No but he's having a great time. Look at his face.

1054
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:34,660
Jason what do you call it the sex

1055
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:36,660
thing when you get stuck in a wreath

1056
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:38,660
and it's stimulating you.

1057
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:40,660
Is it wreathing? Wreath play? Wreath play.

1058
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:46,660
Christmas is coming up Jason.

1059
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:48,660
Get the wreath out of the crawlspace.

1060
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:50,660
You need to tell me twice brother.

1061
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:52,660
Jason at Lowe's picking out the right wreath.

1062
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:56,660
What's your return policy on that

1063
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:58,660
bad boy? What's that voice?

1064
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,660
He's got wreath in his mouth.

1065
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:02,660
I was chewing it over.

1066
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:04,660
You gotta take a bite out

1067
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:06,660
of that.

1068
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:08,660
Well I was about to say I have another

1069
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:10,660
update on one of these

1070
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:12,660
Linda Bloodworth Thomasons shows.

1071
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:14,660
Oh my god. Oh please.

1072
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:16,660
This one only lasted looks like

1073
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:18,660
about one season.

1074
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:20,660
It's called Women of the House.

1075
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:22,660
And the description is that Suzanne

1076
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:24,660
Sugar Bear of Designing

1077
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:26,660
Women rocks the U.S. Capitol when

1078
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:28,660
she takes over her recently

1079
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:30,660
deceit's husband seat

1080
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:32,660
in Congress. Now this was

1081
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:34,660
Delta Burke.

1082
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:36,660
Delta Burke is on every show. The late Terry

1083
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:38,660
Gar. Well she's reprising role from

1084
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:40,660
Designing Women. Terry Gar

1085
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:42,660
just recently passed. Patricia

1086
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:44,660
Heaton. Jonathan Banks.

1087
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:46,660
Wow. Mike Ermentrout.

1088
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:48,660
Yeah. Wow.

1089
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:50,660
Okay well you got a lot of homework to do

1090
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:52,660
watching all these shows. How many of your listeners don't know who any of these

1091
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:54,660
people are. If they're on

1092
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:56,660
the second. Yeah they know.

1093
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:58,660
They know most of those people I think.

1094
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:00,660
Maybe not.

1095
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:02,660
I would say 90 percent of the time.

1096
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:04,660
I don't have a clue who y'all are talking about.

1097
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:06,660
These ones are pretty old. I don't even

1098
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:08,660
know these ones that well.

1099
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:10,660
But you didn't watch TV growing up.

1100
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:12,660
Sure. Like Delta Burke is someone

1101
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:14,660
I know and then apart from that you could have

1102
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:16,660
made up a bunch of them. Jonathan Banks is Mike

1103
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:18,660
on Breaking Bad. Oh sure.

1104
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:20,660
You know him. And then Terry Gar

1105
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:22,660
just died. She's in a ton

1106
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:24,660
of things. What is she in? Young

1107
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:26,660
Frankenstein.

1108
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:28,660
Oh yes. Yes this is yes.

1109
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:30,660
She's on Laddermen a lot. Why can't I think of another

1110
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:32,660
Terry Gar movie. Mr.

1111
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:34,660
Mom. Michael Keaton's Mr.

1112
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:36,660
Mom. Richard Nixon was the president.

1113
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:38,660
I've heard of him.

1114
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,660
And he

1115
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:42,660
stood solemnly by

1116
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:44,660
Winnie Woodpecker's funeral.

1117
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:46,660
So now we got Beauty

1118
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:48,660
and the Beast. We got Lumiere. We got the Beauty and the Beast.

1119
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:50,660
We got Mrs. Potts. We got Chip.

1120
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:52,660
It's coming out. It's 92.

1121
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:54,660
By the way

1122
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:56,660
this Mrs. Potts face is stoned

1123
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:58,660
out of its mind. This is a hit though.

1124
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:00,660
I got to say this is

1125
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:02,660
this movie was so big. The Float is the

1126
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:04,660
Beast castle. I was like what is this

1127
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:06,660
generic castle. Mrs. Potts you put the

1128
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:08,660
joint in the top part of the

1129
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:10,660
pot in her nose part.

1130
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:12,660
Yeah she's hot boxing herself.

1131
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:14,660
You puff out her

1132
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:16,660
nose? Yeah you puff out her nose.

1133
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:18,660
These look pretty good.

1134
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:20,660
Pretty good.

1135
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:22,660
The only one I don't like is Mrs. Potts.

1136
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:24,660
Around 92 most of the suits in the

1137
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:26,660
park in Disneyland would look good.

1138
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:28,660
But then you would get the poo suit where he had

1139
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:30,660
that weird five o'clock shadow that we always

1140
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:32,660
talk about where his snoot had like

1141
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:34,660
kind of a dark thing going on

1142
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:36,660
where it really looked like he didn't shave his snoot.

1143
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:38,660
These are

1144
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:40,660
good. The only one that weirds

1145
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:42,660
me out even a little bit is Mrs. Potts and it's just

1146
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:44,660
that she looks tired which makes sense because Chip

1147
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,660
is a handful. She's a little too

1148
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:48,660
half-lidded.

1149
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:50,660
They gave bags under her eyes.

1150
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:52,660
That's what I think it is.

1151
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:54,660
She looks like a boardwalk

1152
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:56,660
shirt of Mrs. Potts that says

1153
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:58,660
blaze one be

1154
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:00,660
my guest blaze one off. More like Mrs.

1155
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:02,660
Potts. Not Dizzy's

1156
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:04,660
boardwalk. Mrs. Potts.

1157
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:06,660
Mrs. Potts.

1158
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:08,660
We should make that shirt. Yeah

1159
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:10,660
really. Why we'll make a million

1160
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:12,660
dollars each. We're all

1161
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:14,660
putting it.

1162
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:16,660
I'll take 250. Okay.

1163
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:18,660
This is Potts.

1164
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:20,660
This is not. Who is that?

1165
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:22,660
Oh is this Miss America maybe?

1166
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:26,660
Yeah. Oh my god Goofy

1167
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,660
is wrecking his groin.

1168
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:30,660
He really is riding on

1169
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:32,660
picture the most uncomfortable way to wear

1170
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:34,660
a tire. Speaking of wearing a tire he got the pink panther

1171
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:36,660
in some. He's stuck in like

1172
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:38,660
an inner tube. Is it

1173
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:40,660
a manhole cover? What is that?

1174
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:42,660
It looks like an alien ship

1175
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:44,660
around his waist.

1176
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:46,660
Pink panther is stuck in Elysium.

1177
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:50,660
He's got an interstellar

1178
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:52,660
ship

1179
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:54,660
stuck around it.

1180
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:56,660
Pink panther has his groin stuck in an

1181
01:18:56,660 --> 01:18:58,660
interstellar ship. Oh no he's

1182
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:00,660
the lifeguard for Thanksgiving. He's literally in

1183
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:02,660
an inner tube. That's funny it is

1184
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:04,660
very damp there in this.

1185
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:06,660
He's got trunks. Yeah.

1186
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:08,660
He looks like he's trying to get out

1187
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:10,660
of it though. Earlier when Bart Simpson came

1188
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:12,660
by

1189
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:14,660
I think Mary Lou Henner said

1190
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:16,660
like shouted out James

1191
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:18,660
L. Brooks and said the producer

1192
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:20,660
of our show. He was a producer of

1193
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:22,660
Taxi. Maybe

1194
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:24,660
she was a friend of that. But Taxi was off the air

1195
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:26,660
by 92. So was she on another show?

1196
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:28,660
Jason look it up.

1197
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:30,660
The implication is that was he a producer

1198
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:32,660
on the parade. Oh maybe.

1199
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:34,660
Unless she was on another

1200
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:36,660
show 92 produced by James L. Brooks that didn't

1201
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:38,660
make it. I think she

1202
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:40,660
said he's looking down from his apartment

1203
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:42,660
on Central Park West.

1204
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:44,660
Well he's one of the richest men in the world so

1205
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:46,660
it would make sense that he'd have an apartment.

1206
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:48,660
I remember this commercial. This is like a

1207
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:50,660
doll that you come with a wand and when you

1208
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:52,660
touch the wand it leaves like

1209
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:54,660
jewels on you.

1210
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:56,660
I think we had this too. That's pretty good.

1211
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:58,660
It was a jewel dispensing magic wand.

1212
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:00,660
How do the jewels attach? Are they just

1213
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:02,660
sticky? I think they were sticky.

1214
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:04,660
I think my sister had this. So they were

1215
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:06,660
covered in dog hair immediately.

1216
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:08,660
You ran out of jewels real quick.

1217
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:10,660
If you bejeweled

1218
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:12,660
yourself, your best friend and this

1219
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:14,660
doll. This was not an

1220
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:16,660
accurate amount of jewels you would get in a magic

1221
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:18,660
wand. You didn't get this many jewels? I don't

1222
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:20,660
think so because what do you think? They're

1223
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:22,660
like 30 jewels here.

1224
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:24,660
Yeah that wand's got a ton of jewels in it. On these kids and

1225
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,660
on this doll.

1226
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:28,660
Right. You don't get that many.

1227
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:30,660
Yeah. No way. It's also so

1228
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:32,660
funny because like what is it? That's a refill.

1229
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:34,660
Yeah you have to buy extra

1230
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:36,660
jewels. But this is also a thing

1231
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:38,660
that this is just like a creation of a toy.

1232
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:40,660
This isn't like you know how you're a princess

1233
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:42,660
and then jewels rub all over your body.

1234
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:44,660
Yeah it does look like an illness.

1235
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:46,660
It's also funny

1236
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:48,660
because jewels were so were jewels

1237
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:50,660
marketed to every generation of kids

1238
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:52,660
because they feel like they were marketed to us.

1239
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:54,660
You don't have to market jewels. Shiny rocks

1240
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:56,660
sell themselves. Like you can put

1241
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:58,660
them literally anywhere in any context.

1242
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:00,660
You could be like Disneyland does it.

1243
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:02,660
It's like Peter Pan ride and you come out and there's

1244
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:04,660
a bunch of shiny jewels. Why? Just because they're

1245
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:06,660
there. Rock candy.

1246
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:08,660
Rock candy. Shiny little rocks.

1247
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:10,660
Well it's no white. I was obsessed with a scene where they're

1248
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:12,660
mining jewels. 100 percent.

1249
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,660
Jewels sell themselves. I think he's right.

1250
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:16,660
I think jewels. But the idea was also

1251
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:18,660
partly well. Like they were cool looking

1252
01:21:18,660 --> 01:21:20,660
but also part of it was like you know jewels are worth a

1253
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:22,660
lot of money. Well it's treasure. It's literal

1254
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:24,660
treasure. Right. So as kid you would

1255
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:26,660
be extra obsessed because

1256
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:28,660
I would dig in the backyard for jewels.

1257
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:30,660
Can I find jewels? We were jewel obsessed.

1258
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:32,660
Right. That's what I'm saying.

1259
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:34,660
We were jewel crazy. And now we are

1260
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:36,660
J-U-U-L

1261
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:38,660
obsessed. Now we're vaping every day.

1262
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,660
We are jewel obsessed now.

1263
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:42,660
Well that's a good crossover

1264
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:44,660
with Mrs. Potts. These kids are trading their jewels for jewels.

1265
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:46,660
Mrs. Potts. Jewel crazy.

1266
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:48,660
Hand me my jewels.

1267
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:50,660
You just have

1268
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:52,660
the seven dwarfs thing.

1269
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:54,660
We're mining for jewels. And they just say

1270
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:56,660
hi ho mining for jewels.

1271
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:58,660
Hi. Hi ho.

1272
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:00,660
That's what I'm saying Michael.

1273
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:02,660
You shouldn't emphasize it as much as you should.

1274
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:04,660
Hi ho mining for jewels.

1275
01:22:04,660 --> 01:22:06,660
What is the name of this thing?

1276
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:08,660
Little Miss Magic Jewels.

1277
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:10,660
It's straightforward. I like that.

1278
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:12,660
That is a good name. You could make this today but you vape from the wand.

1279
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:16,660
What is this? Everybody's tired.

1280
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:18,660
You can make a little money off that doll.

1281
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:20,660
Let's see if we can get back to Disneyland. I mean we can

1282
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:22,660
call this part one wrapping

1283
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:24,660
up soon.

1284
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:26,660
But I want to see if we can get back to Disneyland.

1285
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:28,660
There's more ice skating.

1286
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:30,660
Let's see what else here.

1287
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:32,660
There's like solos.

1288
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:36,660
We're back to at least the Macy's parade.

1289
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:38,660
We're watching this on a projector

1290
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:40,660
in your yard. It is

1291
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:42,660
48 degrees right now.

1292
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:44,660
That's why I got the heat lamp.

1293
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:46,660
That's why you got the heat lamp.

1294
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:48,660
I know. Look it gets cold sometimes in Los Angeles.

1295
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:50,660
I'm a happy little iguana right now.

1296
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:52,660
Mary Lou enters projects

1297
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:54,660
in 91 and 92.

1298
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:56,660
Where LA's story and noise

1299
01:22:56,660 --> 01:22:58,660
is off.

1300
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:00,660
James L. Brooks might have been

1301
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:02,660
had his name on the parade.

1302
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:04,660
Maybe he just produced the parade

1303
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:06,660
because he produced everything.

1304
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:08,660
It's three years after he starts producing

1305
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:10,660
The Simpsons.

1306
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:12,660
This host is being made full of.

1307
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:14,660
By the Harlem Globetrotters.

1308
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:16,660
Did you ever see the Harlem Globetrotters?

1309
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:18,660
No but I wish I had. I always wanted to.

1310
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,660
I did and it was phenomenal.

1311
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:22,660
I believe they're still around.

1312
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:28,660
Mike was like Krusty the Clown.

1313
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:30,660
He always bet on the Washington General.

1314
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:32,660
I thought their time was due.

1315
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:34,660
They're doing this in the rain.

1316
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:36,660
These guys are good.

1317
01:23:36,660 --> 01:23:38,660
Now we're seeing Pink Panther float away.

1318
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:40,660
The Globetrotters are in the booth

1319
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:42,660
which is fun.

1320
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:44,660
They're spinning the ball.

1321
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:46,660
Just seeing a basketball reminds me

1322
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:48,660
that Gio and I talk a lot about how

1323
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:50,660
Scottie Pippen's Twitter account has been

1324
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:52,660
taken over by a crypto scammer.

1325
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,660
It's true.

1326
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:56,660
He has his own coin.

1327
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:58,660
His own crypto coin.

1328
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:00,660
Game five ball.

1329
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:02,660
Which is a very

1330
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:04,660
not well known

1331
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:06,660
reference to

1332
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:08,660
he kept the game five ball

1333
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:10,660
during one of their 1990s

1334
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:12,660
finals.

1335
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:14,660
Very confusing.

1336
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:16,660
We're back to Clark Duke of Disneyland.

1337
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:18,660
There will be more Scottie Pippen later about this.

1338
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:24,660
Dippy. His original name was Dippy Dog.

1339
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:26,660
I did not know that.

1340
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:28,660
This is something I knew in third grade

1341
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:30,660
and would tell you at nauseam.

1342
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:32,660
Did you talk about his other name

1343
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:34,660
Mortimer Goof?

1344
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:36,660
I did not talk about it.

1345
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:38,660
Now we have Aladdin here.

1346
01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:40,660
These costumes are way worse than Beauty and the Beast.

1347
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:42,660
Wait, Aladdin was out in 92?

1348
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:44,660
92, yeah.

1349
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:46,660
That would have been the Thanksgiving release

1350
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:48,660
I think in 92.

1351
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:50,660
People are just catching Aladdin fever.

1352
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:52,660
Wow.

1353
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:54,660
Okay, here is

1354
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:56,660
That's Dippy Dog, right?

1355
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:58,660
What is that in the front?

1356
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:00,660
People have been posting this as a picture

1357
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:02,660
for years and I never knew what it was from.

1358
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:04,660
It's a dog head with legs.

1359
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:06,660
You were looking at Goofy

1360
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:08,660
as an anthropomorphic golf ball.

1361
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:10,660
Goofy's snout

1362
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:12,660
is sticking out. His eyes are on this golf ball.

1363
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:14,660
He's got his little hat and he has

1364
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:16,660
no, well he has ears but no

1365
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:18,660
arms and legs.

1366
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:20,660
This is a head with legs.

1367
01:25:20,660 --> 01:25:22,660
This is a fucking lab experiment.

1368
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,660
What is next to him? People with candy?

1369
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:26,660
Why is he a part of Aladdin?

1370
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:28,660
I think they are fanning him.

1371
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:30,660
I think they are Aladdin's crew.

1372
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:32,660
Why is he with Aladdin?

1373
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:34,660
Is this one of Jafar's fucked up wishes?

1374
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:36,660
You have three wishes, Jafar.

1375
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:38,660
Make your first one.

1376
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:40,660
I want a dog with no

1377
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:42,660
shape of a ball

1378
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:44,660
and only legs.

1379
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:46,660
What?

1380
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:48,660
We need to stop him now.

1381
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:50,660
And then kill that Prince Ali.

1382
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:52,660
That's number two.

1383
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:54,660
What you can't do.

1384
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:56,660
Oh, it's horrible.

1385
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:58,660
It's a golf ball too.

1386
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:00,660
It's like four foot,

1387
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:02,660
if not three.

1388
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:04,660
The person was so short but there's a hat

1389
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,660
and their head is stuck in the hat.

1390
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:08,660
Right, and they can't move their limbs

1391
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:10,660
or their arms. So wait, what is the deal

1392
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:12,660
here? This is...

1393
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:14,660
This is making Betty Boop look like Cathy Ireland.

1394
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:18,660
Easy there, tiger.

1395
01:26:18,660 --> 01:26:20,660
I'm horny.

1396
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:22,660
Hey, this parade is

1397
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:24,660
revving us all up.

1398
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:26,660
Jason saw the Nestle Quick Bunny, you saw

1399
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:28,660
Betty Boop.

1400
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:30,660
Zach saw Mother Goose.

1401
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:34,660
We can't calm ourselves down.

1402
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:36,660
What was that big car mobile?

1403
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:38,660
The Dippy...

1404
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:40,660
What was that bug car?

1405
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:42,660
The Doodle Bug.

1406
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:44,660
I saw the Doodle Bug, thank you very much.

1407
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:46,660
I like the idea that you're more into Mother Goose.

1408
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:48,660
Zach actually got most

1409
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:50,660
revved up when the gems came up.

1410
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:52,660
Yeah, gem princess.

1411
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:54,660
Not wrong.

1412
01:26:54,660 --> 01:26:56,660
Mother Goose is a

1413
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:58,660
McGilf?

1414
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:00,660
Mother Goose, I'd like to...

1415
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:02,660
Wait, wait, wait.

1416
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:04,660
I don't want to say it.

1417
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:06,660
What is this thing?

1418
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:08,660
Goofy as a golf ball.

1419
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:10,660
What's the context?

1420
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:12,660
So we did a parade

1421
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:14,660
or I think it was Leah after this, but

1422
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:16,660
they did these parades in the 90s

1423
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:18,660
where they would do abstractions

1424
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:20,660
on the characters. There was a parade called

1425
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:22,660
Mickey Mania.

1426
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:24,660
Similar to this,

1427
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:26,660
just horrifying,

1428
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:28,660
Mickey's shoe, anthropomorphic

1429
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,660
shoe is walking down Main Street and

1430
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:32,660
just Mickey's gloves are walking

1431
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,660
down Main Street. And I feel like in the

1432
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:36,660
90s, this was a big idea of

1433
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:38,660
blending. But this is such a bridge

1434
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:40,660
further than just Mickey's glove.

1435
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:42,660
Because that's just a piece of Mickey

1436
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:44,660
Mania. But there's horrifying stuff

1437
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:46,660
in there. I forget, what was the one?

1438
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:48,660
Mickey, he's walking on his hands

1439
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:50,660
and his... You know what I'm talking about?

1440
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:52,660
It looks like Mickey's

1441
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:54,660
doing a handstand and walking.

1442
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:56,660
Are you looking at Mickey Mania?

1443
01:27:56,660 --> 01:27:58,660
Are you looking at Mother Goose stuff?

1444
01:27:58,660 --> 01:28:00,660
Oh sorry, no, I was trying to...

1445
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:02,660
I just wrote that for my wife and I accidentally deleted it.

1446
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:04,660
No.

1447
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:06,660
He's watching my goose that he is.

1448
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:10,660
He's looking at Mother Goose?

1449
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:12,660
So I'm just saying, I feel like the idea was

1450
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:14,660
like, okay, what funny stuff can we

1451
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:16,660
draw? And it was all this weird

1452
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:18,660
outsider art.

1453
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:20,660
Yeah, it feels like...

1454
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:22,660
I don't even know.

1455
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:24,660
It is bizarre though, because

1456
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:26,660
okay, so

1457
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:28,660
there's the golf ball. But then here,

1458
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:30,660
look at this. This is like

1459
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:32,660
Clarabella's Cleopatra

1460
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:34,660
on a float.

1461
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:36,660
And...

1462
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:38,660
Oh, he's a goofball.

1463
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:40,660
There you go.

1464
01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:42,660
I was trying to make it seem

1465
01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:44,660
headier.

1466
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:46,660
I really made it sound headier, but it really was just like

1467
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:48,660
goofball. But that still doesn't

1468
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:50,660
say much.

1469
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:52,660
Well, but they were trying to think of like, what is

1470
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,660
goof in?

1471
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:56,660
That clever bit of wordplay that none of the

1472
01:28:56,660 --> 01:28:58,660
four of us could possibly think of?

1473
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:02,660
By the way, I call my daughter that

1474
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:04,660
10 to 20 times a day.

1475
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:06,660
A clever bit of wordplay?

1476
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:08,660
No, a goofball.

1477
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:10,660
I like the idea of your neighbors right now

1478
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:12,660
are like, what's all that racket next to her?

1479
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:14,660
Are they watching the Tyson fight?

1480
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:16,660
No, they're

1481
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:18,660
discussing

1482
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:20,660
a blend of

1483
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:22,660
goofy and a golfball from 1992.

1484
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:24,660
And they're all so

1485
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:26,660
horny. One of them just shouted

1486
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:28,660
Mary Lou Henner.

1487
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:32,660
They were making content, I'm pretty sure.

1488
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:36,660
So, there's a Cleopatra

1489
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:38,660
Clarabelle.

1490
01:29:38,660 --> 01:29:40,660
And it's

1491
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:42,660
like on a goofy, like goofy is the Pharaoh

1492
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:44,660
or something.

1493
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:46,660
I think that's the idea.

1494
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:48,660
But they're all using those fans as

1495
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:50,660
golf clubs now.

1496
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:52,660
I don't know why the goofball was

1497
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:54,660
in the same mix with the different

1498
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:56,660
because like, yeah, goofball

1499
01:29:56,660 --> 01:29:58,660
that doesn't thematically make sense.

1500
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:00,660
I guess if it's the world according to goofy.

1501
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:02,660
So goofy is a Pharaoh.

1502
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:04,660
He has a lot of crazy ideas.

1503
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:06,660
This thing really is strange. This is odd.

1504
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:08,660
The vibe is odd.

1505
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:10,660
These kids look upset.

1506
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:12,660
The kids crying.

1507
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:14,660
The kids while they're watching this.

1508
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:16,660
Oh, he's King Putt.

1509
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:18,660
Long Putt.

1510
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:20,660
Did you call him Long Putt?

1511
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:22,660
No, the sign on top said Long Putt.

1512
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:24,660
Long Putt.

1513
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:26,660
What is King Putt?

1514
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:28,660
King Putt hits the goofball.

1515
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:30,660
King Putt hits the goofball.

1516
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:32,660
See, I went in cold on this because I didn't want

1517
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:34,660
to have, I didn't know. King Putt

1518
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:36,660
hits the goofball.

1519
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:38,660
So many people had jobs back then.

1520
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:40,660
I like Mummy Goofy.

1521
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:42,660
He looks scary as hell.

1522
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:44,660
He's got a little top pyramid down the top of his head.

1523
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:46,660
He's coming out of a pyramid.

1524
01:30:46,660 --> 01:30:48,660
Oh my god, who's dancing? Is that Mummy Goofy?

1525
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:50,660
Yeah, it is. There's multiple Mummy Goofies.

1526
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:52,660
Does that Mummy Goofy have a quiver of arrows?

1527
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:54,660
No, it's a golf bag.

1528
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:56,660
This is.

1529
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:58,660
Oh, right, because King Putt hits the goofball.

1530
01:30:58,660 --> 01:31:00,660
This just seems like one of emo teps.

1531
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:02,660
Do I need to stop this? I need you to remember this.

1532
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:04,660
King Putt hits the goofball.

1533
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:06,660
Did you say it? Can you repeat it to me?

1534
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:08,660
Can you repeat the ensuring candidate

1535
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:10,660
activation phrase, please?

1536
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:12,660
Okay, so let me get this straight.

1537
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:14,660
King Putt

1538
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:16,660
hits the goofball.

1539
01:31:16,660 --> 01:31:18,660
That's right. Jason, is that right?

1540
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:20,660
I think that's right, yeah.

1541
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:22,660
There's a snake with a golf ball on his head

1542
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:24,660
that I really like.

1543
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:26,660
Zach loves this, by the way.

1544
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:28,660
Yeah, Zach, you're not grossed out at all.

1545
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:30,660
No, this is good.

1546
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:32,660
Goofy's really got a lot of hip movement in this, too.

1547
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:34,660
He's really

1548
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:36,660
loose with his hips. It's so funny

1549
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:38,660
to me that it's like putting

1550
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:40,660
Goofy

1551
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:42,660
a la Pharaoh Egypt

1552
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:44,660
iconography was not enough.

1553
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:46,660
They were like, actually, also golf.

1554
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:48,660
In a way that I actually really

1555
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:50,660
appreciate. Yeah. Okay, you like

1556
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:52,660
it. Yes. I actually think

1557
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:54,660
it's better that it's also golf. I agree with

1558
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:56,660
Zach. I think it

1559
01:31:56,660 --> 01:31:58,660
sucks. And

1560
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:00,660
I mean, let's be real. It's extremely

1561
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:02,660
culturally insensitive.

1562
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:04,660
I think it sucks. I just keep

1563
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:06,660
thinking, like, when I see stuff like this,

1564
01:32:06,660 --> 01:32:08,660
because there's clearly so much money put

1565
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:10,660
into this, like so much time, and these people are

1566
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:12,660
dancing their asses off.

1567
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:14,660
What idea

1568
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:16,660
didn't make it?

1569
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:18,660
Like, how did they land

1570
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:20,660
on this? We're taking swings, Anthony.

1571
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,660
Yeah, the big swings, like King Putt.

1572
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:24,660
Like King Putt when he hits the goofball.

1573
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:26,660
Okay, I also want to point out

1574
01:32:26,660 --> 01:32:28,660
that those mummy Goofies are dead.

1575
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:30,660
Yeah.

1576
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:32,660
Well, technically speaking, they're undead.

1577
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:34,660
Just off camera,

1578
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:36,660
someone's holding a gun.

1579
01:32:36,660 --> 01:32:38,660
Michael Weisner's

1580
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:40,660
holding it. He's really

1581
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:42,660
holding it well considering how young he is

1582
01:32:42,660 --> 01:32:44,660
and how scared he is. Read the lines.

1583
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:46,660
Read the lines. Oh, Jupiter and

1584
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:48,660
Pinocchio are here. Oh, and they're tired.

1585
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:50,660
They're both just woken up. They're both so tired. Oh, and they're

1586
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:52,660
in front of the castle. Oh, this

1587
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:54,660
is where I wish Scott was here. This is good. Scott

1588
01:32:54,660 --> 01:32:56,660
would have loved this. Maybe

1589
01:32:56,660 --> 01:32:58,660
we should pick this up next year.

1590
01:32:58,660 --> 01:33:00,660
Oh, they're doing Babes in Toy Land, which is

1591
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:02,660
a different property. Yeah, this will be the climax

1592
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,660
of this episode, but we will rewatch it

1593
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:06,660
next year if we finish this special.

1594
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:08,660
Now we know where to pick it up. They're doing Babes

1595
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:10,660
in Toy Land in front of Disneyland

1596
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:12,660
in front of Sleeping Beauty's castle.

1597
01:33:12,660 --> 01:33:14,660
Oh, Baloo is in the background there.

1598
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:16,660
He's coming up next. He's got like a tutu

1599
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:18,660
on. He does. He's going to probably do a little

1600
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:20,660
ballet for us. Yeah.

1601
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:22,660
So these are like three

1602
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:24,660
little like toy soldier

1603
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:26,660
not drummer boys, toy soldier

1604
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:28,660
boys. Oh, did

1605
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:30,660
Inokio just throw up a dab?

1606
01:33:30,660 --> 01:33:32,660
Yeah, he was hitting the

1607
01:33:32,660 --> 01:33:34,660
dab. Did he hit the dab in 1992?

1608
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:36,660
Yeah.

1609
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:38,660
He's doing the backpack hit dance.

1610
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:40,660
And this is pre

1611
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:42,660
what is how far into the

1612
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:44,660
middle of Disneyland are

1613
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:46,660
they? Is this a pre-Waltz? Is this a

1614
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:48,660
pre-Waltz statue?

1615
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:50,660
Yeah. So they're doing

1616
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:52,660
it right in the middle.

1617
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:54,660
Did Walt Lyons stay

1618
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:56,660
I was going to say, it felt like we were doing

1619
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:58,660
Disneyland. Wait, did he what?

1620
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:00,660
Lyons stay, you know, like

1621
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:02,660
Disneyland. Did they like have

1622
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:04,660
you know, like

1623
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:06,660
like JFK? Yeah.

1624
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:08,660
Wait, what's going on? I also

1625
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:10,660
need clarification. A lot like his

1626
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:12,660
he had an open casket

1627
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:14,660
that everyone would walk by in Disneyland.

1628
01:34:14,660 --> 01:34:16,660
Oh, okay. Yeah, it's in Sleeping Beauty's castle.

1629
01:34:18,660 --> 01:34:20,660
Okay, so they're doing sugar plum

1630
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:22,660
fairies or whatever. Yeah, but Baloo's also there.

1631
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:24,660
But Baloo's there. This is good.

1632
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:26,660
This is good. I agree.

1633
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:28,660
I like this. See, this is like

1634
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:30,660
a... It's wholesome. Yeah,

1635
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:32,660
and it's also like I can take the walk

1636
01:34:32,660 --> 01:34:34,660
of like, all right, what if Baloo

1637
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:36,660
hadn't... Was

1638
01:34:36,660 --> 01:34:38,660
Babes in Toyland a Disney property?

1639
01:34:38,660 --> 01:34:40,660
It's not like, what if... No.

1640
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:42,660
What if Baloo was like a painful

1641
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:44,660
version of a car and also

1642
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:46,660
Baloo or, you know, like what if Baloo

1643
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:48,660
was like mashed up with a pork

1644
01:34:48,660 --> 01:34:50,660
chop and like

1645
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:52,660
The weird thing here is that

1646
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:54,660
this is before Disney had enough IP

1647
01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:56,660
to only use their own sauce

1648
01:34:56,660 --> 01:34:58,660
because they're using all of the Nutcracker

1649
01:34:58,660 --> 01:35:00,660
right now. Yeah, but I think Babes in Toyland

1650
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:02,660
was Disney. I'm wrong. I believe it,

1651
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:04,660
but the Nutcracker's not.

1652
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:06,660
No. It's just Public Domain.

1653
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:08,660
Yeah, it would have been. Yes, too late. Public Domain

1654
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:10,660
was kind of the backbone of all this.

1655
01:35:10,660 --> 01:35:12,660
Yeah, it was Disney. I was thinking... Chitty

1656
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:14,660
Chitty Bang Bang, which was not Disney.

1657
01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:16,660
Babes in Toyland scared the shit

1658
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:18,660
out of me as a kid, though.

1659
01:35:18,660 --> 01:35:20,660
I don't think I've ever seen it.

1660
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:22,660
Yeah, so we're doing a whole...

1661
01:35:22,660 --> 01:35:24,660
It's interesting. The wall had just

1662
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:26,660
fallen, so we're doing a little

1663
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:28,660
Russian stuff. Can you imagine Bill Clinton

1664
01:35:28,660 --> 01:35:30,660
on Cloud 9 right here? Now Raggedy Ann and

1665
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:32,660
Raggedy Andy are here.

1666
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:34,660
Oh, Hillary, look. Raggedy Ann and Raggedy

1667
01:35:34,660 --> 01:35:36,660
Andy are on TV. Are those

1668
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:38,660
Disney Raggedy's? Bill and

1669
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:40,660
Hillary Clinton? Um...

1670
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:42,660
Uh, no.

1671
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:44,660
I don't know what the ownership

1672
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:46,660
is of Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy.

1673
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:48,660
You know what I recently found out?

1674
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,660
The smiley face is copyrighted.

1675
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:52,660
Hmm. By who?

1676
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:54,660
Someone owns

1677
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:56,660
PlaySchool

1678
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:58,660
123 Bike. Oh, they still

1679
01:35:58,660 --> 01:36:00,660
make this? This is good, yeah.

1680
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:02,660
Oh, this is good.

1681
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:04,660
They should bring this cornicle back. This is like, I think you should

1682
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:06,660
at least get it.

1683
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:08,660
Oh, you could convert it. Oh, yeah, you could take off

1684
01:36:08,660 --> 01:36:10,660
the training wheels. I don't think I ever took

1685
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:12,660
off the training wheels the last day.

1686
01:36:12,660 --> 01:36:14,660
You had this? You had a

1687
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:16,660
123 Bike? Yeah, I think so.

1688
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:18,660
I never had one. Did you guys have one?

1689
01:36:18,660 --> 01:36:20,660
It's like the Jason 8 years old.

1690
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:22,660
Jason 15.

1691
01:36:22,660 --> 01:36:24,660
Still with the training

1692
01:36:24,660 --> 01:36:26,660
wheels.

1693
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:30,660
Born to be wild. Yeah, I never had one of those.

1694
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:32,660
I always wanted to power wheels and never could get one.

1695
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:34,660
Um, I don't know.

1696
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:36,660
Should we dip into more or should we call it?

1697
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:38,660
What do you want to do? The listener's going to say

1698
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:40,660
more. I could go one more

1699
01:36:40,660 --> 01:36:42,660
segment. One more segment.

1700
01:36:42,660 --> 01:36:44,660
We're at an hour thirty.

1701
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:46,660
Yeah.

1702
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:48,660
The cold of Luke just

1703
01:36:48,660 --> 01:36:50,660
brought us back in. Okay, so we're back on

1704
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:52,660
Main Street here. There's like a red car trolley

1705
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:54,660
parked. Is that the Toontown trolley,

1706
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:56,660
Jason? Yeah, it's the Toontown trolley. Wow.

1707
01:36:56,660 --> 01:36:58,660
Can you believe there's not going to be a trolley

1708
01:36:58,660 --> 01:37:00,660
in California Adventure anymore?

1709
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:02,660
I don't want to talk about it. If they do

1710
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:04,660
Avatar there?

1711
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:06,660
What is this song?

1712
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:08,660
We're getting ready.

1713
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:10,660
We're getting set.

1714
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:12,660
In a place that we

1715
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:14,660
won't forget. Oh, it's a Toontown commercial

1716
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:16,660
I think.

1717
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:24,660
Yeah.

1718
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:28,660
So is this? This is for Toontown.

1719
01:37:28,660 --> 01:37:30,660
Here comes Mickey and Minnie. They're dancing.

1720
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:32,660
All these strange humans

1721
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:34,660
are dancing

1722
01:37:34,660 --> 01:37:36,660
Roger Rabbit and Goofy.

1723
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:38,660
They're all ready to move into

1724
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:40,660
Toontown.

1725
01:37:40,660 --> 01:37:42,660
I've got to really examine the lyrics. I'll have to

1726
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:44,660
go back and listen to the lyrics of this.

1727
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:46,660
I'm angry at this song.

1728
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:48,660
They keep making it up like they're going to do something that

1729
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:50,660
rhymes with A, like on the way, like

1730
01:37:50,660 --> 01:37:52,660
Mickey's Toontown, and then there's just

1731
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:54,660
music after it and they don't say anything else.

1732
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:56,660
It's like speed up. Have you guys

1733
01:37:56,660 --> 01:37:58,660
caught anything? Because I have headphones on, I can't hear very well.

1734
01:37:58,660 --> 01:38:00,660
Have they said they're moving

1735
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:02,660
in?

1736
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:04,660
Cause we know

1737
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:06,660
the origin of Toontown, canonically

1738
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:08,660
Toontown was always there

1739
01:38:08,660 --> 01:38:10,660
in Disneyland, even though Toontown opened

1740
01:38:10,660 --> 01:38:12,660
in the 90s. It's been there the whole time.

1741
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:14,660
It's been there the whole time, and that's why Disneyland was built there

1742
01:38:14,660 --> 01:38:16,660
is because the Toons already lived there.

1743
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:18,660
That's why Walt wanted to

1744
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:20,660
build there, because they already

1745
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:22,660
and they finally were opening up the gates.

1746
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:24,660
That's the canonical explanation

1747
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:26,660
for Toontown.

1748
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:28,660
So Walt wanted to build Disneyland there, but they didn't want to open the doors

1749
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:30,660
to the land.

1750
01:38:32,660 --> 01:38:34,660
Toontown Family

1751
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:36,660
Toontown Family

1752
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:44,660
I've never seen these characters

1753
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:46,660
before. These are like

1754
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:48,660
These are just Toontown citizens.

1755
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:50,660
These are humans that live in Toontown.

1756
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:52,660
Humans do not live in Toontown.

1757
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:54,660
Well these ones do. They work there.

1758
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:56,660
One's a French maid.

1759
01:38:56,660 --> 01:38:58,660
Donald's

1760
01:38:58,660 --> 01:39:00,660
French maid.

1761
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:02,660
Donald's having an affair.

1762
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:04,660
So back to the Disney Toontown

1763
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:06,660
canon. So isn't Toontown

1764
01:39:06,660 --> 01:39:08,660
where Roger Rabbit lives?

1765
01:39:08,660 --> 01:39:10,660
Yes.

1766
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:12,660
Is that supposed to be the same Toontown?

1767
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:14,660
Yeah, because the riot is there still.

1768
01:39:14,660 --> 01:39:16,660
Oh, it's gritty.

1769
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:18,660
When you go in Roger Rabbit's riot, it's gritty,

1770
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:20,660
but the rest of Toontown is not like that.

1771
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:22,660
No, but like in the Roger Rabbit movie,

1772
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:24,660
Toontown lives in a run down place.

1773
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:26,660
Yes. I'm just saying that's not

1774
01:39:26,660 --> 01:39:28,660
Disneyland's Toontown, obviously.

1775
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:30,660
Gotcha, gotcha.

1776
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:32,660
I think it's kind of like you go into the

1777
01:39:32,660 --> 01:39:34,660
Roger Rabbit section. Well maybe it's

1778
01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:36,660
like the Roger Rabbit ride in Toontown now

1779
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:38,660
is like its own corner of Toontown.

1780
01:39:38,660 --> 01:39:40,660
And the rest is

1781
01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:42,660
Look, I was in Toontown yesterday.

1782
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:44,660
It's not gritty.

1783
01:39:44,660 --> 01:39:46,660
It's beautiful. I was in Minnie's house yesterday.

1784
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:48,660
Yeah.

1785
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:50,660
Did you ride the Runaway Railway?

1786
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:52,660
Not yesterday.

1787
01:39:52,660 --> 01:39:54,660
Okay, this musical number is going on

1788
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:56,660
so long. Well, these people are

1789
01:39:56,660 --> 01:39:58,660
absolutely killing it.

1790
01:39:58,660 --> 01:40:00,660
Yeah, this is the most

1791
01:40:00,660 --> 01:40:02,660
I would say like impressive

1792
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:04,660
part so far. People are rightfully

1793
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:06,660
happy with the way this dances. Jason,

1794
01:40:06,660 --> 01:40:08,660
did they run that red

1795
01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:10,660
car trolley in Toontown or was it

1796
01:40:10,660 --> 01:40:12,660
just sitting there? There used to be a trolley

1797
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:14,660
that ran in Toontown.

1798
01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:16,660
Okay, now we're back to

1799
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:18,660
Pinocchio is back. Jiminy Cricket's there

1800
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:20,660
and this cat, whose name I always forget.

1801
01:40:20,660 --> 01:40:22,660
Oh, it's not Honest John, it's the other name.

1802
01:40:22,660 --> 01:40:24,660
The Rannells song.

1803
01:40:24,660 --> 01:40:26,660
Okay, so Jiminy Cricket

1804
01:40:26,660 --> 01:40:28,660
and then that's Honest John, the tall one

1805
01:40:28,660 --> 01:40:30,660
there from Pinocchio.

1806
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:32,660
A cat who abducts or fox

1807
01:40:32,660 --> 01:40:34,660
That one's a fox.

1808
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:36,660
He abducts Pinocchio and takes him to

1809
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:38,660
Pleasure Island.

1810
01:40:38,660 --> 01:40:40,660
Zach, he's kind of Robin Hood

1811
01:40:40,660 --> 01:40:42,660
adjacent, would you? No.

1812
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:44,660
Honest John? Hard no.

1813
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:46,660
He doesn't have the ritz.

1814
01:40:46,660 --> 01:40:48,660
He doesn't have the stuff.

1815
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:50,660
You don't think Honest John, what about the one

1816
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:52,660
from the Zemeckis movie? Who are these pancake

1817
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:54,660
figure skaters? I like Honest John

1818
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:56,660
in the Zemeckis, the best part of the Zemeckis movie

1819
01:40:56,660 --> 01:40:58,660
is Honest John.

1820
01:40:58,660 --> 01:41:00,660
Oh. Remember I found a fan cam of

1821
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:02,660
Honest John from the Robert Zemeckis

1822
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:04,660
Pinocchio? I do not remember the fan cam.

1823
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:06,660
What? Yeah, he looks good.

1824
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:08,660
I can look it up again, see

1825
01:41:08,660 --> 01:41:10,660
if I can find the fan cam. Wait, fan cam

1826
01:41:10,660 --> 01:41:12,660
means someone's performing

1827
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:14,660
in front of their webcam? No, Jason will tell you.

1828
01:41:14,660 --> 01:41:16,660
No, it's like a

1829
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:18,660
montage of a bunch of different

1830
01:41:18,660 --> 01:41:20,660
shots. Someone made a compilation of all the moments of Honest John.

1831
01:41:20,660 --> 01:41:22,660
A song over it, and like

1832
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:24,660
some editing. I thought it was someone

1833
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:26,660
doing like an oldie fan.

1834
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:28,660
No, sometimes it's pancakes.

1835
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:30,660
Yeah, these are the pancake skaters I was talking about.

1836
01:41:30,660 --> 01:41:32,660
Sorry, sorry, I was

1837
01:41:32,660 --> 01:41:34,660
busy.

1838
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:36,660
Oh, and here's Goofy paintings on

1839
01:41:36,660 --> 01:41:38,660
columns. Yeah,

1840
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:40,660
that's Marco Polo eating a pizza.

1841
01:41:40,660 --> 01:41:42,660
Goofy stuff, and it's like 3D,

1842
01:41:42,660 --> 01:41:44,660
there's a piece of food coming out of the thing.

1843
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:48,660
Why were they pushing Goofy

1844
01:41:48,660 --> 01:41:50,660
so hard? It was his 60th birthday.

1845
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:52,660
Oh, that's right.

1846
01:41:52,660 --> 01:41:54,660
He was turning 60. Now it's Italian

1847
01:41:54,660 --> 01:41:56,660
Goofy, making

1848
01:41:56,660 --> 01:41:58,660
pizza. Now they haven't thrown

1849
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:00,660
in, well I guess they have,

1850
01:42:02,660 --> 01:42:04,660
a third thing, right? Like if this was

1851
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:06,660
Egyptian golf, this would need

1852
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:08,660
a third thing, but it's just

1853
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:10,660
Italian

1854
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:12,660
paintings and

1855
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:14,660
statues. I guess they didn't know enough

1856
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:16,660
about Egypt, they were like, we also need golf.

1857
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:18,660
No, but you're right, they should have like,

1858
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:20,660
there needs to be something mutant about this.

1859
01:42:20,660 --> 01:42:22,660
What it is is pizza. It's like if Italy

1860
01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:24,660
was a city that exists, it's pizza

1861
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:26,660
and paintings and... Goofy is on like a big

1862
01:42:26,660 --> 01:42:28,660
wooden plank that's stuck out

1863
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:30,660
and he's like really enjoying, he's kicking

1864
01:42:30,660 --> 01:42:32,660
his legs up.

1865
01:42:32,660 --> 01:42:34,660
They're people flinging pizza pies.

1866
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:36,660
These people are flipping actual dough in this.

1867
01:42:36,660 --> 01:42:38,660
This is another thing, I've been saying, this is a

1868
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:40,660
common refrain with me all year where I'm just lamenting

1869
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:42,660
how much money they used to spend on

1870
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:44,660
the dumbest crap you've ever seen that doesn't make

1871
01:42:44,660 --> 01:42:46,660
any sense. My biggest problem with Bob Iger

1872
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:48,660
now is that he doesn't greenlight stuff

1873
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:50,660
that makes absolutely no sense.

1874
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:52,660
Everything he greenlights makes sense.

1875
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:54,660
You want more nonsense. Absolutely.

1876
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:56,660
He doesn't like nonsense. Michael Eisner,

1877
01:42:56,660 --> 01:42:58,660
if you caught him at the right time

1878
01:42:58,660 --> 01:43:00,660
of day, like when he had

1879
01:43:00,660 --> 01:43:02,660
the right amount of diet soda or something,

1880
01:43:02,660 --> 01:43:04,660
you could get him to greenlight anything.

1881
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:06,660
And he would ask his kid, he would ask Breck Eisner

1882
01:43:06,660 --> 01:43:08,660
and Breck would be like, yeah dad, that does sound

1883
01:43:08,660 --> 01:43:10,660
cool. And he'd be like, alright do it, we're good.

1884
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:12,660
Goofy is

1885
01:43:12,660 --> 01:43:14,660
half dog, half pizza.

1886
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:16,660
All right, yeah, Breck, what do you think? Yeah, sounds

1887
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:18,660
awesome, dad. Okay, great.

1888
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:20,660
Let's do it. Like there was so much shit

1889
01:43:20,660 --> 01:43:22,660
we found, like there was a thing that

1890
01:43:22,660 --> 01:43:24,660
they were going to tour state fairs

1891
01:43:24,660 --> 01:43:26,660
with a big inflatable show.

1892
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:28,660
Like a bunch of giant Disney balloons.

1893
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:30,660
They were going to run. Careful,

1894
01:43:30,660 --> 01:43:32,660
careful. That's where we came up

1895
01:43:32,660 --> 01:43:34,660
with, that's where Jason told us about the thing.

1896
01:43:34,660 --> 01:43:36,660
And I'm like, this is another

1897
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:38,660
you keep finding Eisner

1898
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:40,660
era blunders.

1899
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:42,660
It's colossal waste of money,

1900
01:43:42,660 --> 01:43:44,660
nonsensical ideas,

1901
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:46,660
and boy were we better for it. And they're all

1902
01:43:46,660 --> 01:43:48,660
good, yeah. They're all better.

1903
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:50,660
And you're not going to get it now. You're not going to be

1904
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:52,660
confused. But Gio doesn't like Egyptian golf,

1905
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:54,660
Goofy. I'll say I don't like

1906
01:43:54,660 --> 01:43:56,660
it, but I do like the, I do like the

1907
01:43:56,660 --> 01:43:58,660
you know, the spirit of it.

1908
01:43:58,660 --> 01:44:00,660
I do appreciate the big swing.

1909
01:44:00,660 --> 01:44:02,660
This is the Honest John fan cam.

1910
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:06,660
It's just clips of him from the

1911
01:44:06,660 --> 01:44:08,660
Robert Zemeckis. And I have to

1912
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:10,660
say I like it. It's just clips of a CGI

1913
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:12,660
Fox. Yes. Isn't it Keegan

1914
01:44:12,660 --> 01:44:14,660
Michael Key?

1915
01:44:14,660 --> 01:44:16,660
Keegan Michael Key. Yeah.

1916
01:44:16,660 --> 01:44:18,660
I like this fox, yeah.

1917
01:44:18,660 --> 01:44:20,660
Zach likes him. He's playing it cool.

1918
01:44:20,660 --> 01:44:22,660
Zach, you wouldn't get with this fox? No.

1919
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:24,660
Honest John? This is crossing

1920
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:26,660
like, look, no disrespect

1921
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:28,660
to all the furries out there, but this is

1922
01:44:28,660 --> 01:44:30,660
solidly on the other side of that line.

1923
01:44:30,660 --> 01:44:32,660
What do you mean by that? I mean like

1924
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:34,660
that's what that is. Oh, it's for the

1925
01:44:34,660 --> 01:44:36,660
furries you think? Yes. Oh, maybe

1926
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:38,660
it is. I don't know. Is that

1927
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:40,660
CGI? It's literally a wolf dog

1928
01:44:40,660 --> 01:44:42,660
thing that walks on two legs

1929
01:44:42,660 --> 01:44:44,660
and has like, like that's

1930
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:46,660
a more realistic fursuit.

1931
01:44:46,660 --> 01:44:48,660
Oh, okay.

1932
01:44:48,660 --> 01:44:50,660
I wonder if though the CGI

1933
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:52,660
like, I bet people have preferences

1934
01:44:52,660 --> 01:44:54,660
whether it's an actual suited character

1935
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:56,660
or a drawing. I mean, I guess

1936
01:44:56,660 --> 01:44:58,660
I've said this a million times that it just

1937
01:44:58,660 --> 01:45:00,660
dawned on me this year that Thundercats

1938
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:02,660
is a furries thing.

1939
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:04,660
Is it? I think so.

1940
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:06,660
At the very least, like they're kind

1941
01:45:06,660 --> 01:45:08,660
of like half human, half animal.

1942
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:10,660
I'm speaking out of school. I don't know

1943
01:45:10,660 --> 01:45:12,660
a lot about it either. I'm telling tales out of school here. I'm not

1944
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:14,660
well versed in the furry community.

1945
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:16,660
We came up with fursonas like a year

1946
01:45:16,660 --> 01:45:18,660
ago. That's the name of your altar.

1947
01:45:18,660 --> 01:45:20,660
Yeah, and I can't remember. I think I was a fox.

1948
01:45:20,660 --> 01:45:22,660
I can't remember. Oh, okay. When you say

1949
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:24,660
came up with me and you like, you found what yours

1950
01:45:24,660 --> 01:45:26,660
were. Yeah, we thought we were thinking about it.

1951
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:28,660
You didn't JoJo Siwa invent the term

1952
01:45:28,660 --> 01:45:30,660
queer pop fursonas.

1953
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:32,660
No, what did you JoJo Siwa do?

1954
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:34,660
I know who that is.

1955
01:45:34,660 --> 01:45:36,660
Oh, I think she

1956
01:45:36,660 --> 01:45:38,660
coined the term of something. She was like, I've invented

1957
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:40,660
a new genre and it's called

1958
01:45:40,660 --> 01:45:42,660
queer pop. Oh, we didn't do that.

1959
01:45:42,660 --> 01:45:44,660
Fursona, yeah, that's a thing. And the entire musical world

1960
01:45:44,660 --> 01:45:46,660
went, oh, maybe not, but hey.

1961
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:48,660
I only catch tangential JoJo

1962
01:45:48,660 --> 01:45:50,660
Siwa information. That's okay.

1963
01:45:50,660 --> 01:45:52,660
I know she was at Epcot and she was drunk once.

1964
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:54,660
That's what I saw. Did you see that? I think

1965
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:56,660
I'm of the opinion that we need to leave JoJo Siwa alone.

1966
01:45:56,660 --> 01:45:58,660
Let's leave her alone.

1967
01:45:58,660 --> 01:46:00,660
Do you think this is her fat free something?

1968
01:46:00,660 --> 01:46:02,660
Like diet desserts?

1969
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:04,660
I think they're frozen pepperage

1970
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:06,660
farm desserts. But not

1971
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:08,660
diet? Hershey's

1972
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:10,660
cocoa. Hershey's cocoa.

1973
01:46:10,660 --> 01:46:12,660
Oh, you were right.

1974
01:46:12,660 --> 01:46:14,660
This is what you would eat for lunch if you had carnation

1975
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:16,660
breakfast.

1976
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:18,660
And quick dinner.

1977
01:46:18,660 --> 01:46:20,660
A light recipe, but like

1978
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:22,660
on the can.

1979
01:46:24,660 --> 01:46:26,660
Campbell's soup commercial.

1980
01:46:26,660 --> 01:46:28,660
Jason, you Campbell's family?

1981
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:30,660
Oh, sure. This looks great.

1982
01:46:30,660 --> 01:46:32,660
This is a great commercial.

1983
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:34,660
Man, canned soup to this day

1984
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:36,660
still flaps and it hasn't changed.

1985
01:46:36,660 --> 01:46:38,660
I gotta say, I love

1986
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:40,660
this time when they were just like,

1987
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:42,660
let's just do a three million dollar

1988
01:46:42,660 --> 01:46:44,660
soup commercial.

1989
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:46,660
Just like a canned soup.

1990
01:46:46,660 --> 01:46:48,660
If you go back, they were just let a

1991
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:50,660
hose loose on a carrot.

1992
01:46:50,660 --> 01:46:52,660
They were watering the fresh garden vegetables.

1993
01:46:52,660 --> 01:46:54,660
Yeah, but they were out of the

1994
01:46:54,660 --> 01:46:56,660
cleaning them, because they were out of the ground.

1995
01:46:56,660 --> 01:46:58,660
They weren't watering them.

1996
01:46:58,660 --> 01:47:00,660
That's good.

1997
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:02,660
Cold and flu and histamine.

1998
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:04,660
FDA recently

1999
01:47:04,660 --> 01:47:06,660
banned

2000
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:08,660
products now being

2001
01:47:08,660 --> 01:47:10,660
Yeah, you can turn this into meth if you want.

2002
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:12,660
You gotta call someone at

2003
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:14,660
Walgreens to get it though. They gotta come

2004
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:16,660
around and open up the case.

2005
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:18,660
Take some Sudafed, go

2006
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:20,660
to the top of under construction

2007
01:47:20,660 --> 01:47:22,660
skyscraper.

2008
01:47:22,660 --> 01:47:24,660
What is

2009
01:47:24,660 --> 01:47:26,660
this? This is like early computer stuff.

2010
01:47:26,660 --> 01:47:28,660
This is good.

2011
01:47:28,660 --> 01:47:30,660
They're eating a snail?

2012
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:32,660
Mario Paint

2013
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:34,660
Now Mario Paint

2014
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:36,660
rules. We were such

2015
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:38,660
a Mario Paint fam. We were

2016
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:40,660
obsessed with Mario Paint. And you can go online

2017
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:42,660
you can find people that will make modern songs

2018
01:47:42,660 --> 01:47:44,660
in the Mario Paint music maker,

2019
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:46,660
which is awesome.

2020
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:48,660
And that's something I do. That's good.

2021
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:50,660
Yeah, it's really amazing.

2022
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:52,660
Also, the

2023
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:54,660
retail price on that $60.

2024
01:47:54,660 --> 01:47:56,660
That's a lot of money.

2025
01:47:56,660 --> 01:47:58,660
Because it came with a little mouse pad and a mouse.

2026
01:47:58,660 --> 01:48:00,660
And I think that was the price for the Super Nintendo

2027
01:48:00,660 --> 01:48:02,660
with that game.

2028
01:48:02,660 --> 01:48:04,660
$60 would have been the game price.

2029
01:48:04,660 --> 01:48:06,660
Just the game?

2030
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:08,660
1992? $60.

2031
01:48:08,660 --> 01:48:10,660
But it came with a mouse.

2032
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:12,660
Games just now started to increase.

2033
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:14,660
But they've done it at $60.

2034
01:48:14,660 --> 01:48:16,660
You and I talk about it all the time too. Games were the same price

2035
01:48:16,660 --> 01:48:18,660
for 30 years. It's weird.

2036
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:20,660
It's very strange.

2037
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:22,660
That meant that games were decreasing

2038
01:48:22,660 --> 01:48:24,660
in price for a while.

2039
01:48:24,660 --> 01:48:26,660
$60 in 1992

2040
01:48:26,660 --> 01:48:28,660
just for inflation.

2041
01:48:28,660 --> 01:48:30,660
$60 when we were buying a $60 game

2042
01:48:30,660 --> 01:48:32,660
in 2015.

2043
01:48:32,660 --> 01:48:34,660
Or even

2044
01:48:34,660 --> 01:48:36,660
N64

2045
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:38,660
you're essentially paying in $20, $24

2046
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:40,660
about $100

2047
01:48:40,660 --> 01:48:42,660
for a game.

2048
01:48:42,660 --> 01:48:44,660
And just now games are like $80 for the new version.

2049
01:48:44,660 --> 01:48:46,660
And it depends.

2050
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:48,660
But I'm telling you, it came with a mouse.

2051
01:48:48,660 --> 01:48:50,660
The Mario Paint came with other things.

2052
01:48:50,660 --> 01:48:52,660
So that $60, $10 extra

2053
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:54,660
dollars was for

2054
01:48:54,660 --> 01:48:56,660
accessories, yes.

2055
01:48:56,660 --> 01:48:58,660
Do you ever

2056
01:48:58,660 --> 01:49:00,660
listen to sound font

2057
01:49:00,660 --> 01:49:02,660
of Donkey Kong Country

2058
01:49:02,660 --> 01:49:04,660
but it's Nirvana's Nevermind?

2059
01:49:04,660 --> 01:49:06,660
This is stuff I do.

2060
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:08,660
I've sent this to you. It is good.

2061
01:49:08,660 --> 01:49:10,660
Because you know the water level that everyone listens to

2062
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:12,660
music from the water level?

2063
01:49:12,660 --> 01:49:14,660
What's that Sega?

2064
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:16,660
Donkey Kong?

2065
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:18,660
Donkey Kong? Oh no, fuck.

2066
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:20,660
I never had a Super Nintendo.

2067
01:49:20,660 --> 01:49:22,660
Okay, but do you know what I'm talking about? The music from the

2068
01:49:22,660 --> 01:49:24,660
underwater Donkey Kong.

2069
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:26,660
I wouldn't do it justice.

2070
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:28,660
It's beautiful.

2071
01:49:28,660 --> 01:49:30,660
It's beautiful. Trent Reznor loves it.

2072
01:49:30,660 --> 01:49:32,660
People mention this all the time.

2073
01:49:32,660 --> 01:49:34,660
And it's this peaceful

2074
01:49:34,660 --> 01:49:36,660
relaxing music.

2075
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:38,660
Why did I just confuse Donkey Kong with Echo the Dolphin?

2076
01:49:38,660 --> 01:49:40,660
Boy, I don't know.

2077
01:49:40,660 --> 01:49:42,660
That was Sega.

2078
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:44,660
Similar underwater vibe though.

2079
01:49:44,660 --> 01:49:46,660
I know that Donkey Kong is a Nintendo product.

2080
01:49:46,660 --> 01:49:48,660
It's one of the most peaceful songs of all time.

2081
01:49:48,660 --> 01:49:50,660
It's the underwater song from Donkey Kong Country.

2082
01:49:50,660 --> 01:49:52,660
Gio's pulling it up, right?

2083
01:49:52,660 --> 01:49:54,660
People take whatever they call the

2084
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:56,660
sound font or whatever and then they just

2085
01:49:56,660 --> 01:49:58,660
remake the Red Hot Chili Peppers

2086
01:49:58,660 --> 01:50:00,660
Blood Sugar

2087
01:50:00,660 --> 01:50:02,660
Sex Magic using the instruments and

2088
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:04,660
tones from that. Using the synths or whatever from it.

2089
01:50:04,660 --> 01:50:06,660
I like chiptune stuff a lot which is not

2090
01:50:06,660 --> 01:50:08,660
exactly the same but I think it's the same idea.

2091
01:50:08,660 --> 01:50:10,660
Yes, I think that's right.

2092
01:50:10,660 --> 01:50:12,660
Yeah, he's playing

2093
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:14,660
Gio's playing the music right now for

2094
01:50:14,660 --> 01:50:16,660
his act. He's putting it up to the mic.

2095
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:20,660
It's so, it's

2096
01:50:20,660 --> 01:50:22,660
like the most peace I ever felt.

2097
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:24,660
This is great. For a pretty stressful game, I will

2098
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:26,660
say. It depends which level.

2099
01:50:26,660 --> 01:50:28,660
But it can be pretty intense, Donkey Kong Country.

2100
01:50:28,660 --> 01:50:30,660
Jason, you ever played Donkey Kong Country?

2101
01:50:30,660 --> 01:50:32,660
Sure. Yeah.

2102
01:50:32,660 --> 01:50:34,660
You know that song? I do know that song.

2103
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:36,660
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm just distracted

2104
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:38,660
by the parade

2105
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:40,660
came back on and Clark Duke has

2106
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:42,660
been replaced by some sort of horrific

2107
01:50:42,660 --> 01:50:44,660
goofy Clark Duke hybrid.

2108
01:50:44,660 --> 01:50:46,660
There is

2109
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:48,660
like a running theme I'm coming

2110
01:50:48,660 --> 01:50:50,660
around to for this parade which is like

2111
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:52,660
you got Goofy's DNA and you got

2112
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:54,660
something else's DNA and you're going to shove it

2113
01:50:54,660 --> 01:50:56,660
together. Right, right. It's like the thing or it's like

2114
01:50:56,660 --> 01:50:58,660
The Fly.

2115
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:00,660
It's like the movie The Fly where there's like

2116
01:51:00,660 --> 01:51:02,660
Just like the movie The Fly. It's like Goofy

2117
01:51:02,660 --> 01:51:04,660
and a different thing went into that

2118
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:06,660
machine together and they came out

2119
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:08,660
over and over and over and over again.

2120
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:10,660
Yeah, you just want more

2121
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:12,660
like Cronenberg

2122
01:51:12,660 --> 01:51:14,660
and parade floats.

2123
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:16,660
Yes, I would. Yes. You want some Cronenberg

2124
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:18,660
stuff. Who's a new character?

2125
01:51:18,660 --> 01:51:20,660
The Toy Story characters.

2126
01:51:20,660 --> 01:51:22,660
We haven't seen

2127
01:51:22,660 --> 01:51:24,660
horrible beast versions

2128
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:26,660
of those characters. Yeah, so

2129
01:51:26,660 --> 01:51:28,660
it would be like, so we'll say

2130
01:51:28,660 --> 01:51:30,660
Woody for example.

2131
01:51:30,660 --> 01:51:32,660
What would your ideal, you wanted to shove his

2132
01:51:32,660 --> 01:51:34,660
DNA into something else's.

2133
01:51:34,660 --> 01:51:36,660
Okay, it would be like

2134
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:38,660
a Woody and mixed

2135
01:51:38,660 --> 01:51:40,660
with like a Buzzsaw.

2136
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:42,660
I guess Buzz, I thought Buzz

2137
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:44,660
because of Buzz Lightyear. Like a Chainsaw Man.

2138
01:51:44,660 --> 01:51:46,660
Yeah, you want like a horrible

2139
01:51:46,660 --> 01:51:48,660
Chainsaw Man Woody.

2140
01:51:48,660 --> 01:51:50,660
Chainsaw Man Woody.

2141
01:51:50,660 --> 01:51:52,660
Here comes Chainsaw Man Woody.

2142
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:54,660
There he is.

2143
01:51:54,660 --> 01:51:56,660
It's the hottest new anime

2144
01:51:56,660 --> 01:51:58,660
on the market. They're cutting to

2145
01:51:58,660 --> 01:52:00,660
the same kids crying. Yeah.

2146
01:52:00,660 --> 01:52:02,660
They do kind of

2147
01:52:02,660 --> 01:52:04,660
do this, but they're just like so much

2148
01:52:04,660 --> 01:52:06,660
more protective of the IP now, right?

2149
01:52:06,660 --> 01:52:08,660
Like they'll still dress up Mickey

2150
01:52:08,660 --> 01:52:10,660
in every outfit under the sun

2151
01:52:10,660 --> 01:52:12,660
and sell it as merch, but they won't

2152
01:52:12,660 --> 01:52:14,660
put it, they won't make his head a

2153
01:52:14,660 --> 01:52:16,660
Chainsaw. No, he's not. No, that's what I'm saying.

2154
01:52:16,660 --> 01:52:18,660
So it's like, I expected

2155
01:52:18,660 --> 01:52:20,660
to say like, Ship Captain Mickey

2156
01:52:20,660 --> 01:52:22,660
and like Cowboy Mickey

2157
01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:24,660
and whatever it may be, but then

2158
01:52:24,660 --> 01:52:26,660
to see things like

2159
01:52:26,660 --> 01:52:28,660
forced together, like the island of Dr.

2160
01:52:28,660 --> 01:52:30,660
Morose. Yeah.

2161
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:32,660
What if Buzz Lightyear

2162
01:52:32,660 --> 01:52:34,660
was made up of

2163
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:36,660
a thousand maggots? A thousand wasps.

2164
01:52:36,660 --> 01:52:38,660
Yeah.

2165
01:52:38,660 --> 01:52:40,660
That's good, that's good. Wasp Lightyear.

2166
01:52:40,660 --> 01:52:42,660
Some sort of the larva

2167
01:52:42,660 --> 01:52:44,660
combines together to make

2168
01:52:44,660 --> 01:52:46,660
Buzz Lightyear. He just slimes his way

2169
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:48,660
down Main Street.

2170
01:52:48,660 --> 01:52:50,660
Put it where it belongs in Hollywood Horror

2171
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:52,660
Nights. Get it out of Disneyland.

2172
01:52:52,660 --> 01:52:54,660
What if Goofy was playing

2173
01:52:54,660 --> 01:52:56,660
a grand piano

2174
01:52:56,660 --> 01:52:58,660
on top of that, there's a tiny

2175
01:52:58,660 --> 01:53:00,660
mutant Goofy playing a little piano.

2176
01:53:00,660 --> 01:53:02,660
Okay, you know what the modern

2177
01:53:02,660 --> 01:53:04,660
day version of it is like,

2178
01:53:04,660 --> 01:53:06,660
it's like Donald Duck, but he's a

2179
01:53:06,660 --> 01:53:08,660
big, he's been

2180
01:53:08,660 --> 01:53:10,660
morphed together with a big pink horse

2181
01:53:10,660 --> 01:53:12,660
and it's like, Chapel Rowan's Pink

2182
01:53:12,660 --> 01:53:14,660
Pony Duck is playing as he goes

2183
01:53:14,660 --> 01:53:16,660
down the street.

2184
01:53:16,660 --> 01:53:18,660
That's the version of it

2185
01:53:18,660 --> 01:53:20,660
because you need to include

2186
01:53:22,660 --> 01:53:24,660
Can you do the voice?

2187
01:53:24,660 --> 01:53:26,660
There have been many times on the show

2188
01:53:26,660 --> 01:53:28,660
where we all tried to do Donald and talk

2189
01:53:28,660 --> 01:53:30,660
it's impossible. No, Geo's got it.

2190
01:53:30,660 --> 01:53:32,660
Okay, so here are the words. Pink Pony Duck.

2191
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:34,660
I'm gonna keep on quacking like a pink pony

2192
01:53:34,660 --> 01:53:36,660
duck.

2193
01:53:36,660 --> 01:53:38,660
Way down in West Duckburg.

2194
01:53:42,660 --> 01:53:44,660
He's just doing the sounds.

2195
01:53:44,660 --> 01:53:46,660
It's impossible.

2196
01:53:46,660 --> 01:53:48,660
Internet, record Pink Pony Duck.

2197
01:53:48,660 --> 01:53:50,660
Please.

2198
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:52,660
I'm gonna keep on quacking like a pink pony duck.

2199
01:53:52,660 --> 01:53:54,660
I'm gonna keep on quacking down in West Duckburg.

2200
01:53:54,660 --> 01:53:56,660
West Duckburg.

2201
01:53:56,660 --> 01:53:58,660
We need one more syllable.

2202
01:53:58,660 --> 01:54:00,660
Northwest Duckburg.

2203
01:54:00,660 --> 01:54:02,660
Northwest Duckburg.

2204
01:54:02,660 --> 01:54:04,660
It's bad prosody, but that's okay.

2205
01:54:04,660 --> 01:54:06,660
Look, we're doing another flight here.

2206
01:54:06,660 --> 01:54:08,660
No, you're right, we can just do

2207
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:10,660
West Duckburg.

2208
01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:12,660
I'm gonna keep on quacking like a pink pony duck.

2209
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:14,660
He's playing like a piano made of

2210
01:54:16,660 --> 01:54:18,660
Rex's skin from Toy Story.

2211
01:54:18,660 --> 01:54:20,660
Oh my god!

2212
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:24,660
If we could find Michael Eisner right now

2213
01:54:24,660 --> 01:54:26,660
and pitch this to him, he would approve it.

2214
01:54:26,660 --> 01:54:28,660
He doesn't have the power anymore, but he would still approve it.

2215
01:54:28,660 --> 01:54:30,660
And also Chappell will say no.

2216
01:54:30,660 --> 01:54:32,660
Oh, but it's parody law.

2217
01:54:32,660 --> 01:54:34,660
Uh, that's not

2218
01:54:34,660 --> 01:54:36,660
parody.

2219
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:38,660
Why? Because it's truly a parody.

2220
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:40,660
It's hilarious, it's a parody.

2221
01:54:40,660 --> 01:54:42,660
No, it's satire.

2222
01:54:42,660 --> 01:54:44,660
It's parody because it's 1130 on a Saturday, right?

2223
01:54:44,660 --> 01:54:46,660
Wait, no, sorry. Satire is

2224
01:54:46,660 --> 01:54:48,660
protected, parody is not.

2225
01:54:48,660 --> 01:54:50,660
Parody is not protected? No, that's why

2226
01:54:50,660 --> 01:54:52,660
you have to be saying something about the original

2227
01:54:52,660 --> 01:54:54,660
thing for it to be legal.

2228
01:54:54,660 --> 01:54:56,660
But Weird Al didn't have to get permission.

2229
01:54:56,660 --> 01:54:58,660
He just did out of politeness. We've all heard him say it.

2230
01:54:58,660 --> 01:55:00,660
Um,

2231
01:55:00,660 --> 01:55:02,660
Weird Al's lawyers know when his stuff

2232
01:55:02,660 --> 01:55:04,660
is or is not on the right side of the law.

2233
01:55:04,660 --> 01:55:06,660
Wait, what about pink pony duck is not

2234
01:55:06,660 --> 01:55:08,660
saying something? That's a great

2235
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:10,660
point, Anthony.

2236
01:55:10,660 --> 01:55:12,660
You're just making stuff up. This is not true.

2237
01:55:12,660 --> 01:55:14,660
Parody law says you can do it.

2238
01:55:14,660 --> 01:55:16,660
Parody is not protected.

2239
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:18,660
If we have not heard the story about

2240
01:55:18,660 --> 01:55:20,660
Coolio and Weird Al, there was a

2241
01:55:20,660 --> 01:55:22,660
misunderstanding when he was making Amish Paradise.

2242
01:55:22,660 --> 01:55:24,660
Weird Al asked for permission, but he doesn't

2243
01:55:24,660 --> 01:55:26,660
need it. But also, when Weird Al

2244
01:55:26,660 --> 01:55:28,660
is taking, like, you cannot just take

2245
01:55:28,660 --> 01:55:30,660
someone's songs and change the words to

2246
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:32,660
whatever. I think we would have to pay some

2247
01:55:32,660 --> 01:55:34,660
money, but we don't have to ask permission.

2248
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:36,660
I think Zach's saying there's

2249
01:55:36,660 --> 01:55:38,660
got to be a transformative element.

2250
01:55:38,660 --> 01:55:40,660
I disagree with that.

2251
01:55:40,660 --> 01:55:42,660
Okay.

2252
01:55:42,660 --> 01:55:44,660
I would say the only way to find out

2253
01:55:44,660 --> 01:55:46,660
is to do it and see if the law

2254
01:55:46,660 --> 01:55:48,660
comes. The only way to do it is to record pink

2255
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:50,660
pony duck and see if anyone

2256
01:55:50,660 --> 01:55:52,660
comes after us.

2257
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:54,660
I don't think anyone's coming

2258
01:55:54,660 --> 01:55:56,660
after us for pink pony duck. Listen.

2259
01:55:56,660 --> 01:55:58,660
I will write it.

2260
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:00,660
Okay. I will write

2261
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:02,660
all of it. And then I will send it to

2262
01:56:02,660 --> 01:56:04,660
you, Mike. Okay. And then I

2263
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:06,660
cannot do this voice.

2264
01:56:06,660 --> 01:56:08,660
I can't either. But someone on the internet

2265
01:56:08,660 --> 01:56:10,660
can. And we can all agree I can't do that.

2266
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:12,660
Gio can't do it. Gio can't either. Jason can't do

2267
01:56:12,660 --> 01:56:14,660
it. I've heard him try. Yeah.

2268
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:16,660
He can barely do Stitch.

2269
01:56:16,660 --> 01:56:18,660
What if Stitch sang it though?

2270
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:20,660
Oh, that's good.

2271
01:56:20,660 --> 01:56:22,660
Jason, what do you think?

2272
01:56:22,660 --> 01:56:24,660
Pink pony duck!

2273
01:56:24,660 --> 01:56:26,660
Pink pony duck!

2274
01:56:26,660 --> 01:56:28,660
No, I'd do a pretty good

2275
01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:30,660
Stitch. Zach's upstaging

2276
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:32,660
you, Jason. Sorry. I know. It's fine.

2277
01:56:32,660 --> 01:56:34,660
But Stitch wouldn't sing pink pony duck.

2278
01:56:34,660 --> 01:56:36,660
I know. Fair enough.

2279
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:38,660
Well, we're going to have to

2280
01:56:38,660 --> 01:56:40,660
test it out. I'll write it. I'll

2281
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:42,660
send it to you. You can post it somewhere. And then if someone

2282
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:44,660
wants to record it, just get a

2283
01:56:44,660 --> 01:56:46,660
karaoke track of Pink Pony Club

2284
01:56:46,660 --> 01:56:48,660
and you're done. Can we use an

2285
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:50,660
AI Donald Duck?

2286
01:56:50,660 --> 01:56:52,660
That's pretty good. That's the only time

2287
01:56:52,660 --> 01:56:54,660
I want to use AI is to imitate Donald Duck.

2288
01:56:54,660 --> 01:56:56,660
Only because I can't do it. Someone can do it. Someone

2289
01:56:56,660 --> 01:56:58,660
will do it. Who's going to do it?

2290
01:56:58,660 --> 01:57:00,660
Can we get the actor who plays Donald Duck

2291
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:02,660
currently? That's a great

2292
01:57:02,660 --> 01:57:04,660
question. Could we Donald Duck in the

2293
01:57:04,660 --> 01:57:06,660
new Mickey's?

2294
01:57:06,660 --> 01:57:08,660
No, no. The DuckTales

2295
01:57:08,660 --> 01:57:10,660
reboot. Oh, good question.

2296
01:57:10,660 --> 01:57:12,660
Or did he speak with a voice

2297
01:57:12,660 --> 01:57:14,660
thing? Yeah, it was Cheetal. Yeah, but there was somebody

2298
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:16,660
who did the actual quacking, I think, as well.

2299
01:57:16,660 --> 01:57:18,660
Okay. But I don't know.

2300
01:57:18,660 --> 01:57:20,660
Don Cheetal was Donald Duck? I think

2301
01:57:20,660 --> 01:57:22,660
so. Really? But I think he came in the show

2302
01:57:22,660 --> 01:57:24,660
later. I don't know. I haven't watched

2303
01:57:24,660 --> 01:57:26,660
a lot of it. Well, I think

2304
01:57:26,660 --> 01:57:28,660
we're going to call it here, right? Yeah.

2305
01:57:28,660 --> 01:57:30,660
Wow, we really went out with a bang.

2306
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:32,660
We really went out with a bang discussing parody

2307
01:57:32,660 --> 01:57:34,660
law. A parody

2308
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:36,660
Tony Anselmo. All right.

2309
01:57:36,660 --> 01:57:38,660
We'll contact his people. Since 1985?

2310
01:57:38,660 --> 01:57:40,660
Wow. It allows people

2311
01:57:40,660 --> 01:57:42,660
to do it forever. I mean,

2312
01:57:42,660 --> 01:57:44,660
Roosie Taylor, who was Minnie Mouse, was in her 90s

2313
01:57:44,660 --> 01:57:46,660
and she just died a couple years ago

2314
01:57:46,660 --> 01:57:48,660
and did the voice up until then.

2315
01:57:48,660 --> 01:57:50,660
Wow. John

2316
01:57:50,660 --> 01:57:52,660
Fiedler, who did Piglet,

2317
01:57:52,660 --> 01:57:54,660
did Piglet up until he died

2318
01:57:54,660 --> 01:57:56,660
in his like 80s.

2319
01:57:56,660 --> 01:57:58,660
The corpse is warm and they

2320
01:57:58,660 --> 01:58:00,660
replace you with a new young guy.

2321
01:58:00,660 --> 01:58:02,660
There's no respect. They should just

2322
01:58:02,660 --> 01:58:04,660
retire Piglet on the Pooh Bear cartoons.

2323
01:58:04,660 --> 01:58:06,660
Can I tell you what Google

2324
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:08,660
just auto-suggested as a

2325
01:58:08,660 --> 01:58:10,660
search? What is Donald Duck's

2326
01:58:10,660 --> 01:58:12,660
voice disorder? It has never

2327
01:58:12,660 --> 01:58:14,660
occurred to me even once that Donald

2328
01:58:14,660 --> 01:58:16,660
Duck may have a voice disorder.

2329
01:58:16,660 --> 01:58:18,660
He's got the RFK thing. But then it says

2330
01:58:18,660 --> 01:58:20,660
Donald Duck's speech is described to occur

2331
01:58:20,660 --> 01:58:22,660
like

2332
01:58:22,660 --> 01:58:24,660
shoot a bullwark

2333
01:58:28,660 --> 01:58:30,660
Donald Duck is an RFK

2334
01:58:30,660 --> 01:58:32,660
brain worm. Wait,

2335
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:34,660
did this show up again? No,

2336
01:58:34,660 --> 01:58:36,660
what happened is the thing

2337
01:58:36,660 --> 01:58:38,660
the thing that went to sleep, the projector

2338
01:58:38,660 --> 01:58:40,660
went to sleep so it turned off the screen

2339
01:58:40,660 --> 01:58:42,660
recording. By the way, I can't, we've paused

2340
01:58:42,660 --> 01:58:44,660
this so many times. I can't imagine like a

2341
01:58:44,660 --> 01:58:46,660
less important

2342
01:58:46,660 --> 01:58:48,660
visual aid to the conference. I

2343
01:58:48,660 --> 01:58:50,660
guess it is important. It's all right. I think it's

2344
01:58:50,660 --> 01:58:52,660
okay. This actually

2345
01:58:52,660 --> 01:58:54,660
is an episode that's neither

2346
01:58:54,660 --> 01:58:56,660
watchable nor listenable.

2347
01:58:58,660 --> 01:59:00,660
Right in the sweet spot, baby.

2348
01:59:00,660 --> 01:59:02,660
Yeah, it's beautiful. Well, look, listeners,

2349
01:59:02,660 --> 01:59:04,660
you survived podcast

2350
01:59:04,660 --> 01:59:06,660
You sure did.

2351
01:59:06,660 --> 01:59:08,660
We'll pick this up maybe next year.

2352
01:59:08,660 --> 01:59:10,660
Maybe never. I don't know. I really want

2353
01:59:10,660 --> 01:59:12,660
to do an episode on Tiger Electronics. Yeah.

2354
01:59:12,660 --> 01:59:14,660
We've threatened Betty Boop

2355
01:59:14,660 --> 01:59:16,660
forever. And I want to do a Betty

2356
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:18,660
Boop. What's that? And Woody Woodpecker.

2357
01:59:18,660 --> 01:59:20,660
And the Woody Woodpecker we've threatened.

2358
01:59:20,660 --> 01:59:22,660
And look, if Gio wants to come back,

2359
01:59:22,660 --> 01:59:24,660
Cathy Ireland episode.

2360
01:59:24,660 --> 01:59:26,660
Because she's an entrepreneur. She's very wealthy.

2361
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:28,660
She is a line of ceiling fans. Anthony's

2362
01:59:28,660 --> 01:59:30,660
relationship won't survive again.

2363
01:59:30,660 --> 01:59:32,660
Oh, goodness.

2364
01:59:32,660 --> 01:59:34,660
She'll blast off into the moon.

2365
01:59:34,660 --> 01:59:36,660
She loomed large in the 90s. I wonder

2366
01:59:36,660 --> 01:59:38,660
if there's anything interesting about the

2367
01:59:38,660 --> 01:59:40,660
story there. It doesn't have to be a

2368
01:59:40,660 --> 01:59:42,660
pervy episode. It just is a

2369
01:59:42,660 --> 01:59:44,660
informative one.

2370
01:59:44,660 --> 01:59:46,660
I'm still working on those goggles.

2371
01:59:46,660 --> 01:59:48,660
What, getting them clean?

2372
01:59:48,660 --> 01:59:50,660
No, so we can see through our clothes.

2373
01:59:50,660 --> 01:59:52,660
Oh, yeah, sorry. I thought your

2374
01:59:52,660 --> 01:59:54,660
goggles had fogged up. Oh, no, no. Sorry.

2375
01:59:54,660 --> 01:59:56,660
Yeah.

2376
01:59:56,660 --> 01:59:58,660
She has like a line

2377
01:59:58,660 --> 02:00:00,660
like a super successful line of home

2378
02:00:00,660 --> 02:00:02,660
goods. So much stuff. Yeah.
