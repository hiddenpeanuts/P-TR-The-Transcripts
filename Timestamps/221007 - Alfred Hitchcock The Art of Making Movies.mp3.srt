1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Warning.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,240
The following haunt cast may require working knowledge of Funko Pop executives.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:19,440
You may encounter coked out birds, embarrassed dads, and exactly as many Hitchcock impressions

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,440
as you suspect.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:26,960
It's the classic Universal Studios attraction Alfred Hitchcock, the art of making movies

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,720
on Haunt Cast the Fright.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:52,640
Welcome, Foolish Mortals, to Haunt Cast the Fright.

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,920
I had a whole opening joke plan, but I just want to get cut to the chase.

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,080
We got a host who's excited to do Alfred Hitchcock for you.

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,680
Let's go, Mike Carlson.

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,560
He was chomping at the vid.

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,480
I did it on Mike a little earlier, but good evening.

15
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,600
Welcome to Haunt Cast the Fright.

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
And then I kind of lose it.

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Haunt Cast the Fright.

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,200
It's past the good evening.

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,400
The good evening I have, and then it's gone.

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,720
Then it's over, then I go, it just goes right into my gruff.

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,680
That's, you know what, let me try to do, I wrote a little intro.

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,320
Let me try to do it like Alfred Hitchcock.

23
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
OK, here we go.

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,320
OK, OK.

25
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,480
Welcome to Haunt Cast the Fright.

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,920
A podcast about.

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,720
No number one, lose the clapping.

28
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
Sorry, sorry.

29
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:54,000
Scream Pox, hosted by two Disney deadies and one haunted doll.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,480
My name is frightful, gnarled son.

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
You're still.

32
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,480
Oh, I mean, Alfred Hitchcock.

33
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,280
Hitch, they call me Hitch.

34
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,760
They called me Hitch, but my name's Mike Frightful Carlson anyway.

35
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,800
I don't know where the Hitch comes from.

36
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,240
Here, keep going.

37
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,240
This is great.

38
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,920
I actually didn't have a name for Jason Skeleton.

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,640
Welcome.

40
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,880
We've got two big Hitchcock boys here today.

41
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,520
OK, well, in that case, let's cut to the chase.

42
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Let's get to Hitchcock.

43
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
Let's get into it.

44
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm going with Scott Grim Reapner.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,760
That's what I'm going to attempt this year.

46
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,240
But everybody, you know, punch up your punch up each other's.

47
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,520
You seem quizzical about that one.

48
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:50,160
Yeah, I was trying to think if I had done this one yet, should I try Jekyll Shriekenden?

49
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
I think I love it.

50
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,840
I think I've tried Jekyll.

51
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,760
Have you tried Jekyll?

52
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,760
I don't recall you trying Jekyll.

53
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,760
Jekyll and Jackal, I think, were the ones I kept trying.

54
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,760
Well, Jackal, you know, we like that.

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,320
There's only one Jackal, I'm afraid.

56
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
Sebastian Jekyll.

57
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
We're listening.

58
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah, we talk about the Sebastian Jekyll of Christopher Lloyd.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,440
The character Christopher Lloyd played on UPN's series Deadly Games.

60
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
Of course.

61
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
That's on the second gate.

62
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,040
So stay away from Jackal, because that guy, he'll go right through these computer wires

63
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,760
and microphone hookups and suddenly he's in your head, man.

64
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:29,480
I do not want him to saunter into the room with his glass of semi-flat sparkling apple

65
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,240
juice and just get my ass, you know?

66
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:39,400
Yeah, and kind of like be sinister to you, but not really do anything that bad.

67
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
No.

68
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
That was our takeaway from that show.

69
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,600
No, not really.

70
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:48,920
His role on the show, which is only slightly longer than Alfred Hitchcock cameo in the

71
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
movies.

72
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,640
We got to cameo point, didn't it?

73
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
Yeah.

74
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,640
Okay.

75
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,280
Well, first things first, welcome to Hauntcast, The Fright.

76
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,080
I'm excited we've begun this again.

77
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,880
You know, we're going to have some fun.

78
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:12,160
Of course, the Haunted Mansion series will step closer and closer as we step closer and

79
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,360
closer to the grave.

80
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,040
So, we'll set a similar pace, well, at a year-by-year pace.

81
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,280
That'll be the end of the month.

82
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,440
Mike has been out haunting again.

83
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,640
We're going to hear about some recent.

84
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,760
I know it's been a bit, you have carved out the time.

85
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,240
You're in a stretch of parenting where it's hard to get out, but you love haunts that

86
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
much.

87
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,440
You have made it work.

88
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,760
We've carved out like one thing, fun thing for me to do a week, which is go to a haunt.

89
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,320
Luckily, there's a lot of them.

90
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,600
It's fun seeing your daughter grow before your very eyes.

91
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,760
All that is magical and beautiful, but I'm just talking about extra curricular fun outside

92
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
of the home.

93
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,480
So, yeah, basically my only fun in that regard is haunts and then going to the toy section

94
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
at Target.

95
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
Okay.

96
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,960
You go for functional reasons, but then like, well, it's on the way.

97
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,920
You can't fault me for.

98
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,080
Oh man, do we need something?

99
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,080
We need something, huh?

100
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,480
We need, are we out of granola bars?

101
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Oh shoot.

102
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,640
Okay.

103
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Yeah.

104
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
I'll have you go unless you want to go.

105
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
Did you pump?

106
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Did you pump?

107
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Because if not, I'll probably have to go.

108
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,320
It's so convenient, the baby section.

109
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,000
And I don't know what, sometimes I forget where it is and I have to walk through adjacent

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,120
sections like really close to it.

111
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,080
But if things was a babyish stuff in there like a toy.

112
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
Yeah.

113
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Well, she needs toys.

114
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,080
I mean, she's a little child.

115
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,320
Oh, little children need toys.

116
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,920
That is a rule.

117
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,520
That is what Dr. Spock said.

118
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,800
Is that where is to the target toy section where you got this, this Kingo, my favorite

119
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
character.

120
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,480
Let me, let me update this for 2022.

121
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,520
My favorite character in fiction.

122
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,640
I know I got that at GameStop actually.

123
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
Okay.

124
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,640
Oh, gotcha.

125
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
And I won't lie.

126
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,360
It was on clearance and I said, you know what?

127
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,120
That's a really good deal for a, for a little Funko pop key chain.

128
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,040
So yeah, that's where, that's where I got it.

129
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,200
This was not a priceless.

130
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,280
This is not like lines out the door every day for, do you have a new second shipment

131
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,280
of Kingo yet?

132
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,120
Well, you know, it's a good question because like they make a lot of Funko pop merchandise.

133
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,560
So it could either be a limited run and then it didn't sell well or it sold very well and

134
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,960
they made a million of them.

135
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
So I'm not actually sure.

136
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,600
I would be interested to know.

137
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:33,080
I could talk to Funko president Brian Mariotti and see if he has the list or like of how

138
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,320
many they made for all these things.

139
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,760
You know the name of the president of Funko.

140
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
Yes.

141
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,760
Brian.

142
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,120
I have texted about this man.

143
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
Oh boy.

144
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,760
Dear Mr. Mariotti, I have a new beautiful daughter and I'm wondering if you can tell

145
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:53,160
me where to track down the young Sheldon variant where he's in his little docent costume from

146
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,040
when he worked at a train museum.

147
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,360
Yeah, here he is.

148
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,920
This is Brian Mariotti.

149
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
Whoa.

150
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,400
He is the chief creative officer.

151
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Excuse me of Funko.

152
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,760
He looks like the John Cena of toys.

153
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,840
Yes, I think he is the John Cena of toys.

154
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,560
But yeah, you know, we know we have all these different guys on this podcast, right?

155
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,520
But believe me, the toy world is full of guys.

156
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,680
And yeah, this is what as soon as I heard the name and that you Griffin of time, like,

157
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,880
OK, this is this is an Eisner.

158
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,880
This is a trey.

159
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,480
I don't know in terms of I don't know his like ethics or what I don't.

160
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Yeah, I don't know anything about that.

161
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,480
I just I'm fascinated by him immediately.

162
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,080
I haven't done any sort of deep dive.

163
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,040
But yeah, he's I follow him on Twitter and he might.

164
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,280
He'll know the answer to how many KINGO's were produced, how many KINGO keychains.

165
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,400
I don't know if you only do this with Disney executives, but let's try it.

166
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,560
Let's cut to the chase.

167
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,040
Can Brian Mariotti get it?

168
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,560
He looked pretty handsome in the photo.

169
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Let's see him again.

170
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
Oh, there he is on the screen.

171
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Oh, he's oh, yeah.

172
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,360
Well, this is kind of your aesthetic, Mike, which is like Rockstar, who peaked 18 years

173
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
ago.

174
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,200
That's kind of his vibe.

175
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,040
So this is what you regard as the pinnacle of male handsomeness.

176
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
That's true.

177
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,800
A lot of the toy guys, again, this is a different for a different podcast, but a lot of the

178
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,120
toy guys have a wide variety of aesthetics.

179
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,360
So yeah, he's got his own unique aesthetic going on here.

180
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,000
But yes, I mean, I think he's a pretty good looking guy.

181
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,620
He's got he's got a nice suit on.

182
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,520
It's got like a checker pattern or what would you call it?

183
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah, I'd wear that suit.

184
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,200
Jason, that suit screams I am about to con a like 10th round NFL draft pick.

185
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,200
18 year old out of 80 percent of their income.

186
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
That suit says all that.

187
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,480
That's what a suit can say.

188
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
That suit says that.

189
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,000
Shady, shady sports agent.

190
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,920
I say that's the suit of a man who makes dreams come true by producing high valued collectibles.

191
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,000
Oh, and now wait.

192
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,760
Now, Jordan has slid the screen over and now we're looking he's in front of a big C3PO

193
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,280
and he's wearing sort of a Bill Nye.

194
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,640
He's from the Bill Nye collection.

195
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,280
Yeah, so he's got a little bow tie.

196
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,760
Standing in sort of a feed, you might say.

197
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,560
What would the pocket?

198
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,240
A little.

199
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,960
Yeah, I'm getting a little young Sheldon with that boat.

200
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,160
Maybe that's why the show that the multiple.

201
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,560
Do we know how many Sheldon's all told there are Funko pops?

202
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,120
Yeah, yeah, because we know there's two at least there's basic.

203
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,600
There's classic and there's docent like stars in the universe.

204
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,040
It's unknowable.

205
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,160
Funko pop wise.

206
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,240
Yeah, there's got to be very so many different show and variance, I imagine,

207
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,000
with him in just different shirts.

208
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,640
Using the word variant at this point in this year to describe in this case,

209
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,080
it can just we've all used this word a lot and now we're using it to describe

210
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,280
how many Sheldon's there are.

211
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,040
It's funny because you say that because I'm equally on the COVID-19

212
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,680
Reddit where they're discussing variance and like the general action

213
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,720
figure collector where they talk about variance.

214
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,640
It's called a very you actively learn more about COVID than you have to.

215
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,400
I am. Yes, that's true.

216
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,120
I still am.

217
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,920
I'm like, well, I see you subscribe to different reddits.

218
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,440
And then it's sort of an aggregate of all the different reddits.

219
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,560
And so I've subscribed to it.

220
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,680
So when I'm scrolling through Reddit, I will learn about new

221
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,120
Ninja Turtle collectibles, and then I will learn about the bivalent booster

222
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,360
and how maybe that when are we getting the efficacy data?

223
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,400
You know, when are we going to know?

224
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,800
Because it hasn't had a full trial yet to know exactly how successful it'll be.

225
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,880
Do we have the Calabunga data yet?

226
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,520
Do we know how bodacious the new line of turtles are?

227
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,720
We do have that data.

228
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,120
And the answer is very the answer is highly bodacious.

229
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,680
Have we gotten to 100 percent?

230
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,760
Because I'm not I don't know if I'm willing to.

231
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,200
I don't know if I'm going to take the time to get the new Donatello

232
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,840
if it's not 100 percent Calabunga's rate.

233
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,360
Well, you should not.

234
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,960
Don't fear on this, because these are these are as perfect as turtles can get.

235
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,560
Shout out to head of NECA Toys, Randy Falk, a different guy

236
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,280
who I love, Randy again, Randy Falk.

237
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,640
But Randy is great because Randy looks like kind of a rock and roll guy.

238
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,720
He's he's like the you mean like the person we know.

239
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,720
But other toy guy we just talked about.

240
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,040
But a different type of rock and roll kind of guy.

241
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,440
He he he's like kind of like a cool like metal kind of guy.

242
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,640
He's a Vince Neil. He's got long hair.

243
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,960
I think he used to be on rock and roll radio, rock and roll radio.

244
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,440
Yeah, which I just that was just that's something that just came out on his

245
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,120
Twitter he revealed a few weeks ago.

246
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,760
Again, this is a different podcast.

247
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,400
Yeah, I'm doing a different podcast right now, and I want to go back

248
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,360
to haunt cast the fright.

249
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,080
You know, we have to.

250
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,400
Yeah, we're one premise of podcast within another premise of podcast.

251
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,080
So we'll get through it here.

252
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,360
But we're we're we're haunting.

253
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,760
The point is, you're haunting again.

254
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,360
But where do we kick this month off?

255
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,320
I think there's no better place to do it than with the master of horror

256
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,360
cinema's finest tour of frights.

257
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,280
That is, of course, Rob Zombie, who directed the new monsters,

258
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,080
which I believe by this point, technically we kicked off haunt

259
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,080
cast the fright with an episode about that on the second game.

260
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,280
We're recording this before we know before we know how good it is.

261
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,520
Yeah.

262
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,720
Well, I'll just say that there is a gulf as big as that fall

263
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:12,320
in saboteur of the Statue of Liberty on some of the movies I've watched lately.

264
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,960
I see. Wait, so that means you maybe have seen Rob Zombie's

265
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,440
monsters by this point.

266
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,480
I you'll hear you check out the Patreon and you can hear my saga.

267
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,640
With Rob Zombie's monsters, maybe that's by the time this episode comes out.

268
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,400
I will have seen all but the last 20 minutes because I fell asleep.

269
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,240
So Jason's saga is that he fell asleep or is the saga like you like lost your past?

270
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,560
We forgot your passport. No, no, I didn't.

271
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,880
Not a saga in like, oh, Mike's going out of town.

272
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,200
I wonder what a crucial thing is in another state.

273
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,000
You know, OK, got it.

274
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,800
But I feel like it's a long lineage of sagas that involve you falling asleep.

275
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,440
Yeah, that's a pretty standard.

276
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,160
That's what I call a saga.

277
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,160
It's not limited like the Skywalker saga that ended.

278
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,840
It keeps going and going and going.

279
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,440
But anyway, now that we've we since we've already covered

280
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,280
the master of horror, now we move to a it's, I don't know, a lateral move

281
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,400
or a lesser move to Alfred Hitchcock, who was a

282
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,920
was not just a character in that Anthony Hopkins film 10 years ago.

283
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,080
He was a real man. That's right.

284
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,680
And he made he made some movies.

285
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,880
There was a second Hitchcock biopic around that time, too.

286
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,080
I think straight to HBO. Oh, well, was that about how he was like a big creep?

287
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,880
They made a movie like that.

288
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,480
I think all of them mentioned that a little.

289
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,320
But I think the Hopkins one seemed like real Oscar baby.

290
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,320
And that's the bet when something is Oscar baby and then they do not take the bait.

291
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,400
No, that's always very funny.

292
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,680
It's there's there's a certain type of award season movie

293
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,120
where like everyone's like, wow, this performance is amazing.

294
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,160
They're definitely going to get nominated if not win.

295
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,160
And then you hear it's like, oh, how's the rest of the movie?

296
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,280
And it's like, oh, don't worry about it.

297
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,440
Don't ask that. He put the stuff on his face.

298
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,080
What do you want?

299
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,560
It does. Do you care now about what he does in the movie?

300
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,000
And if it's good, look at his face. It looks different.

301
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,120
Yeah. Did he try to do was the voice as good as mine?

302
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,880
Did he try to talk?

303
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,920
It might have been right in the same neck of the woods.

304
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
I don't I feel like I saw some of it, but I don't.

305
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,280
I might have been a screener.

306
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,520
No, let's talk about the man and let's talk about

307
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,640
the finest work associated with him.

308
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,600
The Universal Studios attraction, which like

309
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,960
probably the title, the main title, you would say, is Alfred Hitchcock,

310
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,960
the art of making movies, had a couple other titles.

311
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,320
But this was an opening day attraction at Universal Studios, Florida,

312
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,200
in 1990, closed in 2003.

313
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,040
And a great tribute to somebody who you guys say that you are boys

314
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,680
of what it describes.

315
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,200
Let's let's talk about your Hitchcock feelings in connection.

316
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,240
Sure. Yeah.

317
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,360
I mean, we were a big Hitchcock family for a few reasons.

318
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,920
One, the easiest of which was that when Nickelodeon

319
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,960
started airing the SNCC block.

320
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,520
Are You Afraid of the Dark was on?

321
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,200
Then it kicked over to Nick at Night and they followed it with

322
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,760
Alfred Hitchcock Presents.

323
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,440
Oh, they did a little horror tie together between the formats.

324
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,360
Wow, that's cool. Yeah.

325
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,920
And so we like that.

326
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,960
I saw a couple of

327
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,720
Alfred Hitchcock Presents recently on like MeTV or AntennaTV.

328
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,160
One of those channels where you're like, what is this?

329
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,960
But then it's like, this is pretty good.

330
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,880
Like they got interesting stuff.

331
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,440
And so I feel like that was one reason we like the intros.

332
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,200
We started watching the movies.

333
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,520
We like looking out for the cameos.

334
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,520
And then isn't this, by the way, this is sort of this is this is Eisner

335
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,160
before it is Eisner.

336
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,760
Guy talks to a semi charismatic,

337
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,520
semi bald guy introduces a special movie of the week.

338
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,960
Yeah. And I think the other reason, well, one Hitchcock movies are kind of

339
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,760
I didn't want to say they were that my parents knew there wasn't

340
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,720
foul language or nudity or violence, which were very verboten in the early 90s.

341
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,000
But murder is fine.

342
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,280
Murder and grand theft and that sort of thing.

343
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,720
My parents, I think around this time, were both big readers of like paperback.

344
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,640
Suspense novels like

345
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,640
Stephen King and Dean Koontz and and Sue Grafton and stuff.

346
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,320
So those were always around.

347
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,160
So I think we could all kind of agree on this. Sure.

348
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,240
We I didn't get to watch horror movies and watch a lot.

349
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,560
My parents didn't show me a lot of stuff, but my mom did love Alfred Hitchcock.

350
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,920
So even though I wasn't allowed, not allowed, just not even made aware

351
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,240
kept away from, I would say, most of the things I've talked about,

352
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,000
like Gremlins or whatever, she still liked the most

353
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,960
or horrifying snuff film that was Gremlins and Gremlins 2, which is a cartoon.

354
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,920
Yes, a literal wonderful show.

355
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,000
It's fantastic. Yeah.

356
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,560
She did like Alfred Hitchcock a lot.

357
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,040
So she would be like, well, you might be like nine or 10.

358
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,760
But you know, you could watch Psycho.

359
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,600
I would let you watch Psycho. Sure.

360
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,040
Because she liked the big she liked the main ones.

361
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,480
So I did see those and we watched the show on Nick at Night.

362
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,960
So, yeah, we like that. That was great. That was fun.

363
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,840
As a kid, I was scared by all of it, believe it or not.

364
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:51,720
For sure. Well, this it is like a the the attraction itself that there

365
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,800
and we'll get into what it was and everything.

366
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,560
But if you can imagine, there's, you know, a big section related to the

367
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,080
Shikah Shower scene like I do.

368
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,520
I remember as a kid that it felt risky or especially scary

369
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,600
to be like that. There are like a bunch of kids in the room watching the stuff

370
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,800
that is, you know, regardless of that, it wasn't actually bloody or whatever.

371
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,960
The scene is still very jarring.

372
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,840
And I think they I don't know how they conveyed this, but I think in some sense,

373
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,240
they tried to make this like designated a PG 13 attraction.

374
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,960
Like they kind of warn parents. Yeah.

375
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,960
I mean, you are seeing a live

376
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,320
depiction of a naked woman being stabbed.

377
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,440
Yeah. And they early before that, a 3D version

378
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,160
of the strangulation in Dial M for Murder, which is, you know,

379
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,760
thwarted by stabbing a man in the back with a pair of scissors.

380
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,560
Oh, OK. So yeah, all of that.

381
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,640
Yeah, that's all whether what regardless of what he's actually showing. Yeah.

382
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,200
Yeah. It's upsetting for a kid. Yeah.

383
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,200
I mean, I guess I mean, a lot of the rides would be upsetting for a scared kid.

384
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,160
But I'm trying to think, is there anything comparable like when Universal opens?

385
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,640
I mean, Jaws, there's blood, blood.

386
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,840
Yeah. Well, and when he gets like burn up, electrocuted, that is like jarring.

387
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,680
I think I would say a lot on the scale, at least certainly compared to Disney,

388
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,520
that a lot of the 1990 Universal was edgier, scarier.

389
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,120
I think that, you know, something maybe we'll talk about in the future

390
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,120
on a hot cast that that horror makeup show. Right.

391
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,800
With you, because that is the that is stuff from the fly in it.

392
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,680
And the fly is a very horrifying kid would not.

393
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,880
A young kid probably wouldn't or shouldn't be watching the fly. Yes.

394
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,320
So, yeah, they were they were obviously there's still a little more

395
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,120
comfortable scaring kids.

396
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,840
But yeah, back in the old days.

397
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,280
Yeah. Well, and this one, both suspenseful and a little scary and notable

398
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,320
among the opening day attractions, because it worked.

399
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,680
Sure. No. Yes.

400
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:59,360
The big ticket mechanical Jaws earthquake, King Kong fraught with problems.

401
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,960
But the shows that were produced probably for on a lower budget scale

402
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,840
that were clip reliant were more controllable than those did,

403
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,800
which I'm so fond of all of that.

404
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,040
We were debating about which one to do this year because there's that make

405
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,880
this the horror makeup show. There's murder.

406
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,480
She wrote. We'll get to all of it.

407
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,680
But I'm very fond of all of those.

408
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,480
Here's how movies are made from the early 90s.

409
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,680
It's interesting because this is I feel like this falls in with the Lucy attribute

410
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,040
to because it's like both of these people were dead for a while.

411
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh, Hitchcock was dead for 10 years before this open.

412
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,840
So it's like these are almost like nostalgia attractions.

413
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,360
Yeah. That were opened.

414
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,040
I'm trying to think of like an equivalent.

415
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,320
I guess it's like seeing Max from the goofy movie dancing now

416
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,840
during these Halloween events or something where it's like that's marketed

417
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,120
just to the older people.

418
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,200
They're probably. Yeah, that must be true.

419
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,760
Well, at least some of the classic Hitchcock's probably now in 2022

420
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,520
or as old as Goofy Goofy movie.

421
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,840
Yeah. Yes. What?

422
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,080
Goofy movie 95. Yeah.

423
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,920
So yeah, we're getting almost 30 year anniversary of Goofy movie.

424
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,000
Talking about. Shut up.

425
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,320
All of you shut up. Max Max is a younger millennial.

426
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,920
Yeah. We're closer to Jim.

427
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,080
Max has a lot of gigs like he's he's doing a lot of gigs

428
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,360
and he does freelance graphic design and he is interviewed

429
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,400
in that business insider like good luck millennials.

430
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,000
You'll never have a home, you fuck.

431
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,240
Yeah, that's nice to see.

432
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,840
Oh, yeah. Thank you for taunting us.

433
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,560
Articles once a week.

434
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,120
And my my trending topics underneath that were like Disney World.

435
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,520
And it's like, well, yeah.

436
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,840
Yeah. Well, well, well, is it though?

437
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,720
Because this week we're recording this is probably trending.

438
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,920
I know. I think I saw it before.

439
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,560
I think I saw when it was just like it's lightly raining

440
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,560
and people are in long way, you know, there are nice.

441
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,840
Yeah, there is the like everybody's huddled in the hotel

442
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,000
and they're putting on nice little like skits.

443
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,360
The country bears are hanging out playing in the arcade.

444
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,920
I saw today. That's fun.

445
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,360
They make they make good things.

446
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,000
But universal, the the the walls got torn up.

447
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,400
But then the whole.

448
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,160
Yeah, the rest of the year.

449
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,000
They got to they got to clone a new one.

450
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,560
Yeah, I looked psycho is 1960.

451
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,920
So it's 30 years from psycho to this.

452
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,040
Wow. Attraction opening.

453
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,600
So what's the stupidest thing from 1992 that we can say?

454
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,240
Good question. 1992.

455
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,160
Like babies kids come out a little early.

456
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,000
Hudson Hawk a little before that before to

457
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,040
bad movies.

458
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,240
1992 Cool World.

459
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
Cool World. Oh, cool.

460
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,280
Is this interesting?

461
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
I think it's I don't like the movie.

462
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,480
There's an interesting aesthetic to it for sure.

463
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,560
Or like Encino Man Encino Man, which also is a fun watch.

464
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,600
But Encino Man is as old today as psycho was when Universal.

465
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,280
Yeah, but she was.

466
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,440
But I feel like the Hitchcock movies didn't never dissipate,

467
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,880
either airing on TV or like, well, yeah, early video store classic

468
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,960
and universal to as DVDs, Blue Ray.

469
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,040
They have never let these movies dissipate.

470
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,960
They re-release them so often.

471
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,480
A lot of the Hitchcock movies are on Peacock and the others are like on HBO Max.

472
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,840
So you can see a lot of the filmography.

473
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,600
Yeah, yeah. And because I'm dumb,

474
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,160
I watched Psycho because I hadn't seen it a long time in the lead up to this.

475
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,200
But then I was like, oh, you know what? I really want to see Psycho 98

476
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,120
and Psycho 2.

477
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,720
I'm like halfway through Psycho 2.

478
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,960
If you can imagine, I'm having some sleep issues as well

479
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,080
when it comes to Psycho 2.

480
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,400
But this is a I mean, we could deal with this more down the road.

481
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
But I've always wondered what those movies are.

482
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,640
And so far, Psycho 2 is a lot of Norman Bates working at a diner.

483
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,280
And so he has to keep picking up knives and it's triggering to him.

484
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,760
So it's a lot of him like shaking a knife and not being able to cut a sandwich.

485
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,720
I'm trying to think, is it somebody like Quentin Tarantino

486
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,960
has some sort of wild opinion that like Psycho 2 is better or something.

487
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,640
And I can't remember if that's right.

488
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,960
I think for sure the people say the old like Omen or Exorcist 3 is good.

489
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,200
I've said this before, where there's like certain beliefs that like some of these

490
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,200
there's like like outlier sequels because all of these feel like trash.

491
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,240
Yeah, real. Yeah.

492
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,040
Because like what else should be the story of Psycho?

493
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,840
But like I think there's at least some opinion that one of these psycho

494
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,400
sequels is good and I forget which one it is.

495
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,800
You know, two is better than I thought so far.

496
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
I haven't finished it, so I don't know where it's going.

497
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,080
But I'm like, you know, a solid Dennis Franz performance.

498
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,520
Oh, wow. What's your name?

499
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,200
Meg Tilley is solid.

500
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,520
I'm like, it is not as trashy and stupid.

501
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,240
I watched the trailer for four.

502
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,760
I got to do it sequentially.

503
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,200
I'm not. I.

504
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,120
So I won't make it to four for a while.

505
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,440
But I was curious about that because that's one of the weird universal Orlando

506
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,800
connections to Hitchcock is that, you know, obviously the psycho house

507
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,160
is on the universal Hollywood back lot.

508
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:05,000
But Orlando has or had the house in the motel from Psycho 4.

509
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:11,200
And you ask, why did they need to rebuild it there when it's in Hollywood

510
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,920
and remains in Hollywood?

511
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,920
And then it was we were talking, Jason, about how there was that creepy

512
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,840
corner of the park, yes, where it turns into there's like a there's a weird

513
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,320
off park hard rock cafe, but you have to pass by the unsettling

514
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,280
fake psycho house to get there.

515
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:33,160
This I remember crystal clear standing looking at the psycho house and

516
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,720
that part of the park truly seems like looking back, I was staring

517
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,640
at a giant Rubik's Cube.

518
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,520
There was a hard rock park, very interesting building.

519
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,320
There was like shaped like a big guitar.

520
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,440
Yeah. And you could enter from outside the park or inside the park.

521
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,400
For some reason, something we love. We always love that.

522
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,680
Yeah. And I just we just blew right by it.

523
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,360
Like none of us.

524
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,560
We were more interested in the psycho house set.

525
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:06,000
My family and had no real connection to the hard rock cafe.

526
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,480
That would be your adulthood.

527
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,240
That would be a large part of a large part.

528
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,360
I mean, every time I go to a city, I get the shirt or and I get a pin.

529
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,600
I got a Jacksonville.

530
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,320
Yeah.

531
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:24,600
So it holds a weird place in my memory, which I think this show in general does,

532
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,880
because there is a gag, the gag at the end with the mother, the two Norma's.

533
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,520
I remember that clear clear as day.

534
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,120
Yeah.

535
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,280
Do you mean Norman or do you mean the mother?

536
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,040
No, the mother.

537
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,560
When there's two mothers at the end.

538
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,560
OK, yeah, right.

539
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,880
I I never forgot that.

540
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,720
Like when I went back to rewatch this, because there's a lot of versions of it

541
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,760
on YouTube, I was like that happened exactly.

542
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,280
As I remember the thing that I misremembered about this show

543
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,760
was that the Statue of Liberty thing is just when you're leaving.

544
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,880
I thought that was part of the finale, too.

545
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,640
Yes, it was part of the show in the little mini version in Hollywood,

546
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,480
which it gets confusing because we covered some of this a little

547
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,840
with the special effects stages with Carl Tartt a couple of years ago.

548
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,600
And I don't know what we covered in that.

549
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,240
So there might be repeating.

550
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,840
I'm not sure these micro versions they make us figure out.

551
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,720
And let's add to that complication, Psycho House off the table, its own episode.

552
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,080
Yes.

553
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,280
It's micro topic this, which includes also Norman Bates attacking the tram.

554
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,000
And by the time we do that, I will have watched all four psychos.

555
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,160
I'm pretty excited.

556
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,920
Yeah, we'll all do it.

557
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,160
All five, including the.

558
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,360
Oh, if 98 counts.

559
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:39,760
Yeah.

560
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,160
Sure.

561
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,440
Yes.

562
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,480
Show.

563
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,520
How long would that run?

564
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,640
Oh, boy. That round for a while.

565
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,600
Yeah, I didn't watch that either.

566
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
And then, yeah, I mean, there's going to be a little

567
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,880
There's going to be a little Psycho House Bates Motel talk on when we talk about Horror

568
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,480
Nights because they put up a whole thing around there with a new original universal character.

569
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,840
They add.

570
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,160
Yeah.

571
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,760
So there's a whole new mythology that they've built up.

572
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:07,400
It doesn't really fit with the Bates Motel, but they're repurposing those sets for this.

573
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,640
That's some of the coolest, like in the little bit that I've done Horror Nights, that you get to walk

574
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,960
right up to the set.

575
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,200
Yes.

576
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,920
So great.

577
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,120
Yeah.

578
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,920
You walk right by the rooms at the Bates Motel, then you walk up in front of the house.

579
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,880
That's amazing.

580
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,160
Yeah.

581
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,440
Yeah.

582
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,480
And I got to use it.

583
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,440
I won't say I don't say why, but I will say I got yelled at by the Norman Bates.

584
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,160
But like for a real reason.

585
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,080
Like more by the actor, you're saying?

586
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,320
Yeah.

587
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:32,400
Yeah.

588
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,760
The actor knew I was doing something I shouldn't have.

589
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,800
Not it's not crazy, but I'll say what it is when we talk about it.

590
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,120
Mother does not approve.

591
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:40,520
Yeah.

592
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,640
Before we get to the attraction, I wanted to talk a little about the Universal Hitchcock

593
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:54,360
Association and what made it like now Hitchcock is one of the big franchises that they can

594
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,200
bring to Universal Florida when it opens.

595
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,960
So Universal produced the TV show Alfred Hitchcock Presents.

596
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:08,560
So the famous silhouette and the music that was always under Universal.

597
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,920
He had a bungalow on the lot.

598
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,680
That was a big thing.

599
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,000
You always pointed out as a tour guide and no matter who's in there, I think it was

600
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,040
whatever Mark Platt productions is when I was doing it.

601
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,360
The silhouettes on the side of the window.

602
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,360
So it's like it feels like part of the Universal Hollywood DNA.

603
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,800
And he filmed a lot of movies there.

604
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,560
Like the birds, I think, filmed a ton on the lot.

605
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:37,480
Saboteur, I want to say, or at least Saboteur was a Universal movie, but not all of them

606
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:43,640
were Universal movies, which is what's a little confusing that Psycho, which you now associate

607
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:50,600
very hard with Universal, was made by Paramount or maybe he made he might have made it on

608
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,920
his own and then they and then Paramount distributed.

609
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,600
Yeah. So it's a little confusing.

610
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,800
Why is there so much Psycho and it's on the lot?

611
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,960
So you really associate them.

612
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:06,360
And I believe it's that like so Hitchcock made movies kind of everywhere, but then it

613
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,200
consolidated at Universal at some point like his production company.

614
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,600
He basically he sold Universal a bunch of movies that they did not make.

615
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,880
Rope, Rear Window, Man Who Knew Too Much, Vertigo, a bunch of other ones.

616
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,760
And I believe Psycho and he did this in 1964.

617
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:29,280
And in doing so, like in exchange, he became the third largest shareholder in MCA, the

618
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,480
parent company of the universe.

619
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,640
So like major, major deal.

620
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,280
I didn't realize he was so invested in it and probably the family still.

621
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,280
I who knows, but like at least in 1990, it was like, well, Hitchcock is like super

622
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,680
intertwined with this company.

623
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,760
Yeah, we need like, yeah, he does.

624
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,480
He didn't get the Spielberg deal or anything, I guess, because it wasn't the theme park

625
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,560
yet, really. But the Spielberg deal and that he was like that he still like makes money

626
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,560
from the park. Yeah, somehow.

627
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,560
Yeah, but me. I don't know.

628
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:02,360
That's be interesting because there's still stuff of his who knows what exactly the deal

629
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,120
was when you sell all of it.

630
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,160
And does it still?

631
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,440
Well, I mean, they still are.

632
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,880
Right. So like the franchises they still own in the movies and they're on Peacock, like

633
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:15,680
Jason said. But yeah, does there any when you retire the ride to those benefits?

634
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:21,160
All the yeah, all the everyone standing at all the old rock and roll guys are signing

635
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,960
these big deals now for their whole catalogs.

636
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,880
But some of them have different like some of them are just a blanket signing over their

637
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,120
catalog for a bunch of money.

638
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,840
And then the whoever buys it can do literally whatever they want.

639
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,120
And then some people are like selling Neil Young is like half sold his and he still gets

640
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,120
like kind of a say. OK, what's going on with it?

641
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,360
And maybe is when he dies, the estate will.

642
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,720
So I wonder, like all these interesting deals straight to commercials like we've been

643
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,040
waiting so many goddamn years to Ohio.

644
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,400
We're going to embarrass the hell out of him from beyond the grave.

645
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,720
Cortez, the killer in a Chili's commercial.

646
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,040
Cortez, the killer fajitas.

647
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,640
Old man, take a look at your life.

648
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,320
Is that him? That's yeah.

649
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,200
That's him just over an Applebee's commercial with like check out Father's Day's

650
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,960
Bud Light special big Bud Lights for three dollars.

651
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,960
Take your old man's had a look at his life with.

652
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,200
That's what's going to happen.

653
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,400
Some chili peppers.

654
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,440
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, these are clearly big ticket items.

655
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,880
All these live. It's a little scary, like watching everybody cash out.

656
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,640
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Bob Dylan cashed out for what?

657
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,640
Like 500 million, like something 500 million or something, I think.

658
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,080
He was one of the first ones I feel like was high profile.

659
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:37,480
But yeah, they're all cashing out right now for just an insane sum.

660
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:43,080
So like a horrible corporation can use these now for the rest of time, I guess.

661
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,920
Don't know. One of them should sell the catalogs to Universal because we know what happens.

662
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,280
Oh, yeah. Universal has all the musicians.

663
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,320
Oh, master recordings. Oh, yeah.

664
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,320
Sorry. I just have to mention.

665
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,040
Get well, Jimmy Buffett, whatever happened.

666
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,120
He had to postpone concerts for like six months.

667
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,720
Oh, yeah.

668
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,080
Oh, got well, Jimmy.

669
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,680
This will that would if anything happened, God forbid.

670
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,200
Suddenly you get the heaviest podcast, the ride.

671
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,560
I don't think we've ever done a one a 90 minutes of solemn.

672
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,080
Oh, we will.

673
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,920
Suddenly, it's the most solid.

674
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,640
We'll edit out the jokes if there were even jokes.

675
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,520
Well, we'll we might try jokes throughout and then you kind of like snap at us like, hey,

676
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,720
cut the shit. Not today.

677
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,200
Not today. Or, you know, maybe I'll just do that one alone.

678
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,040
We've never done.

679
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,880
I know. 90 minutes alone.

680
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,640
Just need to work some thoughts out.

681
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,640
So, you know, he postponed some concerts, I think, till March, Vegas and March.

682
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,080
So I guess we got to March.

683
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,160
Well, we're going to go back and celebrate the return to the road.

684
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,600
Welcome the king back.

685
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,960
Yeah. Hopefully, Deuces are Wild Tour still happening then, too, because Deuces.

686
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,240
You know, they're not Steven Tyler's out of rehab back back in Vegas

687
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,600
for the Deuces are Wild Tour.

688
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,760
Is it currently happening?

689
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,120
Currently happening. Yes.

690
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,400
Oh, boy. I'm so sorry you're stuck with your daughter.

691
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,720
Right. Right now, I'm trying not to get COVID again.

692
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,040
So probably not the pit at the Deuces are Wild.

693
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,280
Las Vegas Aerosmith Residency is the place I should be.

694
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,560
But, you know, she can get vaccinated at six months.

695
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,800
So maybe the day after.

696
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,840
All right. And shot. And Mike takes off.

697
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,200
That's right. I'm going for like a month.

698
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,400
Needle ignition. Hey, this is good.

699
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,240
It's fully strong two hours later. Right.

700
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,560
No, sir. Two weeks.

701
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,680
It's like, I can't hear you. I just heard two.

702
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,040
Got to get to a Bob Hope Airport.

703
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,800
I'm on the phone. You can hear in the background.

704
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,520
I'm back in the saddle again.

705
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,880
Over the over the sounds of your weeping.

706
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,520
Yeah. I'm here.

707
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:48,000
Talking about music, I was surprised in this attraction that they don't.

708
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,720
I feel like music is a big part of Hitchcock movies,

709
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,800
the psycho theme, the North by Northwest theme and the vertical vertical music.

710
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:02,160
And I feel like usually they mention nowadays

711
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,080
if they make an attraction like this, they they toss a cursory

712
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,080
mention to a collaborator.

713
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,600
But I didn't see any of that or no mention of Saul Bass's famous title

714
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,040
sequences, the defunct land on this shout out has the Saul Bass,

715
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,880
the defunct credit likes all that.

716
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,000
Yeah. Right. Yeah.

717
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,480
He's based. The family said no.

718
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,000
It was about one man about the family.

719
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,280
Fuck off, Bernard. Fuck off, Harry.

720
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,120
He didn't write these movies.

721
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,760
Yeah. Yeah. We don't hear about writers, really.

722
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,920
The I mean, I get what I was driving at, maybe with like so big things

723
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,760
happen in 64.

724
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,160
One is that merger and he owns a bunch of the company now.

725
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,880
And the other thing is that the Universal Tram Tour opens in earnest.

726
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,520
Like there were ways to tour the studio, but the trams and the big pink

727
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,960
glamour trams, that's new in 64.

728
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,720
And think about a time before Jaws, before Earthquake, before any of that.

729
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,560
What is the biggest thing on that tour?

730
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,120
It's the psycho house.

731
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,720
So that's opening day attraction on the tour, which probably cements

732
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,880
psycho as being iconic.

733
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,760
And it's also like the beginnings, I think, of the Universal brand,

734
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,560
where it's like this is like current recent relevant movies were made here.

735
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,920
You recognize that set, you know, it's so well.

736
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,680
And it's a big director that you a regular person know, like, you know,

737
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,040
with the association with Spielberg or Ron Howard or whatever.

738
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,560
So I feel like Hitchcock and Universal Studios in Hitchcock being so married,

739
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,560
it really like that's what Universal becomes a little bit.

740
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,080
And a big another big step in that,

741
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,160
I feel, is the brief era where Alfred Hitchcock became

742
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,600
not just associated with the brand, but the face of the brand.

743
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Yeah, this is one of the big things to talk about.

744
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,480
I think we were excited to talk about.

745
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,240
Don't know when sometime in the mid 70s, but he at least for one commercial,

746
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,400
I couldn't find if there were more.

747
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,560
Do you guys find like you saw the one?

748
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,840
No, I saw the one.

749
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,560
Yeah, I don't know if there was more.

750
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,680
I always thought there were that he made a bunch of them,

751
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,160
but there was only this one that I could find.

752
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,360
So he was like he was a Colonel Sanders for a minute.

753
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,000
It's fantastic.

754
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,840
For Universal Studios, you know, like he's he obviously liked the spotlight.

755
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,960
He liked being Mr.

756
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,400
On camera. Yeah.

757
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,400
In the same way that any of these people, even though you'd be like,

758
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,040
oh, well, they're just behind the scenes when you get older, you go,

759
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,240
well, they're they loved it.

760
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,120
Like he he was in every movie.

761
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,320
He did cameo in every movie way before Stan Lee was doing it.

762
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,600
You know, way before Tyka, my law or fight.

763
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,680
I wish Hitchcock would have rift a little bit.

764
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,880
But if Hitchcock could have ripped,

765
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,840
if you could have mocapped like a court like character from Ragnarok,

766
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,280
like Thor as a very slow talk, slow speaking Englishman who's with him.

767
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,680
So that just happened.

768
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,800
Awkward.

769
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,760
It would be funny.

770
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,840
Is that even a thing?

771
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,040
It'd be funny to see.

772
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,120
Oh, hold on. Sorry.

773
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,960
So sorry. Sorry.

774
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,480
No, please. No, no.

775
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,480
You got to go. OK, OK.

776
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:09,840
Here we go.

777
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,000
It's good for fly.

778
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,760
They see you know, I had to say it.

779
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,040
I had to cut you off.

780
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,440
Sure. No, that's fine.

781
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,680
I was just going to say a very stoic like Jolly Thor, like with the,

782
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:30,000
you know, Apple on his head and like the knife throughout the knife,

783
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,320
like being thrown right next to his ear.

784
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,880
Yeah. Like in some of those gags.

785
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:38,080
Oh, so let's let's get to this.

786
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,600
Let's see Alfred Hitchcock himself extolling the virtues

787
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,160
of going to Universal Studios Hollywood.

788
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,360
Good evening.

789
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:52,480
Welcome to Universal Studios, where you learn Hollywood secrets.

790
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,880
Music. Fantastic.

791
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,680
And now you'll learn the secrets of the six million dollar man

792
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,800
and the bionic woman on the Universal Studios tour.

793
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,400
So a lot of that when there was just music playing,

794
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,640
we're cutting to all the fun, you know, the kooky characters,

795
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,840
the cowboys and jaws with the big insane teeth, the jaws used to have

796
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,080
and Frankenstein.

797
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,720
But then the the meat of it is that and promoting the new.

798
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,560
Yes, I don't even.

799
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,240
The six million dollar man feels like a different universe than Alfred Hitchcock.

800
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,520
Oh, yeah. And say those words.

801
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,040
Yeah, it does. It feels like he because when you're a kid, you

802
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,560
I've said this before, I you're confused even maybe about like exactly

803
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,600
the like eras these things were made.

804
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,400
Yeah. But Alfred Hitchcock feels like a hundred years before

805
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,720
the six million dollar man.

806
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,880
So it's funny to see him because you're like, oh, yeah, he was alive

807
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,240
until what? 1980.

808
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,400
He died in 80, but he directed a family plot was like 76.

809
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,320
Yeah. Like a handful of movies in the 70s.

810
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,640
He had some less good movies.

811
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,000
Those. Yeah, I don't.

812
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,640
I don't think those are as well.

813
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,880
I've seen family plot like ages ago.

814
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,320
I feel like I at different ages, I would get into different Hitchcock things.

815
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,480
We watched Psycho when I was younger.

816
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,520
When I was in high school, I watched Vertigo in college.

817
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,160
It was like North by Northwest and Shadow of a Doubt.

818
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,480
And then Rope. Oh, and film school.

819
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,720
People were obsessed with Rope.

820
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,560
Yeah. Right.

821
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,320
Worryous of notorious.

822
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,880
I haven't seen it. There's a handfly.

823
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,080
Oh, you would love that.

824
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,640
I yeah, I want to see that one.

825
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,440
Also, James, Jason, your guy.

826
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,480
I love Claude Rainey.

827
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,960
Guy is Claude Rainey.

828
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,240
Hitchcock started so long.

829
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,600
He started in silent films, but also he made the 1935 Man Who Knew Too Much.

830
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,200
And then he made it again.

831
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,800
He made it twice with Jimmy Stewart.

832
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,800
I've seen one of those.

833
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,600
I think I've seen the Jimmy Stewart one.

834
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,760
And when I was listening movies quickly, did I say man who knew too little?

835
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,000
Does anyone have? It's very easy.

836
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,240
I like that is again because I'm stupid.

837
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,280
That might the Bill Murray movie might be more on the tip of my.

838
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,480
That might have passed.

839
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,440
Maybe I'm wrong, but maybe in half an hour ago, I said man who knew too little.

840
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,680
And nobody called it out.

841
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,200
I'm a little sleepy, so it's right by me.

842
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,120
Well, check the tape. I just oh, I boy.

843
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,560
Well, hey, I caught it.

844
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,440
I owned up to it if it happened.

845
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,560
Look, the lifeblood of podcasting is going

846
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,400
calling out when someone mixes up an aphorism or going,

847
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,280
how do you say that word?

848
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,560
Say that again.

849
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,640
We've done it to you.

850
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,360
Yeah, I see you every single episode on other shows.

851
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,760
So it makes me feel a little better.

852
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,760
Junker not chaperone.

853
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,520
I chaperone.

854
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:44,320
I'm talking about when I am not the only one who says I think that's a reason.

855
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,360
Some of it is like, yeah, like a regional thing that I've just never heard.

856
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,040
But yeah, anyway, no, that happens all the time.

857
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,800
Yeah. Oh, excuse me.

858
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,240
What did you mean?

859
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,200
You motherfucker. I'm getting your ass.

860
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,280
What do you mean?

861
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,440
You call it a Hasek instead of an Ottoman. Yeah.

862
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,520
Destroy him.

863
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:07,720
You got I think you said you did that to me in like 2010 or 2009.

864
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,320
We were like doing an improv scene.

865
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,640
You're like, what the fuck?

866
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,560
In the scene. Literally not known.

867
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,320
Yeah. No, you need to know to do an improv scene.

868
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,560
If you suggested an item that I'm not familiar with, it was never.

869
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,320
I was just a thing.

870
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,840
I think it was just an old timey phrase, a word that stuck around in the family.

871
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,840
And it wasn't until I was much older.

872
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,960
People were like, what did you call that?

873
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,280
What was the word? Do we know Hasek?

874
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,520
Oh, that was that Hasek was in an impasse versus Ottoman.

875
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,000
Oh, that was a real thing.

876
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,520
Yeah. This was this like happening.

877
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,440
I never forgot. Yeah.

878
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,080
That happened.

879
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,120
Let me go back to the Jordan.

880
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,320
Can you pull up the video again?

881
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,680
I might make you like, OK, you well, you have one of the frames.

882
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,680
The hop ready that I yes.

883
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,160
So well, first things first, hearing him say it is weird as it sounds to us.

884
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,280
It's clearly weird for him to say this six million dollar man.

885
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,800
Bizarre word to stress.

886
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,960
Yeah, I hate to cut you off, but it's a guy's like,

887
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,960
well, let's see what Gilligan and the Skipper are up to.

888
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,160
Like it doesn't it feels like he shouldn't be associated with the trash of TV. Yeah.

889
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,880
Is he a love boat?

890
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,320
Is he? Yeah. Is he like, I am wrong, but I could be wrong.

891
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,240
I am the cruise director.

892
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,840
Activity start every day at 8 a.m. on the Lido deck.

893
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,840
A couple is having quite the marital issue.

894
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,040
It will take a lot of drinks to.

895
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,640
So what's the bartender's name? Isaac. Isaac.

896
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,760
Get on it, Isaac.

897
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,080
I know that fact.

898
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,120
I know you are basic geography.

899
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,880
Do you have my back on that one?

900
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,600
So the frame that we're looking at for people who are just listening,

901
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,800
he is like flying and he's clearly flying in this like theme parky

902
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:55,640
where an effect that they can replicate very easily in front of an audience

903
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,000
where you fly by just standing straight and then the camera moves you to the next place.

904
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,560
So seeing this very stilted hitchcock flight is so funny.

905
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,800
And then when he lands, he gives this look.

906
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,680
He immediately breaks commitment and looks off frame like, was that it?

907
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,720
Can I stop acting like a fool?

908
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,080
Look how defeated he is.

909
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:22,360
He does. Well, I think he likes like talking to camera and being on camera,

910
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,880
but he likes that genteel nature.

911
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,920
And I think he felt stupid doing what they made him do.

912
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,880
I think he probably did.

913
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,360
But on some level, he still wanted to be a star.

914
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,800
Yeah, I could be super.

915
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,160
I hear they're making a new Superman.

916
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,120
I'm Cal.

917
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,440
Christopher Reeve is no match for me.

918
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:48,000
Yeah, I know I'm on death's door, but if they just let me screen test.

919
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,680
I'm an ailing old creep, but I could be Superman.

920
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,080
I think Universal probably owes a lot of.

921
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:01,840
I feel like Universal rides with like a little bit of bodyness

922
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,800
and a little bit of darkness when they work best.

923
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:09,280
Like I'll toss out like the fake mummy, you know, unloading sequence

924
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,000
and the rumors and the fire, I think are of a piece with like

925
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,360
kind of the comedy in Hitchcock.

926
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,400
Does that make sense?

927
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,840
Or like the comedy and like that his intros and stuff

928
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,280
and like his weird little darkly funny or darkly funny.

929
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,840
The check movies are horny.

930
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,360
They vary horny.

931
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:35,280
He's a British guy who nailed the American it's like can

932
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,920
can regular people be pushed to do evil things like murder and also

933
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,920
what are they like when they're dangerously horny for blonde white women?

934
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,760
Like he got our ass like he got the Republican Party platform.

935
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,120
That's true. 22.

936
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,280
It was also he was living it because he was freaking out.

937
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,000
What's her name?

938
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,600
Are freaking out is an understatement with Tippi Hedren or something.

939
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,680
I think. Yeah, yes.

940
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,600
You said I so he had been doing Kim Novak, even everyone.

941
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,920
But his movies are all yeah, like his movies are all the what you just

942
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,240
like the the universal playbook body.

943
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,640
Yeah. Violent.

944
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,880
It's anyone called Hitchcock's movies.

945
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,720
Body.

946
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,400
Yeah.

947
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,760
Well, again, Jason said I let it slide, but I'm like, we just say body now.

948
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,800
He said without being stopped.

949
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,720
He body.

950
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,000
I said body for you there.

951
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,360
What would you when Jimmy Stewart in rear window is discussing the brazier

952
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,640
that what's your name is working on?

953
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,640
You would call that a little body.

954
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,400
Little body.

955
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,680
The body is joke.

956
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,520
North by Northwest, which I like in college.

957
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,840
Even even I at the time of like a freshman college is like, come on, man.

958
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,920
There's that so many gags of him going to kiss the love interest.

959
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,320
And then a train goes into a tunnel.

960
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,760
This happens multiple times in the movie.

961
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,880
I see. I see. I guess that I got away with it

962
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,800
because trains are like the third lead in this movie.

963
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,920
I just I swear the two of you are double handedly

964
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,920
keeping the word body alive in this century.

965
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:12,280
Yeah, I think this word is retired if not for you two guys.

966
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,800
I wonder if Hitchcock ever said it in one of his intros on the TV show.

967
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,800
It sounds like a word he would say.

968
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,920
It's of his era.

969
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,840
Maybe that deserves a good I was looking for his appearance

970
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,400
to see if he was that he was on like What's My Line and stuff.

971
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,000
He was on like talk shows.

972
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,560
He's on some weird. He's not going to.

973
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,800
They're guessing him immediately on what's my.

974
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,280
You think he can't do a voice?

975
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,760
You think he can't hide that voice?

976
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,000
My name is your Alfred Hitchcock.

977
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,320
It's Alfred Hitchcock.

978
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,360
I work in an entertainment sector.

979
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,760
Hitchcock, get out of here.

980
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,600
I'm interested in murder.

981
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,080
Oh, yeah. Yeah. All right.

982
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,480
We know who it is. Yeah.

983
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,440
Do you have you considered bleaching your hair?

984
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,000
I do see a headline, Alfred Hitchcock's body game with the vertigo.

985
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,760
So somewhat people have associated Hitchcock with bodyness before.

986
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,600
A hundred percent.

987
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:08,120
Look, their movies are a little body, a little body, I would say. Yeah.

988
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,800
Would you agree they were a little bodies?

989
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,160
I think so. Yeah.

990
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,760
Sorry, new listeners.

991
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,360
We're sorry we lost you.

992
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,600
Yeah. So if you've turned it off now because of all the body talk, we apologize.

993
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,600
What were you going to say? Oh, you were looking up cameos.

994
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,520
Oh, yeah. Just saying I didn't see him on Love Boat.

995
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,120
I just saw he was on some talk show.

996
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:27,920
You know, a Tom Snyder show he was on, but he did not do like a guest spot.

997
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,800
But this silly him flying around is really funny.

998
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,480
Oh, boy. There's a billion dollar man.

999
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,160
I wish there were a ton of these and I wish he was still around today

1000
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,960
to talk about her new things on the universal.

1001
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,560
Oh, we all have to make sure to vote.

1002
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,920
Covid boosters are available in the city.

1003
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,560
What? Walking by Vailen,

1004
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,920
the Covid boosters by Vailen.

1005
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:05,280
Check out the new universe store with custom items

1006
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,920
from all three pitch perfect movies.

1007
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,600
Is the song when I'm going back pitches?

1008
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,440
Yes. Albert Hitchcock doing the cover.

1009
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,840
Albert Hitchcock singing cups when I'm gone.

1010
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,680
When I'm gone, you're going to miss me.

1011
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,920
You're and I'm gone.

1012
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,160
But then it's like the slow clack,

1013
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,480
clack, clack.

1014
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,600
All right. Well, that song is 48 minutes now.

1015
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,080
They should just have an actor play him.

1016
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,640
Why are they not doing that?

1017
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,520
Let's just have an actor doing playing him on the commercial.

1018
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:48,120
It would make so much sense to have a walk around Hitchcock in Universal Studios.

1019
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,040
They never did that. They should have.

1020
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:54,080
Yeah. Because Lucy, you can I don't I haven't seen Lucy walking around lately

1021
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,240
at Universal, but a couple of years ago, there was a walk around Lucy still.

1022
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,760
There was a Charlie Chaplin.

1023
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,160
Yeah. Was there a Groucho maybe at some point?

1024
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,000
Oh, maybe. I'm not sure that would I guess.

1025
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,560
He I guess he seems more famous than Groucho,

1026
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,320
at least more in the modern sense.

1027
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,280
I could be totally wrong.

1028
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,960
But Groucho was a performer.

1029
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,240
So sure. Yes.

1030
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,600
And he did a lot of TV later.

1031
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,480
And that's the old Groucho old Groucho.

1032
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,160
He was a totally different guy.

1033
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,040
Also pretty can't talk about old Groucho.

1034
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:21,960
Oh, man.

1035
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,960
He did enough groucho.

1036
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,880
Gilbert got it on the billboard Groucho impression

1037
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,120
where he was just like so slow by the end.

1038
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,360
He was like such a fast talking guy in all the movies.

1039
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,080
And then he was just so slow on like Johnny Carson's like Jerry Lewis.

1040
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,880
Like that's that other era where he's just like a different person.

1041
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,440
Mothball. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1042
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,720
And I understand your age, but then people like live in that for decades.

1043
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,480
Yeah. Slow version of themselves.

1044
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,760
It's wild this way that can swing, because like I feel like Orson Welles

1045
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,680
sounded the same forever.

1046
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,840
Mm hmm. The 30s to the 80s.

1047
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,440
You know, Orson Welles should have done commercials for Universal.

1048
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:02,120
Gee, like there is a theme park, California theme park.

1049
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,120
Now they've screwed me on a couple pictures.

1050
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,000
So I'm going to be up front with you on that.

1051
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,560
There's still you just find so much weird Orson Welles stuff like you.

1052
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,960
He's like this talk show that he did.

1053
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:13,880
Have you ever seen any of that?

1054
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,480
We're never getting out of this episode.

1055
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,320
I know. I'm sorry.

1056
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,440
Say what is it? Go, go, go.

1057
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,520
Orson Welles' talk show that didn't really work

1058
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,520
where he's like obviously drunk.

1059
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:26,000
And I think Jim Henson was on an episode like fascinating old Orson Welles clips.

1060
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,760
He had his own talk show. Yeah.

1061
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,080
I don't remember that one.

1062
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,240
Some of it's on YouTube.

1063
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,480
I forget if it's just the pilot or if there's more.

1064
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,840
There is a pilot for like a Twilight Zone

1065
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:40,560
esc Alfred Hitchcock presents esc show he did that is so cool and weird.

1066
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,000
And I forget what it's called, but it's really good.

1067
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,240
And it's out there.

1068
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,600
I forget if I'm mixing up with the was Jim Henson or not,

1069
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,720
but for sure it was the Orson Welles show.

1070
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:56,760
And he's got a big Bert Reynolds on one of the episode.

1071
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,240
They're wearing matching suits and shirts.

1072
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,160
Big open black red.

1073
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,520
That's weird as hell.

1074
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,600
Yeah. In front of just giant photos of Bert.

1075
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,120
He doesn't have a desk or anything.

1076
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:11,240
It's sort of like what was Merv Griffin like that or like a daytime talk show.

1077
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,080
Why are they wearing the same?

1078
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,400
I don't know if they mentioned it.

1079
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,560
I can't remember.

1080
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,800
Was it on purpose or does that just did everyone just wear blazers

1081
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,200
and then red butterfly?

1082
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,880
You got to go home and watch this.

1083
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,680
You're showing a very intimate shot with a spotlight behind him.

1084
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,720
It looks like a frame from the Brady Bunch variety.

1085
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,000
Or like it's Lauren Sanderson singing a ballad.

1086
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:33,600
Days recording days after Johnny Knoxville show,

1087
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,160
they did a jackass episode of Family Feud and Johnny Knoxville

1088
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,640
wore the same suit that Steve Harvey wore.

1089
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,400
Yeah.

1090
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,400
Oh, that's fun.

1091
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,600
So I don't know if that was the gag or that was just an accident.

1092
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,600
Everybody in the 70s had the open red shirt, red dress shirt,

1093
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,640
and then a suit jacket.

1094
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,000
Yeah, could have been coincidence.

1095
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,600
Anyway, point is Hitchcock incredibly tied to Universal Studios.

1096
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:03,600
So by the time Universal Florida opens 1990, you got to get him in.

1097
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,280
And we get this show.

1098
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,160
Again, Alfred Hitchcock's The Art of Making Movies,

1099
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:15,560
but alternately called The Art of Alfred Hitchcock or Hitchcock's 3D

1100
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,320
Theater.

1101
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,040
There was a 3D component of this.

1102
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,160
There was a 3D film that you watched that was one of the scenes of it,

1103
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,400
which I believe, somewhere saying, this

1104
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,360
might have been the first 3D movie on Universal property.

1105
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,840
So you have this to blame.

1106
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:36,640
Like a dealer giving an 18-year-old a taste of cocaine.

1107
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,880
It's going to be a hook for life.

1108
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,680
Are you crazy?

1109
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,180
Of course.

1110
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,640
And it was replaced by a 3D movie as well.

1111
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,520
One of the finest.

1112
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:46,280
Yes, this is the space for stellar cinematic achievements

1113
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,360
because it gave way to Shrek 4D.

1114
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,360
To Shrek 4D.

1115
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,000
Shrek 4D, Shrek, and Donkey R.

1116
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,840
Somebody once told me the world is not your roadie.

1117
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,360
What is it?

1118
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:57,880
Roadie?

1119
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,080
Somebody once told me the world is going to roll me?

1120
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,120
It's going to roll.

1121
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,440
I thought it was the world is not your roadie.

1122
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,720
That's what I was about to say.

1123
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,040
Oh, no, that's not the lyric.

1124
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:06,540
OK.

1125
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,000
This MF said this world is your roadie.

1126
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,800
Go ahead.

1127
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,600
Get his ass.

1128
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,440
Blast me.

1129
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,320
The world is not your roadie.

1130
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,560
But in order to go in order through this attraction, of course,

1131
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,960
outside, you're looking at the famous silhouette.

1132
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,280
In thinking about the silhouette, I was like,

1133
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,000
if someone drew my silhouette and that's how it looked,

1134
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,760
I would be furious.

1135
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,480
This is what you think of me.

1136
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,120
I do have kind of big cheeks, so I

1137
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,600
would be concerned about that.

1138
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,360
It is like the joke of like the Simpsons joke where Lisa gets

1139
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,320
the caricature drawn of her on the boardwalk,

1140
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,040
and it's just like everything, like all the features,

1141
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,040
or everything that you would want.

1142
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,320
She thinks she's ugly because of it.

1143
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:47,920
Oh, all the insecurities.

1144
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,760
So it does seem like perhaps that is.

1145
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,800
But I think also he's got some say.

1146
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,440
I bet he likes it.

1147
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,400
I think he likes it.

1148
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,200
He probably likes it.

1149
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,960
Hitchcock likes it.

1150
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,320
I wish he was alive just so we could ask him,

1151
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:04,240
what do you think about the big Ted statue next to your silhouette

1152
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,160
on the bungalow?

1153
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,280
Is that what's there now?

1154
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:10,840
I think it's either Ted or it might be like the Hasbro.

1155
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,000
Like Hasbro might have taken over that bungalow.

1156
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,600
Oh, there was a Mr. Potato head at some point.

1157
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,680
At some point, there's a Mr. Potato head

1158
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:21,920
next to the Mr. Potato head of 20th century American film.

1159
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,000
I think you'd be proud of everything that's

1160
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,920
been made on the Universal lot for the many years since his

1161
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,520
pat, you know?

1162
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,040
I think Hitch should be proud.

1163
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:37,240
When I want to relax, I just put on my HD DVD of Evan Almighty.

1164
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,840
That's the one I went to too because my first summer

1165
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,760
as a tour guide, it took over everything.

1166
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,320
It was all over the lot, and we had to talk about it so much.

1167
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,840
And then it came out, and we had to talk about it so much.

1168
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:48,840
Yeah.

1169
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,560
Yeah.

1170
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,360
Psycho, Strangers on a Train, Evan Almighty.

1171
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,000
There it is.

1172
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,640
Oh, wow.

1173
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,400
Hey, Jerry Fett.

1174
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,960
There's the Hasbro bungalow.

1175
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,440
Wow.

1176
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,520
I didn't make up a Mr. Potato head, which

1177
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,600
is weird because Mr. Potato head's at Disneyland, as we know,

1178
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,760
or California Adventure.

1179
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:09,680
But he's owned by his movie rights for his own solo movies.

1180
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,640
Well, and remember, Scott and I stumbled upon the Potato Head

1181
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,600
Kids recently as well, a cartoon that I did not know existed.

1182
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:16,920
Yeah.

1183
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,240
You haven't watched it since?

1184
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,960
Believe it or not, I haven't watched it since.

1185
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,440
But there was a cartoon where Potato Head had a bunch of kids.

1186
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,400
Wow.

1187
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,640
Like in the 80s.

1188
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,240
Then they all look like turds.

1189
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,320
Oh, I remember this.

1190
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,400
Yeah, I kind of remember.

1191
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:29,920
See?

1192
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,760
The turds of this.

1193
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:31,400
The turd kids.

1194
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,680
Oh, it's that turd kid show.

1195
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:38,080
Anyway, you get inside, and there is a, I remember the lobby.

1196
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,560
I remember the lobby very strongly.

1197
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:45,680
There was this big collage, not just a flat collage, but very 3D.

1198
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,680
This is like, I had to be there to remember.

1199
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,440
But I have this faint kid memory because I was scared by it.

1200
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,040
It was like black and white with hints of color.

1201
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,800
And then there's film reels with all the names of all of his movies,

1202
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,760
but then kind of like surreal, grotesque stuff.

1203
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,560
Here's big chattering teeth or a big spiral swirl

1204
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:09,200
or big handcuffs and a big crazy hand.

1205
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,640
This was neat, I remember.

1206
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,680
And I remember thinking it felt very Nickelodeon.

1207
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,640
And then I was looking into it, and this sculpture collage,

1208
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,600
whatever you want to call it, was made by somebody

1209
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,440
named Diane Stapleton, who was the art director of Roundhouse

1210
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,040
and Wienerville.

1211
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,160
Wow.

1212
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,720
So I guess worked in Orlando.

1213
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:31,440
And so like, yeah, because it felt like that double dare aesthetic,

1214
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,600
like a big crazy moldy hand where you felt that somebody just

1215
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,800
made it themselves.

1216
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:40,400
Cut me off after 45 seconds here, but I saw Wienerville live.

1217
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,880
I saw Mark Wiener perform live at a racetrack.

1218
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,240
A racetrack?

1219
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,600
But that's too far away.

1220
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,360
Racetracks have terrible vision.

1221
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,360
I couldn't see very well.

1222
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,120
Visibility.

1223
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,640
But if you know what Wienerville is, it was a weird show

1224
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,760
with a guy who put his head through a little hole,

1225
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,400
and it would make characters look like they were tiny.

1226
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,640
Yeah, I liked it.

1227
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,760
It made me a little anxious.

1228
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:03,640
Yeah.

1229
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,880
I think I bought into it too much.

1230
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,920
You thought it was real?

1231
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,040
Well, I was like, they're going to turn the Studio On members back,

1232
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:12,920
right?

1233
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,640
They can't just leave them like that.

1234
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:15,520
How old were you?

1235
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,280
Too old, Michael.

1236
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,440
You know what he's talking about?

1237
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,120
Too young to watch Psycho.

1238
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,480
Too old to believe the logic.

1239
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,800
He puppetified people, you're saying?

1240
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,000
Well, you would be standing up, and then it

1241
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,160
would look like you were shrinking down to puppet.

1242
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,760
Because you'd put your head through a hole

1243
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,560
to make it look like.

1244
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,760
Put your head through a hole.

1245
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,720
Like this.

1246
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:34,240
Yes.

1247
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:34,760
Yeah, yeah.

1248
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,000
Wienerville, of course.

1249
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,760
But they would say so much, like we're going to Wienerfy.

1250
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,760
Probably not that.

1251
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,960
It was Wienerfy?

1252
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,520
They would turn you into, we're going to turn you into a thing.

1253
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,120
And I'm just like, oh my god.

1254
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,440
Was it Wienerize?

1255
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,680
The word Wienerize is like, smirking out

1256
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,720
of the distant recesses of my brain.

1257
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,240
Impossible.

1258
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,640
Well, we'll do a Wienerville episode.

1259
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,560
Again, I don't want to get off, again, too many intangents today.

1260
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:01,080
Yes, so to get in, anyway, I just remember,

1261
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,960
I remember this entire thing, by the way,

1262
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,360
just being so moody, feeling very adult.

1263
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,440
I probably saw it when I was nine years old.

1264
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,240
And I felt, I was just like scared by all of it,

1265
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,320
but also impressed by it.

1266
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:17,800
And I love, I think in both the Hollywood, the mini version,

1267
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,920
and the bigger one in Orlando, I think they did a good job of like,

1268
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:25,600
here's a little film school lesson that theme park tourists can access

1269
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,200
and go, oh, that's cool.

1270
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,520
So that's how we did it.

1271
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,400
Yeah, I did not see this.

1272
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,560
I didn't go to Universal till I was older.

1273
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:35,040
We were still like brand loyal for some weird reason

1274
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,440
if we went to Orlando.

1275
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,840
Even though my mom loved Alfred Hitchcock,

1276
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,880
it wasn't like, oh, there's an Alfred Hitchcock,

1277
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,520
we should go over 25 minutes away to go to this thing.

1278
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,400
So I'm seeing it all for the first time.

1279
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,360
But we would have gone nuts for it, I'm sure, if we had seen it.

1280
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,480
So you didn't see it in person or maybe later?

1281
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,960
No, I never saw it.

1282
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,840
I just never, yeah, did not see it in person.

1283
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,120
Do you see this in person, Jesus?

1284
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,680
Yeah, a few times, I think.

1285
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:02,400
I was surprised that it stuck around till 2003.

1286
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,320
It lasted 13 years because I could not remember

1287
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,440
seeing it in high school.

1288
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:15,360
But I can't think of, I feel like 2001 or 2002, my family,

1289
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,120
me, my dad, and brother would go stay at the Hard Rock

1290
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,520
and do Universal for a few days and then just drive over

1291
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,720
to a couple days at Disney.

1292
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,440
And so we were at Universal for a while.

1293
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,920
And I can't imagine not seeing this

1294
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,720
I was there for a couple days.

1295
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:32,720
Yeah, I think I went and it was still kicking

1296
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,840
when I was like 14 or so.

1297
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,920
Yeah, and I don't know, held up, cool.

1298
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,240
And here, we're getting towards, you

1299
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:47,120
talk about believing things like Jason and Wiener-rising.

1300
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:50,200
Feel free to call it anything that you liked in the 3D movie,

1301
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,640
which he says something at the beginning,

1302
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,760
this is the best of Hitchcock.

1303
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,360
And then you get a big pile of iconic moments,

1304
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,720
or at least the ones Universal had access to,

1305
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,720
which is most of them.

1306
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:07,600
But they build up that Dial M for Murder was shot in 3D.

1307
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,720
And it had never been screened in 3D

1308
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:13,840
because 3D was kind of a trend that had lapsed at that point.

1309
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:17,200
So they only, they theatrically released the flat version.

1310
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,080
But this 3D print existed.

1311
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,240
So I think that the guides or whatever

1312
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,080
would say here for the first time,

1313
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,240
even though it's done every day in the theme park,

1314
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:30,440
you get to see Dial M for Murder the way it was shot.

1315
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:33,240
So that's what this big montage builds up to,

1316
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,320
which you were describing.

1317
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,280
It's like, so there's a strangulation and the?

1318
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,200
Yes.

1319
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,600
Well, first off, it is a long montage.

1320
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,880
And I think at the time, seeing little set piece

1321
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,680
moments from movies was a bigger pain in the ass

1322
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,520
to track down all these movies.

1323
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,800
So it was more novel to see them all again,

1324
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,080
even if you get them in syndication or.

1325
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,000
And then in a nice theater, too.

1326
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,880
In a nice theater, good quality footage.

1327
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:04,200
And but there's a couple things I really like going on here.

1328
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:09,280
There's the Dial M for Murder 3D,

1329
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:13,160
which is wild that that is just in there.

1330
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:17,920
But then pretty much the main 3D thing

1331
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,800
seems to be setting up the birds joke.

1332
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:22,320
Where.

1333
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,160
Because it gets cut off.

1334
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,280
You don't really get to see the full ending of Dial M

1335
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:25,800
for Murder.

1336
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,480
Yeah, yeah.

1337
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,240
And I got to say, there's another trick in there

1338
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,880
where he says, it's time for the main attraction.

1339
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,560
Put on your glasses.

1340
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,040
You know, put on your glass.

1341
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,200
So they show a bunch of shots with characters

1342
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,520
in glasses in Hitchcock movies.

1343
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,760
But when he says it's time for the main attraction,

1344
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,480
there's like multiple shots from the birds.

1345
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,160
So they tell you what's coming.

1346
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,480
You just don't know it.

1347
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,840
It's like a little secret trick.

1348
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:54,400
They subliminally remind you the birds are coming.

1349
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,760
Yeah, because what it builds to is

1350
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,760
that you're watching this 3D movie,

1351
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,120
and then it starts to sputter out.

1352
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:04,320
Is there like that sound kind of pitch bends?

1353
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:08,800
And then the film burns out, and there's just nothing on screen.

1354
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,560
Or wait, well, I guess the big thing

1355
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:14,760
is there's like a giant rip all of a sudden through the screen.

1356
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:17,840
And then it becomes birds chaos.

1357
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:22,080
The bird, the famous birds take over this space,

1358
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,320
and you see back to what's behind the screen,

1359
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:27,280
which is this big kind of implied sound stage sort

1360
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,240
of space.

1361
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,560
And yay, speak of the day, Gremlins 2

1362
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:34,440
was just brought up, the other prominent thing,

1363
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,360
where film breaking happens.

1364
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,640
I would always buy this.

1365
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,120
It would scare the hell out of me any time.

1366
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:44,080
I mean, still, like it is a very like,

1367
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,480
apparently the projectionist the first time this was screened

1368
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,640
thought something was wrong.

1369
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,880
Like he bought it.

1370
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,080
So this is great.

1371
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,240
In a 3D movie setting, the film burns out,

1372
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,840
and then a bunch of animals attack you.

1373
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:59,000
It was like very chilling to me.

1374
01:03:59,000 --> 01:03:59,960
I loved this thing.

1375
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:00,600
Yeah.

1376
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:04,280
And Kevin touched on it in the Defunct Land.

1377
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:08,080
Like Tippi Hendren's daughter bought it when she first saw it.

1378
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:09,880
She was like, oh, fuck.

1379
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,760
She was startled.

1380
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,600
There's also very funny that once the screen rips down

1381
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,880
and there's the fake sound stage behind it,

1382
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,760
they do some classic 3D, this girder is coming right at you.

1383
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,000
This pipe is coming right at you.

1384
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,640
Yeah, sound stage stuff.

1385
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:26,880
A big old pipe.

1386
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,800
Yeah.

1387
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,640
It gets a little silly the longer.

1388
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:32,280
I think it's very chilling when it starts.

1389
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,480
And just haunting, seeing these birds kind of slow motion

1390
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:38,560
fly towards you, which was, I'm sure,

1391
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,720
a big pain in the ass to shoot.

1392
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,320
They showed in the Animal Actors Show,

1393
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:45,200
you've got to get a fan out to keep them

1394
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,480
into where you could focus on it.

1395
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:50,240
But then, all right, what would a bunch of birds

1396
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:54,720
really make lights fall and then the lights spark

1397
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,400
and people fall off ladders?

1398
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,240
I guess birds are like, in the movie, the birds,

1399
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:02,640
they're throwing themselves into the foam booth

1400
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,120
and killing themselves.

1401
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:04,760
Yeah.

1402
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:08,120
So I guess if they're hurling themselves at lights,

1403
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,200
I guess it could maybe knock a light off.

1404
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:14,400
They're not like special birds in the birds, right?

1405
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,960
There's just too many of them.

1406
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,520
Yeah, what is the plot of the birds?

1407
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,600
I don't think it's ever just, it's like.

1408
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,080
It's not?

1409
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,640
No, there's got to be a reason.

1410
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:26,640
They didn't like fly by an overturned truck that

1411
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:30,720
had a secret cocaine shipment in the undercarriage.

1412
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,880
Are the birds on cocaine?

1413
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:32,480
That's what I'm asking.

1414
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,320
I'm going to Google, are the birds on cocaine?

1415
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,360
The birds.

1416
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,040
1964 on cocaine.

1417
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,640
No, it's not like a modern film where it's like,

1418
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,680
how did the monsters get spot?

1419
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,240
Or like, how did Herman and Lily meet?

1420
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,400
How was Herman created?

1421
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,720
How was Herman created?

1422
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:50,120
I don't know.

1423
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:54,400
Well, if there was a scene where the birds all snorted cocaine,

1424
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,360
it was cut.

1425
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:58,080
And they didn't bring that back for the theme park version.

1426
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:58,600
Keep talking.

1427
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,160
I'll find it.

1428
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,000
Well, yeah, it gets so silly what happens.

1429
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,240
Like a fire starts and the lights are crackling.

1430
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,760
But then that turns into fireworks.

1431
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:13,280
And so then it's like nice magic of movies, fireworks.

1432
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:17,720
And the final bird that flies up towards the camera

1433
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:21,400
morphs into the famous Hitchcock silhouette,

1434
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,120
which has a confusing message to me.

1435
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:27,680
Like, Ben, the bird was hitch the whole time.

1436
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,840
It was a big pain in the ass.

1437
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,280
Caused chaos wherever it went.

1438
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

1439
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:32,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1440
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,400
Kind of like pecked at people.

1441
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,440
Me with them.

1442
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,240
Oh, wow, Jason's right.

1443
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,120
There's no real reason.

1444
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,400
It's like North by Northwest.

1445
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,480
They're like, we've got to get the documents.

1446
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,600
Clown on me for saying that was wrong, now.

1447
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,560
You fucking asshole.

1448
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,840
You thought the birds were a spell?

1449
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:51,160
You thought there was like polluted water or something?

1450
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,480
That's a cool thing about it.

1451
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:52,960
They don't know.

1452
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:53,480
I don't know.

1453
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,840
Something's happening with birds.

1454
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:58,000
I think executives were nervous about it.

1455
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,680
Like, there were multiple things where it's like,

1456
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:02,840
how are we going to film this psycho book?

1457
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,480
Like, how is he going to do this?

1458
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,520
I believe in early marketing gimmick of like,

1459
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,080
don't learn anything about this movie.

1460
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,400
Just come see it.

1461
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:14,640
And I think the first round of crowds who saw it were like,

1462
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,440
holy shit, like we're freaking out.

1463
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,520
Because of the twist, yes.

1464
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,520
Well, the twist and also like that music sting

1465
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:24,080
with the shower sequence is very jarring the first time you

1466
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:24,600
see it.

1467
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,440
And the character, spoiler alert, killed off.

1468
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:27,960
Yeah.

1469
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,560
Who's presented as the protagonist.

1470
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:30,680
Yeah, that was crazy.

1471
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,280
That was one of his big twists.

1472
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,880
It's like the start of Executive Decision

1473
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:37,360
where Steven Seagal dies really quickly.

1474
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:37,880
Yeah.

1475
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:39,440
Have you ever seen Executive Decision?

1476
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,080
No, I haven't.

1477
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:40,880
Oh, you'd love it.

1478
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:41,440
Oh, man.

1479
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,680
Kurt Russell.

1480
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:45,440
Oh, I just watched Breakdown for the first time.

1481
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,080
I've never seen that.

1482
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:46,640
Breakdown, really.

1483
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,040
You should check out Breakdown.

1484
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:52,360
Well, this confirms I'll keep going into Kurt Russell.

1485
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,120
So included.

1486
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,000
I've never watched Backdraft for all though.

1487
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,440
Didn't watch it when we did it in the first.

1488
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,200
I haven't either.

1489
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,080
I could not remember if I had ever

1490
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,440
seen the ending of the movie.

1491
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,960
I could not remember if I had ever seen the ending of this.

1492
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,320
So we watched Get Out the other day,

1493
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:09,360
which does feel very hitch cocked.

1494
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:10,720
He's Mr. Universal now.

1495
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,240
Yeah, Jordan Peele's Mr. Universal.

1496
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,320
He kind of took the spot.

1497
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:13,960
He really did.

1498
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,800
With the set next to the psycho set.

1499
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,480
Yeah, the current director face, I guess.

1500
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,400
We walk through again.

1501
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,440
We'll talk about it later.

1502
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:23,560
But when you're walking around, you walk right through Nope

1503
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:25,000
slash Usiverse.

1504
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Oh, this is a good chance to talk about it

1505
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,160
because we didn't really talk about the Nope set that

1506
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:29,920
got added to.

1507
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,160
Yeah, so we'll talk about it in the Horror Nights.

1508
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:32,800
Great, great.

1509
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:33,320
OK, OK.

1510
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,920
Yeah, you walked through a big one.

1511
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,600
Walked through that.

1512
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,400
Well, let's move over to the psycho room

1513
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,640
because that's where you're at.

1514
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:42,280
After you watch this montage, you

1515
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:44,080
try to get the birds out of your head.

1516
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,360
But then there's more horrors awaiting you

1517
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:49,440
because there's an indoor set, an indoor version

1518
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:53,800
of the psycho house and a sputtering Bates Motel sign.

1519
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:59,720
And this is kind of a combo of clips and demonstration stuff.

1520
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:05,600
But I think it kicks off with Anthony Perkins himself

1521
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:11,600
in walking out the door of the iconic house, welcoming you in.

1522
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:17,320
And then the mother from upstairs yells, no, I tell you,

1523
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,840
they won't be feeding their ugly appetites

1524
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:23,200
with my food or my son.

1525
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,760
In a psycho rewatch, this struck me

1526
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,680
as one of the sillier elements of the film,

1527
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:30,720
that the mother is a cartoon witch.

1528
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,200
Yes.

1529
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,000
No, boy.

1530
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,520
They really could have made that a reasonable older lady's

1531
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:37,120
voice.

1532
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:42,880
It also is not a voice that I can imagine Norman Bates doing.

1533
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,440
Right.

1534
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:44,320
That's a crazy.

1535
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:49,760
He's like the master of, he's like Terry Fader.

1536
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,760
I was going to say Mark Weiner.

1537
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,480
I was going to say another.

1538
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,680
The great puppeteers.

1539
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:56,720
Yes, that's true.

1540
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:59,440
I mean, I think people, you would probably argue that the first,

1541
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,400
up until Janet Leigh getting killed,

1542
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,800
that's the best part of the movie,

1543
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,560
is that whole sequence where she's on the run, checks in.

1544
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:06,760
It's so suspenseful.

1545
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:07,640
All the driving.

1546
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:10,920
All the driving, all like checking in, Norman.

1547
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,720
And then the rest of the movie is like good,

1548
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:15,800
but the tension's sort of a little bit gone there.

1549
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:16,440
Yeah, yeah.

1550
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,520
Obviously, there's still a twist coming at the end.

1551
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:21,360
There is the scene with the private investigator,

1552
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,040
who in the remake is William H. Macy.

1553
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,480
Detective Arbogast?

1554
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:26,360
Arbogast.

1555
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,920
That was my favorite part in re-watching it, was the boy,

1556
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,880
whoever, I know the old actor is Viggo Mortensen in the new one,

1557
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:36,720
but getting out of the car and Arbogast being mad at Arbogast.

1558
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,520
Arbogast, whatever.

1559
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,480
Also, there's a Ted Baxter cameo at the end of the first cycle.

1560
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:43,000
What?

1561
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,240
Is he one of the guys in the?

1562
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,680
He's just working in the jail.

1563
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,200
Wow.

1564
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,120
I don't even know if he has a, he might have one line,

1565
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:48,840
but he might not.

1566
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,240
I never knew that.

1567
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:55,800
The overhead shot when the detective walks up the stairs

1568
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,440
and they shoot it overhead in the hallway,

1569
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,880
and Norma just full speed runs at him.

1570
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:01,380
Yeah.

1571
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:02,280
It's terrifying.

1572
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,280
Yes, that's terrifying.

1573
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,760
That rivals the earlier stuff.

1574
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,920
Yeah, I'm not saying it's bad.

1575
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,800
I'm just saying that first shot, it's almost like, what,

1576
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,960
Wally, where the first part of Wally is like a little bit.

1577
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,560
Yeah, well, I think the second one got me as a kid.

1578
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,640
I'm like, oh, they're not going to do that again.

1579
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,360
And then they do, and it's such a disorienting angle.

1580
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,040
And then it's kind of cartoony how he falls down the stairs.

1581
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,680
That is the, that does not, that didn't age as well.

1582
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:29,480
I watched the making of the Gus Vansant 98 Psycho,

1583
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:31,640
where William H. Macy's talking that out with him.

1584
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:32,960
And like, well, because I remember in the first one,

1585
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,000
it looks a little silly.

1586
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,200
So we're going to do it a little better.

1587
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,720
And Gus is like, no.

1588
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,240
No.

1589
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:37,880
No, no, no.

1590
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:38,880
It's still special effects.

1591
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:39,360
Shot for shot.

1592
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,480
Oh, so we're going to kind of, OK.

1593
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,360
And you could tell Macy's like, your funeral,

1594
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,840
but I'm getting a paycheck.

1595
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,320
It reminds me of in The Batman.

1596
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:51,960
The, that's still, the Robert Patton said Batman.

1597
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:56,240
There's a scene where the Riddler like just brains a guy

1598
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:59,480
and he just runs full speed at him and goes, ah,

1599
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,960
like he's in a dark apartment.

1600
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,400
And it's just the most unsettling thing.

1601
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,600
And I was watching it in the dark alone.

1602
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,080
And I was like, Jesus Christ, is the whole movie

1603
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,240
going to be like this?

1604
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,120
You got afraid?

1605
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,000
You were afraid of the Paul Dano?

1606
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,360
No, he just does his guttural scream.

1607
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:16,840
I'm trying to remember.

1608
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,440
I've seen it, but I can't remember what part you're talking about.

1609
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,800
I think it's the mayor.

1610
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:24,840
I think it's when he, I think he's watching the news.

1611
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,840
And then the Joker, or the Riddler just silently appears

1612
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,840
behind him and then runs full speed at him.

1613
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,000
Oh, I remember that scene, yeah.

1614
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,720
And it's terribly unsettling.

1615
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:36,320
And that they don't do again in the movie, I don't think.

1616
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,400
In The Batman.

1617
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,280
In The Batman.

1618
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:38,640
Right.

1619
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,160
Yeah.

1620
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:44,040
Modern masterpieces, modern itchcock.

1621
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,360
I liked it.

1622
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,560
It's very long, but I liked it.

1623
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,640
They try to do a lot of, it's a few

1624
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:50,720
movies.

1625
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:54,880
It's a few issues of a comic book.

1626
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,800
So this thing, you're like, then you're kind of bouncing back

1627
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,680
and forth, like you get a, it's a great, it's a classic early

1628
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,920
90s universal walk and talk.

1629
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,160
Hi, I'm Anthony Perkins.

1630
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,680
When we did this, we went da da da.

1631
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:06,480
He's very good.

1632
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,200
It's great to see him in this video.

1633
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,520
And nice to see him in sort of like, you know,

1634
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:13,320
genteel Phil Hartman like, you know,

1635
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:16,440
being that he's iconically such a creep.

1636
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,840
Although he's like, he has his own like charming.

1637
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,640
That's actually a mistake of the Vince Vaughn thing

1638
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,880
is that he's like weird and ticky and tucking his shoulder

1639
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:24,480
the whole time.

1640
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:28,120
And whereas like you could see how original Norman Bates

1641
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:29,040
would kind of lure you in.

1642
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,720
Yeah, because he saw like he seems wholesome and innocent.

1643
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:34,400
That's what Norman Bates charm was.

1644
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,840
Had a hard life, Anthony Perkins.

1645
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,360
Put himself in conversion therapy.

1646
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:39,840
Whoa.

1647
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:40,800
I did not know that.

1648
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,080
He was not.

1649
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:42,880
He was gay.

1650
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:47,080
He was actually, Stephen Sondheim and him worked together,

1651
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:47,920
I think only one time.

1652
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,200
But he was kind of Sondheim's muse for a while.

1653
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,440
And they were very close.

1654
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,440
But they made this movie called The Last of Sheila

1655
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,800
that I watched a few months ago.

1656
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:56,720
And it's awesome.

1657
01:13:56,720 --> 01:14:00,200
It's like a whodunit kind of movie.

1658
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:04,800
And it's got James Mason and like a very young Ian McShane.

1659
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,640
Like it's in the 1970s.

1660
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,200
And you're like, I was like, who is that?

1661
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,440
They're so familiar.

1662
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,160
I can't place it.

1663
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,760
And it fucking Ian McShane.

1664
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:15,760
Wow.

1665
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,040
But yeah, Last of Sheila.

1666
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:17,800
Check it out.

1667
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,720
That's a great movie.

1668
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,400
Huh.

1669
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,400
But yeah, he's like super like dapper Sherman.

1670
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,680
And you got to like the real guy playing the,

1671
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,960
even though he passed away not long after this.

1672
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:28,440
Right.

1673
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,400
Just was sick of the sad life.

1674
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,480
Early tragic AIDS death.

1675
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,240
But he fit this in.

1676
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:36,800
And I like seeing this in the Hollywood version.

1677
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,000
They repurposed this part.

1678
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,080
And this is where you get between him and the in-studio crew

1679
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,760
who are going to recreate the shower scene for you.

1680
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:52,480
You get great, legit good, like classic universal factoids

1681
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,120
about this.

1682
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:56,560
You get a little mini film school, which I liked.

1683
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,960
But this Hitchcock stuff was gone

1684
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,280
by the time I was a tour guide.

1685
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,880
But it was always recommended as like, hey,

1686
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,320
if you get stuck by the psycho house,

1687
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,920
you can go into these facts.

1688
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,360
And I like the classic facts.

1689
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:09,520
The blood was chocolate syrup.

1690
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,920
Well, this isn't a fact, but the joke,

1691
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,960
the scene that drove thousands from the shower to sponge baths.

1692
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:16,720
Kills.

1693
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:21,120
Every old VHS rip of this online, that joke kills.

1694
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,920
You could get stabbed doing a sponge bath too.

1695
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:24,760
That's true, yeah.

1696
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,040
It's still in the tub.

1697
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,280
It's not the shower part of it.

1698
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:30,200
Yeah, you can hide razor blades in that sponge.

1699
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,360
Oh, god.

1700
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,240
That's horrifying.

1701
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:32,840
Yeah, scary.

1702
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:33,320
Jason, stop.

1703
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,120
Secret blade.

1704
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:35,760
Stop it.

1705
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,880
The twisted mind.

1706
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:41,440
This seems like some twisted idea out of the asylum that

1707
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,160
is Blumhouse.

1708
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:50,280
But then you, the legit cool fact, and probably the main thing

1709
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:54,000
they're demonstrating, is that the knife never actually

1710
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,040
enters the skin of Janet Lee.

1711
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:01,280
And that this is all done, it's really left up to your imagination.

1712
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,960
You fill in the gaps.

1713
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,200
And that's cool.

1714
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,240
And it's cool that they take you through the angles,

1715
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:08,960
and they recreate some of the angles,

1716
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:13,720
because this is the epitome of perfectly chosen, whatever it is,

1717
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:17,520
these 15 shots or whatever, and what poetry they are.

1718
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,600
And the only appeal of that 98 Gus Van Zand is like,

1719
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:24,720
well, it'll be interesting to see the shots again.

1720
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:28,160
Even though he put in weird that there's psychedelic shit

1721
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,360
when her eyes kind of, it's not good.

1722
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:31,480
It's so not good.

1723
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:32,880
It's like, yeah, the same thing.

1724
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,840
That's the only appeal of when Weezer did the Africa cover.

1725
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,080
It's like, we may as well hear the music again.

1726
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:40,120
I would, yeah.

1727
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:40,680
Yeah.

1728
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:44,360
I think I would still like, I had more fun watching 98 Psycho

1729
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,640
than listening to it.

1730
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:49,760
I never made it all the way through, because that's sacrilege to me.

1731
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:50,280
Right.

1732
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:50,840
Some good actors.

1733
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:51,760
My Hitchcock is there.

1734
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:55,200
You got some good actors steering that ship.

1735
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,640
Well, what you end up with is a scene, the very last scene,

1736
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:03,040
has Philip Baker Hall and Robert Forster, greats, who have passed on.

1737
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,720
You're like, wow, they filmed together.

1738
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:09,200
And they refilmed that shitty end scene where everything is over explained

1739
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:12,400
to you, and it maybe only confuses things more.

1740
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,720
So you're like, is this the only time Forster and Philip

1741
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:15,680
Baker all were together?

1742
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,760
Was this crap?

1743
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,520
That's a good question.

1744
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,160
I think that was, yeah.

1745
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:25,120
But they're not even really in the same shot, even.

1746
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:28,160
So anyways, like this demonstration.

1747
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:32,400
And then did you guys find the trivia about the Janet Leigh

1748
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,400
in this show?

1749
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,120
Who played her?

1750
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:35,680
Yeah.

1751
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:36,200
Uh-huh.

1752
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:36,800
No.

1753
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,680
We got a picture.

1754
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:44,560
Jordan, do we have a photo of a woman in skin-colored shower suits?

1755
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,000
Cheryl Hines.

1756
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:51,440
Young Cheryl Hines, apparently fresh out of University of Central Florida.

1757
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,200
Oh, that's Jane's alma mater.

1758
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,160
Whoa, wow.

1759
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,000
And then went to work at Universal.

1760
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,600
Yeah, and also worked at Universal.

1761
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:58,560
That's the pipeline.

1762
01:17:58,560 --> 01:17:59,120
Crazy.

1763
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,240
Yeah, well, there you go.

1764
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:05,280
Well, she can look at Cheryl Hines as the path from Central Florida

1765
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,360
to Universal Orlando, too.

1766
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,760
And then, yeah, she's with an anti-vaxxer.

1767
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,680
Now, are you talking about Cheryl Hines' real-life husband?

1768
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:18,720
Is that what you're referring to?

1769
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:19,200
Yeah.

1770
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,880
I've kind of heard of Robert Kennedy.

1771
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:21,360
Yeah.

1772
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,880
Robert Kennedy.

1773
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,000
Junior.

1774
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:24,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1775
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:25,520
Not the first.

1776
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,680
I mean, the first one might, you know, they might still be alive.

1777
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:29,760
Well, that's a different thing.

1778
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:30,400
Yeah.

1779
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,520
They're all still alive.

1780
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:32,320
All of them.

1781
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:32,880
They're all alive.

1782
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:33,920
All the Kennedys are alive.

1783
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,680
All the Kennedys are alive.

1784
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:36,640
There's one more photo.

1785
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:37,840
Let's just put it up to say we did.

1786
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:38,160
See?

1787
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:38,640
Look.

1788
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,360
Yeah, there it is.

1789
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,240
In the press kit.

1790
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,720
She said it was a bizarre job.

1791
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:48,000
You're taking showers in fake nudity in front of tourists every day.

1792
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,800
And then, like, I couldn't find video of her doing it.

1793
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:54,160
But the other, it's a weird, like, little mini scene within all this,

1794
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:57,360
if you watch the video, where, like, she's mad at the crew.

1795
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:01,440
That has to recreate Psycho every day for some reason.

1796
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,440
She's, like, complaining at him.

1797
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:04,240
Yeah, all of that.

1798
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,200
It sucks.

1799
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,520
Because, again, I had not seen this in person.

1800
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,840
So I'm watching the video, and Anthony Perkins is there.

1801
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,520
And you're like, he's hitting the right mood.

1802
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,440
It's a little scary, but it's a little informative.

1803
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:14,320
He nails it.

1804
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,120
It's good to see.

1805
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,320
The music is good.

1806
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,720
Then it's like, hey, here comes the performers.

1807
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,160
And you're like, oh, god.

1808
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,480
These Orlando guys in, like, shiny jackets.

1809
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,320
Kind of like the Carl Wilson jacket I like.

1810
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:27,120
But it has the silhouette of Hitchcock on the back.

1811
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,520
And, like, yeah, I don't care that the fake director and cameraman

1812
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,960
and fake Janet Leigh aren't getting along while doing this.

1813
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,280
And she's like, why do you think I'm upset?

1814
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,880
Everyone's just going to be looking at me and saying,

1815
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,000
Janet Leigh looks better.

1816
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:45,360
And you're like, why is this weird, like, they're having, like, a domestic dispute?

1817
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:45,840
Yes.

1818
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:49,120
There's one version I saw online where there's a lot of jokes

1819
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,920
between her and the director, like, is this about last night?

1820
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,400
And then it's like, oh, it's cold in here.

1821
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,560
And he goes, like, yeah, just like last night.

1822
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:00,240
And I'm like, this must be the chunk of lines where they said, like,

1823
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:01,360
you can improvise.

1824
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:06,080
And that improv would go on to surf her well later in her career.

1825
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:06,640
Yeah, sure.

1826
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:07,840
That's where she learned.

1827
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,280
It's not necessarily the performance fault.

1828
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,840
I'm sure that's sort of, like, the directive they were given.

1829
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,680
But it's completely, totally off.

1830
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:14,640
Yes.

1831
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,000
Like, what the mood they've set up.

1832
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,280
And now you're just getting, like, bickering people you've never heard of.

1833
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,080
And it's like, it just doesn't.

1834
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,600
That's the one drawback.

1835
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,280
That's the one thing I don't think I love.

1836
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,080
I would agree.

1837
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,280
I had no memory of it.

1838
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,800
It's a well-designed room.

1839
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,000
It's a great little sequence.

1840
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,200
This bickering does not match.

1841
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,200
When you're talking about a director known for, like,

1842
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,960
just a sparkling dialogue.

1843
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,080
Yeah, tightness.

1844
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:40,960
Yeah, tightness.

1845
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,720
Yeah, interesting filmmaking.

1846
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:48,800
I will say that, like, so after they show you both sides of, like,

1847
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:53,680
how they shot the scene, and then there's, like, a switch at some point

1848
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:59,440
where one of the crew members puts on the dress and, like, the fencing face.

1849
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:03,360
Oh, yeah, whatever, like, shadow face they have to put.

1850
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:03,840
Yeah.

1851
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:07,200
In Andy Bergen's one, I believe he says,

1852
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,240
they had to blacken the stand-in's face.

1853
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:13,040
And I'm like, oh, they would have massaged that line nowadays.

1854
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,120
That doesn't sound great.

1855
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,480
Different verb, perhaps?

1856
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,520
It's just a mask.

1857
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:26,080
So, like, at some point they swap, and then that mother starts, like, going after the director.

1858
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:31,600
You think that the audience volunteer has lost it and is starting to stab everybody

1859
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,880
and chase them around the set.

1860
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,840
But then there was a little fake-a-roo pullback of the curtain,

1861
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,960
and it was the director of this little show did a little change.

1862
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,000
It's a great gag.

1863
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,080
That, I think, is totally correct.

1864
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:46,000
Well, that's their true, they're already, like, feeling the,

1865
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:50,160
we've talked about it, Universal's basically shifted almost completely around the, like,

1866
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:52,880
making of a movie and showing how it works.

1867
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,160
And we're just doing it now.

1868
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,680
You're just in it, and it doesn't matter.

1869
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,360
We're not going to be behind the scenes.

1870
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,040
But you can feel already there's a pull of, like,

1871
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,200
we should give everybody, we could just scare them more.

1872
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,000
So they throw that in there in between.

1873
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:04,960
It's a little...

1874
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:05,760
You get a little...

1875
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,260
Whatty.

1876
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:07,360
Oh, well.

1877
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:09,360
It's a little outrageous, you know?

1878
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,040
There's a shower happening.

1879
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,320
Something goes wrong.

1880
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:17,440
A class, an early example of something is going wrong in this presentation.

1881
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,320
That's true, yeah.

1882
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:26,560
So, yeah, this is like a superstar television at MGM Studios a little bit,

1883
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,760
where you get the person up, and then there's a little, there's hijinks.

1884
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,280
And it's got a lot of the stunt show features of, like,

1885
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:37,600
fake person that you think is a person from the audience.

1886
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:42,080
And kind of making a fool out of the, like, even the reveal of,

1887
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:44,960
hey, look, your dad's dressed like an old lady now.

1888
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:45,920
Yeah, right, exactly.

1889
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:46,640
This is another one.

1890
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:49,280
Humiliate Dad wins every time.

1891
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,000
And this was a hallmark of the 90s attractions.

1892
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:59,680
Dear Penthouse Forum, I was cucked by the Universal Studios Florida resort destination.

1893
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,360
I was made to look a fool.

1894
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,640
Is there any, we've said it before,

1895
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:07,600
is there any attraction now that is humiliating dad?

1896
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:08,480
That's all about humor.

1897
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,960
I don't think, I mean, other than, like, just the start tours or something,

1898
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,560
but not specifically.

1899
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,960
The only thing you can do to humiliate him, I guess,

1900
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:18,080
is buy him, like, the grumpy shirt that says, like, I'm an asshole.

1901
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,880
I'm a grumpy asshole.

1902
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:22,640
I gotta get one of those now.

1903
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:24,000
Less attractive grew.

1904
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,360
I gotta get some of these shirts now.

1905
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,600
I realize now I can buy them and wear them proudly.

1906
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,480
Oh, finally.

1907
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:31,600
Full dad shirts.

1908
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,400
Like, the Donald, we've talked about this before, they sell dads,

1909
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:38,000
the Donald shirt and grumpy, because they're both jerk characters

1910
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,240
who don't want to be at Disney World or Disneyland.

1911
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,480
Are you gonna be able to, like, settle into that type?

1912
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:48,400
You have, there's hours of you on record saying that you like being at theme parks.

1913
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,840
Well, I'll try.

1914
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:52,880
Maybe it'll feel too weird and I'll have to remove the shirt and buy a different one.

1915
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,520
You have started drinking coffee in the last year.

1916
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:55,920
That's true.

1917
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:00,960
You can get the grumpy, like, don't talk to me until I've had my morning coffee, you know?

1918
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:01,280
Okay.

1919
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,120
I'll do that one.

1920
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:03,840
Start doing it.

1921
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,880
You've got a whole new world of t-shirts ahead of you.

1922
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:07,840
You gotta size up.

1923
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,400
You gotta size up one or two sizes with those ones.

1924
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:13,760
They need to look like a fucking sail on a sailboat.

1925
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:17,360
Those grumpy.

1926
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:21,280
Thick, Haines beefy tee, thick beefy tee, but like two sizes too big.

1927
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:25,920
Dads are so humiliated in the theme park shows to have to wear a dress,

1928
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,320
but their t-shirts are big dresses.

1929
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:28,720
That's true.

1930
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:29,680
They don't even put it together.

1931
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:30,320
They don't even know.

1932
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:31,760
You're in one.

1933
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,920
You changed one for another one.

1934
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,720
A shirt with like an angry looking stitch on it that says,

1935
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,560
like, my kids don't give me a minute's peace.

1936
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:43,280
It's a real, the next step will be if they can customize,

1937
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,840
put my children's names in this angry.

1938
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,400
Ohana means family.

1939
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:52,480
Family means don't wake dad before 10 on the weekends.

1940
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:56,160
I need shirts that keep going to the back.

1941
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:59,840
There's more complaints on the, here's some other gripes I got.

1942
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:05,760
When my wife looks me in the eyes, the fire is gone from her vision.

1943
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:14,080
That's just got a very cold looking Merida on it.

1944
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:16,480
Crust arms.

1945
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:18,960
Okay.

1946
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:24,800
We've talked about Hitchcock being bad to the actresses.

1947
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:30,640
And this is, and we talked about these often repeated bits of trivia.

1948
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:34,160
This was for sure a thing I was supposed to say as a tour guide or that I could say

1949
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:37,840
that like, you know, part of one of the things that made it so unsettling

1950
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:42,400
and it made Janet Lee's performance great was that Hitchcock would change the temperature

1951
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:47,360
of the water without telling her that it goes from warm water to ice cold.

1952
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:50,320
And then that caused terror and shriek and surprise.

1953
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:50,720
Yes.

1954
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:57,840
But I watched some DVD making of the shower scene where Janet Lee denies this and even calls out.

1955
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,840
She says, now I don't know what they're telling people on the universal tour,

1956
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:06,240
but let me just say this for the record that that did not happen.

1957
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:08,160
They never used ice cold water.

1958
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:13,280
And in fact, that was very well taken care of because it was extremely,

1959
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:18,880
like she describes it all, how like, you know, the final shot is her dead with the,

1960
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:23,280
like starting from very as close to the eyes you could possibly get and the water's still running.

1961
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:27,760
And they had to do that so many times because like it was manual focus.

1962
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,320
Like there was no way to like keep the focus.

1963
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:34,480
So like she's there slumped over for hours and she said everybody was a gentleman,

1964
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:38,240
except for the crew members way up in the rafters who she said,

1965
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:42,320
I think they brought more crew members in to look at me every day to ogle.

1966
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,080
Interesting.

1967
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:47,680
I wonder, I sorry, I wonder how many people would object to like if they went through,

1968
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:50,800
just like watched you do your tram tour speech.

1969
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,320
Would Paul Giamatti have had an objection of the big fat liar portion or something?

1970
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:57,600
Like, because I wonder how much like movie fact is not fact.

1971
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:02,800
There's a lot of, you know, when I said he was very verbally abusive to all the children,

1972
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:07,920
I don't know why I went out of my way to say that this character assassinate Giamatti.

1973
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:08,320
Yeah.

1974
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:13,840
I mean, a lot of, yeah, a lot of the Hitchcock stars, you know, older stars make appearances

1975
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:18,160
like in this attraction or at least like, yeah, that story about

1976
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:21,200
Tippi Hendren's daughter, which I do, which could be Melanie Griffith.

1977
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:22,560
Oh, right.

1978
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,000
I don't know if she had a sister.

1979
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,240
I just saw the phrase, uh, Tippi Hendren's daughter.

1980
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:32,400
So the line is Tippi Hendren, Melanie Griffith, Dakota Johnson.

1981
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:33,520
Wow.

1982
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:34,480
What a lineage.

1983
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:34,880
Yeah.

1984
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:35,120
Yeah.

1985
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,360
And then they were all, that was the family that lived with the lions for that weird movie.

1986
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:39,680
Yes.

1987
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:39,760
Roar.

1988
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,400
That was way worse than anything Hitchcock ever did to anybody.

1989
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:43,120
Yeah.

1990
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,400
And they chose it, I think.

1991
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:49,440
The, um, old Jimmy Stewart is really something in his post-show segment.

1992
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:50,480
Oh, yeah.

1993
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:51,360
Yeah, they got Jimmy Stewart.

1994
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,840
Old Jimmy Stewart, again, on talk shows, fantastic.

1995
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:54,400
Really good.

1996
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,320
So slow, you read a poem about his dog.

1997
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:00,080
Jim Carrey did it, I think he did that on Saturday Night Live, that is a bit once.

1998
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:00,560
Yeah.

1999
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:01,040
Yeah.

2000
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,400
Or Joe Pesci show, was it?

2001
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:02,800
Oh, yes.

2002
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,000
I think it was a Joe Pesci show.

2003
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:04,400
Oh, okay.

2004
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:07,040
Hey, speaking of anti-vaxxers.

2005
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,240
But in a theme park context.

2006
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:09,920
Not Pesci, Pesci used that, we don't know.

2007
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:10,420
No.

2008
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:15,600
In a theme park context, so you've got the Statue of Liberty scene from the saboteur,

2009
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:20,960
a carousel, which I think is strangers on a train, but there's also a carousel in Shadow of a Doubt.

2010
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:29,520
And then you have a city, like, you know, apartment buildings from rear window

2011
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:32,320
that you can stand with binoculars.

2012
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:35,680
And Jimmy Stewart is telling you, did you find the murderer yet?

2013
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:38,320
They might have found you.

2014
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:43,760
Like, I was like, that is insane to think about six-year-old me with binoculars going like,

2015
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,080
there's a lot of things going on in these apartments.

2016
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,480
I hope the murderer doesn't see me.

2017
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:51,280
You're looking at murder and there's women in their underwear instead of that?

2018
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,560
And that's a body sequence.

2019
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:53,840
There's a rear window.

2020
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:58,400
Oh, speaking of Brian Marriott, Funko is making a rear window board game, I saw.

2021
01:28:58,400 --> 01:28:58,880
What?

2022
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,880
Yeah.

2023
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:03,120
Funko is in the board game space now.

2024
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,440
I like that you still chose, you didn't say speaking of Funko,

2025
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,360
you said speaking of Brian Marriott.

2026
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,960
We were a long time ago.

2027
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:14,960
Three hours ago.

2028
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,040
Look at rear window board game.

2029
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:18,480
Jason, look at this.

2030
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:20,000
Wow.

2031
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:20,480
Yeah.

2032
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:24,160
But wait, it's the actual, like, poster art and stuff?

2033
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:25,920
Okay, so they're not Funko-fied.

2034
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,440
It's not a Funko-fied.

2035
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:28,080
Oh, right, right.

2036
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:28,400
No, no.

2037
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:29,280
There are Funko games.

2038
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,160
I have a Seinfeld Funko game as well that I haven't played yet,

2039
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,320
where there's like Funko-fied versions.

2040
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:35,600
And that thing I got you was Funko as well.

2041
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,440
You gave me the full, yes, the Seinfeld set in Funko, which is so awesome.

2042
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,520
Thank you, Brian Marriott.

2043
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:46,320
This last room, I liked so much.

2044
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:52,560
This crazy, surreal, as with the opening collage or whatever,

2045
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:56,960
that here's like a bunch of, like, wow, there's a rear window and a carousel

2046
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:59,840
and a big Statue of Liberty torch all in one space.

2047
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:03,920
Like, that felt like being in Hitchcock's mind, where here's big icons.

2048
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:04,880
Yeah, that's great.

2049
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:05,200
Yeah, yeah.

2050
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:06,240
That's almost like Batman.

2051
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:10,240
Batman in the Batcave in certain versions has, like, a big penny,

2052
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:11,920
big two-faced penny and a big dinosaur.

2053
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,560
It's like stuff he's collected and it feels like this is the same thing

2054
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,960
Hitchcock's, like, artifacts from the movies.

2055
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,440
Yeah.

2056
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:23,440
And it bled into, like, the Bates Motel, like, a gift shop as if it was at the Bates Motel,

2057
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:25,920
which is also a pretty good gag.

2058
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:31,040
And yeah, that Bates Motel, I mean, they still sell Bates Motel stuff here and there,

2059
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:35,680
but I remember after it closed, a bunch of it showed up at the, like,

2060
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:41,840
there's a store in the New York streets, and I'm not sure what it is right now.

2061
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:46,720
A few years ago, it was, like, Irish stuff, you know?

2062
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:52,880
And before that, and maybe at the same time, it was all the clearance merchandise.

2063
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:56,080
And so I remember going there and being so excited that day.

2064
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:58,560
I was like, I'm going to get a Bates Motel keychain.

2065
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:03,040
It does say Lisa on it, but it's also $2, so I can't be too picky.

2066
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,800
You bought not your own name.

2067
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,560
Yeah, I bought not my own name.

2068
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,880
Yeah, I was a cool guy in high school.

2069
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:09,600
What do you want?

2070
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,520
Did you, like, show it off, though?

2071
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:13,360
Because that is, like, ironic to not have your own name on a keychain.

2072
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:15,040
Yeah, I think that was part of it.

2073
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:18,320
That was a very funny gag for 17-year-olds.

2074
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,400
Like, look, I got a keychain with someone else's name.

2075
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,640
I think it was too, I think it was rectangular.

2076
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:25,280
And I think he ends were metal and pointed.

2077
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:30,240
So I was like, this isn't practical as a keychain, but I'll keep it in my little souvenir box.

2078
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:33,840
When Kmart was going out of business, we went there every week, a couple times a week.

2079
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,400
And I remember I bought these, like, yellow sunglasses.

2080
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,920
And I was like, you know what I'm doing now?

2081
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,720
I'm wearing these every day 24-7.

2082
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:41,040
Yeah.

2083
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:41,920
This is my thing now.

2084
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,200
And yours was the Lisa keychain.

2085
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:44,400
Lisa keychain.

2086
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:48,480
Me and some friends were, like, walking through Sears once they had clearance, like, socks,

2087
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,960
like, teen socks.

2088
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:54,000
And we were like, let's get matching Hottie Patrol socks.

2089
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:54,640
Oh, wow.

2090
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:56,640
That's too blotty for me.

2091
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:05,680
Hottie Patrol socks, Bates Motel Lisa keychain, and you in yellow sunglasses.

2092
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:07,920
Everybody's in their best.

2093
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:11,920
I mean, we've got a couple of fucking quarterbacks right here, a couple of prom kings.

2094
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:17,840
No denying that.

2095
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:19,840
Look at this motherfucker.

2096
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,840
He can't even say he's denying.

2097
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:22,960
He fucked up.

2098
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:24,080
I'm sorry, everyone.

2099
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,080
No, this is gold for misspeaking.

2100
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:28,400
Classic misspeaking.

2101
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:29,760
There's one thing I want to go back to.

2102
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:33,920
I know we've been going forever, but I can't let the episode pass without bringing this up.

2103
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,520
This is back in the Psycho sequence.

2104
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:41,680
And this is one of the things that Anthony Perkins talks about, where he,

2105
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:48,160
this is a quote that he kind of, like, interrupts the live demonstration.

2106
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:51,600
So he can give some expertise, because he was Norman Bates.

2107
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:56,080
And he says, well, he wants to say a little of what made that original scene work.

2108
01:32:56,080 --> 01:33:00,640
And I think it goes on to make the point that the knife never entered her skin, and here's why.

2109
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:05,120
And in setting that up, he explains how this could have been a lot more grisly.

2110
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:09,600
And what he says is, you see, Psycho was based on a real murder case.

2111
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:13,600
Years later, they made a much more graphic film based on the same case.

2112
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,160
It was called the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

2113
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:19,680
But Hitchcock felt the violence of the crime was just too horrible.

2114
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:24,000
And thus, you know, it was tame, and the audience fills in the gaps.

2115
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,680
I was like, I never heard of this.

2116
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:29,360
The same thing as Psycho and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

2117
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:34,080
Now, so all right, let me figure this out.

2118
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,920
And here's the big crazy reveal.

2119
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,120
There's a fella named Ed Gein.

2120
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:39,840
Oh, Ed Gein, yeah.

2121
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,040
You know Ed Gein.

2122
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:41,920
I know Ed.

2123
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:42,080
Yeah.

2124
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,520
You're a good fella.

2125
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:46,400
The Butcher of Plainfield, the Plainfield ghoul.

2126
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:46,900
Sure.

2127
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:48,880
I didn't know any of this.

2128
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:54,800
The same guy, there's elements of Norman Bates and Psycho,

2129
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:59,520
Leatherface and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs.

2130
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:00,000
Wow.

2131
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:07,440
Like real things pulled from this one, got one man is all of these monster, like lawn chaney, but real.

2132
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:09,760
Every monster.

2133
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:14,720
Now I'm going to, you've heard a little about Ed Gein.

2134
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:18,960
I'm sure that, I didn't know any of this because this is not my area, true crime and stuff.

2135
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:22,480
I'm sure there is a podcast, this is probably a podcast that's all about Ed Gein.

2136
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:26,320
Well, I want to know what does Ryan Murphy have to say about Ed Gein.

2137
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:32,720
Now I'm going to put a blindfold on and throw a dart at a dartboard, starring Adam Devine.

2138
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:33,220
Okay.

2139
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:34,560
Hey, okay.

2140
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:35,520
It's Ed Gein.

2141
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,000
All right.

2142
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:41,440
Netflix limited series produced by Ryan Murphy starring Adam Devine.

2143
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:42,240
Money please.

2144
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:47,440
I think maybe I saw that there's something from an American Horror Story that's also Ed Gein.

2145
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:48,320
I'm sure.

2146
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,800
So yeah, he might have beat you to it.

2147
01:34:52,000 --> 01:35:00,480
But just in wrapping my head around Ed Gein, okay, so Middle of Nowhere creepy house,

2148
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:03,920
incredibly like crazy, crazy religious mother.

2149
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,520
Sex is evil and women are instruments of the devil.

2150
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:10,240
This was instilled and things don't get too crazy yet.

2151
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:12,320
I was going to say this is the way all three of us were raised.

2152
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,120
And we haven't killed anybody yet.

2153
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,360
We haven't done that.

2154
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,200
So this is so far it's okay.

2155
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:24,240
But anyway, then he like, he might've killed his own brother when they were younger

2156
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:26,400
because there was a fire and he went and told the police,

2157
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,400
my brother, I lost him in the fire.

2158
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,320
And then they came to the fire and said, well, what happened?

2159
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:31,760
He said, oh, he's right there.

2160
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,200
And why do you know now?

2161
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:38,800
So maybe Shadely killed his own brother and then his mother died.

2162
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:41,760
He put the word mother on the tombstone.

2163
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:42,640
So that's real.

2164
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:50,720
And then so the fixation with mother and wanting to dress up like her, that's a real thing.

2165
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:53,440
Then you go to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which I've never seen.

2166
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:54,240
I should see it.

2167
01:35:55,200 --> 01:36:00,160
But I'm told that there's furniture made out of human skin and bones.

2168
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:00,720
Mm-hmm.

2169
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:01,680
Yes, I believe so.

2170
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:02,000
All right.

2171
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,280
So that's this guy.

2172
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:04,160
He did that.

2173
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:06,800
He made furniture out of skin and bones.

2174
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:13,520
And then to bring silence to the lambs in, the woman suit, the skin suit.

2175
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:14,160
Right, right, right.

2176
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:15,280
That is him.

2177
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:18,320
And that's him trying to be his own mother.

2178
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:21,680
Isn't that weird that Norman Bates and Buffalo Bit, two of the crazy,

2179
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:23,920
and that like they just didn't go crazy enough.

2180
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:25,840
It wasn't just a wig.

2181
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,120
This guy fucking.

2182
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:30,720
I like you're delivering this as if it's the same way we're like,

2183
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,560
and you know, imagine you're Claude Coats.

2184
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:35,680
He was the guy of the Haunted Mansion who actually added some of the dark stuff.

2185
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:37,520
And he was also Snow White's Scary Adventure.

2186
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,200
You're like, whoa, I didn't know.

2187
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:40,560
I only have one tone.

2188
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,080
I don't know how else to do it.

2189
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:43,440
I mean, I would have done it the same way.

2190
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:47,920
When tragedies befall me in my life, I'll be talking in the same tone.

2191
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:51,280
I'll be nervous laughing because I'm losing my, I don't know what else to do.

2192
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:55,600
So I came out and there was a screwdriver in each one of my tires.

2193
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:59,200
And I don't know who did it or who I've wronged.

2194
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:03,280
And fun facts, the manufacturer of the tires was.

2195
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:10,800
I guess a Goodyear tires, but it's like, you know, an always ready screwdriver.

2196
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:15,040
And, you know, they're owned by the same parent company nowadays.

2197
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:18,080
I just I just I also want to add, I just purchased a leather face neck,

2198
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,080
a toy from Target for a friend of mine.

2199
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:20,640
And that's true.

2200
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:22,320
I did it a week and a half ago.

2201
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:26,640
So now, you know, the toy was inspired and I would say,

2202
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,360
wait, sorry, Brian Mariani.

2203
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:30,640
Yeah, Brian.

2204
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:31,680
Well, that's Funko.

2205
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:32,160
OK, OK.

2206
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,440
Andy Falk is NECA.

2207
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,560
Oh, sorry, NECA.

2208
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:39,920
So, OK, well, I'd say, well, you know, I'll throw it out to Brian or Randy.

2209
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,640
When is the when's the tribute to Ed Gein?

2210
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:46,320
We pay tribute to the to the the fictional monsters.

2211
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,840
But where's Ed Gein's?

2212
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,120
I'm sure they're working.

2213
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:51,680
He wrote all Hitchcock didn't think of any of this shit.

2214
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:52,720
Ed Gein did it.

2215
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:53,440
Yeah, right, right.

2216
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:58,960
I go in that there was a thing that stuck out to me from this.

2217
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:01,520
Who is the oh, God, I forget.

2218
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,480
I didn't write.

2219
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:05,200
Is it Shirley MacLean is talking at some point?

2220
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:05,440
Yeah.

2221
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:05,920
And the yes.

2222
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,480
Yeah, she describes a lot about the TV show.

2223
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,480
I yeah, I did.

2224
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:15,680
She at some someone in one of the narrations discusses that he's like,

2225
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,240
you know, and of course, Hitchcock movies usually have a big ending

2226
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,520
or a plot twist or something.

2227
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:24,080
Whereas Hitch would say, I I'm worried I got the word wrong.

2228
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:26,240
It's got to end with a smacker.

2229
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:27,520
Yes.

2230
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:31,440
And I was just like, I don't remember that one that I forgot about.

2231
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:32,400
I don't know.

2232
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:32,960
I've never heard.

2233
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:37,840
I heard I saw the video, but I've never heard that if that somehow I might have missed that part

2234
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:44,320
in the montage or missed that part in the post show because I feel like if I was a little kid,

2235
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:47,680
I was like, do you know that Hitchcock movies end with a smacker?

2236
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:51,760
Like I would have been really just insufferable talking about smackers.

2237
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,360
That I mean, it's a good philosophy.

2238
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,720
We should incorporate that word.

2239
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:59,760
And if we're on the way out here, let me try to end with a smacker.

2240
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:03,520
Jordan, there's there's two videos that I haven't shown and they have the same title except one's

2241
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:04,640
part one, part two.

2242
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:05,520
I think maybe skip.

2243
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:06,320
Oh, we already saw.

2244
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,240
OK, no reveal.

2245
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:12,720
I was gonna see if we could surprise you guys with who's going to but let's this is a smacker.

2246
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:16,960
Nonetheless, yeah, this is let's bring some more great kid.

2247
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:20,320
Now that we've tied together Buffalo Bill and Leatherface and Norman Bates,

2248
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:25,360
let's bring another character into it via a Universal Studios Florida promotional video

2249
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:28,240
from the late 80s telling people what was going to be there.

2250
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:30,880
Let's just play and see.

2251
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:36,240
Good evening fellow tourists.

2252
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,160
I was on top of these stairs.

2253
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,120
But the second murder took place.

2254
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:48,560
Master, let's cause it because the listener can't know what's going on.

2255
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:51,440
Oh, that's Sebastian Jackal actor Christopher Lloyd.

2256
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,440
You may know him mainly deadly game.

2257
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,520
That's the character he played on UPN's Deadly Games.

2258
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,600
But he also played the character Doc Brown.

2259
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:04,880
And there's I don't think we've really talked about this that Doc Brown runs around

2260
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:10,320
and sees all the he travels to the future of 1990 to see all of the things that are

2261
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,640
going to be at Universal Florida, which brings him.

2262
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:17,920
We got to cover every bit of this, but he ends up face to face with all this crazy other

2263
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:18,880
iconography.

2264
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:23,520
But here he is snuck up into the psycho house where Alfred Hitchcock is talking and explaining

2265
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:24,720
how he shot the scene.

2266
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:30,320
And then very strangely, he says master, which is I get what you're saying.

2267
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:33,040
He's a master filmmaker, but it's weird.

2268
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:35,040
Yeah, it doesn't feel like something Doc Brown would say.

2269
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:35,840
Master of suspense.

2270
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:36,320
No.

2271
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,880
Why would yeah, why wouldn't you just say the master of suspense?

2272
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:39,380
Master.

2273
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:41,280
Yeah, I know it's odd.

2274
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:41,920
Really weird.

2275
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:45,840
But then we get a little more into the Doc Brown voice, I'd say, with what he says after

2276
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:46,340
this.

2277
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:06,240
Weird, weird little mini Doc Brown monologue about why Hitchcock's a great director.

2278
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:12,080
But then if you could pull up the other video, this is a smacker.

2279
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:13,760
Imagine just imagine watching.

2280
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:16,960
You think you're watching the end of Psycho and then you get this.

2281
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:22,480
This is the scene where this is Vera Mile, right, is walking up to what she thinks is

2282
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:26,560
Norman Bates' mother in the room with just one light.

2283
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,160
And this happens.

2284
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:39,120
And the chair turns around, but it's we know it's going to be a corpse, right?

2285
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:43,920
It's Doc.

2286
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:46,480
Wait, stop, pause it, pause it.

2287
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:51,280
Doc Brown is Norman's mother.

2288
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:51,680
Yeah.

2289
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:54,160
Twist, but then further twist.

2290
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:58,880
Then it cuts to Doc Brown regular at the door watching this and he gets scared.

2291
01:41:58,880 --> 01:41:59,120
Right.

2292
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:00,320
So this is like a trippy.

2293
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:02,240
This is like Doc Brown's having a nightmare.

2294
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:04,080
He's seeing himself as Norman Bates' mother.

2295
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:08,000
Or he's he's messed with the time stream so much he's actually running to himself.

2296
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,240
Which we know he's not supposed to do.

2297
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:13,680
They do all the time in the movies, but you're not supposed to do that.

2298
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:15,280
Yeah, well, OK, so he's being cautious.

2299
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:17,840
If you see yourself, get out of there.

2300
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:20,720
Yeah, because also he really probably didn't know what the hell, what happened here.

2301
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:22,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2302
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:23,040
I don't know.

2303
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:27,360
This is beyond this is more like a being John Malkovich, like some surreal.

2304
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:28,640
Why is my face on this?

2305
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:29,200
I don't know.

2306
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:36,000
There's a little tale more to then some people come in and remove the grandma or the mother

2307
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:37,760
prosthetics.

2308
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:39,040
Yeah, so this is great.

2309
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:43,840
Well, I think we did I think we did a little of this on the fake Doc Brown episode, perhaps.

2310
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,440
Yeah, or a different maybe a different one.

2311
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:47,120
But yes, this is such a weird.

2312
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:50,240
It also like isn't necessarily the character of Doc Brown.

2313
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:52,400
He seems to love the magic of the movies.

2314
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:53,680
Well, check this out.

2315
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:54,720
This is the rest of this.

2316
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:56,320
Nothing more magical.

2317
01:42:57,680 --> 01:43:00,560
Makeup cosmetic beautification.

2318
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:01,060
Wrong.

2319
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:03,040
Horrific mutation.

2320
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:08,080
Live horror makeup show with a secret of horror unfold before your very eyes.

2321
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:10,960
Whoa, it's two attractions.

2322
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:11,600
Yeah, yeah.

2323
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:16,560
Then he ties it to the horror makeup show, which we'll do down the road maybe next year.

2324
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:18,320
You know what?

2325
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:21,040
This is one where I would we've said we've criticized this before,

2326
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:25,200
like on the Benicio del Toro opening of Guardians of the Galaxy the Ride.

2327
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:28,560
This is maybe one where you don't you want him to like suggest that he's Doc Brown,

2328
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:31,760
but not be Doc Brown, where it's like I'm Christopher.

2329
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:34,880
And like he's acting like a little like Doc Brown, but you don't want it in continuity

2330
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:38,480
because it doesn't make any sense that Doc Brown loves movies.

2331
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:39,120
I don't know.

2332
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:44,160
Well, he loves Edison and Edison had a lot to do with early movie technology.

2333
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:49,680
I forget what exactly, but no, he would love all of the and the knife ever never actually entered

2334
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:51,440
revolution rope.

2335
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:53,040
It's all one shot or so.

2336
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:58,240
The magic of the movies would have you believe I just I use the time machine to go back

2337
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:03,520
and see that first screening of the train coming right at you so I could see a whole crowd go.

2338
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:05,920
Everyone jumped away.

2339
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:06,400
They thought I was real.

2340
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,200
I've been proven wrong.

2341
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:07,520
You're right.

2342
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:08,400
It should be Doc Brown.

2343
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:10,560
I just wish there was movies.

2344
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:14,640
Yeah, I wish he just had talked more about the movies he loves in the back to the future movies.

2345
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:16,800
I'm sure he will in Back to the Future 4 through 6.

2346
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:18,320
Sure.

2347
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:22,720
That will happen as soon as Zemeckis pass away.

2348
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:23,220
Sure.

2349
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:25,680
Honestly, maybe before.

2350
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:26,560
Well, who knows?

2351
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:27,360
Anything's possible.

2352
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:32,640
I was kind of hoping this that reminded me of another universal video that we haven't

2353
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:38,240
done, but I feel like we have to do an episode on the John Forsythe souvenir video you could buy.

2354
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:38,880
Oh, yes.

2355
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,560
For like $40.

2356
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:44,160
And I think there was a Florida one and a Hollywood one.

2357
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:46,640
So if you want to talk micro targeting.

2358
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:47,040
Yeah.

2359
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:47,920
Yeah, both.

2360
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:48,400
Oh, God.

2361
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:49,440
Well, I would love to.

2362
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:50,800
I love those so much.

2363
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:53,040
Movies are the wizard's wand.

2364
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,520
We've brought it up in bits and pieces.

2365
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:59,200
Yes, let's do that soon for sure.

2366
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:02,960
But I checked that for interesting clips.

2367
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:07,840
And can you imagine that how they addressed this was John Forsythe, who is an actor on

2368
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:10,080
Charlie's Angels, by the way, who's very...

2369
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:11,680
I only know this.

2370
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,440
Charlie's Angels.

2371
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:17,920
Farrah Fawcett's luminous hair.

2372
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:22,320
So I have the poster in my garage.

2373
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:23,360
What can I say?

2374
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:24,160
I'm a man.

2375
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:28,640
Could you dye it a little more platinum?

2376
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:36,080
I was going to say, if you can imagine what John Forsythe did in that video, as we've

2377
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:41,200
been doing the whole time, is walking up turning profile and saying, good evening.

2378
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:41,840
Nice.

2379
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,360
You can't resist it.

2380
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:44,720
We couldn't resist it.

2381
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:44,960
No.

2382
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:46,560
We had to do it the whole time.

2383
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:51,200
And he made all these great movies, but what we're going to know him for...

2384
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:52,000
This is what I'm saying.

2385
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:55,360
He's going to feel like a theme park character in 100 years.

2386
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:57,920
He's a guy who said, good evening.

2387
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:59,360
And he was very retunned.

2388
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:00,880
That's all we'll know.

2389
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:01,760
He was like Shrek.

2390
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,600
Like Shrek after him.

2391
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:04,320
He's just laying there.

2392
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:08,560
This is the space where the big bulbous characters live.

2393
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:09,680
The ogres.

2394
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:11,200
Shrek and Hitchcock.

2395
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:16,560
Psycho, North by Northwest, Vertigo, one or two others might sustain.

2396
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:19,840
But then the perspective will be like, you know who directed those?

2397
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:20,880
The Good Evening Guy.

2398
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:22,880
That guy.

2399
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:24,800
I thought he was just from commercials.

2400
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:26,480
Made movies too.

2401
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:29,200
They're going to look, he's going to be deep faked before we know it.

2402
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:30,880
And he'll be in stuff again.

2403
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:34,400
And he'll be doing intros and there'll be a new Alfred Hitchcock hour.

2404
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:35,120
Sure.

2405
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:35,840
Or whatever it was.

2406
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,120
Let's get him on the show.

2407
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:44,640
We could get an AI Alfred Hitchcock saying like, sign the Change.org petition to bring back Shrek.

2408
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:48,400
Forever Dog's making acquisitions lately too.

2409
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:52,320
So Brett, if you're listening, could you acquire the deep fake rights to Alfred Hitchcock?

2410
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:56,160
And have we have his likeness rights and we can do a podcast as him.

2411
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:59,200
Well, that'd be a big boost for Forever Dog.

2412
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:02,080
Alfred Hitchcock presents the podcast.

2413
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:02,640
We'll do it.

2414
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:05,840
But you know, why do the deep?

2415
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:07,760
If it's just audio, why do the deep fake?

2416
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:09,040
Well, we have video here.

2417
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:09,440
Yes.

2418
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,240
Oh yeah, true.

2419
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:11,120
You want maybe the whole thing.

2420
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:15,440
But if you need a little help filling in the voice, we got Mike to do it.

2421
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:19,280
It's like 95% of the errors.

2422
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:20,560
It's pretty close.

2423
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:22,400
It's kind of an easy one to do.

2424
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:23,440
It's kind of a satisfying.

2425
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:24,720
Don't cut him down like that.

2426
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:25,680
Well, no, sorry.

2427
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,400
Difficult to master.

2428
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:30,480
The master of the master of suspense.

2429
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:31,840
I'll be, master!

2430
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,640
I'll have mastered it by Tuesday.

2431
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:36,640
Oh, so it's too late.

2432
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:37,680
The episode's done.

2433
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:42,320
Oh, well, but when I do this podcast on Forever Dog, the official Alfred Hitchcock podcast.

2434
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:42,800
Yeah.

2435
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:43,680
Is it really him?

2436
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:44,720
Did they reanimate?

2437
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:48,960
Did they dig him up from the grave like Ed Gein would do with his bodies?

2438
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:49,520
No, no, no.

2439
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:53,440
It's a modern mimic named Mike Carlson.

2440
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:55,680
I'll wear his skin if we don't get the deep fake rights.

2441
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:57,520
If it's still around.

2442
01:47:57,520 --> 01:47:58,400
I don't know that it's around.

2443
01:47:58,400 --> 01:47:59,840
I would have wanted that.

2444
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:00,720
Where my skin?

2445
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:02,400
He's probably buried 10 minutes from here.

2446
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:03,040
Probably.

2447
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:04,400
Let's go dig up.

2448
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:05,520
I looked it up.

2449
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:06,960
He was buried at sea.

2450
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:07,280
What?

2451
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:08,400
Isn't that weird?

2452
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:09,680
Yeah, ashes at sea.

2453
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:11,760
Well, we got to get his ashes, put them back together.

2454
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:12,720
Jason, get your sailor.

2455
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:15,600
He loved making lifeboats so much.

2456
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:17,440
Jason, get your sailor boy outfit on.

2457
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:18,560
We're going out to sea.

2458
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:23,200
All right, Mike, get your giant t-shirt with Stitch on it looking pissed.

2459
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:24,000
All right, great.

2460
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:28,720
Don't send me on a recovering ashes mission until I've had my coffee.

2461
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:32,800
Mike, you say it last.

2462
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:36,000
You got to do it as the man.

2463
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,520
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

2464
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:38,720
I was like, what is he talking about?

2465
01:48:41,120 --> 01:48:42,080
You've survived.

2466
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:44,720
Podcast the ride.

2467
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:48,240
Right as Jordan pulls up a picture of a Hitchcock.

2468
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:48,740
Funko.

2469
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:51,680
It all ties together.

2470
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:52,960
It connects.

2471
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:56,160
The circle has been looped around too.

2472
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:56,880
What's the word?

2473
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:59,440
Someone roast me for not saying the phrase correctly.

2474
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:04,240
So yes, you survived.

2475
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:05,600
You could find us on the socials.

2476
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:07,440
Marriottie's Funko Pop.

2477
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:09,360
There is one of him?

2478
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:10,000
Yeah.

2479
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:10,880
That's a lot of-

2480
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:11,600
Who's Becker?

2481
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:14,240
Is he another Funko part of Funko, I think?

2482
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:15,120
I think he's another guy.

2483
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:16,080
Presumably.

2484
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:19,920
To fucking be these guys, you've got all the Funko plastic that you're ready.

2485
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,200
You could do whatever you want with them.

2486
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:23,520
There's a Jordan Blum Funko Pop too.

2487
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:24,480
Oh, sure.

2488
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:25,760
They got the director series.

2489
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:28,160
These guys would be Ed Gein's now.

2490
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:34,320
If they- Ed Gein had to resort to being creative with corpses and skin because that was all he had.

2491
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:40,080
If he had a bunch of plastic like Marriottie, maybe he would have made some great toys instead.

2492
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:40,720
Yeah.

2493
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:41,440
I think it's- yeah.

2494
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:42,560
It's a real shame.

2495
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:44,160
Anyway, you know what's not a shame?

2496
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:49,600
The great bonus material that's available on our socials at Podcast the Ride, the merch in our T

2497
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:52,080
Public Store, including for Haunt Cast the Fright.

2498
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:56,640

2500
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:01,520
We've got to spookify that.

2501
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:05,360
You can get one more bonus there on our new tier.

2502
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:08,800
You can find all that at patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

2503
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:13,040
And thanks to Jordan Black Cats.

2504
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:14,000
How about that?

2505
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,040
Spookified.

2506
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:15,600
Pretty good.

2507
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:22,000
At Forever Rabbit Dog for producing this episode.

2508
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:24,800
On the second gate, Munsters 2002.

2509
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:27,120
Coming up on Club 3 is voted by the audience.

2510
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:28,240
2022.

2511
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:28,960
What'd I say?

2512
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:29,920
2002?

2513
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:30,160
Fuck.

2514
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:30,560
I'm gonna-

2515
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:30,960
Got him!

2516
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:31,520
No!

2517
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:32,560
Don't roast me!

2518
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:33,200
Wrong year, moron!

2519
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:35,520
Let's end it before I fuck it up more.

2520
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,240
Wrong year.

2521
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:36,880
Damn it.

2522
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:38,080
So much roasting.

2523
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:39,920
You end it with a smacker.

2524
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:42,720
Bye.

01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:46,160
