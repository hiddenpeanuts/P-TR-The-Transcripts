1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,800
Warning, the following podcast contains these ingredients.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,800
Riffing, out of left field tangents,

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,760
chuckles, and equal parts sincerity and irony.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,600
Guest Candice LeRae joins us to talk treats

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,600
on today's delicious podcast, The Ride.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:46,200
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast whose definition of treats ranges

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,360
from ice cream and cookies to mid-Atlantic specific meats like Scrapple.

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,360
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Scrapple enthusiast Jason Sheridan.

11
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,760
I don't know if I consider that a treat so much as a staple.

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,200
Like, there's something good and reliable to have in the house.

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,760
So you've completely rejected my premise immediately.

14
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,760
Yeah, sure.

15
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
All right, fine.

16
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
So I'll amend that.

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,240
Some people, you could consider it a treat.

18
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,380
But wouldn't you say that donuts are a staple as well?

19
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,800
But they're also a treat.

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,920
No, I think they're a treat.

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,240
But don't you have a donut every day?

22
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,320
Well, let's bring Scott Gartner in here to weigh in on this very important topic.

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,320
Yeah, I hear what he's saying.

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,520
A treat implies that you don't have it all the time.

25
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,600
But if you're having Scrapple on the daily, then it's hardly a deviation from the norm.

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Right.

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,440
But if Scrapple is something you have once in a while, wouldn't it be sort of like a

28
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
treat staple?

29
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,880
Like, as a once in a while fun staple, Jason?

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,720
So there's staples, there's treats and there's treat staples.

31
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,960
These are different categories.

32
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,240
That's what I'm getting at.

33
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,240
But I think once in a while does not imply a staple.

34
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,320
OK, that's fine.

35
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,840
No, no, that's correct. A staple would mean a staple means it's like one of your in the

36
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,680
front infantry of treats.

37
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,120
It is deployed the most often as an occasional thing.

38
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,960
Right. You know, maybe during the course of this episode, we'll figure out all the lanes

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,480
that the foods go in.

40
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,760
Sure. We obviously have a lot of important work to do today as far as organization, as

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,440
far as figuring out where things go.

42
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,920
Got a lot of field clearing to do.

43
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,920
It's going to be like like pretty tough physical labor, I feel.

44
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,760
But let's bring our guest in.

45
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,440
I'm sure she has a lot of thoughts on Scrapple and other treats.

46
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,680
You know her from WWE NXT.

47
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,840
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Candice LeRae.

48
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,080
She's here.

49
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,920
Hello. I'm really pumped to be here.

50
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,440
Yeah, one of my favorite topics.

51
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,120
You're like one of us.

52
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,440
You know, you're very hardcore when it comes to all of this stuff.

53
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,880
Yes. And actually, my husband has created a monster.

54
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,160
He is really on top of looking everything up and knowing everything there is to know

55
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,360
about everything that we could possibly eat, especially in theme in theme parks.

56
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,960
So, OK, I'm an expert now because of him.

57
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,520
Before, I was just OK.

58
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,720
But now. So he checks new

59
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,680
seasonal items. Yes.

60
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,880
So the Epcot Food and Wine Festival, is that something he'll know, like

61
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,640
the entire lineup for?

62
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes. And we will like print out the menus before we go.

63
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,200
And we always go in with a game plan.

64
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,200
Like, we kind of know what we want, what we don't want,

65
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,880
because I think that when people go to something,

66
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,200
I mean, anytime there's seasonal seasonal stuff, you may go in

67
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,400
and you get really pumped to eat all this stuff and then you get ahead of yourself.

68
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,160
You eat too much, too fast, and then you're full.

69
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,960
So he has this completely planned out to where we don't get full, too fast.

70
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,360
And we space everything out.

71
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,840
It's a whole system he has. It's crazy.

72
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,120
Wow. OK, so you have like sort of like a book report.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,200
Long. Yes. Interesting.

74
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,400
Is there does do you have like a general strategy

75
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,600
when you're going to like one of those festivals?

76
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,560
Is there like you hit savory foods first, you hit sweets later?

77
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,480
That's where it gets a little tricky because I'm a savory person.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,240
And Johnny is very much so a sweets person, like the ultimate sweets person.

79
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,240
And I mean, for instance, if we wake up in the morning, he's like,

80
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,640
let's get a bunch of donuts.

81
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,440
My the first thing I'm going to tell him is we got to get something else

82
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,360
because I can't just eat a bunch of donuts.

83
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,360
That's so much sugar in so little time.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,520
So like we kind of it works out because we will go to a stand

85
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,400
and we're like, oh, they have a sweet thing, but they also have a savory thing.

86
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,560
We want both. And we can get both.

87
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,480
I'm going to eat more of the savory. He's going to eat more of the sweet.

88
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,040
It's like perfect harmony.

89
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,080
It actually works out for us.

90
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,160
It's a balance. We have a nice balance. Sure.

91
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,280
If it's just like a general theme park visit, though,

92
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,160
like if you're just going to say Epcot or you're going to the Magic Kingdom

93
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,000
for a night, is there a strategy always or is this just sort of a normal game

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,520
plan at that point?

95
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,400
I guess it depends if there's seasonal stuff out or if there I mean,

96
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,320
and it seems any more, there's always seasonal stuff. But.

97
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,880
Yeah, it just depends.

98
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,400
Like nowadays, there's so many seasonal options out there,

99
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,720
and it just depends on if we've had all that stuff.

100
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,200
And then it also depends on if it is a cheat day or not,

101
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,040
because we can't always just go and eat a bunch of snacks.

102
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,520
Well, he can't always go and eat a bunch of snacks.

103
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,640
But I like to bend that rule a bit. Sure.

104
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,560
Yeah. I mean,

105
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,600
ideally, we try to fit something in,

106
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,120
even if we're not technically on a cheat day.

107
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,800
But it really depends on if it's worth it at that point to cheat.

108
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,200
I got to be worth it.

109
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,360
What would you say? Like, what is a treat that's worth it?

110
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,440
What are the top?

111
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,120
Like, I guess we're probably I mean, we're going to talk a lot of treats here.

112
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,960
But what are the top treats?

113
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,640
Like, what are we like all of us? What are our top?

114
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,240
Like if even if we're feeling like we shouldn't be eating something,

115
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,320
but we see it, we're right by it.

116
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,440
Me, it's like the double like on Main Street.

117
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,080
If I get like a double scoop cone with sprinkles on the outside,

118
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,600
we'll usually get that.

119
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,360
Even if I should.

120
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,200
I feel like I can always convince myself that a dole whip is OK.

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,760
I'm like, oh, you know, like, it's not really that bad.

122
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,080
Even if it's on top of like the little pineapple upside down cake,

123
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,880
I like that isn't really that bad.

124
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,240
It's fruit. It's nutritious.

125
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,080
Yeah, it's just fruit.

126
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,440
It's just liquid fruit.

127
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,320
I think it's even dairy free. Yeah.

128
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
Yes. Yeah.

129
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,280
Can't go wrong.

130
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,720
So we'll talk about how many carbs are in that fruit, but it's mostly.

131
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,840
You need it, though, because it's energy.

132
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,480
It's energy. Sugar is energy.

133
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,960
Fruit is energy.

134
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,840
That's a good point.

135
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,800
The big risk is if you don't have enough treats.

136
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,680
And the biggest health thing would be if you if your energy was low

137
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,280
and you like collapsed and hit your head on the curb on Main Street or something.

138
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,800
It's vital to have all of these traits.

139
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,760
Yeah, it's a necessity.

140
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,720
There's a lot of like you need something.

141
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,040
There's a lot of lying to ourselves that goes into eating a lot of this stuff.

142
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,360
No, are we lying?

143
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,720
I mean, is it a lie?

144
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,640
I mean, there's a truth.

145
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,360
There's a hint of truth.

146
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,680
It's a bend. Bending the truth is what it is.

147
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,560
Yeah. Do any of you guys think before a theme park

148
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,920
visit, like in the several days prior,

149
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,320
I have to like be on my good.

150
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,640
I have to be on the best possible diet to allow myself

151
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,160
this amount of cheating,

152
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,600
because you know that's like inherent to the theme park experience.

153
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,320
Or do you not think about it, especially because probably all of us

154
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,080
just end up at theme parks without realizing it, because we go for the moment.

155
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,480
Yeah, I'm going to go with no.

156
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,200
I do not get that any thought, but I probably should as I get older.

157
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,800
I think my tree plan is usually dependent on how like

158
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,320
if I'm going to be there a full day or if I'm going to be there like a half day.

159
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,240
Like if I'm going to be there all day,

160
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,520
I find I like burn energy quickly.

161
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,760
Like I get hungry a lot.

162
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,680
Sure. Oh, yeah.

163
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,800
I don't have that.

164
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,840
Like if I'm just sitting at home, like working and stuff like I don't

165
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,360
I don't eat that many times in a day.

166
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,960
But if I'm like walking eight to ten miles a day in a theme park.

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,440
Yeah, I think I'd get more hungry.

168
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,880
Yeah, you need more calories.

169
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,600
Yeah, you need more calories. You just need more.

170
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,920
Yeah, but since I of course, usually have ice cream at home,

171
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,040
I usually like to get something a little more at the park, either

172
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,000
like a milkshake.

173
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,560
Not that many places have milkshakes or sundaes or something a little

174
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,960
little extra. Sure.

175
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,560
But like something needs to be added.

176
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,360
You can't it can't just be something you could scoop out of a carton.

177
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,240
I feel the same way about alcoholic beverages.

178
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,600
If the bartender can do something, it's not just opening a bottle

179
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,640
of something I could buy at the grocery store.

180
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,400
Yeah, I want I want a little flair.

181
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,040
I want some little doodad on it.

182
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,720
Well, let's you know what, Scott, Scott brings up a doodad,

183
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,200
which makes me think of an idea he's had, which will segue perfectly

184
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,120
into talking about the fact that you worked at Universal Studios.

185
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,800
I did as was that was your official title, Baker, or were you in?

186
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,560
Yeah, you were.

187
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,800
So you were a baker at Universal Studios.

188
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,040
Scott, this reminds me because Scott had a great idea for a drink at Universal,

189
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,360
which I'll never forget.

190
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,880
It's the he wanted a sugar Mr.

191
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,080
DNA in a cocktail.

192
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,560
From Jurassic Park, a little character.

193
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,760
Oh, my God.

194
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,680
You should think with the eye.

195
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,400
Yeah, which is, I think, a fantastic idea.

196
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,280
Because, you know, it's universal.

197
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,720
You have less opportunities to have treats that look like characters.

198
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,840
I feel like the Grinch and the minions have opened things up for them

199
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,840
significantly, but I think there's there's a lot more they could be doing.

200
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,600
And granted, the properties are a little more limited.

201
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,840
It's maybe weird to do like a cupcake that looks like an Apollo 13 console

202
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,400
or whatever the hell their properties are.

203
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,480
But, you know, Mr.

204
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,680
DNA is sitting right there.

205
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,040
Beloved universal character.

206
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,920
Yeah, that shouldn't be easy to.

207
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,680
Yes.

208
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,280
Very basic.

209
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,520
So how long did you work as a baker?

210
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,160
So I worked there for two years and then

211
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,680
that wrestling was going well for me.

212
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,040
So I did the crazy,

213
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,240
probably not adult thing and left my baking job for my wrestling.

214
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,120
It worked out. Yeah, it did.

215
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,680
Yeah, none of it sounds very adults.

216
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,400
That's all like a little kid fantasy.

217
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:14,480
That's I will say to you, I know I had I applied at Disney first

218
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,120
and they said that you needed more experience, which is fine.

219
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,160
I get that.

220
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,120
And I went to Universal and originally the baking position wasn't a thing.

221
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,720
It just said cook.

222
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,360
And I was like, well, I have like a full culinary degree.

223
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,160
I'll just do I'll do that. That's fine.

224
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,440
I like cooking.

225
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,200
And I went in for my interview and you had to take a test first.

226
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,920
And they asked me, they said, oh, you didn't specify which test

227
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,640
you wanted to take. And I was so confused.

228
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,800
I was like, what?

229
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,440
And they said, do you want the baking test or do you want the cooking one?

230
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,600
And like, I lost my mind because I was like,

231
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,960
I want to be a baker so badly.

232
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,240
And I took the baking test, was not prepared for the baking test.

233
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,520
So I thought I was going to vomit.

234
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,760
But I passed.

235
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,040
I only missed like three on the test.

236
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,760
The chef talked to me because I lived at the time I was in Riverside,

237
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,200
which is a good solid hour and a half away from Universal.

238
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,560
So the chef was a little worried about that commute every day.

239
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,760
But I mean, the hour and a half commute is not bad when you're working,

240
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,760
you know, 12 hour shifts.

241
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,520
And it was such a great like I didn't feel like I was working at all.

242
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,400
I loved it so much.

243
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,480
We got to do so many cool things like we because the bakery there,

244
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,080
I don't think a lot of people realize the bakery in the production kitchen

245
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,480
also cater events that happen on property.

246
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,960
So we got to do a lot of movie premieres, television premieres,

247
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,200
like just so many cool events that were happening that nobody would have ever

248
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,240
guessed that we got to cater for.

249
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,680
So every day you walk in and it's like you just don't know

250
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,360
what you're going to be doing or what to expect is just such a cool job.

251
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,920
I literally never felt like I was working.

252
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,600
Wow, that's great. I'll play.

253
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,880
I have a lot of questions about everything you just said,

254
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,320
and I'm going to go in chronological order.

255
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,960
The first one, what is what does the baking test consist of?

256
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,400
Well, they ask you a lot of questions, you know, because you have to be.

257
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,640
I was served safe certified at the time, so they'll ask you a lot of things

258
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,360
like temperatures and, you know, you don't want eggs just hanging out,

259
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,280
not staying cold.

260
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,640
You want to know what temperatures things have to be to be done

261
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,960
because you want to get people sick.

262
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,760
So basically that and cleanliness, things of that nature

263
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,000
is basically what the test was.

264
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,880
And then like the thing is that there are some things

265
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,360
that they're going to ask you in a baking test that I mean, you don't need for a baker.

266
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,240
You don't necessarily need to know what temperature chicken needs to be

267
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,680
for chicken to be done.

268
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,200
But if I was going to take the cooking test, that was something I needed to know.

269
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,560
So so you might you may have had a lot more trouble with a cooking test,

270
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,680
and maybe that was not a job you wanted anyway.

271
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,160
So luckily, I had just gotten out of culinary school.

272
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,240
So I I had already taken all these crazy exams where they're asking you like symptoms

273
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,080
and they're like, what does this person have equalized salmonella?

274
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,480
And you just have to know. Yeah, it's crazy.

275
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,760
Don't ask me now. It's been far too long.

276
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,400
But yeah, you had to know based on somebody's symptoms,

277
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,120
what it could have been because you have to indicate

278
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,120
and be able to kind of figure out where the problems stem from.

279
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,400
It's yeah.

280
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,600
If it's just a brain freeze, that's not as big of a problem as a

281
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,840
an equalized seizure or whatever.

282
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,880
Yeah, maybe not.

283
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,880
Maybe it's very common to survive.

284
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,160
Unless it's just a level 10 brain freeze.

285
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,760
I kind of want to see if we can find this test and that we could take it.

286
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,320
I would be interested if we could guess what what the problem is based on like

287
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,080
the food illness.

288
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,360
You could probably do any serve safe certification type

289
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,440
exam, because a lot of the questions are the same. Yeah.

290
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,760
It's crazy what you have to know to be able to or what you should know

291
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,040
to be able to work in a kitchen.

292
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,720
We're looking for ways to kill time during quarantine.

293
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,680
So maybe we should all take a baking test and see if.

294
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,960
Go get served.

295
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,600
They said that's our next Twitch stream is taking the serve safe

296
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,480
certification test.

297
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,320
So, yeah, that's that's fun.

298
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,480
So you did that for two years at Universal.

299
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,960
Was there ever any consideration into anything else at Universal?

300
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,560
I mean, you are a performer as well.

301
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,400
Were you ever thinking of being the New York Street

302
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,240
Miss Fear characters or anything?

303
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,800
Well, so this is I'm one of the people.

304
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,600
Johnny and I are very different in this respect.

305
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,680
Like he is such a like I would love to be in the center

306
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,600
of the world and everybody all eyes on me.

307
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,880
And he's like such a performer, which is why he's so great at what he does.

308
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,200
But I am like outside of wrestling.

309
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,840
I'm kind of like, well, I'll just stay behind the scenes.

310
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,480
And like, I love wrestling and I'm confident in wrestling.

311
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,280
But if you ask me to go and perform something else

312
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,120
in front of a bunch of strangers, I'd be so insecure and like, oh, my gosh.

313
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,880
Nobody looks at me. Shakespeare.

314
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,280
I did. I loved acting when I was a kid.

315
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,120
And I like performing in front of like friends and family.

316
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,880
But I just oh, my gosh, I get so insecure about how ridiculous.

317
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,920
Like, I just I'm so hard on myself that I'm going to just

318
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,560
automatically assume I'm the worst at acting.

319
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,280
I should never do it again.

320
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,360
So I'd rather just stick to my little comfort zone there with wrestling.

321
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,600
Gotcha. So that will be my performance in front of people.

322
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,120
That feels a little fitting in terms of like the baking job,

323
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,680
because like you would be going in, I'm assuming

324
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,360
bakers traditionally start very early.

325
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,440
You would be going in while much of the world is still asleep.

326
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,520
I'm assuming I.

327
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,320
Yes, I used to wake up at 10 p.m.

328
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,120
so that I could get ready and drive from Riverside

329
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,040
to Universal and my shift started at one in the morning.

330
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,360
And I'd work one in the morning until one p.m.

331
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,600
a lot of days. Yeah.

332
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,920
And you were juggling an independent wrestling schedule, right? With that.

333
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,800
Yes. So they I made it.

334
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,880
I actually had put the wrestling thing on my resume because I was like,

335
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,640
this guy's not going to forget me.

336
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,240
If nothing else, the chef who's interviewing me, he's not going to forget me.

337
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,920
And he had a lot of questions about that, of course.

338
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,160
But like he hired me on the spot.

339
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,760
And so he knew that I was going to be doing this commute.

340
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,840
And like the wrestling thing was made very clear to them from the beginning,

341
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,800
because like if you work at a theme park, you have to kind of accept

342
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,800
that a lot of weekends are gone. Yeah.

343
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,640
Like, but most wrestling shows happen on weekends.

344
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,400
So to find the balance, I used to wrestle a lot of California shows

345
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,560
and depending on where the show was, like, for instance, the one promotion,

346
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,200
PwG is based out of Rosita.

347
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,680
So at the time, Rosita, I used to work my shift and I'd get off

348
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,000
a little bit early that day.

349
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,840
And so I'd start at one a.m.

350
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,320
And then a lot of times I'd get off.

351
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,680
I told them maybe 11 at the latest just because I had to go back home.

352
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,800
I'd go all the way back to Riverside so that I could shower,

353
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,760
get ready, get my bag packed, and then I drive back out to Rosita,

354
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,200
which is again, another hour and a half.

355
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,960
It's based it's closer to universal than Riverside.

356
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,360
But I would wrestle

357
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,760
and the shows would get over so late, like the latest

358
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,680
they could possibly be over.

359
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,440
I'd be getting home at like three, four in the morning, sleeping.

360
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,600
And then I'd wake up and my they would work it to where

361
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,000
my next shift wouldn't start until two p.m. the next day.

362
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,680
So I get like a nice little bit of time in between.

363
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,040
I didn't want to have to ask weekends off.

364
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,640
You know, you never went from Rosita right into work.

365
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,120
No, I did have a few times

366
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,680
where I'd wrestle in Northern California and I would go.

367
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,120
My my tag partner and I, I'd drop my car off at his place

368
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,560
because he lived in in L.A.

369
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,320
So I dropped my car off at his.

370
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,560
We'd go like six, eight hours to North Cal, depending on where the show was.

371
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,760
We'd wrestle.

372
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,360
Get in the car, drive back, and then I would get in my my truck

373
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,280
and I'd park it in the park in the Jurassic Parking Garage,

374
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,680
and I would just like nap in the back seat of my truck until my shift started.

375
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,840
Hey, you got to do what you got to do. Yeah.

376
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,960
Who among us has not had a little nappy in Jurassic Park?

377
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,040
Yeah, it was hard.

378
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,840
Sometimes, though, T-Rex is everywhere.

379
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,600
It is hard, though, because they do have security that'll go through.

380
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,600
I had so many co-workers tell me that they would have security

381
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,920
knocking on their car windows to wake them up and ask them why they're sleeping there.

382
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,560
And then I go, I my shift starts soon.

383
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,280
I don't know. What do you want me to do?

384
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,080
But I luckily was my I had a truck at the time.

385
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,560
So the back seat, I could hide back there and go undetected.

386
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,680
You were smuggling yourself.

387
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,840
It never raises.

388
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,560
Yeah, it never raises red flags because so many people,

389
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,040
especially since a lot of times I would get there while people were still,

390
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,800
you know, if you're getting there at 1230 at night,

391
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,800
people were still at the nightclubs there.

392
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,520
Oh, like how the moon and stuff.

393
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,160
So there's still so many cars.

394
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,520
Yeah, there's so many cars that are just like parked there at all hours.

395
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,040
Your car. It was pretty surprising.

396
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,400
You ever get barfed on?

397
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,480
No, I see some some blue cocktail land on your window at one in the morning.

398
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,800
No.

399
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,200
Well, thank goodness you got to like take your 15 minute break

400
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,800
and witnessed last call at Howl at the Moon.

401
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,960
Like there was there was one time there was a concert going on.

402
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,160
And oh, my gosh, what was the theater there called?

403
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,560
I can't remember right now.

404
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,800
Yes, yes, yes.

405
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,880
So when the Gibson was there,

406
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,200
they used to kind of walk you through this little area that was kind of backstage ish.

407
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,600
And I think one time somebody got really, really, really drunk there

408
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,080
and managed to wander down the hill where the bakery was

409
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,400
and just came walking into the bakery at like one thirty two in the morning.

410
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,480
Or like this must have been the most ridiculous because we're like.

411
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,760
It was there were three of us in there, two girls and a guy.

412
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,160
And this person just comes walking in.

413
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,840
And we were like, this person came in so confidently, though.

414
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,920
We're going, how did they did they have a map of this place?

415
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,680
But then they ended up walking into the very dark, super walk in

416
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,720
freezer that we have.

417
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,000
And then that was the oh, they maybe don't know what the heck's going on.

418
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,440
So that's like pre security.

419
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,080
And so that's like pre crazy security, too. Right.

420
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,640
Yeah. Yeah.

421
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,880
And now that it's not there anymore, I don't think anybody can even.

422
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,080
I think it's just because, you know, like late nights when they have those concerts

423
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,640
and so many people being around.

424
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,400
It's just easy for somebody to very confidently walk by.

425
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,320
And I mean, there's so many of us that start work back there

426
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,760
that are just walking back there in general.

427
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,280
If he just got to the right place at the right time,

428
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,200
then nobody would have ever questioned it.

429
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,800
Is it possible that this drunkard is the one who started the late night fire

430
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,000
that burnt all of the music in the vault?

431
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,160
And King Kong, this guy, the conspiracy.

432
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,120
He spilled a beer and then like a lighter fell out of his pocket and

433
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,160
more muddy waters music.

434
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,760
It's all burned up on fire.

435
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,040
So what so which years did you work at Universal?

436
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,560
Did you and did you overlap with Scott? That's my question.

437
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,040
Oh, yes, I was a tour guide.

438
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,480
So it's usually.

439
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,560
I'm trying to I'm trying to remember the exact years like I'm

440
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:07,160
coming to find that as I get older, actual years really confused.

441
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,000
I remember years better when I had less going on.

442
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,640
It's easier to catalog

443
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,400
because anything that happened was doing anything at all.

444
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,680
Wow. It must be 2006.

445
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,640
There we go.

446
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,520
2012 to 2014 were my two years there.

447
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,680
OK, OK. A little bit later than.

448
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,960
Yeah, I was out of there like 2008, I believe.

449
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And you're saying you said there's no more bakery.

450
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,680
This is not there.

451
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,280
No, there's no more.

452
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,400
There's no more Gibson.

453
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,440
The amphitheater is gone because they had to put Harry Potter.

454
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,160
I was there while they were

455
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,520
in the transition of that and starting on the Harry Potter stuff.

456
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,040
Gotcha. OK, OK.

457
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,160
Well, thank God, because if there was no more bakery,

458
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,880
what a sad place they were.

459
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,320
So would be they did.

460
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,840
They did. After I left,

461
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,920
get a better.

462
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,360
I it's not necessarily it's more I would call it a donut factory.

463
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,760
They got a better donut factory for them

464
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,160
because it was a lot, a lot more complex

465
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,920
of a system when I was there than I what I think they have now.

466
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,680
So were you hand like you were hand making more donuts?

467
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,600
Like now they have like some sort of a machine to make those donuts.

468
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,920
They do have a machine.

469
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,200
I think it's I think it's for smaller donuts

470
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,360
because I don't know that they make something the size.

471
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,240
I don't know if they have a cutter now to cut out the Simpsons donut

472
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,720
because that is a whole thing.

473
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,240
And like you have to weigh the Simpsons donuts, too, because they have to be.

474
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,280
They all have to match in weight, not necessarily sized.

475
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:51,000
So is this kind of the primary universal dessert at this point?

476
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,920
Or was it when you were there? Is that like the crown jewel?

477
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,840
When I was there, if it was an off season,

478
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,640
we would do anywhere from like 70 to 100 ish donuts.

479
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,280
But then the most we would end up doing was during horror nights,

480
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,360
because basically during horror nights, the park is open 24 hours, essentially.

481
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,040
And so we'd have to have like four or five hundred donuts.

482
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,000
And like. And I feel like it was four or five hundred donuts

483
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,880
just for the normal park hours, plus a few more,

484
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,680
you know, a few hundred more for like the night. And.

485
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,760
We were basically frying donuts all day.

486
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,920
There was somebody in the bakery doing donuts, not one person, 24 hours at a time,

487
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:41,400
but there were different people going through, but donuts were being done 24

488
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:46,560
seven during horror nights. It's crazy how many people love these donuts.

489
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,000
And I think now they even have different kinds of the big donuts.

490
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,600
Yeah. The Simpsons.

491
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,840
I was just going to say the Simpsons donut is is consists of what I have to admit.

492
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,760
I've not had this donut. And what is the what is it?

493
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,320
Is it like a classic pink Homer donut?

494
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,720
Yeah. So I will say this, that when I first started working there

495
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,920
or before I started working there, I would just like go to the park as a guest.

496
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,520
I would never get this donut because I thought, oh, this just

497
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,160
it's probably been here for days, like, who knows?

498
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,720
And it's probably not even that good.

499
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,640
But then after being physically a part of the process of this donut,

500
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,400
like you realize that when you go there and you see the donuts that are there,

501
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,240
they made them that day.

502
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,440
Like they made them that morning. You don't get an old donut.

503
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,400
So the donuts at the end of the day, if they don't sell them,

504
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,440
they either send them home with the employees because there were a few times

505
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,000
where we'd make a few extra donuts just in case something happened.

506
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,680
And I would end up taking it home to my nieces or something, you know, like.

507
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,600
And I had no idea that I would love a Simpsons donut so much.

508
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,320
Jason has cut out.

509
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,640
He left to go get a job at Universal as soon as this is all over.

510
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,040
It is a very good donut.

511
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,320
It is. It is good.

512
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,160
You know, you share it with somebody, cut it in pieces or rip off pieces.

513
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,360
Like, it's great.

514
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,000
I was going to ask like how long they sit there, but that's good to know.

515
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,160
Anytime I've had it, I was like.

516
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,240
Impressed that it was so fresh.

517
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,920
Yeah, every day.

518
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,480
And high standards here in early enough, high standards here in Southern California.

519
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,440
There is a big donut shop culture.

520
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,440
Oh, yeah, they have the Grinch donut now, which I think is probably the same model.

521
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,000
It's just a different color food coloring, I assume, or different color frosting.

522
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,160
Yeah. When I was there, we used to have to do

523
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,040
when I very first started, like if I started during the holidays

524
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,360
in 2012 and so they were doing all kinds of Grinch things

525
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,520
and we were making mini donuts that we put in these bags.

526
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,160
But I think they decided because we were having at the time, we hand cut

527
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,200
all the donuts, even the little ones.

528
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,280
And when you're spending all this time

529
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,360
hand cutting all these teeny tiny little donuts and then dipping them all in

530
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,960
red and green icing, it's it just is a lot of

531
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,960
wasted time, really.

532
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,680
So now I'm glad they've moved on to like, hey, you know,

533
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,720
everybody just likes the big donuts anyway.

534
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,720
Like, I mean, let's be honest, everybody just wants a big giant donut.

535
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,320
If nothing else for the Instagram photos, so I don't want to bag a little donut.

536
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,360
That's interesting. Were you did it?

537
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,640
Was there kind of like a rise of

538
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,880
could you feel the influence of Instagram while you were there?

539
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,160
Is that that became so much more of a theme park thing?

540
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,920
Like, it's got to be really showy donuts that'll play on social media.

541
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,080
I don't know if it was such a big thing when I was there.

542
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,400
I feel like people were more into Twitter at the time.

543
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,080
And I don't I wish that the Instagram thing would have been.

544
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,360
Like, I don't know, I wish more people would have been into the Instagram

545
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,200
type food when I was there, because we tried to get adventurous

546
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,760
with some things sometimes, and it would have looked great.

547
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,120
And I think they would have just put it out into the parks

548
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,720
instead of just leaving it in our test kitchen,

549
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,840
because we did a lot of test kitchen stuff.

550
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,520
And there were some things that were so pretty,

551
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,200
but I even still haven't seen it make its way into the park. So

552
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,160
anything, anything, anything that like didn't make it

553
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,920
didn't make it out in the world.

554
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:34,240
OK, so, you know, like, there's a lot of moose type domes

555
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,040
that they've been doing at Disney a lot like.

556
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,280
Like if you go into Pandora and you want the little

557
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,600
the the chocolatey like moose dome, I can't remember my

558
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,600
why can't I think it's like, it's like the turtle we got.

559
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,800
I got for the electrical parade dinner we had, I think.

560
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,720
Sure. That's like a moose dome, a moose dome,

561
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,000
which is really a term we need to use more on this show.

562
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,920
Moose dome, moose dome.

563
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,000
Jason, don't you agree?

564
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,800
We've never said moose dome before, so I think we've just got a new phrase we like.

565
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,560
I agree 100 percent.

566
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,280
And I'm hoping I feel like a lot of theme parks,

567
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,160
one of their go to desserts, especially at the cafeteria style restaurants.

568
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,040
In the 90s, there was a big chocolate moose explosion,

569
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,280
probably because it's easy to make in bulk.

570
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,120
Oh, yeah, definitely.

571
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,440
And I want I want a return.

572
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,480
I want a return. I want a new moose renaissance.

573
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,080
And if it's got to look good for Instagram, so be it.

574
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,800
But I'm just I'm always down for chocolate moose.

575
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,000
Jason Sheridan under the moose dome.

576
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,040
Yeah.

577
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,320
The first I guess the right original film.

578
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,400
I agree with that, though, because they're very easy to make.

579
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,840
And you can just make a sheet cake and cut out a bunch of circles

580
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,520
and you have a little bit of cake in it, too.

581
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,280
And like we we test we tested them a long time ago.

582
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,920
But I just think that.

583
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,480
They. I don't I don't know.

584
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,120
Like we I think we did them for the VIP stuff every so often,

585
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,640
but I don't think that they were willing to put it into the parks just yet,

586
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,280
because I think it was still like too soon.

587
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,160
I maybe scare people because they couldn't post this fancy picture of it.

588
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:23,440
You know, was there frustration among all of you that like you had ideas

589
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,040
that were very good and people would like, but Universal would not allow

590
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,320
such a extravagant dessert at this point at that point?

591
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,320
Well, I just ended up because at one point, so

592
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,560
they I don't know if any of you have ever done one of the VIP

593
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,880
tours at Universal, but there's like lunch or breakfast

594
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,120
and there's a dessert that they have there and we cater that to.

595
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,960
So every day there's somebody who's in charge of making the desserts for VIP.

596
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,960
And it's like the job nobody wants.

597
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,840
And I don't know why, but it is stressful because you're

598
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:06,040
you're basically catering for anywhere from, you know, 50 to 200 people.

599
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,520
And they want at least six, seven different kinds of desserts.

600
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,800
They want different shapes. They want different flavors.

601
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,680
So you have to kind of do your own.

602
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,160
Like you don't have anybody that comes in and preps for you.

603
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,760
So you're doing your own prep and making all these desserts every day.

604
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,520
It tends to be a little stressful.

605
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,040
But and there's a deadline, which most of the other jobs, there's no deadline.

606
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,120
They say, hey, we need more of this.

607
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,400
So let's get it out, you know, by this amount of, you know,

608
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,720
like by the end of the day, have at least this or and people have already prepped.

609
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,640
Like if you have to do muffins, somebody's already prepped the batter for you.

610
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,960
So you just got to scoop them and bake them and let them cool and then send them off.

611
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,280
But VIP, it's all on you.

612
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,920
So I did a lot of the VIP stuff at the end of my time at Universal.

613
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,960
I loved it because the days went by so fast because you're racing the clock.

614
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,120
But I would anything that I kind of wanted to do or try.

615
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:08,880
I would just do while I was doing my VIP stuff.

616
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,200
OK, so because they know I was going to say like,

617
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,160
so you could experiment at those instances. I see.

618
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,080
Yeah, like we did some things just to kind of

619
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,640
see what the chefs would like or they'd say, hey, we need a new this,

620
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,480
we need to do that.

621
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,000
And then we would kind of try some different stuff and then they decide what they like.

622
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,440
And sometimes it was for a catered event where they said, well, we need we have this coming up.

623
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,480
What can you guys do? Like the the minion.

624
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,600
We had these minion cookies for a while and I don't know if they still have them,

625
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,360
but they're like a rolled type cookie dough.

626
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,520
And we had three different colors.

627
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,480
So we had to make the big amount of dough and then

628
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,320
divide it into the different colors.

629
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:56,640
And then you have to roll the dough out a certain way so that it makes it look like the minion's eye.

630
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:03,440
And I kind of they gave me the recipe for it and I kind of like did the test kitchen for it.

631
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,080
But then, like when they end up liking something that you do,

632
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,480
then you have to continue to be the first to do it until somebody else can do it

633
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,640
just as fast and or the same as you, because they want all the obviously they want them all to look the same.

634
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,600
You don't want you don't go to a theme park and get a churro.

635
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:27,440
And then like the next time you get it, it's half the size it was last time and doesn't have enough cinnamon on it.

636
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,040
You know, you don't want that.

637
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,800
You want them all to be the same.

638
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,040
The Mickey ice cream bar is like a third year once in a while.

639
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,720
Yeah.

640
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,040
Well, you're just getting extra ice cream.

641
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,880
They are the people are going to start demanding the third year.

642
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Yeah.

643
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,960
That's if Mickey's been involved in a lab test.

644
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
Right.

645
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,560
There's an experiment gone wrong.

646
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,560
A lab tester, someone like popped him and he's got a shiner, you know.

647
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,560
Yeah.

648
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,560
Oh, it's a bruise.

649
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,560
Yeah.

650
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,560
Yeah.

651
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,560
It's Mickey's been in a fight ice cream bar.

652
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,560
The kids love it.

653
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,560
Yeah.

654
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,360
So OK, so I guess this is probably I guess goes without saying.

655
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:14,560
But so when you start as a baker, they essentially like you can create things that you can do.

656
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,760
Like you can create things.

657
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,760
Do you sign a contract that basically says any of my creations are property of universal

658
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,760
forever?

659
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:29,960
I don't remember signing anything like that, but so maybe you could sue now.

660
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,760
I mean, for like for ownership.

661
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,160
No, I don't know.

662
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,160
Maybe there's like an agreement that it's like a combined intellectual property or like

663
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,160
working together.

664
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,560
I don't know.

665
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,960
I didn't really read it like any of my agreement type stuff.

666
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,360
It's mainly if you wanted to make it at home, they couldn't sue you.

667
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,160
They couldn't come to your house and say, I probably couldn't sell it.

668
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:58,360
But, you know, like a minion things like we did minion cookies and these mini minion

669
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,960
cupcakes that had like Twinkies sticking out of them.

670
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,360
And like I'm sure if I was like, oh, I'm going to make these and sell these and they'd be

671
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,560
like, hey, man, what are you doing?

672
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,360
Sure.

673
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,360
Candice's original minion cookies.

674
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,360
Yeah.

675
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,560
Micra.

676
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,160
You have to call you can't call minions for copyright either.

677
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,560
So it's like little pals.

678
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,560
Yeah.

679
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,960
Candice's yellow friends.

680
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,960
Pretty good.

681
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,760
Do you have do you remember was there ever like a did you ever attempt anything in the

682
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,160
desert field that was like a big disaster?

683
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,360
Oh, oh my gosh.

684
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:43,760
So there I realized through this process working at Universal that I can't make like a normal

685
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,960
just like caramel in the pan because I and I think it's just I'm too, you know, baker's

686
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,760
supposed to be patient.

687
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,560
I think maybe I'm too impatient.

688
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:57,560
And every single time I went to make this caramel with it, it's just like sugar and

689
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,360
water. It shouldn't be hard.

690
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,760
But if you do it just wrong or like one little speck of something that shouldn't be in there

691
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,760
gets in there.

692
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,760
The whole thing's ruined.

693
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,760
And I just couldn't feel it was so frustrating.

694
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,560
There was a day where I tried three or four different ones because I was trying to make

695
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,960
an ice cream and like this was the beginning of this ice cream recipe and I just couldn't

696
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,960
do it.

697
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,960
I can't.

698
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,960
And I tried it home after I was like, I don't understand what I'm doing.

699
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:29,960
So I do have a game plan to one day by a specific pot and teach myself how to do it because

700
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,360
I just for some reason can it's like my kryptonite.

701
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,360
I can't do it.

702
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,960
I don't understand that.

703
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,760
Is that similar to making a roux like you really have to watch it and keep?

704
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,960
I don't have problems with rules.

705
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:51,160
So I maybe I it's just you don't you actually don't want to touch it that much.

706
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,560
Oh, OK. But but you don't want it to like I don't know.

707
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,560
You have to babysit it, but you can't touch it.

708
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,360
And then like I don't I don't want to touch it.

709
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,360
I it looks like it's getting weird over here.

710
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
So I have to touch it.

711
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,360
But then it's ruined.

712
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
So I don't know.

713
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,960
Don't know what I'm doing wrong, but it hates me.

714
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,960
And I can't do it.

715
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,360
Jason, have you ever tried to make that?

716
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,560
I've never I've tried to make.

717
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:21,760
Well, Mike, you've had I've made pecan pies before and you have to boil the maple syrup

718
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,960
and you can't boil it too long.

719
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,160
But then you want it to cook for a little while before you put it in the pie crust.

720
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,960
Right. But you you needed to cook a little.

721
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,760
But then you also have to like let it cool a bit, but then get it out

722
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,160
because it will start to harden in the pot.

723
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,760
Yeah. Right.

724
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,760
That's where you're making these pecan pies.

725
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:54,560
I've made them for like, you know, it's usually around Thanksgiving or like,

726
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,960
you know, parties.

727
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,960
Jason, could you make one with a minion's eye in the middle?

728
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,160
How would I do that?

729
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,160
I guess, yeah, I can do it.

730
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,760
I think, yeah, you can do it.

731
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
You can do it.

732
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
I believe in you.

733
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,360
Hey, let's get let's let's start while we're in quarantine.

734
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:18,360
Let's start a podcast to ride side business where Jason makes pies for listeners.

735
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:25,360
Oh, oh, it's a it's a Patreon tier, maybe.

736
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,360
I have one problem with the one you propose, though,

737
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,160
which is that I think if a minion's eye was on a pecan pie,

738
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,760
it would look like it would it would look like a minion was a burn victim or something.

739
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,760
Oh, yeah, maybe you're right.

740
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,560
That pattern is just bizarre, I think, for it to be the consistency of a minion's face.

741
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,360
OK, well, we can go back to the drawing board on it.

742
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,760
All right. A minion meringue is perhaps an easy one.

743
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,760
That's nice and smooth.

744
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,360
Yeah, but Jason can't make a meringue.

745
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,360
I've never attempted a meringue.

746
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,560
They're easy. You can do it.

747
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
Thank you. Thank you for all your support.

748
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:08,360
I believe in you. I appreciate a pecan pie is a little more the texture of like

749
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,760
a dinosaur's face, so maybe you like take a slice out of it

750
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,160
and then it's sort of like a T-Rex or a raptor.

751
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,760
Yeah, that's yeah.

752
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,760
Well, yeah, Jason. OK, well, we'll figure out what baked good Jason

753
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,360
will be sending to listeners soon, maybe off air.

754
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,560
I love it.

755
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,160
Is there cancer?

756
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,960
Is there do you have a specialty as a baker?

757
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,360
Like what? Like if you were to if you were like trying to impress a king of a country.

758
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,960
Oh, my gosh.

759
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:40,560
Like you're like this is what this is what I make the best or or enjoy even the best.

760
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,760
It's so hard for me to like I try to tell people all the time.

761
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,560
You're basically asking me to choose between my children.

762
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,360
I see. And it's it's so difficult to do that.

763
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,360
I I'm trying to think of things that.

764
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,760
I like to do just to impress people.

765
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,760
I will say one thing that I have brought into my real life.

766
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,560
Got to do this to like look fancy, but not doing anything.

767
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,560
That's hard is that I do still make the T-Rex cakes that they used to have.

768
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,660
I don't know. I don't know if they still have them.

769
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:18,360
I don't know. But they were these just like six layer chocolate cakes

770
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,360
with chocolate icing.

771
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,160
And we put these mini chocolate chips all around the outside of the cake.

772
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,360
And then there's like a chocolate ganache on top.

773
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,560
And it looks so fancy and so pretty.

774
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,260
But it's really like the easiest thing to do.

775
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,560
It's so easy. I love doing that.

776
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,960
And so you still will on on the regular make something like this.

777
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:47,360
Yeah. If I like Johnny, when Johnny and I first started dating, I which I it's still

778
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:51,460
so tricky because I have to convince his family that I really like baking.

779
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,160
So they'll have a party or something.

780
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,260
We're like, oh, we'll bring something. They're like, no, don't worry about it.

781
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:58,660
And like, look, if you tell me I can't bake something and bring it,

782
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,260
you're actually making me really sad.

783
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,360
It's actually ruining my day.

784
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:08,260
So for his dad's birthday, I made that T-Rex cake and it was just chocolate

785
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,960
on top of chocolate and it just looked so fancy.

786
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,960
And they were so impressed.

787
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,160
And like that, that's like 100 percent of the time people see that cake

788
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,160
and they're like, oh my God, it's so pretty.

789
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,660
It's it's just I'm literally just mushing chocolate chips on the side of the cake.

790
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,760
So there's nothing fancy about it.

791
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,960
And it's I wonder what is it called again?

792
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,860
Just so I know I try to think of what the T-Rex cake.

793
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,860
This was sold. Where was it sold in Universal?

794
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:42,060
Just anything near all the Jurassic Park stuff.

795
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,460
Gotcha. Because I know I feel like there was a couple of places that we sent it.

796
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,560
I just Googled T-Rex cake and there's about 100 results,

797
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,560
all different from different like child's birthday party cakes.

798
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,360
So I don't know if I'm going to be able to find a picture of this very easily.

799
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:04,960
I see. Well, that's the rest of my day coming through those results.

800
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,960
Living vicariously.

801
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,360
Living vicariously through these kids who will have super cool birthdays.

802
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,060
You can actually go through your whole birthday history

803
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,160
because I see one that says fourth birthday, one that says sixth birthday.

804
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,160
Wow. Wow.

805
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,260
I could I could live a whole life, a whole other life.

806
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,860
Yeah. Today, you'll be reliving your life via T-Rex cakes.

807
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,760
I'll have to make it because I feel like this is this is going to be impossible,

808
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,760
but I'll have to make it sometime and then tag you guys.

809
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,060
So that oh, yeah.

810
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,960
Oh, yeah. The glory that is the T-Rex cake.

811
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,960
That'd be great. Yes. Cliffhanger.

812
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,460
Candice, talking about theme park cakes,

813
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,760
you and Johnny got married at the Grand Californian.

814
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,260
How was that cake?

815
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,560
OK, so that was famously a cake based day.

816
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,360
Yes, I that was the one because so we went in for a tasting.

817
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,720
And when we did the tasting, we were kind of excited about the food.

818
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,860
But then when it came to the cake and I'm not I'm not usually a big cake person.

819
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,560
Like I like I said before, I'm a savory person.

820
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,520
The irony of that is I get it.

821
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,860
But like I I love.

822
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:21,160
I love, I don't know, salty things that are fatty and just that's all me.

823
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,560
But these cakes that they had were so good

824
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,760
and they have a Dole Whip cake.

825
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,420
And that was all I wanted.

826
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,860
And so I on our wedding day, I really didn't eat much,

827
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,120
but I did eat my Dole Whip wedding cake.

828
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,560
It was so good.

829
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,600
It was so good.

830
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,100
They have churro now, too.

831
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:47,460
And I think we're going to renew our vows somewhere just so that I can have this churro cake now.

832
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,500
Oh, wow. So is it only for wedding havers?

833
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,100
Yeah, not available to the public.

834
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:57,700
Otherwise, like this Dole Whip, I think that it was a mousse inside the cake, too.

835
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,200
Like this cake was so good.

836
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,760
And like, oh, I just I wish they did sell it in the park somewhere

837
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,700
because they were just, oh, they need that mousse dome.

838
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,900
This Dole Whip cake right now.

839
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,240
It's got to be a way.

840
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,180
So are you you know, we are obviously like a lot read a lot of these blogs

841
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,640
and listen to these other podcasts.

842
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:24,480
Are you in some sort of loop where you know, like what the newest Disney wedding cakes are?

843
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,080
I just saw something somewhere and I can't remember where it was, but it said

844
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:33,500
and I don't it might have been on there because the fairytale weddings

845
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,940
has an Instagram and I might have seen it on there.

846
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,620
And I got really excited.

847
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:42,840
Like Johnny and I have been talking for a while about renewing our vows in general.

848
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,680
But then all these other things keep coming out.

849
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,720
Like, I will tell you this, for anybody who is even thinking

850
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,740
about doing a Disney wedding, do the Disney wedding.

851
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:59,420
It was the greatest thing I could have ever hoped for.

852
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,140
Like the they took care of everything.

853
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,880
They literally handled everything.

854
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,460
And then any time I wanted something, they said, just ask us and we'll put a price to it.

855
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:10,960
And then if you don't think it's worth that price, then it's fine.

856
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,360
We'll take it off and we'll change it.

857
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:17,620
Like we had because you you have your dinner and they have cake and then we're sorry.

858
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:21,020
We had the cocktail hour that had appetizers.

859
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,860
Then we had the dinner.

860
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,520
Then we had our cake.

861
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,660
And then after when people were leaving, because like we had a candy buffet

862
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,880
and then when they were leaving, there were Mickey pretzels.

863
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:33,180
Like, well, yeah, we were all.

864
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,660
Yeah, I was like, that's that's all.

865
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,080
And I told Johnny at one point because I didn't think the Mickey

866
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,880
pretzel thing was going to happen.

867
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,060
And I looked at him and I was like, I just really, really want Mickey

868
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:46,280
pretzels at our wedding.

869
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,920
That's is that too much?

870
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,620
And he said, I just get the Mickey pretzel.

871
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,580
So it was one of my proud.

872
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:57,180
I ran out into the hallway to take a picture of them

873
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,480
being present at our wedding because I was so happy that they were there.

874
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,920
Where is that ceremony?

875
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,080
Is it like in the there's kind of that like

876
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:09,460
atrium area in the middle of Grand Californian?

877
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,880
Yeah. OK. Yep.

878
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,720
That's where we did it. And the monorail went over, I want to say, every

879
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,020
like five minutes during the ceremony, the monorail went over.

880
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:20,220
And like I could see how some people might be like, well, that's getting to be

881
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,580
a bit repetitive. But I every time it did it, I got so happy.

882
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,780
I kept looking at Johnny. I was like, oh, my gosh, there it is.

883
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,460
I was right at your wedding.

884
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,180
That's pretty cool.

885
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,780
I was really, really, really happy about it.

886
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:39,160
My family stayed at one of the rooms that overlook that little courtyard once.

887
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,760
And it was cool to just go out on the balcony and see the monorail go by.

888
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,380
But sure enough, I did go out once and look down and there was a wedding.

889
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,020
Wow.

890
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:55,880
What were their character like, were their costume characters at the wedding?

891
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,260
Like was Mickey at the wedding or is that we thought about it?

892
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,480
We thought about it, but it's so much extra that I was just kind of like.

893
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:08,720
And at the time, like Johnny had Johnny had just signed with WWE full time.

894
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:13,780
So finances were a bit different than than they are for us now.

895
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,860
And like my dad insisted on paying for the wedding.

896
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,280
I'm the only daughter in my family.

897
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,920
I have two brothers and I have like an adopted brother and like I'm the only girl.

898
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,860
So my dad was like, no, I'm paying for your wedding.

899
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,100
So I didn't want to be too greedy either.

900
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,560
I didn't want to be like, hey, dad, I want Mickey and Minnie at the way.

901
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:37,420
I know you're dropping a lot of money for this Disney wedding, but hey,

902
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,220
let's get Mickey and Minnie to for Mickey to show up for 10 minutes.

903
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:45,060
That's like what an entire other wedding would cost.

904
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:48,160
Yeah, it's it was more than I was.

905
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,400
Like, for instance, we wanted to because they have a cake

906
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,780
that they do like a projection onto.

907
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,600
And we really wanted that cake.

908
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,000
But it was I want to say at the time it was five thousand dollars.

909
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:03,640
And I was going, I am not going to ask my dad to spend five thousand dollars

910
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,500
on this cake, like there's no way.

911
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,940
And so we went with one that cost us five hundred dollars.

912
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:12,540
That's much better. Yeah.

913
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,200
Way better.

914
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,340
Was there any sort of this probably this is probably not on a list,

915
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:21,080
but in my mind, there's a list of like characters and the more obscure,

916
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,180
the more money it is.

917
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,120
Like if you want to have like

918
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,480
like if you want Darkwing Duck's daughter at the wedding,

919
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,720
it's way more money than having.

920
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:35,520
Listen, if I could have gotten Darkwing Duck at our wedding,

921
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:40,120
my husband would have been the happiest human that has ever existed.

922
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:43,860
Darkwing Duck performs the ceremony.

923
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,480
Yeah. Oh, he has a whole.

924
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,720
My husband has decided that

925
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,300
when we have our first child,

926
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,500
he's going to have like the entire family sitting in the waiting room

927
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,700
at the hospital because he thinks that that's it's what they do in movies.

928
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,020
So certainly that's what will happen in real life.

929
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:03,960
And then he wants to go into this waiting room and tell everybody

930
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,700
that things are really bad.

931
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:10,700
And like, I'm probably not going to make it and just really get people down

932
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,120
as low as they could possibly be.

933
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:16,160
Then he wants a song to begin playing.

934
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,800
And he wants Rafiki to come out.

935
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,960
And like originally, this was an actual baboon.

936
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,560
And I told him I had to explain to him that the baboon was probably going to eat

937
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,140
the child. So that's a bad idea.

938
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,840
And then he wants he wants him to come out and present the baby

939
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,540
to everybody in the waiting room.

940
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:40,200
And I asked him, I said, well, how how are we even getting this thing

941
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,260
into the hospital? Like, this doesn't make any sense.

942
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,240
And he decided that the baboon will walk in in a doctor's coat

943
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,500
and nobody will suspect a thing.

944
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,740
So he's very theatrical.

945
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,200
This husband of mine.

946
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,060
Sure. I mean, yes.

947
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:02,040
So he wants, yes, he wants Rafiki to hold up the child like Simba.

948
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,160
Yes. Is there any sort of like,

949
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,060
has he even gone to the point where like maybe people should be waiting outside

950
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,160
and he can do it on top of the hospital?

951
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,040
So it's like, oh, don't say that to him.

952
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,760
Please don't tell him that.

953
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,760
Sorry. It's going to get out of control.

954
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,760
I mean, this kid, this kid, like on our wedding,

955
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,740
when when I was trying to lay the ceremony out,

956
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,700
I asked him, is like, hey, do you want to walk your mom down the aisle?

957
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,260
And he was like, what does the groom usually do?

958
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,740
And I'm pretty sure that maybe he's never been to a wedding.

959
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,140
And he's like, well, what is the groom?

960
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,600
Like, what do they usually do?

961
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,640
And I told him, I said, well, I mean, you can either walk your mom down the aisle

962
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,340
or you can just be there.

963
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:44,080
He's like, you want me to just be there?

964
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,940
And I was like, well, I mean, I'm trying to find out what you want.

965
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:50,720
And then I was telling him, you know, the order of everybody

966
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,720
and how things are going.

967
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,720
And he's like, wait, you get your own entrance and I don't get my own entrance.

968
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:01,080
And I was like, OK, I guess we'll work that into it.

969
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:05,580
So he had his own entrance at our wedding and really threw a wrench into things

970
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:10,860
because he didn't he basically wanted to come out right before I did.

971
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:16,060
And I had this long hallway that I had to run down

972
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,620
once he was clear of the door.

973
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,180
It was crazy.

974
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,480
Like, so he had his own entrance.

975
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,320
And then he asked me why nobody applauded him during his entrance at a wedding.

976
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,760
Yeah, that's a performer. All right.

977
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,860
That's for. Yeah, I relate.

978
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:38,240
I told them I told them when we renew our vows, we'll make sure to leave signs

979
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,600
in on like where people are going to be sitting, we'll leave signs

980
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,860
so that they can hold up signs for him and make sure that it is very clear

981
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:48,660
that they are to cheer for him when he comes out and makes his big entrance.

982
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:51,240
Maybe he can go last this time. Who knows?

983
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,500
Yeah, I guess all bets are off when it's a renewal.

984
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,700
So it's not there's not the formality. Yeah, it's not real.

985
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,200
We're already married.

986
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:03,300
Yeah, so it could be it could be full theatrics.

987
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,240
Yeah, lighting.

988
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,600
Yeah, work you can lay you can land from the sky.

989
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,980
Pyro. Yeah, I mean, I row.

990
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,640
It can actually be it can be mainly a wrestling match with just like,

991
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,680
you know, four percent that renewal.

992
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,200
He's already like

993
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,500
what they laying it out as though it is going to be a wrestling show. So

994
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,400
before, you know, the vows are just renewed backstage.

995
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,380
We even lost the reason to do it.

996
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,780
And it's just all right.

997
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:33,680
Like, now when you when you two met,

998
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,980
was there a shared connection immediately of that about this type of stuff?

999
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,720
About like

1000
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,520
rank theme parks and stuff, I was like about how crazy he is.

1001
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,980
So Johnny had never been to a theme park until he met me.

1002
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:56,220
And how I took him to Disneyland first,

1003
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:01,900
because to me, Disneyland is like everything.

1004
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,960
It's my home base, like even living out here.

1005
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,400
I'm like, but it's still not Disneyland.

1006
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,600
And when people ask me like, oh, which one?

1007
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,460
I'm like, I'm so Disneyland.

1008
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,260
It's the original.

1009
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:15,400
Walt actually walked those streets like it's a pretty big deal.

1010
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,720
So I took him to Disneyland first,

1011
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:23,300
and then I took him to Universal and then his entire life changed.

1012
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:27,480
So I did I did a good thing for his life.

1013
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,480
Right. So was he a Disney guy?

1014
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,480
Were you did you at least have like a Disney connection or was

1015
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:37,780
like, where did your nerd or your nerd interests meet?

1016
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,800
Was he a Star Wars Marvel guy before?

1017
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,500
He is Star Wars Marvel.

1018
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:46,400
So that was our part of our like, oh, we like all a lot of the same things.

1019
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:52,000
And like, I mean, we we have similar taste in like TV shows and

1020
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:54,400
we're like we like playing video game.

1021
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,940
I mean, you can as you saw, we have just the most absurd amount of

1022
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,780
toys and collectible type things.

1023
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:07,800
And like we I don't know that like he was so big into Disney.

1024
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,740
But once we kind of started dating and we started,

1025
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,540
I think we found a lot more similarities in things like

1026
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:21,600
I didn't know he was such a massive Darkwing Duck fan, for instance, until we like we

1027
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,280
walk around the theme parks and he's going like, how come there's no Darkwing Duck here?

1028
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:28,280
It's like, oh, didn't realize it was that important.

1029
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,100
Big Rafiki fan, apparently.

1030
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,580
Yeah, loves Rafiki.

1031
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:34,300
He just loves Rafiki.

1032
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:38,840
He added added the thing about like you dying a childbirth, though.

1033
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,580
That doesn't happen in the movie.

1034
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:44,240
No, no. Famously lives a long time.

1035
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:49,240
His theory is that they're at such a low at that point,

1036
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,740
like they can they can only go up from there.

1037
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,440
Yeah, like you're at such a low.

1038
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,080
You can only go up.

1039
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,680
Wait, so yeah, Jason brings up also another good point is like,

1040
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,840
does Rafiki also announce that you're alive in the.

1041
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,440
I don't know. I don't know.

1042
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,520
I don't know that he's thought about that yet.

1043
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,940
I believe she lives.

1044
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:16,240
I do. I never really thought about the fact that he does go out.

1045
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:18,420
Rafiki goes out there with the baby.

1046
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:21,300
Everybody's probably in fear for that baby's life.

1047
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:22,960
Also, they think I'm dead.

1048
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,920
Maybe they think Rafiki did this.

1049
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,120
You were killed by a baboon.

1050
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,100
I mean, yes, if they're that if they've been taken that low

1051
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:33,760
and then you see a live animal walk out, you might assume the worst.

1052
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,360
You might not be full of joy when you see this animal.

1053
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:41,160
I would also like I think I would attack the animal to get the baby back

1054
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,660
before the animal was able to present the baby.

1055
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:47,820
Johnny thinks as long as he's wearing a doctor's coat, it's fine.

1056
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,820
I mean, I can't I can't argue with that.

1057
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:57,500
I would be much, you know, I would I would respect a baboon

1058
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:01,900
in a professional setting a lot more than a unclothed baboon.

1059
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,620
Just like a drunk guy walking into a bakery, you see me there for a reason.

1060
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:08,200
Yeah, he went in with a purpose.

1061
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,260
You went in with if you went in, he was vomiting everywhere.

1062
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,260
I might be like, OK, there's like a zombie running through here right now.

1063
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,560
Sure.

1064
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,400
But if the monkey arbitrarily checks a clipboard or something.

1065
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:21,340
Yeah, we've mentioned a little bit

1066
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:24,640
on the Indies and the independent scene, there are a few things

1067
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,700
that you would do to reference your love of theme parks.

1068
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:31,300
If my memory is correct, you would announce that you were from

1069
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:34,000
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. Yes.

1070
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,300
It broke my heart because when I came here,

1071
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:42,200
when I was doing the first man classic, they put hometown

1072
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,640
and I was kind of devastated because I was going,

1073
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,940
I can't be from Mr. Toad's Wild Ride anymore.

1074
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,200
Like, what do I do?

1075
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,700
And I did Anaheim, California.

1076
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,040
But then I was going, I think the reference is lost on people

1077
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,200
that I am not from.

1078
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,380
I think people just are from there. True.

1079
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,540
Yeah.

1080
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,980
Yeah. I think there was one PWG where you and your former tag team

1081
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,000
partner, Joey Ryan, had R2D2 and C3PO.

1082
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,880
Yeah. Yes.

1083
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,780
We have this other idea that just never

1084
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,520
we just never had time to do it, actually.

1085
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:18,260
But he we wanted to be Peter Pan and Tinkerbell.

1086
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:21,720
And Joey does not typically

1087
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:26,880
go up top to jump off for anything or just be up there.

1088
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,320
Period. He's not.

1089
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,960
That's not his thing.

1090
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:34,520
And we wanted to do something where he climb up to the top.

1091
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:38,180
And I and he'd be scared, but I would give him pixie dust.

1092
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:41,080
And therefore he would now be able to fly.

1093
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:44,160
But it just never it never panned out for us.

1094
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,280
So I think that we also

1095
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:53,120
we were we had Captain EO inspired gear as well.

1096
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,220
Oh, wow. I don't think I've ever seen that.

1097
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:58,860
Some people and a lot of people have actually seen it and don't realize.

1098
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:03,020
And I get really happy when people do realize what the reference is. But

1099
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,180
we had a guerrilla warfare match.

1100
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:10,080
And I insisted that we were white.

1101
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,020
Oh, I've seen this match.

1102
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,660
I didn't even realize. Yeah.

1103
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:17,560
I will. I watch that match the other day.

1104
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,720
And I was like, it's the Captain EO color.

1105
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,020
Yeah. That also is.

1106
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:24,220
You were.

1107
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:27,580
Yeah. Wearing white and started bleeding profusely.

1108
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:31,320
Yeah. What a day to wear white.

1109
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:34,020
What a day. Yeah.

1110
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:37,660
You know, it's funny that I didn't put that together.

1111
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:40,820
I think the yeah, the match is so crazy.

1112
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,900
I think I didn't even notice that. Yeah, it's clearly the colors.

1113
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:50,300
Did you have any other references you've put into outfits or anything else?

1114
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,260
I'm trying to think.

1115
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,460
Because a lot of times, if I try to do something, it's too obvious.

1116
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:00,900
And I don't want to be too horribly obvious.

1117
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:05,880
I did buy some fabric recently that is like the purple wall here here.

1118
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,480
But like, I haven't made it yet.

1119
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,580
And I don't know that I'm going to be able to wear it any longer.

1120
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:18,140
I don't think I think we've moved on from fun, flashy, bright colors.

1121
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,600
Candice Luray.

1122
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,900
I see. Oh, right, right, right.

1123
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,840
Yeah, I'm not I'm not going to wear black, though.

1124
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:28,800
That's my my intent is still to not wear black because I'm not your

1125
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,080
I'm not the cliche.

1126
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,600
I'm up to no good now.

1127
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,940
I'm going to wear black. Right.

1128
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:38,740
I'm so mean.

1129
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:42,980
You're not going to have a hatbox ghost theme or I wish I wish.

1130
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,340
Yeah, although I will say

1131
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:51,580
Johnny Johnny has been Johnny has been telling his gear guy

1132
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:56,340
when he's like when we were looking at different color schemes for stuff

1133
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:59,240
we liked, he said he liked Haunted Mansion Blue,

1134
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,620
specifically Haunted Mansion.

1135
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:04,520
Sure. What Haunted Mansion Blue is.

1136
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:08,120
It's basically what any of the ghosts kind of look like.

1137
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:11,920
There's a weird like blueish glow to them

1138
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:15,980
that Johnny really likes.

1139
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:19,240
So the actual like ghosts that are like dancing around in the

1140
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,920
like the hitchhiking ghost.

1141
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,620
And yeah, I'm trying to think of it.

1142
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:27,020
There's like, yeah, that's what he likes.

1143
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:28,060
That's interesting.

1144
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:31,500
So you could there's probably like a Disney villain, a subtle Disney villain.

1145
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:36,320
When I when I go in for hair and when I go in for hair and makeup,

1146
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:41,120
I have had numerous times where I don't really know how to explain what I want.

1147
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:46,520
But they do understand if I say I want to be like an evil Disney princess

1148
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:51,900
and then I get my makeup exactly how I thought of it that day.

1149
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:56,480
But I do think is that like Maleficent or what?

1150
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,000
Not a princess.

1151
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,280
She's not a princess.

1152
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,000
Don't be ridiculous.

1153
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,100
I will say, though, I did.

1154
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:08,840
I did find a lot of inspiration from Maleficent recently

1155
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:12,740
because I've been known at NXT as like the pint

1156
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:15,980
size pixie and everything is like about like the pixie thing, the fairies.

1157
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:19,680
And Maleficent is an evil fairy like she's she is a fairy.

1158
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:20,700
She just got all right.

1159
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,640
I've been subjected.

1160
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:26,900
So I've been using a lot of that for inspiration on things to come.

1161
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:28,400
Oh, that's cool.

1162
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,440
Yeah.

1163
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,240
Well, I know I've learned my lesson.

1164
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,780
Maleficent is not not an evil princess.

1165
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:35,100
She's an evil fairy.

1166
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,100
Yeah.

1167
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,100
Thank you.

1168
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,100
I'll never forget.

1169
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:39,100
Thank you, Scott.

1170
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:40,400
She just misunderstood, really.

1171
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,240
Do you have a top do you have a couple top Disney characters, Candice,

1172
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,700
like that are your favorites?

1173
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:52,180
I really love Alice in Wonderland.

1174
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:54,680
I love I'm going to love Dumbo.

1175
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:57,640
I thought the cutest like, I don't know.

1176
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,980
It's not even tough characters.

1177
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:02,740
It's like happy little Pinocchio.

1178
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:07,140
Even ironically, I'm afraid of marionettes in real life, but I love Pinocchio.

1179
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:10,340
I get that.

1180
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:11,340
He's kind of in between.

1181
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:12,680
He's not pure marionette.

1182
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,240
So that's true.

1183
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:14,940
It's true.

1184
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:16,900
I guess that they made like a live action, though.

1185
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,340
I'd have some serious issues.

1186
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:20,340
Yeah.

1187
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:22,500
Every live action Pinocchio is terrifying.

1188
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,500
Oh, yes.

1189
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,500
Yeah.

1190
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,500
It shouldn't.

1191
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,540
We should just not do that.

1192
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:30,040
We should just stop with that.

1193
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,200
There's multiple Pinocchio movies being made.

1194
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,300
I've heard that's so upsetting.

1195
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:35,300
My policy.

1196
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,300
No more Pinocchio's.

1197
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:37,300
No more pans.

1198
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,040
We're done with all these.

1199
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,900
This story does not need to be told again.

1200
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:41,900
Yeah.

1201
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:42,900
Scott is anti pan.

1202
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:43,900
I'm anti pan.

1203
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:44,900
Let me be very clear.

1204
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:48,900
I just kind of feel like after hook, like, do we really need any more?

1205
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:49,900
Exactly.

1206
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:52,900
It's been a deconstructionist one.

1207
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,900
They blew it up.

1208
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,900
They changed our perception of what the pan story is.

1209
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:01,900
So why now are we just doing it, doing the regular one again?

1210
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:03,900
Some creepy English kid.

1211
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,900
I agree with all of that.

1212
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:06,900
I agree with all that.

1213
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:11,900
But I do think that the email address I have, scottispan at gmail.com is still open.

1214
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:17,900
If you want to draw a picture of Scott as Peter Pan, the photo will go right to my email.

1215
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:18,900
That email is real.

1216
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:22,900
I'd like to just advertise it again real briefly here.

1217
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,900
I hope that inbox is empty.

1218
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,900
It better be dry as a bone.

1219
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:31,900
Well, right now it's just filled with a lot of free trials for streaming services.

1220
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:38,900
So, OK, yeah.

1221
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:41,900
You two live in Orlando now.

1222
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:42,900
Yes.

1223
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,900
How is that as a theme park person?

1224
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:47,900
Because like we always fantasize about Orlando.

1225
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:51,900
What is it actually like day to day living in Orlando?

1226
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,900
I love it so much.

1227
01:04:53,900 --> 01:05:01,900
And we get to do these things on occasion where we do either daycations or staycations.

1228
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:07,900
And we'll go and just like get a hotel for a night or a few nights.

1229
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:08,900
And we'll stay there.

1230
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,900
And it's usually, we do it around cheat day.

1231
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:18,900
But if it's not like an extreme cheat weekend or like a few days, then we'll make sure that we get a hotel with a gym.

1232
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:26,900
And then, I don't know, I just, it's really, even though we're right here and we could just drive there and do whatever we want to do and then come back home.

1233
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:33,900
It's just kind of nice to feel like there's an escape from the real world for a little bit.

1234
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:38,900
And we feel like we're on vacation even though we're like 30, 40 minutes away from home.

1235
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,900
And that's so great.

1236
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,900
And it makes our eating life better.

1237
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:46,900
Like if it's not a cheat weekend, then Johnny can take some meals.

1238
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:51,900
Like we could take some food with us so that we don't go over the top, like eat everything.

1239
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,900
So it's, I don't know.

1240
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:54,900
I love it.

1241
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,900
I just love it so much.

1242
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,900
Does Johnny want to move back to Cleveland eventually?

1243
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:01,900
Yeah.

1244
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:02,900
Do I think he's crazy?

1245
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,900
Maybe a little.

1246
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,900
Cleveland people love Cleveland so much.

1247
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,900
I can't even tell you.

1248
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:12,900
We've been thinking like maybe Orlando is the good life.

1249
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,900
So it's good to hear that it is indeed correct.

1250
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,900
We are right.

1251
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:24,900
Now that we're recording this podcast remotely, yeah, let's just, you know, now we don't have to be in the same place anymore.

1252
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:34,900
If you guys want to, and by you guys, I mean Mike and Jason moving in together in Orlando, if you want to fulfill your destiny, I say go for it.

1253
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:35,900
There's no, yeah.

1254
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:41,900
I mean, I was thinking right before we got quarantined, I was like asking Lindsay, should we just go to Japan maybe for five months?

1255
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:45,900
For five months?

1256
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:46,900
Well, I didn't know.

1257
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,900
We don't know how long this thing's lasting.

1258
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,900
Like get a job at that point.

1259
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:52,900
Well, the job is the podcast.

1260
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:56,900
I could get up in the middle of the night to do the podcast with remotely.

1261
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:00,900
I mean, you have to get a job in Japan to stay in Japan.

1262
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:01,900
Oh, maybe.

1263
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:02,900
Perhaps.

1264
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,900
I'd be willing to work.

1265
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,900
Maybe.

1266
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:08,900
What else?

1267
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:09,900
For five months?

1268
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:14,900
That's a lot of money you have to have saved up for five months living in Japan.

1269
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:19,900
There's a reason we didn't do it.

1270
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,900
Well, but either way, you don't get theme parks anywhere.

1271
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:22,900
Right.

1272
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:23,900
I know.

1273
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:24,900
I know.

1274
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:25,900
Yeah.

1275
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,900
That part of Japan is not happening.

1276
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:28,900
Yeah.

1277
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:29,900
Well, that's okay.

1278
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,900
So Orlando is still on the table then for us, maybe.

1279
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:34,900
We can at least drive there.

1280
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:44,900
When you're traveling, what I always think is interesting, especially being a touring performer essentially, is that you get to see a lot of different places.

1281
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:48,900
Did you try to cram in theme park visits on the road?

1282
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:56,900
It's really hard since working with WWE because we're so...

1283
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:59,900
We have such a strict schedule, I guess.

1284
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:03,900
I don't even want to say strict because that sounds like they're like, you have to be...

1285
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:05,900
But it's like we're usually...

1286
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:17,900
Like on a road loop weekend, we fly in somewhere and you're in one town one day and you may stay there that night, but then the next morning you get up, you get on a bus and then go to the next place, wrestle that night.

1287
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:22,900
And sometimes after that, you get in the bus again, you go to the next place and then you get to the hotel.

1288
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:27,900
So it's so much like go, go, go that there's not always a lot of downtime.

1289
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:37,900
I will say that sometimes if I'm going to California and I'm going to see my family, I'll try to work things so that I can stay a little bit longer.

1290
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:41,900
And then, of course, I go to Disneyland when that happens.

1291
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:43,900
But it is kind of tricky.

1292
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:51,900
When I was on the Independence, I made it my goal if there was a way to go to a theme park we were going to go.

1293
01:08:51,900 --> 01:09:04,900
And there was a time when Johnny and Joey and I were all in England to wrestle and we had shows the next weekend like Joey and I were going to Germany and then Johnny had another show in England.

1294
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:07,900
So we were going to have to stay for a week anyway.

1295
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:14,900
And I had talked to one of the promoters about like how difficult would it be to get over to Paris to go to Disneyland Paris?

1296
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:26,900
And they were so great about it like they booked the entire trip for us to like go there, get to the like have the bus pick us up, take us to the hotel.

1297
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:33,900
And like they did all that and like deducted it from like our pay for the shows and it was like so convenient.

1298
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:36,900
And we so we did that.

1299
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:46,900
And then when I basically anytime I've gone to Japan with Joey to wrestle, we went to Tokyo Disney because how could you not?

1300
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:59,900
I will say one of the days one of the days we took the the trains to get to Disney and it in Japan and it was the craziest experience of my life.

1301
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:04,900
Like I've never seen so many people crammed into like such a small space.

1302
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:07,900
It was a commuter style.

1303
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:08,900
Absolutely.

1304
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,900
Jippie Tokyo in full swing.

1305
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,900
That was like morning rush.

1306
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:19,900
It was I mean, yes, everybody was going to work and like school and just live their lives.

1307
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:34,900
And it was it was just it blew my mind because when we when we would go to Japan to wrestle out there, the promotion would put Joey up in one place and then they put me up in a place that was like right by the train station.

1308
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:37,900
So Joey would like walk over to where I was staying.

1309
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,900
He picked me up and then we'd take the train wherever we needed to go.

1310
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:49,900
And it usually wasn't too bad, but that's because, you know, we're jet lagged and we're just trying to figure out how to, you know, function in a different country.

1311
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:53,900
And so like the trains were never that bad.

1312
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,900
So then we went in the morning to get there right after opening.

1313
01:10:56,900 --> 01:11:02,900
It was the most insane experience of my entire life.

1314
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:09,900
I was just gonna say, yeah, those parks like people line up so crazy early and it's like the fast passes are gone in like.

1315
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:18,900
We just wanted to be able to do journey into the center of the earth so badly that we are like we have to get there first thing in the morning or you don't get a fast pass for it and you don't go on it.

1316
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,900
Did you get it like a 200 minute? Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1317
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:25,900
And amazing. Definitely. You're fucking right. Oh, Lord.

1318
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:31,900
So much that in Sinbad were like my favorite thing.

1319
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:40,900
I've been going through Sinbad with Dr. It's now been a year since I was out there and I think around the anniversary, I listened to the song and it was almost too much to bear.

1320
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:43,900
It's too emotional.

1321
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:52,900
The Sinbad song. I love it so much. I don't know why I'm so emotional when I hear it. I really don't. It's great.

1322
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:59,900
But it's like weird. Like it's as if I heard it when I was five or like when I was in the nursery as a child.

1323
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:02,900
It touched your soul. It really did. It touched your soul.

1324
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:10,900
It's bizarre how it did that. There's very few like newer songs that like do that to me. It's wild.

1325
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:16,900
Joey and I were like just mind blown that we didn't know the words to this song, but it was stuck in our heads.

1326
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:21,900
Yes. And like we'll just randomly send it to each other once in a while or like pictures from the ride.

1327
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:26,900
Like he sent me one the other day and he said, we know who the real who the true Tiger King was.

1328
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:31,900
And then he sent me a picture Sinbad and I'm like, oh my god.

1329
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:36,900
Hell yeah. Sean Dew.

1330
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:44,900
I have one on my bed in like our guest room. I just loved it. I just loved everything about that ride.

1331
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:47,900
I didn't know it was possible to be so in love with the ride.

1332
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:51,900
I know. You didn't really know what was going on, but you knew what was going on.

1333
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:58,900
Real magical. There's a guy he's like caught in the talons of a bird, a bad guy.

1334
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:03,900
Yeah. It's a bunch of drumming monkeys. That part's less moving.

1335
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:08,900
I don't get like I don't like tear up when I think about all the drumming monkeys, but it's cool anyway.

1336
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:13,900
Yeah. Yes, I will agree. I don't tear up thinking about the drumming monkeys.

1337
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:17,900
But the banana smell is great. Yes. Wait, is there a smell in there?

1338
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:22,900
Yes. Oh my god. We just did the fake smell final four and I forgot.

1339
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:26,900
We didn't even address that. It smells like bananas in the banana room.

1340
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:30,900
We screwed up. I forgot. I missed it.

1341
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:35,900
Candice, how how are the treats in Japan?

1342
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:41,900
I was just about to say, which popcorn line did you guys wait the longest for?

1343
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:45,900
We had the chocolate popcorn.

1344
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:49,900
Did you get the honey one by Winnie the Pooh?

1345
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:53,900
Yeah, that was great. Now I'm forgetting what I liked the most.

1346
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:56,900
I liked curry a lot. I don't remember why.

1347
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:02,900
I waited the longest probably for curry and I think that that was over kind of near the Sinbad stuff.

1348
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:05,900
Like their little adventure land type. You got to look it up.

1349
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:08,900
You have to know in advance. Oh yeah. You have to.

1350
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:13,900
But each cart smells exactly like what it is. Oh my god.

1351
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:19,900
The one I was most surprised with was there was like a fresh cracked pepper.

1352
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:23,900
And I loved that one. So simple. It sounds like nothing.

1353
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:26,900
Yeah. Yeah. But I think we might add that too.

1354
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:30,900
Even if you even if you get to the end of the line, get the popcorn and go like, it's all right.

1355
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:35,900
Still, it's very it's a very good base popcorn and it smells so nice around.

1356
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,900
There that you'll forgive it being just. Oh yeah.

1357
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:43,900
I also got and I'm thinking about this and I think maybe we haven't even brought it up on the show, which is strange.

1358
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:47,900
I also got ice cream that was in the shape of Donald Duck's butt.

1359
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:52,900
His seat, Donald's seat.

1360
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:56,900
And he had little like his little feet sticking out of it.

1361
01:14:56,900 --> 01:15:02,900
And the ice cream was like behind, which was very good.

1362
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:08,900
I'm trying to think. Yeah. What other treats do you remember any other treats you had there?

1363
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:19,900
I will. I will say I would like for us to be able to be out here in America to be able to turn our churros into Mickey shaped churros as well, because they're churros.

1364
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:25,900
If you like hold it a certain way, you look at it, it's shaped like a Mickey and I don't know why you can't figure that out.

1365
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:27,900
Like if you're looking down like I.

1366
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:31,900
Yes, yes, I took a picture of it because I was so excited about it.

1367
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:37,900
Like it it's just such a cute little detail that I was like, why why aren't ours like this?

1368
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:42,900
Well, why? That's the thing you ask yourself with a lot of things at Tokyo Disney.

1369
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:45,900
You go, why aren't ours like this?

1370
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,900
It's true. Why isn't our Indiana Jones track so smooth?

1371
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,900
Why aren't more people here?

1372
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:59,900
Not with any other any human friends, but instead just with a Duffy who they're sitting down and having every meal with.

1373
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:02,900
Yes, I will learn that out here.

1374
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:05,900
Candice, can we talk Duffy real quick?

1375
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:07,900
Oh, no.

1376
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:11,900
OK, I suppose.

1377
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:12,900
Just a little. I don't look.

1378
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:15,900
If this is too controversial, I can cut it right out of the.

1379
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,900
What's this? Wait, what do you mean? What's this?

1380
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:20,900
Yeah, you go ahead.

1381
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:27,900
My my cousin and I believe that Duffy is ridiculous and we've hated Duffy since the first time that we saw Duffy.

1382
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:34,900
And I just felt like it was a money making ploy and I just wasn't about that.

1383
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:37,900
And so I didn't want to support Duffy and what Duffy is about.

1384
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:44,900
And I just felt like it was a money making ploy and I just wasn't about that.

1385
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:56,900
And I mean, to the point where when I was at Tokyo Disney and we're walking around and you just like go through that Duffy area, I was so confused.

1386
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:59,900
I was like, how is this even a thing?

1387
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:06,900
And like to realize that Duffy is more famous out there than Mickey Mouse is just like so upsetting to me.

1388
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,900
And I was just appalled.

1389
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:19,900
But Johnny and I, when we first stayed at a Disney resort and they have their channel and there's like a Duffy bear bedtime story thing.

1390
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:25,900
And Johnny asked me about Duffy Bear and discovered how much I just despise Duffy Bear.

1391
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:33,900
But he he made sure to let me know every time Duffy Bear was on that we can watch the Duffy Bear storytime.

1392
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:39,900
And I thought I was being really like funny this year or this past Christmas.

1393
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:52,900
And my friend had taken when I was in Disneyland, my friend had taken me with her to company D and I saw this like Duffy Bear and he was like, I don't know, five bucks or something like that.

1394
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:57,900
And I was like, I'm going to buy this for Johnny for Christmas as a gag gift because I can't tell you.

1395
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:06,900
I mean, as you saw with the turtle calm in the box, Christmases and his birthday are very stressful because I have to find all these things that don't exist in these boxes.

1396
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:14,900
It's ridiculous. So I was like, I'm going to make him think he got the sweet gift and it's going to be a stupid dumb Duffy Bear.

1397
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:19,900
And he just had no reaction to Duffy. And so it wasn't even worth it.

1398
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:23,900
And I have so much regret spending any money on Duffy Bear.

1399
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:31,900
Do you know this exactly happened with Mike and his girlfriend, Lindsay, this Duffy gift exchange that didn't really go over?

1400
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:39,900
Yeah, I just don't. I thought I thought Johnny would at least like pretend to care about Duffy.

1401
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:45,900
I mean, oh, yeah, but well, I got Lindsay, my girlfriend Duffy kind of as a gag, because we'd always make jokes about Duffy.

1402
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:49,900
And I got it for her for her birthday. And she was kind of upset.

1403
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:55,900
I wish he would have at least been upset. He was just nothing like like it did nothing to him.

1404
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:58,900
He had no emotional feeling towards this Duffy.

1405
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:03,900
And I was like, oh, my God, I just spent money on this for nothing now.

1406
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:07,900
I became more upset than he did.

1407
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:12,900
I think maybe you need to get the rest of Duffy's friends for a reaction.

1408
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,900
Oh, God.

1409
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:16,900
Oh, God.

1410
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:18,900
Jelatoni, Shelly May.

1411
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:21,900
I think that then maybe there would be some sort of reaction.

1412
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:25,900
I think you need to get the whole family of characters.

1413
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:28,900
I just.

1414
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:29,900
Wow.

1415
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:39,900
I feel like with Candace Candace despises Duffy, maybe we have a more controversial opinion than Scott doesn't like living with the land.

1416
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:40,900
Maybe. Yeah.

1417
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:43,900
Am I am I off the hook now? No, never.

1418
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:45,900
I'll always be chastised for this.

1419
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:46,900
Yeah, let's go.

1420
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:49,900
Johnny, I can't get Johnny on living with the land either.

1421
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:51,900
He's he's anything. Yes.

1422
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:55,900
Anything educational, anything educational, I cannot get Johnny to do.

1423
01:19:55,900 --> 01:20:05,900
And it's devastating for me because like I took him to do Carousel Progress once and like I'm pumped about it because I'm like, we don't have this at Disneyland.

1424
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:09,900
It's a classic and it's so great. And I'm pumped and I'm happily watching this thing.

1425
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:12,900
We get out. He was like, that was the worst thing.

1426
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:14,900
No, he hates it so much.

1427
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:19,900
And then I took him to see Hall of Presidents and he hated it.

1428
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:26,900
And so I can't even get him to go see American Adventure now because I've discovered that if it's educational, he refuses to do it.

1429
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:29,900
I can't imagine with that pattern that he will like American Adventure.

1430
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:33,900
No, I think he's wrong on Carousel Progress, though.

1431
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:39,900
He's got to embrace the fans and the old machines and the grandma of doing VR in 94.

1432
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:42,900
It's there's a lot of wonder there.

1433
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:45,900
But yeah, keep keep at him.

1434
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:49,900
He'll come. Try as I might.

1435
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:54,900
But so will you go on living with the land alone now?

1436
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:59,900
Um, I haven't been on it.

1437
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:06,900
And so I thought I thought that one of the last times that we went, we were with Tomaso and his wife and their baby.

1438
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:09,900
And I was like, oh, this is something the baby can go on.

1439
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:12,900
And Tomaso and his wife, Jesse, were asking about it.

1440
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:17,900
And I was hyping it up. And as I'm trying to hype it up, Johnny was just like, it's the worst ride.

1441
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:21,900
It is so stupid. You just see a bunch of plants and food.

1442
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:24,900
It's educational, man.

1443
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,900
I have a kindred spirit. I'm so happy.

1444
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:36,900
This is I want to say like that's the biggest heel move Scott has ever made on the show is trashing living with the land.

1445
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:43,900
He's turned most of the audience against them just by saying, just by declaring the ride boring.

1446
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:46,900
What an insane statement that it is boring.

1447
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:51,900
They never ever uttered by any guest in history statement.

1448
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:52,900
I don't even know that that's one that you can.

1449
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:56,900
I don't even know that living with the lands when we keep it, but it's air conditioned. It's great.

1450
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:58,900
Yeah, that's a big draw.

1451
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:00,900
I don't know.

1452
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:03,900
Some some parts are, but some parts are very hard. Maybe.

1453
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,900
Yeah, it is a green ass.

1454
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:10,900
I have I have gone and watched American Adventure by myself.

1455
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:12,900
And then I have also done great moments with Mr.

1456
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:14,900
Lincoln by myself at Disneyland.

1457
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:15,900
Sure.

1458
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:21,900
But that's, you know, I feel like those are just classic things that you just should be doing.

1459
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:25,900
And I'm a nerd and I'm I like history and stuff.

1460
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:31,900
And so like I just can only do those things anymore when he's not with me.

1461
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:36,900
Let it wash over you without the pressure of needing the person you're with to be entertained.

1462
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:39,900
You can just envelop yourself in it.

1463
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:40,900
Yeah.

1464
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:43,900
Can you go on Tiki Room together? Can you watch Tiki Room?

1465
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:46,900
That's a whole other thing, too.

1466
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:48,900
I don't want to bring up pants.

1467
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:57,900
Love. I love the Tiki Room and I love like Trader Sam's and he is not as big on those things.

1468
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:58,900
I true.

1469
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:06,900
So he'll go see it, but he's never going to be one to sing with the birds and he's never going to be one to clap along.

1470
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:09,900
And it's I mean, and that's fine.

1471
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:13,900
But to also not be having, you know, we make compromises.

1472
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:17,900
We love that's what relationship.

1473
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:18,900
It's so true.

1474
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:20,900
That's true love.

1475
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:22,900
You know, that's true.

1476
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:24,900
Look, it's terrible flaws.

1477
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:26,900
Yes.

1478
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:32,900
Animatronic Lincoln and animatronic birds are no goes.

1479
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:34,900
I think I think, you know, I think change can happen.

1480
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:44,900
I think I think one day could maybe if I like pick him up like Dole with the pineapple upside down cake and I'm like, oh, follow me.

1481
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:48,900
We're to a nice cool air conditioned place with entertainment where you can eat this.

1482
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,900
It'll be great.

1483
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:54,900
So essentially, if you construct a Wiley Coyote, ask trap.

1484
01:23:54,900 --> 01:24:00,900
Yes.

1485
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:02,900
So let's let's bring it right.

1486
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:05,900
Let's bring her on to treats before we wrap up.

1487
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:15,900
Do we have like I think we should all go around and like on the topic, like what are what's our Mount Rushmore of treats like like if we build it together?

1488
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:20,900
I mean, Jason, I think you probably as soon as I said that you could list off your your favorites.

1489
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:29,900
We've we've did a little of it already, but I was going to say like, wait, don't I do this every episode?

1490
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:35,900
It's a good point. So can it can amount rushmore is amount rushmore allowed to have 15 presidents?

1491
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:47,900
All right. This about OK. Our Mount Rushmore of treats can have up to 15, but doesn't have to have 15 up to 15 just in that ballpark, you know, on Cliff Wall.

1492
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:52,900
There's plenty of room. I think it'll be more fun if we build our Mount Rushmore together, actually, instead of having.

1493
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:58,900
Yeah, that's probably because I feel I'm having like so much anxiety right now trying to choose.

1494
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:19,900
Sure. I will. I'll start. I'll start. I put a double scoop ice cream sprinkle waffle cone, the specifically the holiday sprinkles, the purple and orange sprinkles with a scoop of strawberry and a scoop of cookie dough in the cone.

1495
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:22,900
That is my first entry on to our Mount Rushmore.

1496
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:27,900
Holy cow. Jason. Yeah, I'm going to go very specific.

1497
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:33,900
Candice, I wanted to ask if you had ever had these. I'm going to go with zebra domes. Does everyone know what a zebra dome is?

1498
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:35,900
Yes. I don't know that I do.

1499
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:43,900
Yeah. You can only find them at the Animal Kingdom Lodge at Boma, the buffet.

1500
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:49,900
Or I think they have them in a cooler at the gift shop, like a fridge at the gift shop.

1501
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:52,900
It is. Yep. It's white cake.

1502
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:59,900
There are these little domes, white cake with a coating of white chocolate ganache, a drizzle of dark chocolate ganache.

1503
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:08,900
And then in between the cake and the ganache is. Oh gosh, I don't know how to pronounce. Amarula, liqueur, mousse?

1504
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:11,900
Yeah. Mousse domes.

1505
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:17,900
Mousse domes. Yeah, they're essentially mousse boats. They're boozy, boozy mousse domes. They're so good. They're really good.

1506
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:22,900
I don't think I have. I don't think I've had. I've had something maybe like that, but I certainly didn't have the one at Animal Kingdom.

1507
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:28,900
I mean, that sounds like a good. That's kind of honestly, that's kind of a fancier treat than I thought you'd go right off the bat.

1508
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:35,900
But I like the choice. Well, you know, part of the appeal is it's very specific and it's like exclusive.

1509
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:41,900
You know, it's got that theme park like exclusive to this, like two locations.

1510
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:48,900
Oh, Jason, you're sending a photo of it. Oh, OK. Yeah, yeah, I like that. Who wants to go next?

1511
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:53,900
I could just sit it all out. I can't get nearly as specific as you can.

1512
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:58,900
These are the longest descriptors. I don't know. I get Mickey bars. I don't know. Mickey bar.

1513
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:03,900
All right. A Mickey bar from Scott. Don't you, Scott, don't you want to describe what it's like to eat it?

1514
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:08,900
Describe eating a Mickey bar like Joe Rody describing the Las Vegas strip on Instagram.

1515
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:18,900
To pierce the shell, a hard outer shell that makes you wonder, could there be anything soft inside?

1516
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:24,900
Or is it so brittle that once I make my way through, it will only be nails and shock?

1517
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:32,900
But no, once you pierce the chocolate shell, what is inside but sweet, soft vanilla ice cream flavors that are opposites

1518
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:41,900
and yet work in concert together. And it is harmony that the ice cream ingredients must have and harmony that we must have as beings on this earth.

1519
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:46,900
Wow. I feel like this was ready. Wow.

1520
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:54,900
I just went I went into a roadie trance. That was good. I won't make you do that. I won't make you do it.

1521
01:27:54,900 --> 01:28:01,900
I can't talk that. Yeah. But you could just say, yeah, is there a what treat would you add to this this rock, this giant rock?

1522
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:10,900
There is one. There is one that Johnny and I have many a times gone completely out of our way for because it's at the contemporary resort.

1523
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:17,900
And it is the peanut butter pie. Oh, interesting. I've not had this. Johnny.

1524
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:28,900
Johnny loves this pie so much. And we've literally gone completely out of our way to get to the contemporary to get him the pie.

1525
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:41,900
And I've even had times where like I went with my cousin one time to Magic Kingdom without Johnny and to bring him home a peace offering for leaving him home.

1526
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:52,900
I went after I walked from Magic Kingdom to the contemporary, got the peanut butter pie and then brought this like happiness home to him.

1527
01:28:53,900 --> 01:29:00,900
And he like he couldn't even be mad. It's his favorite thing in the entire world. Oh, his favorite Disney dessert ever.

1528
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:04,900
Where do you find that the Contempo Cafe, the Wave? What are we talking?

1529
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:12,900
Yes, it's at the Contempo Cafe. They have it in like the little case that they would have the cupcakes and all that good stuff. Sure. Yeah, he loves it.

1530
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:20,900
Have you ever I don't even know how to explain it. Like it's just it's so good. It is good. Have you ever tried to make it?

1531
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:29,900
No, because I so there's been a few things that we've gotten in the parks that I've been like, I probably could figure out how to make this.

1532
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:38,900
But unless I had a recipe, it would be a little tricky to figure some of the bits out, if that makes sense.

1533
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:43,900
Like it wouldn't be exactly the same. And therefore, I don't know that he would like it as much.

1534
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:48,900
Right. You would want it to be perfect. And it's there's a couple of elements that would be a little off, probably.

1535
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:55,900
Yeah. Yeah. Well, it sounds good. I mean, I next time I get there, I would like to do that. That sounds good.

1536
01:29:55,900 --> 01:30:00,900
I need to try Jason's treat, too. So I guess that's we'll stick with four right now.

1537
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:08,900
So our Mount Rushmore of treats is double scoop, sprinkle, Halloween cone. Jason, what's the name of yours?

1538
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:16,900
Zebra Dome, Zebra Dome, Contempo, peanut butter pie and Mickey Bar.

1539
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:19,900
I mean, that's a good mix, I think, because Mickey Bar is a classic.

1540
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:25,900
The ice cream is kind of a classic and those other two are fancy, delicious treats.

1541
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:34,900
And Teddy Roosevelt's still on there, too. He's not he's not a treat, but, you know, just to not have the original Mount Rushmore.

1542
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:39,900
Oh, wait, what if he's eyeing it? It's fogging up his glasses.

1543
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:47,900
He's so hungry and he's got a rock knife and fork with his hands and his tongue stick out.

1544
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:50,900
Tongue is sticking out. He's very excited.

1545
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:53,900
Ready to rip, ready to rip all these desserts.

1546
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:59,900
He's an animatronic, too. He's multiple times an animatronic in Hall of Presidents and American Adventure.

1547
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:03,900
Two attractions that Johnny won't go on.

1548
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:06,900
Hmm. Yeah. Should he?

1549
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:11,900
There should be an animatronic of him with a knife and fork somewhere in the parks.

1550
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:16,900
Is there an animatronic with a knife and fork that we can think of real quick before we were done here?

1551
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:20,900
Hmm. Yeah. Is anyone eating or about to eat dessert?

1552
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:24,900
Oh, wait, wait, I think maybe Molly and Mr. Toad's Wild Bride.

1553
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:27,900
Oh, maybe. Yeah, maybe.

1554
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:30,900
Yeah, because he's got a spinning dinner, right?

1555
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:33,900
I'm trying to look it up now.

1556
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:36,900
Jason's nightmare, a spinning dinner.

1557
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:41,900
I'm trying to look it up because I'm pretty sure you run him.

1558
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:45,900
He's sitting at a table. Oh, you know what? He may only have a food in his head.

1559
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:49,900
He is eating, but he does not have a fork and knife.

1560
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:52,900
It looks like a turkey leg, though, that he has.

1561
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:58,900
Yeah, I'm seeing a picture of mole with a turk, like maybe a drumstick in his hand.

1562
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:03,900
Yeah, maybe he just got a turkey leg in the park and he is like, I'll just get back to work now.

1563
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:06,900
And he looks like he's been caught.

1564
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:10,900
He looks like he's like not supposed to be eating that.

1565
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:12,900
Yeah, maybe, maybe not.

1566
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:16,900
Are there a lot of treats and rides?

1567
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:20,900
I'm sure like Pleasure Island and Pinocchio's during Journey for sure.

1568
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:25,900
There's a lot of candy canes and cupcakes and stuff.

1569
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:30,900
Is that the treatiest ride potentially?

1570
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:35,900
I mean, there's a lot of honey and Winnie the Pooh and that's a treat to him.

1571
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:40,900
There you go. Yes, that's probably the most food centric, at least that I can think of at the moment.

1572
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:43,900
Sushi on Monster's Inc.

1573
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:47,900
There's rum on Pirates, if that's a treat.

1574
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:52,900
I guess rum is a treat to some extent.

1575
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:55,900
Are there there's no I guess there's food.

1576
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:59,900
There's food in in the Haunted Mansion in the dining room.

1577
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:01,900
Yeah, they have a spread.

1578
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:05,900
There's that one scene in Rise of the Resistance where they all stop dead in their tracks and say,

1579
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:10,900
Let's all have a big glass of blue milk, everyone.

1580
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:15,900
That's only that's only like one out of every eight rides you get that.

1581
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:18,900
Yeah, it's one of the paths not everybody knows about that one.

1582
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:24,900
I'm not sure everyone's gotten it, but yeah, it's really just to watch everybody like get along for a minute and then get back to the chase.

1583
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:26,900
Yeah, yeah.

1584
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:32,900
And it's the first it's the first milk drinking animatronic Kylo Ren animatronic.

1585
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:35,900
Yeah.

1586
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:40,900
Candice, thoughts on blue and green milk?

1587
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:42,900
I love blue milk.

1588
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:45,900
Yeah, green milk is not my favorite.

1589
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:49,900
But but I have gotten out here.

1590
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:56,900
We have the adult versions of the beverages and they are both very nice as adult beverages.

1591
01:33:56,900 --> 01:34:01,900
And I would go so far as to say that the green one is better as the adult version.

1592
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:04,900
That's the one I had.

1593
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:09,900
Yeah, I think the flavor on its own lends itself more to it, you know, a Jason's drink.

1594
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:12,900
And it's kind of weird on its own without alcohol.

1595
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:14,900
Yeah.

1596
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:15,900
How about butter beer?

1597
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:17,900
Yes. No.

1598
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:18,900
Too sweet.

1599
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:21,900
Yes. But I this is another one Johnny and I agree on.

1600
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:27,900
So then when he orders their beer, it's a little sad for me, but I prefer it in its natural form.

1601
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:30,900
Johnny prefers the slushy version.

1602
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:31,900
I agree with you.

1603
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:32,900
I agree with you.

1604
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:33,900
The more soda one.

1605
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:38,900
I feel like you don't you don't get the full effect of the foam if you're drinking it through a straw.

1606
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:39,900
Agreed.

1607
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:40,900
And then what's the point?

1608
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:41,900
What's the point?

1609
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:42,900
The foam is fun.

1610
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:44,900
Is that there's hot too.

1611
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:45,900
Right.

1612
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:46,900
They have hot now.

1613
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:47,900
Yeah, I've not.

1614
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:49,900
I like hot.

1615
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:50,900
What's your ranking?

1616
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:54,900
What's your ranking, Jason, of the types?

1617
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:56,900
Cold, hot, frozen.

1618
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,900
Frozen last.

1619
01:34:58,900 --> 01:34:59,900
Frozen last.

1620
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:01,900
And what about have you had butter beer fudge?

1621
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:05,900
I can't remember if I've had butter beer fudge.

1622
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:08,900
I've had the butter beer pop to creme again.

1623
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:10,900
A mousse mousse kind of.

1624
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:12,900
That is very sweet.

1625
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:13,900
Interesting.

1626
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:14,900
I've had the butter beer fudge.

1627
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:17,900
It's good for like a bite, but it's so insanely sweet.

1628
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,900
Yeah.

1629
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:21,900
But I appreciate the effort.

1630
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:23,900
I appreciate what they were trying to do.

1631
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:26,900
I don't want to insult the bakers at Universal.

1632
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:29,900
Hey, Candice, these parks open back up.

1633
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:32,900
What's the first treat you're going for?

1634
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:34,900
What's the thing you'll be the most dying to have

1635
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:36,900
after a bunch of months off?

1636
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:39,900
I feel like I want a churro really badly.

1637
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:41,900
I think that that's my ultimate safe bet.

1638
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:46,900
No matter how I'm feeling, no matter what is going on in my life,

1639
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:48,900
what I should and shouldn't be eating,

1640
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:54,900
because I only like Disney parks churros.

1641
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:59,900
So it's like and I don't know why, but nobody else does it the way that they do.

1642
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:05,900
Not going to somewhere else that I've been like, no, not now.

1643
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:06,900
No, just not the same.

1644
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:07,900
Huh?

1645
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:10,900
Very specific about Disneyland and Disney World.

1646
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:15,900
I won't even get the ones that at like Disney Springs or downtown Disney,

1647
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:17,900
like there's different like churro stands that they'll have,

1648
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:19,900
but I won't even get those.

1649
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:20,900
It's not the same.

1650
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:21,900
Interesting.

1651
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:22,900
Yeah.

1652
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:24,900
I always tell Johnny, I don't know what he's going to do when I'm pregnant

1653
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:28,900
and we're in Cleveland and I'm like, oh, I want a churro or I want a Dole Whip.

1654
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:30,900
And then what's he going to do?

1655
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:33,900
Have to import them from like, he'll have to have like somebody go to the park

1656
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:35,900
and send them in the mail.

1657
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:36,900
Yeah.

1658
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:39,900
That'll be Mike's full time job when you move to Orlando.

1659
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:40,900
Yeah.

1660
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:41,900
Churro mailer.

1661
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:42,900
Yeah.

1662
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:49,900
Hey, if it's lucrative, I mean, it won't be, but if it is,

1663
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:53,900
I guess I'm trying to think of any other Orlando hotspots.

1664
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:54,900
Do you have you?

1665
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:59,900
Have you guys been to the Dr. Toothsome Chocolate Emporium at CityWalk?

1666
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:00,900
Yes.

1667
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:01,900
Yes, we have.

1668
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:02,900
Any?

1669
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:08,900
And yes, it's the food isn't like out of this world,

1670
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:15,900
but the concept of it's cool and like, I don't know, we go there once in a while.

1671
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:16,900
Right.

1672
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:18,900
I had like a shake there.

1673
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:19,900
Yeah.

1674
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:21,900
And it was, it was good.

1675
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:22,900
You have to get it.

1676
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:23,900
You have to get one.

1677
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:32,900
But yeah, but see out at Johnny lost his mind when downtown Disney got a salt

1678
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:33,900
and straw.

1679
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:34,900
Oh, right.

1680
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:40,900
Like we would rather go there and get ice cream there every single time we go

1681
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:42,900
and stay in a hotel out there.

1682
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:46,900
He, we have to get salt and straw and he gets whatever the seasonal flavor is.

1683
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:47,900
Gotcha.

1684
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:51,900
So if you, if you tried like most of the flavors at salt and straw.

1685
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:54,900
Yeah, we've had some shipped to our house before too.

1686
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:55,900
Wow.

1687
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:56,900
Yeah.

1688
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:59,900
He's very serious, especially about ice cream.

1689
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:01,900
Hey, Jason can appreciate that.

1690
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:02,900
Much respect.

1691
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,900
Ice cream and donuts.

1692
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:08,900
Then we have, we have like, he's very, very intense about those things.

1693
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:12,900
Very serious business when we're dealing with donuts and ice cream.

1694
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:13,900
Interesting.

1695
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:16,900
What, so what, do you, are you have flavors in your house at all times of ice

1696
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:17,900
cream?

1697
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:22,900
No, because so we won't have, there's some things we can't have in the house at

1698
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:27,900
all times, which is why I can't bake all the time because if this stuff is just

1699
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:29,900
sitting in the house, he's going to eat it.

1700
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:30,900
Right.

1701
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:33,900
And he's always like on the most strict diet ever.

1702
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:35,900
So we won't have full on ice cream.

1703
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:36,900
He will eat it.

1704
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:40,900
I mean, we've had it, we've had it where we've gotten like salt and straw and

1705
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:43,900
we'll order it and we're like, okay, well, you know, cheat days in a week.

1706
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:45,900
So they'll just sit in the freezer for a little bit.

1707
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:48,900
And then halfway through the week, he's like, maybe we'll just share one.

1708
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:51,900
And then, or he's like, or maybe I'll just have a bite or two.

1709
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:55,900
I'm like, you're never, you are not going to just eat a bite of ice cream.

1710
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:57,900
Like that's not going to happen.

1711
01:38:57,900 --> 01:38:58,900
That's not how it works.

1712
01:38:58,900 --> 01:38:59,900
Impossible.

1713
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:00,900
Yeah.

1714
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:01,900
No, he's like my cats and food.

1715
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:04,900
If you just leave it out, they'll eat the entire bag.

1716
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:06,900
Yeah.

1717
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:08,900
And just choke on the ground.

1718
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:12,900
Do you guys, do you get to do one cheat day a week?

1719
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:13,900
Is that how you do it?

1720
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:15,900
It depends.

1721
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:17,900
Right now we are.

1722
01:39:17,900 --> 01:39:24,900
And it's taken a while because like Johnny was like a little heavier when he was younger.

1723
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:30,900
And so like he's really come like he's lost a lot of weight and he's come a long way.

1724
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:31,900
And but he's still in his mind.

1725
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:36,900
Hasn't accepted that he has physically changed his metabolism.

1726
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:41,900
And like, like it's a concept he just, he will not accept.

1727
01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:45,900
And so if we do have a cheat day, he thinks he just put on like 50 pounds.

1728
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:48,900
And I'm like, but you definitely didn't.

1729
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:51,900
You still have like 20 abs.

1730
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:52,900
Like you're good.

1731
01:39:53,900 --> 01:40:09,900
And so right now, because we don't have like a takeover on the horizon or anything of that nature, he'll have like one meal or like a day a week, depending on how he feels.

1732
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:14,900
But I am more likely to have like one a week.

1733
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:23,900
But if we get really, if it's like a takeover is on the horizon, then we will kind of, I'm trying to be more aware of his needs.

1734
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:32,900
And I will try to not just eat whatever I want whenever I want, because he'll go like three, four weeks without any kind of cheat meal.

1735
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:34,900
And it's crazy.

1736
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:35,900
Yeah.

1737
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:46,900
Then he indulges after, which is when we usually do our like Disney trips or we almost always have a Disney trip planned right around takeover because he can just eat anything and everything he wants.

1738
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:47,900
Oh yeah, yeah.

1739
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:53,900
And that's when he'll get like cartons of and cartons of ice cream shipped to the house or like brownies.

1740
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:55,900
And yeah, it gets crazy.

1741
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:56,900
Yeah.

1742
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:59,900
And then he gets sick and we're a little sad for a second.

1743
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:07,900
So you guys, what basically what you're saying is you get the hell beat out of you and then you reward yourselves for.

1744
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:08,900
Yes. Yes.

1745
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:14,900
We will, you know, I learned that when your body is healing, you need extra calories so that your body can heal.

1746
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:17,900
So we need the extra calories and that's fine.

1747
01:41:17,900 --> 01:41:18,900
It's fine.

1748
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:19,900
Yeah.

1749
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:27,900
And for the listener, Takeover is like a big wrestling event where there's like big like kind of longer matches.

1750
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:28,900
I don't know how I would describe it.

1751
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:29,900
Bigger matches.

1752
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:45,900
Yeah, there's yeah, it's like our big like I just don't even it's our pay-per-view show and it's it's a kind of big deal for us because there's a little bit more there's more eyes on us.

1753
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:49,900
And usually, usually there's a lot more on the line at those.

1754
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:59,900
So it's kind of like a culmination, like having little story, mini Super Bowls, you know, like little mini Super Bowls along the way.

1755
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:00,900
And that's our takeovers.

1756
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:01,900
Right.

1757
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:04,900
Every single one of them feels like the biggest day ever.

1758
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:09,900
I don't know how Johnny has done so many of them and is not stressed out every single time.

1759
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:10,900
Oh, yeah.

1760
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:11,900
Oh, yeah.

1761
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:18,900
I mean, from watching them is like it does feel like it would be the most draining in a good way.

1762
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:22,900
Like, I mean, I've been to one live and it's just it's exhausting.

1763
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:31,900
Like, you're like, whoa, I really like saw some crazy, crazy events because everyone is so excited and it's the culmination of so many storylines and stuff.

1764
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:36,900
So there's no better thing to do than just treat yourself a little laughter.

1765
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:37,900
Oh, yeah.

1766
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:40,900
I mean, everyone's earned it for for God's sake.

1767
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:47,900
So if only this Mount Rushmore that we invented was a real place and you could just go devour it.

1768
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:52,900
Jason, Jason thinks every podcast taping is like a takeover for him.

1769
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:56,900
Yeah, I leave it all on the floor.

1770
01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:58,900
I leave it all up.

1771
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:01,900
He's in he's in bed for weeks.

1772
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:03,900
This is it.

1773
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:05,900
We started we started at 9 a.m.

1774
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:18,900
California time and with the current situation and well, yeah, let's say with the current situation, this is the earliest I have been awake in a month.

1775
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:22,900
I thought I was I was wondering, yeah, what your average wake up time has been lately.

1776
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:26,900
I've been doing the the 2 a.m. to 10 a.m.

1777
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:28,900
Sleep shift or three to three to 11.

1778
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:35,900
So, you know, well, then you just have a couple of gallons of ice cream and then get to bed at noon.

1779
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:40,900
Yeah, that's not that far out.

1780
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:45,900
Well, do we have any anyone else have any thoughts on treats?

1781
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:48,900
Any closing thoughts on treats?

1782
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:50,900
Yeah, we love them.

1783
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:53,900
We love to say they're just they're just great.

1784
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:56,900
Treat yourself.

1785
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:57,900
Treat yourself.

1786
01:43:57,900 --> 01:44:01,900
That's yes, everyone, especially now during this time.

1787
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:03,900
Treat yourself.

1788
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:05,900
Scott, what do you think?

1789
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:09,900
You're the least treat centric of us.

1790
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:10,900
That's that's kind of true.

1791
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:17,900
But it's nice to talk about them, talk about things we can't have live vicariously through people in the past who could have treats.

1792
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:19,900
And Candice, thank you.

1793
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:20,900
Thank you for making trees.

1794
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:24,900
Thank you for providing them to hungry theme park goers for so many years.

1795
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:26,900
Thank you for your your service.

1796
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:28,900
And you survived podcast.

1797
01:44:28,900 --> 01:44:30,900
The right.

1798
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:31,900
Thank you for being here.

1799
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:33,900
Let's exit through the gift shop.

1800
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:35,900
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

1801
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:45,900
Well, I would feel silly if I did not add that you can catch NXT on USA 8 p.m. Wednesday night.

1802
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:53,900
And I have no crazy, interesting name on Twitter or Instagram other than at Candice Loure.

1803
01:44:53,900 --> 01:44:55,900
So creative.

1804
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:58,900
Yeah, that's OK.

1805
01:44:58,900 --> 01:45:01,900
It doesn't have to be a showy name or anything.

1806
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:02,900
It's easier.

1807
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:07,900
The more you have weird little nicknames and stuff than nobody can remember it.

1808
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:14,900
So what you called yourself something else, though, like wait, there's something about something about Pixie or I'm sorry.

1809
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:15,900
I'm Pixie.

1810
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:16,900
I'm Pixie.

1811
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:20,900
OK, so you don't go by Pint size Pixie, but you will answer to Pint size Pixie.

1812
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:22,900
You know, as you do.

1813
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:23,900
Sure.

1814
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:26,900
So when we.

1815
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:32,900
Yeah. So you'll have to come back when we're all allowed to see human beings again in person.

1816
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:34,900
That'd be great.

1817
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:35,900
We who knows when that'll happen.

1818
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:39,900
But as soon as it does, we'll make that happen.

1819
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:48,900
Maybe maybe I'll convince Johnny to go on one of these attractions once everything is open again and tell him I've just missed it so much.

1820
01:45:48,900 --> 01:45:51,900
And then we will report back to you guys with how he does.

1821
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:53,900
Yeah, I would.

1822
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:59,900
It would be very funny if like he got he went on all of those rides and then just gave a review.

1823
01:45:59,900 --> 01:46:00,900
All of them.

1824
01:46:00,900 --> 01:46:02,900
His review, his review would maybe be.

1825
01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:04,900
Yeah.

1826
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:09,900
Anything Scott said would pale in comparison to the reviews of those rides by Johnny.

1827
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:14,900
Let's get this villain heat off of me a little bit.

1828
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:20,900
But yeah, hey, as for us, check us out on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

1829
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:25,900
And there's three bonus episodes every month at Patreon.com slash podcast.

1830
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:26,900
The ride. That's the second gate.

1831
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:28,900
Lots of fun over there.

1832
01:46:28,900 --> 01:46:30,900
Anything else, fellas?

1833
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:31,900
No, I'm good.

1834
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:33,900
I'm a little hungry for something sweet.

1835
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:35,900
I'll be honest.

1836
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:36,900
Time for something sweet.

1837
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:39,900
It's time for something sweet, as Winnie the Pooh would say.

1838
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:41,900
Jason, what are you going to eat for Jason?

1839
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:42,900
What are you going to eat next?

1840
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:51,900
Well, Michael, I am eyeing a Reese's little mini Easter bunny that is sitting on this table and it's got my name written all over it.

1841
01:46:51,900 --> 01:46:53,900
A bunny.

1842
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:54,900
It's shaped like a bunny.

1843
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:56,900
Yeah, it's a little mini bunny.

1844
01:46:56,900 --> 01:46:57,900
OK, so it's a smaller.

1845
01:46:57,900 --> 01:46:58,900
It's not a full size.

1846
01:46:58,900 --> 01:46:59,900
It's a small.

1847
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:00,900
Yeah, it's not a full size.

1848
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:01,900
I'm not going to eat a full size rabbit.

1849
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:02,900
No, don't be silly.

1850
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:07,900
I'm just going to eat some regular sized 11 a.m. chocolate.

1851
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:09,900
OK, that's all right.

1852
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:10,900
All right.

1853
01:47:10,900 --> 01:47:11,900
Well, I'm good.

1854
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:12,900
All right.

1855
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:13,900
OK.

1856
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:14,900
Later.

1857
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:15,900
Bye, everybody.

1858
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:16,900
Bye, everybody.
