1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm Scott Gardner. My co-hosts are Mike Carlson and Jason Sheridan.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm kind of ripping through the intro. Feel free to say hi.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I don't mean to go that fast.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hello.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hi.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm making speed here and I'll tell you why because I want to get to something.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So we recently put out a call for gripes, for complaints that the audience has about the show.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And we're going through those and we'll have a whole episode about them.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But there's one that we wanted to rectify as quickly as possible.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And I will read that right now.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Actually not an anonymous gripe they named themselves.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah, I got a gripe. More Nick Mundy.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Preferably introduced with the 1985 version of Real American by Rick Derringer.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And that's from Tom from Cleveland.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So, Tom from Cleveland, today is your American day.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the bad man, the crypto dandy, the godfather of podcast, the ride, Nick Mundy.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Go ahead. Now, now you go talk.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That song's way less cool.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Well, then what?

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What do you mean just in general?

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
For just so many reasons.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hey, thanks for having me. Thanks. Thanks, Tom.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yeah, Tom. Tom has given Nick Mundy the theme of a real life villain now.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Well, you know what?

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Look, this is a little embarrassing, but I brought my own music.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's got some Steve Miller.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You just had a drop at the ready? You hit a button all pro. You didn't even have to share the zoom screen.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's what I brought.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I would like to say that I also had music ready for Nick Mundy to be played in.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He gets three entrance themes?

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah. I had a couple different options and I was ready to go on the fly depending on what it was, but I'll just go with this one.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This is, of course, a super cut of the Entourage theme, just the oh yeah part.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We'll just play that for the whole podcast, I think.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So we were all prepared, I think.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And no one went with Jurassic Quest.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, we're going to get to that.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Jurassic. Jurassic Quest. Colossal. Fantastic.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Jason, you're spoiling the song from the thing we're talking about today.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Oh boy.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The title and the graphic probably did too.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah, well, sure.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess people know what this is about.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yeah, you know, we're talking about Jurassic Quest, the dinosaur experience in a parking lot due to the ongoing pandemic.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:54,000
We'll get to that. I do just want to say, even though I don't want Nick to get a big head off of that request because another gripe was too much talk about Nick Mundy.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And that one was kept anonymous. So you've got fans and you've got haters both.

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Look, man, this country is very bipartisan.

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So we're pretty divided and I don't know. It's a divided country.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah. But wait, was the second one, Sheridan?

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Only you can tell us.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No, I wrote all the unhinged gripes.

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay.

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I wrote the Vendetta based ones. I wrote the ones of like, well, here is what I think these people's journeys are.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Here is my head cannon. You've all killed before.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And this is your confession.

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah, well, we won't know, though, because we I mean, it would be funny if we were doing a trick with the gripes and we could see everyone who posted them and we just lied to them and said, but I think we can't.

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't think there's actually a way to do it. So we'll never really know who Jason Sheridan is in the gripes.

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes, we'll never know for sure.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I would like to real quick before we get into Jurassic Quest, which I would like to talk about at length.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You've recently come up on the podcast because you were made a very generous offer by Jason Sheridan and I who are going into business together with a tequila, with a Buenos Ninos tequila.

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Something that we wanted to do because one of our heroes in business also has a tequila, Mr. Randy Gerber.

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Nick, I don't know if you remember this, but there was a story that was told on the last.

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It was the last time you were on. I think it might have been that has.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So I'm not sure if you're aware, but ever since you left, absolutely not aware.

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:50,000
OK, so, you know, you stormed out of the podcast because the story was told and what's happened is it has never stopped coming up over the course of a year and a half.

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
How long has it been? I believe I stormed off.

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I believe I just undid Carlson's microphone. You unplugged my microphone and the middle of the story.

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Now, if we really want to relitigate exactly sort of what happened, I was just telling the story of Randy Gerber, Cindy Crawford's husband, and then Jason unbeknownst to me also had a piece of knowledge about the briefcase story and he was able to add to it.

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So we both kind of came together in an unexpected way to understand the joy of what Randy Gerber, Cindy Crawford's husband has done for the country at large in the world.

73
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, and it's kind of like how Randy Gerber and George Clooney came together to make a premium tequila brand.

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's exactly like that.

75
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Mike, is the person on is this you change your zoom background? Is that Randy Gerber? I don't know.

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I genuinely don't know because he's such an anonymous person to me.

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This is leaving right now. Guys, no, just left here.

78
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll prove it. We'll screenshot it.

79
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And he wasn't wrong to you have no and there's nothing keeping you here.

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We don't even have a door that we could lock to keep you in.

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You're you're in another state. You're far away. Right. Yeah, I got about 15 minutes.

82
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay. Okay. So how much Randy do we got? You're gonna have to plow through it, Mike.

83
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So yeah, so all I'm saying is that we offered you a spot on the Buenos Ninos tequila team.

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But you said you were not going to we made up a big photo, a photo while Jason and I were on bikes,

85
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:32,000
like the famous picture of George Clooney and Randy Gerber on the famous, a very funny photo that is very funny without any other context or explanation.

86
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's always hilarious just on its own when you see it. Right. Right. That is right.

87
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's on the top. It's on a truck. And you go, well, who's that guy with George Clooney?

88
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And you find out it's sitting. Crawford's husband. It's funny as fuck.

89
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You're laughing your ass off. And you guys, you know, you wanted to give it a tribute.

90
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So when you said you were open to it, I just wanted to know where you were at with it.

91
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
If you if you were thinking any more about it, it seemed like you were open to it.

92
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And let me check my. Check my crypto app.

93
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You have not sent me any tasos payments.

94
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I have not accepting tasos payments, which is a cryptocurrency.

95
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm only accepting tasos at worse Algorand.

96
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So until you start paying up and some tasos just down four percent, we could move on.

97
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
OK, well, I will call me the crypto dandy on bad YouTube for nothing.

98
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Well, look, you are the crypto dandy.

99
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We all know that. And I will send you some tasos.

100
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And what's great about tasos is you can stake it. Yep.

101
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Which is something that we're watching.

102
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You get into instead of dinosaurs in a parking lot today. Jesus Christ.

103
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What is tasos? Is tasos a celebrity branded Bitcoin?

104
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's also a movie star and some guys endeavor.

105
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't believe there's a celebrity attached to tasos.

106
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I believe it's something different than that.

107
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But I would be interested to know if there was a Randy Gerber Bitcoin, a Randy Gerber cryptocurrency.

108
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Maybe podcast the right should have their own cryptocurrency.

109
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm starting to think now that might not be a bad idea.

110
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I mean, it would be there a naming mechanism for them or is it just kind of boy.

111
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You want boy coins? Is that what you just said? Yeah.

112
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh, I don't know. Good boy.

113
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm worried that's already something and it's something we don't want to get anywhere near.

114
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Boy coins. Good boy coins, maybe? Too mouthy.

115
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Well, yeah, closer, closer.

116
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
How about seat coins? No, no, no, no.

117
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What? OK.

118
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What else? What other things are on the podcast?

119
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Fake rock coin? Wet coin. Wet coin? Wet coins?

120
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We're going to jail for saying any of these words.

121
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
We will. We're not going to make it through the end of this.

122
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
There will be FBI presence in all of our respective Algo boy.

123
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's it. Well, that would be.

124
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:23,000
No, Scott, I got it. I think when it comes to the crypto world, there's a lot more conspiracy theory psychopaths and Silicon Valley libertarian weirdos that the government is surveilling before us.

125
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's a long list.

126
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Elon Musk is tweeting about boy coin right now and seed coin instead of seed coin.

127
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Honestly, that's my pick for the name, but we could talk about it off air.

128
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah. Instead of paying his employees, health care is giving them boy coin.

129
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah, we're going to pay our guests in boy coin and seed coin.

130
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That's if you work for Tesla, you now get paid in podcasts, the rides, cryptocurrency.

131
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah, because, you know, it can be fun. Crypto can be.

132
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
There's Dogecoin, which is the dog. That's kind of a meme currency.

133
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Well, now I feel like Scott, I'm over here laughing so much like he laughing at that picture.

134
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
This is not the main show, right?

135
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
No.

136
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
No, it's the second gate. Thank God.

137
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah, yeah, this is the other one.

138
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So there's even less pressure to stay on top.

139
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The one where people pay their hard earned boy coin to listen to.

140
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's correct.

141
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You're making sure you're ensuring that it is boy coin and not seed.

142
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He doesn't like seed coin.

143
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I think I'm oddly I'm more on board with boy coin as my aversion to seed has grown almost as high as my aversion to the Randy Gerber story.

144
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
All right. Well, fine. It's a boy coin. That's the official podcast to ride cryptocurrency.

145
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'll look. I don't think there is one yet that's called boy coin.

146
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But if there is, then we'll go to see coin. But I'm comfortable.

147
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm very comfortable now with calling it that.

148
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So so I thank you again. You've you helped us get this podcast started.

149
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And now you're helping us have basically just some weird Internet grift Internet money grift going on.

150
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So thank you for that.

151
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yeah. Did you play your theme?

152
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Did you just play your theme again? It's a little hard to hear.

153
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yeah. I don't crank it. Sounds like interference.

154
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I have some more Steve Miller whispering.

155
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Hmm.

156
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah. Well, we'll just I'll put in Steve Miller.

157
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'll just put in the Joker like we were every time you say something cool.

158
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It was just do it in post.

159
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'll add in. Look, I've been in Texas and listen to Steve Miller nonstop for nine months.

160
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah. Let's let's do this podcast.

161
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Well, America has been, you know, forced to deal with Steve Miller's bullshit for four years with that Trump administration.

162
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I mean, come on now.

163
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What's that? Oh, Stephen Mill. Oh, I think.

164
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
OK, there we go.

165
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Should have. Well, yeah, it's the same name, but the the E.N. changes a lot.

166
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
He's leaving again. Oh, no.

167
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
OK, we better get into this thing.

168
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Nick, you brought up. Yeah.

169
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You when when it became clear that this all was going to take approximately longer than a presidential term to play out the virus and all you very intelligently

170
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
made it made it back to Texas.

171
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You've been hanging out in Texas for a while.

172
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah, you know, I have a I have a child and while we enjoyed our place, we had a nice place.

173
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Kids like to do things and run around and and and play enjoy.

174
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
They are newly on the years like children want to experience being alive.

175
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah, they don't want to.

176
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:05,000
They don't want to watch their father plan trips to Gelson's at 11 at night covered in plastic, putting bag after bag over yourself.

177
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yeah. So, you know, we made the move to take an RV and drove across country state in Texas and it's been working out for us.

178
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And, you know, we're we're joined our home. We miss everyone there.

179
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
But I mean, it's a shithole in Texas, too, as far as like, you know, people are just filled.

180
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But Rutgers is just filled to the brim.

181
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Well, our fund records is literally closed outside at the other day.

182
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And it's it's still the Burbank one. It's like stained with the logo like the close on the spot is still there.

183
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
This fund records has a drive through.

184
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I am so jealous of this. They closed Fudd Rutgers here.

185
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And now you're telling me there's a drive through there, which is even better.

186
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I like the inside of Fudd Rutgers because it hasn't changed since 1993.

187
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't know how to be like, hey, can you fill the basket filled with cheese from the cheese pump?

188
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't know how to ask that in a drive through.

189
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Well, that yeah, that's the only thing I was thinking would be a problem, too, because obviously, as everyone out there knows, you don't order a cheeseburger from Fudd Rutgers.

190
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You get a regular hamburger and then you smother it with the pump that has like nacho cheese inside.

191
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That's, of course, one of the greatest hacks.

192
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Jason knows what I'm talking about.

193
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I do know what you're talking about. Those burgers are not good, though.

194
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That is not correct.

195
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The atmosphere, the atmosphere.

196
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You are wrong, sir.

197
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The atmosphere is great.

198
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And I love a toppings bar.

199
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Look, Jason, especially once Burbank had an in and out of five guys and a shake.

200
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Like, I mean, come on, this is Jason's.

201
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Jason, we've come so far.

202
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Jason, we've come so far.

203
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I know I do recall Scott eating Fudd Rutgers with me for the first time like three years ago.

204
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And Scott may be sharing the exact opinion Jason has.

205
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yeah, look, you know, it's good to align with Jason when I can.

206
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
We don't line up on boat ride issues, but I think we do line up on what burgers make you ill.

207
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And Fudd Rutgers is one of those burgers.

208
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But you would have to admit that I think at the time you were sitting in the Tonight Show booth in the Burbank Fudd Rutgers, which made everything all right.

209
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm really sad that that is gone, primarily.

210
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Like, that's Burbank history.

211
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
There was a maybe their biggest booth was devoted to the Jay Leno Tonight Show.

212
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I guess some Carson in there, but it was very Leno centric, never acknowledged Conan or Jimmy Fallon.

213
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Unlike the ride, it stayed all Leno.

214
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You have to imagine Jay was in there at some point, maybe at many points.

215
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And whatever establishment takes over that space, I think should maintain the Tonight Show with Jay Leno booth.

216
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Oh, yeah, I agree.

217
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's it was just like basically it was a bigger booth with some pictures of Jay surrounding the booth.

218
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
In case it says it.

219
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
But with the logo really big, like painted on that wall, that that was cool.

220
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Nick, Nick, do you have a favorite Fudd Rutgers of your life?

221
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah, there's one near the Willowbrook Mall in where the town I grew up.

222
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And I remember being a kid because, like, after baseball games, you would go there and it had a big arcade.

223
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And then also had wall to wall, like different flavored strawberry daiquiris.

224
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Wow.

225
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
More boozy.

226
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh, wow.

227
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Interesting.

228
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
We really only had like beer there.

229
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And I think they only really had beer at the Burbank one, too.

230
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It was it was a it's I think it's still open.

231
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But this one does not have a drive through.

232
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Wow.

233
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And it's probably still filled with people.

234
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Did they close the Fudd Rutgers in Buena Park, California?

235
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I think they might have.

236
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yeah, I think they might have to this man.

237
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Texas sounds better and better the more I hear about it.

238
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
All right.

239
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Well, there's an awesome guy currently making a lot of noise out there.

240
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
This is this dude, Ted Cruz.

241
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah.

242
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And if you so if you go to Texas, you can be closer to him, maybe run into him, maybe in the packed Fudd Rutgers.

243
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm gonna.

244
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah, yeah, I think you might.

245
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And that's really where you're beating us in general, Nick, is that you're that you could end up friends with Ted Cruz.

246
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
At any point, I'm going to pants him.

247
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah.

248
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
When you're when you're all maskless in a Fudd Rutgers, I'm going to pants him in front of his children.

249
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yeah.

250
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Well, that's good.

251
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I mean, he'll he'll probably just enjoy it.

252
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And then you can maybe talk some sense into him in general.

253
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yeah, they know I'll pants him, embarrass him, emasculate him, and then I'll, you know, try to steal an election for me.

254
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's what Trump did to him.

255
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So yeah, I mean, so then he'll be at your board.

256
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So then he'll be at your beck and call for the rest of his life.

257
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
He'll love you.

258
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Right. And you guys will be going to Steve Miller band concerts together after.

259
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh, don't you dare.

260
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What?

261
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Don't you dare.

262
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yeah.

263
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
All right. All right.

264
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You don't have to go to that.

265
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You can go to any number of the comedy clubs that are likely operating in Texas.

266
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Any number of the covid riddled stand up comedians going around the country, go like, oh, this thing like pulling the mask, doing mask like like stage work like.

267
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Complaining about covid while getting it and spreading it.

268
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You and Ted arm arms over each other.

269
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Laughing it up.

270
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
This is going to be a great thing.

271
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
This Texas and we're going to come visit and we're going to all hang out with Ted.

272
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
This is fantastic.

273
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
This couldn't be better.

274
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You can do local pickup.

275
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You can save on shipping for Joe Rogan.

276
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
New tropics like the brain.

277
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I mean, I'm in Joe Rogan's podcast room right now.

278
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The bunker, the weird worker.

279
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yes.

280
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yeah.

281
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Yeah, that's good.

282
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You should get the lights.

283
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You should get lights up.

284
00:19:46,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And like he has when I see those YouTube clips where it looks like he's in, it looks like it's a fake background of like a of a bunk of like a maybe like a 90 syndicated TV show about a like a shelter, a bomb shelter.

285
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Maybe is what it looks like.

286
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I just thought he'd like he went to an abandoned fries and took the theming.

287
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yeah. You know, put it up against the wall.

288
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I wish.

289
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Hey, we won't disparage Steve Miller if you don't disparage abandoned fries.

290
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm not.

291
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Hey, the by the way, the fries in Houston is oil themed.

292
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Oh, we were supposed to.

293
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I forgot you were a little mad when we talked about fries because we didn't incorporate your your knowledge of the Texas ones.

294
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So, yeah, oil themed.

295
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Do you remember any of the main features of it?

296
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
In 20 years.

297
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
No.

298
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
No.

299
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Oh, OK.

300
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Well, maybe next episode, you could go over there and show and like we could discuss it.

301
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You'll be our like man on the ground in Texas for all the themed entertainment there.

302
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Look, I don't want to like podcast the ride you guys up, but I was the one who discovered Dinosaur World 2.

303
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Yes, Dinosaur World.

304
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yes, Dinosaur World.

305
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
The thing we're talking about today.

306
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Well, you know, let's start heading that way.

307
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Yeah, because this just this grew out of Nick, you sending us photos of this thing that you you did and you took your daughter to and we thought, well, that seems like enough being that most of the episode about it.

308
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You've got a show on a goddamn font.

309
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I think it was plenty.

310
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So did we do a show on it?

311
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Did we do an episode about a font?

312
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
We should.

313
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Yeah, we should.

314
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Which one did what we do?

315
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
But that sounds like we did do that, but I can't think of what we did.

316
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Maybe I was maybe a mandelion.

317
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But, uh, well, you know, you're going to make it happen, though.

318
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But we absolutely there's there's a couple of fonts I could think of.

319
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Yeah, we could definitely do one on fonts.

320
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I mean, we're not the real font.

321
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
We are definitely adjacent to we seem like the type of guys who would be really into fonts.

322
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'll say that.

323
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yeah, but I guess so.

324
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So, uh, so it was my kid's birthday and the year before we went, we took her to Disneyland and she had a lot of fun, even though she was only one.

325
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And we were like, hey, maybe this is like a yearly tradition.

326
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Ha ha ha ha ha.

327
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The hubris.

328
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Um, and so we wanted to do something for her birthday because.

329
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
We were just looking for something to do that was different than any other ordinary day.

330
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And then my mom was like, hey, at the Katie Mills mall, which is on the other side of town of Houston, there's this dinosaur thing.

331
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And I was like, cool, I don't even know what it is.

332
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Let's do it.

333
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So, uh, looked it up.

334
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I looked it up, bought a ticket for like 60 bucks.

335
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And they sent us a SoundCloud file and they sent us to the mall.

336
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And we drove around and looked at dinosaurs while SoundCloud file played and it was not sunk up.

337
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And it was awesome.

338
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Yeah.

339
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yeah.

340
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Like one of the best things you've done all year.

341
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I mean, yeah, maybe it was, uh, you know.

342
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Uh, look, maybe it was just doing something.

343
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Oh yeah.

344
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But, uh, cause it's, it's just, it's literally dinosaurs are in a mall parking lot and you're driving around them slowly.

345
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Oh, yes.

346
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So, okay.

347
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So I did this.

348
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I did this out here in Pasadena and we've done a few of these drive through experiences and by and large, they're fine.

349
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
They're okay.

350
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:42,000
We drove through six flags and really what I was hoping for was to crash into a roller coaster and end up in a ditch and have to be rescued from the six flags.

351
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And that didn't happen.

352
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It was just sort of, we drove through and there were some nice lights and a lot of stretches of not interesting stuff.

353
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And it was fine.

354
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It was fine.

355
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
All these things are fine.

356
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Okay.

357
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
All the Halloween thing I did was fine.

358
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Nice little thing.

359
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I went to Jurassic Quest and I go, well, it's going to be fine.

360
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Like all these other things.

361
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The difference is that magic SoundCloud file you brought up.

362
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Okay.

363
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I didn't actually realize that there was that component until I was actually there.

364
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So I drove up and it's literally in the parking lot.

365
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I can just see everything already.

366
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's not even hidden.

367
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
There's no dinosaurs hidden behind things.

368
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And I was like, oh, well, that's kind of a bummer.

369
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I was hoping, you know, you turn on the right.

370
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Were some of the employees on roller skates for you?

371
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What's that?

372
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Were some of the employees on roller skates for you?

373
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
No, that sounds better though.

374
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Okay.

375
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Wow.

376
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So I go, oh, I guess it's all right.

377
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So you just drive through.

378
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I can think I can see the whole like track already.

379
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I find the SoundCloud file and let me play with this.

380
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Jason alluded to this earlier.

381
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Jason, did you end up doing this?

382
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I did do this.

383
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yeah, I did this too.

384
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And I agree.

385
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I thought it was awesome.

386
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I, Mike, I will echo what you said that like, yeah, a lot of these drive through things are fine.

387
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And this, I think Jane told me, we looked it up like right around almost maybe even the same day, Scott, you texted that like, Nick, you had done this.

388
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And the first thing I Googled was just a roller.

389
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
The picture I got was a dinosaur statue surrounded by caution tape.

390
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And I was like, oh, well, that doesn't look very good.

391
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It doesn't look like it moves.

392
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Not the case.

393
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
They move quite a bit.

394
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I was shocked.

395
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Yes, they do move, which is fun.

396
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
What are they?

397
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Are they puppets?

398
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Are they animatronics?

399
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
They're animatronics.

400
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Yeah, they're.

401
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Yeah.

402
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And they'll be so I think it's it'll be like a tall like if it's a T-Rex or whatever, it'll be it's very tall.

403
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
But the head is on some sort of an electronic swivel or something like a little pieces of them move.

404
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's not some full crazy animatronic, but like there's enough movement to like suggest that it's a robot.

405
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
OK, so here's the robot.

406
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
That it's a robot.

407
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
OK, so here's here's when I perked up here.

408
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I'm going to play.

409
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I started playing this in the car and my theme park brain immediately was excited in a way it hadn't been in any of these drive through places.

410
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Jurassic.

411
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Fantastic.

412
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Dinosaurs.

413
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Jurassic.

414
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Jurassic.

415
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Jurassic.

416
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Jurassic.

417
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So that's a little piece of it.

418
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
They played at the end.

419
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And then what basically happens is they have a whole narrative where people narrate what they what you're seeing as far as the dinosaurs.

420
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And they also have little theme park tropes like one of the dinosaurs escaped that happens.

421
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So this is the missing component from all of these drive through experiences.

422
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It doesn't matter that basically it's like the dinosaurs are just set up in a in a line like they're waiting to go into some like they're waiting for a concert.

423
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It doesn't matter.

424
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
That doesn't matter at all.

425
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It only it matters is that there's a narrative like a theme park ride.

426
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
This is what Jurassic Quest is nailed that the other place.

427
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yes. And you get to hear all your friends show up like Dino Dustin prehistoric and Nick Safari Sarah Captain Caleb Park Ranger Marty.

428
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Yes.

429
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Wait wait wait.

430
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
What do you mean the six flags.

431
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Oh we we drove through a six flags for the holiday light.

432
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
They had a holiday lights celebration at Six Flags and we got to drive our car through the six flags.

433
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
The walkways are very wide.

434
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Yeah.

435
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
You can drive your car through a six flags.

436
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Why?

437
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Because they're like candy cane.

438
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I mean it's because there's because all of us are trying to get the saddest Christmas of our lives.

439
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
That's why Nick.

440
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Yeah. Because we can't do anything more fun than a Jurassic Quest kicks that ass.

441
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Clearly. Obviously I didn't do it.

442
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And now I'm I'm sort of regretting it.

443
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I should take the kid.

444
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Well he's kind of I don't think he would know what was going on and he'd probably fall asleep.

445
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yeah but it's also doing something.

446
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Yeah that's true.

447
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Well you got me there.

448
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
That's the underrated aspect of this is I went and did something.

449
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Yeah.

450
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
That's the main thing it has going on.

451
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
That is good.

452
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It felt good to drive to Pasadena to the Rose Bowl and do something.

453
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Yeah.

454
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Before we go too far just so you don't think this is a thing that that's in the past like dinosaurs and you can't do.

455
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
As you're hearing this I think it still is available for a couple of days in Pasadena if you're in the L.A.

456
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
area at the Pomona Fairplex in February in Orange County.

457
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Go to Pomona.

458
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Jacksonville Florida Orlando.

459
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It's like there.

460
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Oh wait maybe Jacksonville's over.

461
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
San Diego it's coming too.

462
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So if you are curious about this it might be coming to your town especially if you're in Southern California.

463
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yeah they have two touring companies.

464
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Usually this Jurassic Quest experience is a walkthrough but they managed to like seemingly pretty quickly pivot to a drive through experience.

465
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And yeah like you're saying did a good job and and that audio file is the most theme parkie of any of the drive through things.

466
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I had to give them credit too.

467
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I think I was getting very claustrophobic at a lot of those drive throughs.

468
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:37,000
They set up those like steel fence kind of guardrails sort of things and Jurassic Quest just opted to buy every surplus traffic cone in America.

469
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And that was much more preferable.

470
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And Jurassic Quest you can do during the daytime.

471
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I think if you have to drive through like snaking switchbacks at one or two miles an hour daylight is a lot more fun.

472
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Or two miles an hour daylight is much better to do at nighttime at least in my opinion.

473
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I think for ours you could only do it do it during the daytime.

474
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
They weren't.

475
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I liked how.

476
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Simple it was and also like oh man they're just making a shit ton of money like I don't know but you ours was packed.

477
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Oh yes I went at three o'clock on Wednesday and it was it was crowded.

478
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It didn't really back up though it moved at a nice pace which was good because as soon as I got into the like start of it I had a low gas low gas came on and I was like oh no.

479
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
No.

480
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Thankfully you only end up driving about like four or five miles when all is said and done so it really didn't matter.

481
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Oh man if you could have only stalled into the middle of Jurassic Quest and stop the line.

482
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I know I was thinking that as well but I'm sure they have some emergency proceed.

483
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
There was like a pullout halfway through where there were some port of parties and stuff.

484
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Dennis Nedry of Jurassic Quest.

485
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Out of gas out of gas over here.

486
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Yeah but Scott you got to go to Pomona one you know that one's gonna be badass.

487
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Yeah sure yeah Pomona is cool.

488
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I've been to the fair.

489
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Yeah well maybe I will maybe maybe now I got to make it out to out to Pomona.

490
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,000
This was a weird experience for me too because I had never in my life been to the Rose Bowl before.

491
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And during the pandemic I have been twice once to shoot a commercial on the 50 yard line and once to drive by dinosaurs.

492
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
That's right. Oh my god you're in the middle of the Rose Bowl.

493
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Yes.

494
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
What a way to experience a place.

495
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yeah.

496
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
The only way to experience it.

497
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I saw you two on that 360 tour where the black eyed peas opened for them.

498
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Oh hell yeah.

499
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So so how was it weird to leave before the main act.

500
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You know they could never be topped.

501
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Once once once I heard I'm a bee.

502
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I was out of there.

503
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I said screw this you two crap.

504
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And Fergie did all her spelling songs.

505
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Yeah.

506
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:34,000
That you know really if that tour had happened more closer to when we do the podcast that would be a good topic because they had a very themed like stage with like a magic microphone that came down from the sky.

507
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It was very much like a mic.

508
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Well it was like a circular.

509
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Monday did you do go to you two shows I forget is that too.

510
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
No that's not cool enough.

511
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
OK.

512
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:53,000
It had like it was like almost like a circle like a neon circle with a microphone in it and Bono would swing from it during the show.

513
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
He's having a themed experience.

514
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
We're like watching him go on a ride.

515
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Yeah.

516
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Yeah.

517
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And we should probably eventually do like the zoo TV tour where he's Mr.

518
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Mick whatever his name is the devil character that we've talked about before.

519
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
McPhisto Mr.

520
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
McPhisto.

521
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I can't believe you implanted that in my head.

522
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Along with the story.

523
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Mr. McPhisto Mr.

524
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
McPhisto got all of his devil friends together and gave him a briefcase of a million hell bugs.

525
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You didn't stuff you're going to be saying Scott when you're on like your death bed you're going to have dementia you're going to be in your like late 80s and you're going to be like Randy Gerber and George Clooney created tequila company and Mr.

526
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
McPhisto is Bono's alter ego.

527
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
You make a mistake inspired by Bono's.

528
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Any of that.

529
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
No didn't need any of that gimmick crap.

530
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Steve Miller.

531
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
That's no yeah.

532
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
He did.

533
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
So he didn't do like costumes or stagecraft.

534
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Wasn't popular enough.

535
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
He didn't make enough money to pay for it.

536
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Not even an abracadabra era.

537
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
He didn't like come.

538
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
They didn't all come out of a big group magician's hat.

539
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I mean they wanted to but Dennis Young took up all the like the magic hats of the time and just wouldn't like.

540
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
He cleared out all the theatrical warehouses yes to do the Kilroy was here tour.

541
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:30,000
My my dream episode if we're going to start getting in if we're including poorly conceived theatrical concert experiences then Kilroy is here is my.

542
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Tommy Shaw wouldn't put up with that shit.

543
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Yeah.

544
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
He's a rocker he's the renegade.

545
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
He doesn't want to come out and read lines.

546
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I don't want to get us derailed even more but somebody has pointed out before before that you would Nick Monday would be a great guest on a kiss meets the Phantom of the Park episode.

547
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Oh yeah good idea.

548
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
That thing sucks.

549
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
But yeah I watch it.

550
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
It's like a really good opening.

551
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It's an opening that convinces you it's going to be a good film and then a good film.

552
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
That it's not going to be horrible and then you guys do a podcast where like you talk about why.

553
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Tommy Shaw sticks is better than Dennis the youngs is or do I need to just start that podcast.

554
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Well we would have I think some difficulty there because even though I have my problems with Kuro is here Dennis the young is better in my book.

555
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Wow this is this going to be you're going to make him mad Scott.

556
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Sorry.

557
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Well but maybe that's the combative net we argue about in weekly episodes over the course of five years we argue about who's better Dennis the younger Tommy Shaw for seven listeners.

558
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Can you pivot then to what is that.

559
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
What would be J.Y.

560
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Hmm. Yeah.

561
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Oh J.Y. listens to hear if he's mentioned.

562
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Yeah.

563
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Mostly not.

564
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Van Hagar I hear what you're saying but I think it's too many people care.

565
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
We have to like corner the market of an issue that no one pays attention to.

566
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Yeah that's a debate someone's had in the last year.

567
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Yes.

568
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Like someone is in the world said like oh what do you think who you think is better.

569
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Although I guess you could go Sharon you could say well Sharon era is the best version of Van Halen.

570
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
That's probably nobody's arguing for that.

571
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I'd like to run this all Sharon arguments.

572
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
What was that Nick.

573
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Here's your own might argue.

574
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Maybe that's the best way.

575
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Probably not.

576
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
He has a high opinion of himself.

577
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Anyway Jurassic Quest.

578
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Back to Jurassic Quest.

579
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
What's the music situation to the rest of it.

580
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Is there a lot like this.

581
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:48,000
There's not other songs like that but there is just sort of like music that like you're in the jungle and like insect sound effects and there's not really any there's like some sort of like little beats to make it like a little more exciting but there's no fun songs.

582
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Other than it's the same.

583
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
They just did.

584
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
They did one song and they played it at the start in the front.

585
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
There's no like musical number in the middle with dinosaurs which would have been a very good idea.

586
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
There's narration.

587
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:09,000
They use a lot of like transitional elements and some stings and they tell you like they they account that the sinking.

588
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Yeah as Monday alluded to the sinking is not perfect.

589
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Basically they tell you when to play.

590
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
They tell you when to pause.

591
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Because like it's going to back up a little or in a couple cases we got like ahead of their narration and just kind of had to like let it play out.

592
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
But the dinosaurs are like pretty close together again.

593
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Just just like real quick like putting it together with sending everyone.

594
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Yeah YouTube link and or SoundCloud link you can use either and it's the same.

595
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It does work surprisingly well.

596
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Yeah I had to readjust a little bit because I had gotten ahead and then like look I some of the dinosaurs are a little similar to each other.

597
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:57,000
OK they seem like they had 40 dinosaurs set up and it's not like they're so some of them are so different from the other.

598
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
So I'd be like is that what is this one.

599
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Is this a.

600
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
OK and then I went back and I finally got it synced up.

601
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
But that's also because I wasn't prepared.

602
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I should have been prepared from the beginning.

603
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
But the funniest thing is when they go pause recording now.

604
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Yeah.

605
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Which is like necessary but it is funny to break up the.

606
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
So I went with my parents because they wanted to.

607
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
You know it was my kid's birthday.

608
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Yeah.

609
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
We didn't stop the pausing because my dad just wanted to get through it.

610
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And then he wanted to put on the news.

611
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
So halfway we're just just listen to the news.

612
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So by the time you get to like the big finale guys you're here.

613
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Yeah that was.

614
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
We were pulling into the first dinosaur because he started it soon as we got the ticket.

615
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
So like Rachel Maddow narrated the finale of Jurassic Quest for you.

616
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
The Dalles up today ending.

617
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Yeah I mean it was a streak.

618
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Yeah you can imagine what was happening.

619
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I don't remember anything that happened.

620
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So I'd have to go back and check the archives of what happened in the news.

621
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
It seems like nothing's really happened.

622
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:16,000
What happened was an all star armada of lawyers like Rudy and Lin Wood took the country back in the name of all patriots.

623
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I think I think that's what happened.

624
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Well I think that's what happened.

625
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Well and then soon as we finished my wife Dallara was like hey you got to tell Scott and Carlson about this.

626
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And then my dad was like why why would they care they're not children.

627
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
And you had a lot to explain.

628
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Yeah and then I explained what the show was.

629
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And that was a difficult conversation.

630
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Did you have to hold him back from wanting to drive out here and beat us up.

631
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,000
No it's like yeah you know like you know if they make money good.

632
00:39:51,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So you said there was a money component to it and then he was a little bit more like oh all right well I guess if there if there's some monetary gain from.

633
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
So they so they like do it for charity and then like no no.

634
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Nick said I'm not sure what their money deal is but I thought I'm going to propose that they start a big crowd.

635
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And then then they'll be making money.

636
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Yeah.

637
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
So they have a bunch of kids.

638
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
No one really does.

639
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Did you go to.

640
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Did you go to a Disney World Nick as a child with your family.

641
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Yeah we went three times.

642
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Could we have your dad on to interview him about those trips.

643
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Not you just me.

644
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Could we have your dad on to interview him about those trips.

645
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Not you just your dad.

646
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
See what would his memory of those trips be what he does he remember.

647
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Could we like get in depth about Pirates of the Caribbean with him.

648
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Oh no you wouldn't know what the hell that is.

649
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I did he like the ride where you go past hydroponic plants and see how see various types of seeds are grown.

650
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Yeah I think we went on a cruise one time.

651
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And he got hammered.

652
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And then I was I was five years old and I wanted a twenty dollar bill and acted like a brat.

653
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And he wanted to throw me off the boat.

654
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
That's a thrilling story.

655
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
But look I was a brat.

656
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
You were five though.

657
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I doubt he remembers.

658
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Oh no.

659
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Well the best trip was we went in high school and it was at the ESPN hotel which we've established.

660
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Which doesn't exist.

661
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
We did not establish that.

662
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
This is where it came up before.

663
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
There is there is a.

664
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Yeah we were at the ESPN hotel that we've all established.

665
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
No you were not real.

666
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Not real.

667
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
You were likely at the Boardwalk hotel which has an ESPN restaurant.

668
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:56,000
So and at the ESPN hotel there was an arcade there and we all played time crisis for most of the trip.

669
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
We spent most of the trip just playing time crisis.

670
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
So you know that's a relatable story.

671
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
If you were going to Disney in the 90s there early 2000s you were playing some time crisis in hotel arcades.

672
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
At the ESPN hotel.

673
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I just think we need a voice like your dad's once in a while because we're living in we're living in a fantasy land here where people all generally understand what we talk about when we're talking about living with the land.

674
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Or we talk about the original journey into imagination.

675
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:32,000
But it would be nice to get a real world voice once in a while to be like shut up you nerds you know so we can get like a little bit of perspective on how the world might view us.

676
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I think you'd be like.

677
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I don't know if you'd call you nerds probably just weirdos.

678
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Okay that's fine.

679
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
All right well.

680
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Call us that.

681
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Dude was it tough to tell him that you caused the podcast that all this is.

682
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
No that was fine.

683
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
He was like why didn't you do it.

684
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Like why were you on it.

685
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Yeah like well that was a dumb idea to give away.

686
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I was like yeah but I didn't give a shit about rides and he was like yeah it makes sense.

687
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Yeah you leave the podcast whenever you're on it you get up and we can't keep you here for more than an hour.

688
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Yeah I think I would not be a good host to the show.

689
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I think you have the right hosts doing it.

690
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
It's very humble of you to admit that you should be one of the regular hosts of 200 episodes.

691
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I'm sure there's other people who like like the Disney Star Wars better than you guys that would be better better hosts adapted.

692
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Let's not get into that.

693
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:29,000
We're going to the gripes in that probably wouldn't grow and grow sardonic and sarcastic and probably bring up politics less.

694
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I think those I think those hosts would probably be better but compared to me I think you guys are way better.

695
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Okay well there's obviously a spectrum and we're doing all right on the spectrum.

696
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
There's nothing but notes a lot of notes.

697
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:56,000
We were talking about your notes because you it didn't seem like you'd heard the podcast in a long time and then you listen to an episode about a ride called Horizons which if you like theme parks people love the rides people love to talk about.

698
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And then you heard the episode and told both Mike and I separately and listen to that show about that ride I know what the fuck you're talking about.

699
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Yeah I like look I'm not trying to be a jerk but what the hell was that about.

700
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Well see now we're doing a thing where we make sure that we say the basics about what the ride is.

701
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I'm calling it Monday's Law.

702
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
We're following Monday's Law and we're saying I'm not calling it that.

703
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
We're calling that's fine man.

704
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Two or three of us are calling it that so I would like I would like Scott though to explain Horizons real quick to Monday and see if you can let him understand what it was.

705
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Oh yeah well see it's a ride about different visions of the future you know back in the past people like Jules Verne had ideas of what the future might be but you know then in the 80s General Electric came along.

706
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
What was this ride on?

707
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
What's that?

708
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Like Epcot Center.

709
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:58,000
It was at Epcot Center which was really near the Boardwalk Hotel where the ESPN restaurant was not the ESPN Hotel.

710
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Now and if you're walking to Epcot from the Boardwalk Hotel you need to remember you're going to be entering in the other entrance of the International Gateway not the main entrance where you would pick up the monorail.

711
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:15,000
You use the International Gateway which takes you in a world showcase and it's actually really charming and it's like a part of the hotel experience that we all discovered that we liked.

712
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
It's just you know beautiful landscaping and manicuring around there.

713
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Yeah now you can take the Disney Skyliner and see a great view of of this entrance.

714
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
The Skyliner which isn't the Skyway.

715
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Not the Skyway.

716
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Yeah.

717
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I'm sorry COVID has changed the world.

718
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I only go through amusement parks in my car.

719
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Yes so do we.

720
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Ninosaur World is ahead of the curve.

721
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I'm not getting out of my car for anything ever again.

722
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,000
So maybe if Disney World offers a drive through if there was a drive through Horizons you would maybe do it but.

723
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Well we're talking about like if things ever get back to normal ha ha ha ha.

724
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Now that we're closer to Disney World the law has never been so we could.

725
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
You could go to Disney World but it's open.

726
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Yeah you should go.

727
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I'm not going now.

728
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Go for it.

729
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Mike you want to get out of the car to see me.

730
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Yeah.

731
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I'm scared of this thing man.

732
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:19,000
No Mike's not going but Nick you're going to go rough it up with Ted Cruz and pull off your masks and then bring Ted.

733
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
You and Ted in Animal Kingdom looking at the animals arm in arm.

734
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Come on.

735
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Are they real animals or they like Dinosaur World.

736
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
No these are real animals.

737
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:36,000
There are fake dinosaurs in Animal Kingdom on a ride called Dinosaur but there are also a lot of them.

738
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Can I sit in my Subaru?

739
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
What's that?

740
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Can I sit in my Subaru?

741
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
You could you just wouldn't see very much.

742
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Yeah.

743
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
You'd see other cars.

744
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
That's why like.

745
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I mean Jurassic Park has got it all figured out.

746
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It's like they take they take mall parking lots which were way full.

747
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
You guys didn't say the right name of this the entire time.

748
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Yeah but I loved it.

749
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Jurassic Quest.

750
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I'm going to make my own because the dinosaurs weren't even that great.

751
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
But like you if you just steal some.

752
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I'm not going to disagree with that.

753
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I thought they were pretty good.

754
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
They were pretty good.

755
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
It was 50.

756
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
That's the going rate for all of these drive through things.

757
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
It's pretty much what they cost.

758
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Yeah.

759
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And this 50 bucks for Christmas lights.

760
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Yeah we did.

761
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Yeah.

762
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Well it was twenty five dollars a person to drive through six flags and when we know why.

763
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I brought it.

764
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
So I paid fifty dollars.

765
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Yes.

766
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
For to see Christmas lights in a closed theme park.

767
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
It was mostly dark.

768
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Yeah.

769
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
What did you ask us Nick?

770
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Why didn't he hide in another blanket.

771
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Yeah.

772
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
What did you ask us Nick?

773
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Why didn't he hide in another blanket when he went through so you'd only have to pay 25 bucks.

774
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Well because we're good boys.

775
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
We're good boys.

776
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
We follow rules like our parents told us to.

777
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Why didn't he pay in boy coin?

778
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
It didn't exist at the time.

779
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
This was 2020.

780
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
We just had the idea.

781
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
We had the mock up.

782
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
We had a sketch of one but they didn't take it foolishly.

783
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Did you guys go in three cars or all together?

784
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
We did not go all together.

785
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
We did not go all together.

786
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
We're quarantined.

787
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
We're quarantined.

788
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
It's a pandemic.

789
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
What are you talking about?

790
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Well there's a carbon footprint to think about too.

791
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
We can't like forget about that.

792
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Oh that's out the window in California.

793
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Oh the reusable cups, the plastic, everything's back.

794
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
No more reusable cups.

795
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
You know.

796
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
What are you guys using straws again?

797
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
We're using straws.

798
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Yeah.

799
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I use ten straws a day now.

800
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
You could barely drive through Jurassic Quest here because there were so many straws strewn all over the ground.

801
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
The dinosaurs are tripping.

802
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Yeah it's a wasteland over here.

803
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
You got out just in time before this thing.

804
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
We're about to sink into the ocean.

805
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
It's real bad news here.

806
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I will say some facts I learned that the velociraptor is a little furry and he's not as big as you think.

807
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
We drove by some things.

808
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Oh yeah that was a big thing.

809
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Yes.

810
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Because we all think of, when we think of Raptor, we think of of course the character Blue from Jurassic World.

811
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
That's what we think of.

812
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
We all know the movie.

813
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
We can name all the main characters.

814
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:17,000
But our favorite character is Blue the Raptor that is trained by Owen Dennis, the main character of Jurassic World.

815
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Wait.

816
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
No.

817
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Claire Dennis.

818
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Owen Grady.

819
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Owen Grady.

820
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
You're right.

821
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I mixed up the two characters.

822
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I'll edit this out so people won't.

823
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Oh they won't even know my mistake.

824
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000
What was the name of the guy who owned the mansion that they did the horror movie in for the last one?

825
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Hmm.

826
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
That actually happened right?

827
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
That just wasn't like bullshit I made up in my mind.

828
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Yes that's right.

829
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
John Hammond's former business partner.

830
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Yes.

831
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Yeah.

832
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I don't know his name but we're talking about Blue here.

833
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
We're trying to talk about Blue.

834
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:58,000
So we drove by and honestly the Raptors are the size of maybe like a mid-sized dog.

835
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Like maybe a bigger dog.

836
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Maybe like even not.

837
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:07,000
But like a St. Bernard felt like it was bigger than these Raptors and I was shocked to learn this that we've been lied to.

838
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:14,000
And they make like little snide remarks about Jurassic Park and sort of the popular theory about dinosaurs.

839
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I'm like no they're not as big as you think they are.

840
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And like the Diloposaurus who in Jurassic Park they show shoots acid.

841
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
They don't do that.

842
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
That is a made up thing.

843
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Oh but they did have the Jurassic Park 3 dinosaur bad guy.

844
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Wait what with the big fin?

845
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
The Spinosaurus?

846
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
There is a Spinosaurus in this drive-thru.

847
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
The Spinosaurus.

848
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Oh yeah totally.

849
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
They had the Jurassic 3.

850
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Yeah that's what I was like.

851
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Oh shit it's the Jurassic 3 bad guy dinosaur.

852
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Yeah so they throw shade at Jurassic Park the whole time because Jurassic Park lied to us about a number of things.

853
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Yeah.

854
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I was surprised.

855
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I knew some I knew it was a bit of a fantasy film.

856
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Do you think Dinosaur World is BD Wong's revenge against Jurassic World?

857
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Did you just are you when you say Dinosaur World you're talking about this drive-thru thing that's Jurassic Quest?

858
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Yeah.

859
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:17,000
In Canon you're saying BD Wong's character has created a parking lot dinosaur drive-thru to correct the record on dinosaurs.

860
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
He is getting progressively more evil as those movies go on.

861
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
He was an evil before.

862
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
What's his character's name?

863
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
BD Wong.

864
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Yes that's right Dr. BD Wong.

865
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I cannot remember but yeah he's pretty villainous in the haunted house one the last one which I liked I liked Fallen Kingdom.

866
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Yeah so I do think and I'm I'm I'm being serious so you do learn something because we've had our brains warped by this prop this fantasy propaganda for too long these Jurassic Park.

867
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Dinosaur misinformation.

868
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Yeah.

869
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
The Jurassic house was kick-ass.

870
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Yeah.

871
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I agree.

872
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
So.

873
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:11,000
A lot of these guys had feathers a lot of the animatronic dinosaurs had feathers and a lot of them looked like little turds like this wormy little guy this Anzu.

874
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:19,000
This is one of the last dinosaurs you see at the experience and he looks like like an ostrich that got in a fight or an emu.

875
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
There's a pronunciation guide and you still you said it wrong still.

876
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Is it Anzu?

877
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Yeah.

878
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Okay.

879
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Right there.

880
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Anzu.

881
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Hey you didn't go shut up Scott.

882
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Yeah.

883
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
But I can read a sign.

884
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
It was tiny the print was tiny from that photo.

885
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:57,000
There are a lot like it felt like we've all been to museums and field trips before and sometimes you'd go to one of those like I'm trying to think we went to something called the JFK health world when I was little in the Schomburgish area and it was very much a more themed type like museum learning experience

886
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
which I like there was a slide in it.

887
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:16,000
This felt like one of like a better version of a boring thing you would do as a kid because you would learn something I do think as a kid I would have been from age let's say two to 16 afraid of these dinosaurs a little bit.

888
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Maybe not 16 maybe like 13.

889
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
My two year old was laughing at them.

890
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
That's good.

891
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Look, you've you've probably raising your child to be a lot tougher than I was.

892
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I was raised to be afraid of the world.

893
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
This is what I was taught.

894
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
This is still what I'm being taught by my mother.

895
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:48,000
But I think that as a kid I would have been a little freaked but I would have learned something which is good for kids and I think doing it at night would be cooler as well because I think especially you're a little kid you're in the back seat.

896
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
You're kind of peering out to see what's next.

897
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I think there would have been a little more like realism.

898
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
But then you're going to see the Costco cones.

899
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
You're not going to see them and you're going to bump right into them.

900
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Well, that's what that's up to dad.

901
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Dad has to do a good job than driving to not bump into the cones.

902
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:13,000
You know, you're it's interesting because you can really sort of think of this like you're the guy driving the boat on the jungle cruise.

903
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:27,000
You know, like you're kind of there's a there's a narrator also going in the car with a SoundCloud file, but you could probably then start throwing in your own jokes and then you could even add a little bit of excitement with the car.

904
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Like you could speed up real fast, pretend you're going to hit the car in front of you.

905
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Like you can then control the experience for your kid in a way.

906
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
So I think that I'm recommending to people if they do this with their children, have fun with it.

907
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Don't put yourself in danger, but you could really like live out your sort of your fantasy of working at a Disney park.

908
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
You're right.

909
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
We did something similar of trying to figure out how you would steal one.

910
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Hmm.

911
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I think I'd be happy.

912
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
You guys think about that too.

913
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I did.

914
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Okay. Yeah, I actually did.

915
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And Jane, I think I was going through, uh, because God bless her.

916
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
All these drive through things.

917
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I am the one white knuckling it like, okay, don't hit the don't hit the cones.

918
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Don't hit the thing.

919
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And so Jane is taking pictures, but she did get a short video of me going like that.

920
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I think that one will fit in the trunk because there are some real like goofy looking.

921
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I could see kids laughing at it because there's some real goofy looking little dirty dinosaurs.

922
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Some of them have very silly claws.

923
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Were you you just you kind of breezed by it.

924
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
You said the phrase white knuckling.

925
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Were you afraid while you were driving through this?

926
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Well, I was a little concerned about running out of gas.

927
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
But that's right.

928
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I my car tells me like you have 30 you've got like 30 miles left or so.

929
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
So I think it only got down to like 25 miles left.

930
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
So you're saying it was more gas based and not you were afraid of the parking lot terrain.

931
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Well, probably gas.

932
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
But also like that many.

933
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
It's a little claustrophobic.

934
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
All of these things like that many cars crammed into these little spaces.

935
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I don't think that's an unreasonable thing to throw out.

936
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
It is the phrase white knuckling applied to a speed of two miles per hour.

937
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
That's true.

938
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Yes.

939
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
But I don't want to suck it dry.

940
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I don't want to run out of gas or tap a car, you know, or tap a dinosaur.

941
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
That's the other.

942
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Oh, man.

943
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Some of the tails wag and the cars in front of me were getting real close to those wagging tails.

944
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I yes, I did.

945
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I was like, OK, I think I could drive the car and I think I could get it so the tail could crack the windshield a little bit.

946
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Maybe. Yeah.

947
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
We wanted it to.

948
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:48,000
You wanted to get the car to get broken by a dinosaur in a fantasy world, of course, the logistics of going to fix it.

949
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Maybe not worth a Patreon episode of podcast the ride.

950
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,000
But in my fantasy world, it would be funny if a robot dinosaur cracked my windshield.

951
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Yes, I was driving a.

952
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Bordor F-150 four by four.

953
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
So we were bigger than the dinosaurs.

954
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
You were like a couple.

955
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Yeah.

956
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
You were taller like you were probably like eye to eye with the T-Rex.

957
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Yep.

958
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I balled it.

959
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Wow.

960
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
The T-Rex probably like kind of look away.

961
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
It was so afraid of your car.

962
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Scott, how have you not done this, man?

963
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I don't know.

964
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Yeah, it is because I.

965
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I do think I could go by myself, but that feels weird.

966
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I do not leave your child and and wife home.

967
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Yeah.

968
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
You're going to dinosaur house.

969
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I just he would fall asleep.

970
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I don't know if they charge for somebody under one year old, but he would like a car.

971
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
It's by car.

972
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Yeah.

973
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
So you're OK.

974
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Oh, OK.

975
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Because Six Flags was per person, which was kind of a posters in my book.

976
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Yeah.

977
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
So all right.

978
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
So that's better.

979
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
That's why like a fifty dollars if you got the you pack the car, it sounds like that's

980
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
a pretty like it sounds like it's like ten dollars per person.

981
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
That's not crazy.

982
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Yeah.

983
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
How close do these these kids can say characters?

984
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
It's a weird way to describe dinosaur.

985
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Go close to these characters.

986
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Get to you.

987
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:19,000
These loud characters like what that because with the way a car seat has to be like, what

988
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
do I I'm like, what do you even see it?

989
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I'm not sure.

990
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
We you pick him up.

991
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
OK.

992
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Yeah.

993
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Because you're going slow.

994
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
You're not.

995
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

996
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I could take him out.

997
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
That's right.

998
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
He's not a lot of kids poking out of like sunroofs when I was doing it.

999
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Oh, OK.

1000
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
OK.

1001
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Which is probably my baby out of the sunroom.

1002
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:44,000
You don't want to stick the baby out of the sunroom like Rafiki, the baby.

1003
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,000
And homage to Michael Jackson in the hotel room and to past guests, Candice LeRae and

1004
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Johnny Garganos plan.

1005
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Oh, they were going to.

1006
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Oh, that's right.

1007
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Weren't they going to declare that the child didn't make it?

1008
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
That they were going to declare that Candice dead.

1009
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I was dead as well.

1010
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Oh, that the birth killed both mother and child and then reveal triumphantly Rafiki style

1011
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
that that a real monkey was holding the baby, I believe was the point.

1012
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
It did involve an ape.

1013
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Yes.

1014
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
This was a strange.

1015
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:22,000
We got to check in on that plan sometime this year and see how that's going.

1016
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
They did turn heels.

1017
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
They've been they've been doing great work as heels on NXT.

1018
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
So maybe we know a photo was pulled up and we ignored it.

1019
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Yeah, sorry.

1020
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Doing it.

1021
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Oh, shit.

1022
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Because I knew it was you because it was geotagged to Katie Mills.

1023
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And I have a lot of questions about Katie Mills.

1024
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
But we'll talk about dinosaurs.

1025
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Pick their ass in football.

1026
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Katie Mills was a school.

1027
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Katie was Katie.

1028
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
OK, that's a that's a town.

1029
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
That's a suburb.

1030
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Mm hmm.

1031
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Yeah, their football stadium had turf, which sucked.

1032
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Yeah, but this has turf and it's cool.

1033
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Yeah, turf under the dino.

1034
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
That's really that's really cool.

1035
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Scott, would you have as a kid have been afraid of something like that?

1036
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Say you were seven or eight.

1037
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I know we've talked about you have a fear of big things in small places.

1038
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
This is obviously outdoors, but still it's pretty big.

1039
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
It is. You're correct.

1040
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
It is the the outdoor issue would make it OK.

1041
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I don't like when there is a big thing in an enclosed space.

1042
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
There is this issue.

1043
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,000
If this was in a mills mall, I think it might have a bother me more.

1044
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,000
But they aren't that big, as you said, because if they're going by, how big the real.

1045
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Well, what was the biggest dinosaur you feel like?

1046
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
It was a fish dinosaur.

1047
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Oh, the Megalodon.

1048
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
That was awesome.

1049
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
They had a Megalodon, the Meg, the Meg.

1050
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Oh, Meg.

1051
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
The Meg.

1052
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Yes, Meg.

1053
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
And they were moved.

1054
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
It was like it was doing swimming most.

1055
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
It was waggling around, but it was like huge.

1056
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Yeah, it was big.

1057
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
It wasn't.

1058
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
It wasn't that wasn't the tallest one.

1059
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I think that T-Rex or the T-Rex was probably the tallest one.

1060
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:03,000
OK, but I mean, the T-Rex felt like it was 20 feet tall, maybe 25.

1061
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
It's bigger than some of the photos would suggest.

1062
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,000
So, geez, I would have definitely been freaked as a kid.

1063
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Jason, would you have been freaked as a kid?

1064
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Well, in most circumstances, yes, but I was a real dinosaur kid.

1065
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I had a lot of dinosaur toys.

1066
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I loved to go into the Philadelphia Natural History Museum and the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.

1067
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
What was your favorite dinosaur as a child?

1068
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Oh, I liked, you know, they we've learned so much since then.

1069
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
So I don't remember.

1070
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I don't know what it's called now.

1071
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I don't remember what it was called then.

1072
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:50,000
But the one with the tail that they all have tails, the tail that has like a big bony like water thing.

1073
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,000
No, not the same as the one who had like spikes coming out of the side.

1074
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Oh, yeah, there was a dino rider with one of those.

1075
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Yeah.

1076
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:05,000
And then the tail had a big bone, like almost bone growth, bone ball at the back.

1077
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Have you guys done a dino riders episode?

1078
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
We haven't.

1079
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I was going to say, who's everybody's favorite dino rider as a kid?

1080
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Did you like this is like the the the Dennis DeYoung Tommy Shaw debate.

1081
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Are you a valorian or are you a Rulon?

1082
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Wait, no, I think the Laureans are maybe dinosaurs and Rulons are aliens.

1083
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
OK, yeah, they're a race of aliens.

1084
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I dino riders is a cartoon.

1085
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I don't remember dino riders.

1086
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I never watched it.

1087
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Can anyone name a dino rider?

1088
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I just looked it up.

1089
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
So I've already.

1090
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
What was that Nick?

1091
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Dinosaur.

1092
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Hmm.

1093
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
I'm not seeing that in the list.

1094
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
It's not on the list.

1095
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Tykeane.

1096
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Hector.

1097
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I was more of a Silver Hawk guy.

1098
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Who's your favorite?

1099
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I like the guy with the guitar.

1100
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Yeah.

1101
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
What's this?

1102
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
What were you?

1103
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Do you ever watch Cowboys of Mumaesa?

1104
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
That I watched.

1105
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Yeah.

1106
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
OK, maybe that was after you.

1107
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Who's everybody's favorite street shark?

1108
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Street sharks.

1109
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Yeah, it was.

1110
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Yeah.

1111
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Well, who?

1112
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Yeah.

1113
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Big Slammoo, obviously.

1114
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Big Slammoo is easily the best street shark.

1115
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
There's no question.

1116
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Was he the one who roller bladed?

1117
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Sure.

1118
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

1119
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I like the one who had roller blades.

1120
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Or did they all roller blade?

1121
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I thought that was the whole thing is they were roller blading sharks with pants.

1122
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Who is everyone's favorite dinosaur on the show dinosaurs?

1123
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Well, come on.

1124
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
It's streaming soon on Disney Plus if not already.

1125
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Why, well, come on.

1126
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Was there an obvious answer?

1127
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Isn't it Baby Sinclair?

1128
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
It has to be Baby Sinclair.

1129
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
No, it doesn't have to be.

1130
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
What do you mean?

1131
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
It could be the boss.

1132
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
It could be the mean Triceratops boss.

1133
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
It's not going to be the boss.

1134
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I think it is the boss.

1135
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
You think it's the boss?

1136
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Or Robbie, who got addicted to steroids or something.

1137
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I like Robbie.

1138
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
That was pretty cool.

1139
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
But I'm a Baby Sinclair man.

1140
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
The mob was hot.

1141
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
You were attracted to the mom dinosaur?

1142
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Sure, we all were.

1143
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
With Jessica Walter's voice?

1144
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1145
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I'm not afraid of my sexuality, guys.

1146
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Dinosaur woman.

1147
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
That's fair.

1148
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Attraction.

1149
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Who's the most attractive dinosaur in Jurassic Quest?

1150
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
That's a good question.

1151
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Yeah, that's a really good question.

1152
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I don't know.

1153
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I think some of the aquatic ones.

1154
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
You're more of a Troy McClure type.

1155
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Yes.

1156
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I'm going to the Aquaria.

1157
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I like the idea.

1158
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I will say the first thing that came to my mind is the Meg, honestly, when you said that

1159
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
question.

1160
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Can you name?

1161
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Yeah, maybe that's really all it was.

1162
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
There was no dinosaur in a blonde wig.

1163
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
If they had one of those, perhaps I would have said, oh, that one.

1164
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I think it's the Meg.

1165
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Maybe they do a fun thing at night and they dress some of the dinosaurs up.

1166
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
That's a plus, though.

1167
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I don't think they can do it at night because the employees have to roller skate.

1168
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Oh, here's the Ankylosaurus.

1169
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Ankylosaur.

1170
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,000
That was the one I liked as a kid because he had a lot going on.

1171
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
And that is real.

1172
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
What do you call that thing at the end?

1173
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
A club?

1174
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Yeah, it's kind of like a club.

1175
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Yeah, it's like a club.

1176
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
It's kind of like a ball.

1177
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
It's like a trying to think what you call like what do you call the ball the prisoner has

1178
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,000
around its ankle, their ankle, a ball ball and change that it is there?

1179
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
There's not a fancy name for that.

1180
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I mean, as a weapon, it's like a maze.

1181
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
It's a maze.

1182
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Right.

1183
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Yeah.

1184
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Are we sure that dinosaur existed?

1185
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Because like a lot of like dinosaur discoveries was bullshit.

1186
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Maybe it was just like a regular dinosaur with a little bit of a little bit of a little

1187
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,000
shit. Maybe it was just like a regular dinosaur with like a rock attached to its tail.

1188
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Like an unrelated rock just happened to be buried next to the one that they found.

1189
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Maybe.

1190
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
So dinosaurs actually exist.

1191
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
You think maybe are you a truther?

1192
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Do you think that they there were no dinosaurs?

1193
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Look, dinosaurs existed, but on a flat earth.

1194
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
By the ice walls.

1195
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Yeah.

1196
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I think my favorite as a kid, my favorite dinosaur here I'll show you right now was this one.

1197
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Oh, you pulled up a picture of Riff from Barney, the like clearly inferior fourth rejected fourth

1198
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
character, the Pucci of the Barney gang.

1199
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Do you Nick, do you know about Riff Barney's nephew?

1200
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
What is he?

1201
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
No, my kid doesn't watch this crap.

1202
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
That's right.

1203
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Well, I think your kids should see Riff.

1204
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Riff plays the saxophone and loves jazz music.

1205
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
He's orange and he has like a smoker's voice.

1206
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
So does Bill Clinton and look where that got us.

1207
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Riff was not on the Epstein Island though.

1208
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
So Riff is clean.

1209
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Not on the logs.

1210
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Yeah, Riff is not on the flight logs.

1211
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Here's one thing we haven't mentioned so far.

1212
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,000
This drive through themed attraction has a drive through gift shop at the end.

1213
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Yes.

1214
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Did anyone get possible?

1215
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
More theme park.

1216
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,000
This is why I said this feels the most like a theme park thing I've done since quarantine started

1217
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,000
because they have all of the trappings of a theme park experience, including the gift shop,

1218
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,000
which is also drive through, which I did not get anything, but I love the idea that I could get

1219
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
merchandise from the ride from this.

1220
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Did you get the drive through photo?

1221
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Did everyone get the drive through photo after the drive through gift shop?

1222
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Oh, we didn't have that.

1223
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Oh, I did get it.

1224
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
And I'm remembering now that I left the QR code in the car and I forgot to bring it up.

1225
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
So I'll find my car.

1226
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I looked like shit that day.

1227
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I mean, I've looked like shit the whole pandemic, but I looked especially bad that day.

1228
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,000
And just the man taking a picture of me disheveled in my car.

1229
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Were you by yourself?

1230
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
I was by myself. Yes.

1231
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Oh shit.

1232
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
They probably called someone.

1233
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Yeah, no, I was on a cross country police chase post.

1234
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,000
They're like, what is that man older man doing alone in the Jurassic quest?

1235
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
I probably podcast.

1236
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Yeah.

1237
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Well, that's finally when that I was it was like sort of the fugitive situation where I was in the tunnel

1238
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
and there was like police with guns pointed at me and I was like, I have a podcast.

1239
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
And they went, oh, OK.

1240
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
And they put the guns down.

1241
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:52,000
When you guys review podcasts, you were like the hat, like the Derby that says press on it.

1242
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,000
No, Jason should Jason thought about it.

1243
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I have a reporter.

1244
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
So yeah, here's to do that.

1245
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Here's our picture.

1246
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
The dog came along.

1247
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I am in the pitch black.

1248
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I don't like there's no the sun is setting.

1249
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
So it looks like I am just in the shadows.

1250
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:16,000
My dog has been awakened is still like half asleep.

1251
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
I had a bunch of boxes in the back seat of my car.

1252
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,000
My photo is still on those boxes in your car.

1253
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
They're different boxes.

1254
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Dude, it's been a year.

1255
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
It's different boxes.

1256
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I cleaned all the boxes you saw out and then there's new boxes in there now.

1257
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
There's new.

1258
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I don't believe you.

1259
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
You could car. You could date the boxes.

1260
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
I swear I can prove it.

1261
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Hey, podcast, the ride, Patreon, Boykoin fans.

1262
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
If you think those boxes are old boxes, say yes on the pole.

1263
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Put a poll up.

1264
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Give Nick a hell yeah.

1265
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Has Mike changed the boxes in his car during the pandemic?

1266
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I swear they're newer boxes.

1267
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I thought it makes it better.

1268
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
In addition to the old boxes.

1269
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Yeah. Oh, you think I just put new boxes on the old boxes?

1270
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Absolutely.

1271
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Larger box mess in the car. It's possible.

1272
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
You take the boxes out.

1273
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,000
There. Well, it's a whole it's another podcast explained to you.

1274
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
There's a story with the boxes.

1275
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Get the boxes.

1276
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
There should be no boxes in the car.

1277
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I got boxes in the car too.

1278
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
And I got to get them out.

1279
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
You got your boxes out.

1280
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
You know why I found out?

1281
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Because I didn't want to.

1282
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I've been like taking a break from going in stores if I don't really, really have to.

1283
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:41,000
But I found there's this charity called Give Back Box where you can put like stuff you're going to send to Goodwill in a box and they'll just send you a UPS code and it just drop.

1284
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
They just pick it up.

1285
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Send that to me because now Nick Nick is going to feel really bad because one of the boxes had stuff for charity.

1286
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
So that's even worse.

1287
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
You've been just holding it hostage.

1288
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,000
You're making fun of me for being charitable, which is just deplorable.

1289
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:05,000
You know, I had stuff there ready to go and now look, I've been made a laughing stock for giving things away.

1290
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
You could give all those things behind you away.

1291
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
No, toys.

1292
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:15,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, noshot.

1293
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
No needy children might enjoy your toys, Mike.

1294
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
The Triceratons soldiers?

1295
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
No.

1296
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
What are they from?

1297
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
We haven't even discussed these dinosaurs this whole time.

1298
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
So these are characters from the Ninja Turtles.

1299
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
These are the Triceratons.

1300
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
This is General.

1301
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Well, this is an infantryman.

1302
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
This is General.

1303
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
There's Xerix.

1304
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
And the other character's name is Xorx.

1305
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Okay.

1306
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
And which one of them is the most attractive?

1307
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Well, it depends what color you like.

1308
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Because they're all different colors.

1309
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Oh, so it depends on what color they are.

1310
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Okay.

1311
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Hey, don't do that.

1312
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Oh, Mike.

1313
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
You stepped in it again.

1314
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
You're up against the ropes.

1315
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Mike lost his podcast.

1316
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:04,000
One more blow and Mundy's going to run away with this whole thing.

1317
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
What have we missed?

1318
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Anything Nick wants to say about that?

1319
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
They did not have a concession stand.

1320
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Okay, you didn't have that, but you did have roller skating,

1321
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:21,000
which is a pretty big plus up and should be instituted nationwide at Jurassic Quests.

1322
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
And anything.

1323
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
All things.

1324
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I looked up the parent company.

1325
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
So Jurassic West is founded in about 2013.

1326
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
They have two traveling shows.

1327
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:38,000
One was doing more Southeast and one's been doing the West Coast.

1328
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:44,000
At some point, they got bought by a group called L2 Capital Partners out of Devon, Pennsylvania,

1329
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
just down the road from King of Prussian Ball.

1330
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:53,000
L2 Capital Partners as one of the most interesting of parent companies,

1331
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,000
one of the most interesting combination of ownerships I have ever seen.

1332
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,000
In addition to Jurassic Quest, they own a company that makes traffic rumble strips,

1333
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:08,000
a company that does snow removal and landscaping,

1334
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
something, a company that deals with, quote, spray applied environmental coatings

1335
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:19,000
that solve some of the world's most complex soil stabilization issues,

1336
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,000
a rug retailer and an outdoor camping equipment company.

1337
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
And then they also own Jurassic Quest.

1338
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
That spray thing is a front. That's too complicated.

1339
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
They make arms. They sell arms to our enemies abroad.

1340
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I was waiting for something sinister and there is a staffing company they own,

1341
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
but it seems pretty benign.

1342
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I didn't really come across anything too sinister with L2 Capital Partners. Shocking.

1343
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I like L2 Capital Partners is up there with King Features Syndicate, I will say, as far as

1344
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
dullest names you could ever imagine.

1345
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Nick thoughts about L2 Capital Partners.

1346
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Nick is crocheting. Nick has resorted to crocheting.

1347
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
He's just getting... He's going to leave. He's... Oh, God. OK.

1348
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
We're at this point in the Monday episodes yet again.

1349
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Any other highlights we haven't mentioned that you'd like to cover about your trip to...

1350
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
You know what? This is what I'd say about...

1351
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Can you name the place? Can you name it?

1352
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Dinosaur... Place.

1353
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Sure. Close enough. OK.

1354
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Look, especially if you have kids or are a kid...

1355
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Actually, you have a lot of families listen to the...

1356
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
We're holding toys from needy kids.

1357
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Yeah.

1358
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Do you have a lot of families listen to the show?

1359
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
We do have a couple. Maybe.

1360
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Yeah. We've met like parent and child combinations.

1361
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
It was like, we like to listen to your show and talk about it.

1362
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Look, if you have kids or you know kids and you can do it safely, why don't you go down to Pomona

1363
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:56,000
or your equivalent Pomona and go check out the dinosaurs.

1364
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
You're cutting an ad for them right now.

1365
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
It kills an hour.

1366
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
And it killed an hour and a half on Podcast The Ride.

1367
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Podcast The Ride. If I could kill slightly more time, you got to tell me what's going on at Katie Mills.

1368
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
I have to know what... If the mall was open, what could I be doing?

1369
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
It probably is open. It might be open.

1370
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,000
You could... Oh, there's an In-N-Out near there now.

1371
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Whoa. OK.

1372
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,000
That's not that different. Yeah, there's an Ikea.

1373
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Oh, yeah.

1374
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I don't know much about Katie, except we kicked their ass in football.

1375
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Good for you. Did you physically harm any people from there?

1376
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,000
No, I got... I mean, I got my face smashed into like the turf.

1377
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Oh, and the turf hurt... Oh, OK. So turf hurts more than grass.

1378
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Yeah, because it was just like some... It was like fake grass over cement.

1379
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Oof. Wow.

1380
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
It was like good turf. It was 1997 turf.

1381
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Did you ever get into a brawl with any kids at a shopping mall?

1382
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
No. Like in Karate Kid?

1383
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Yeah. I mean, yeah. Similar to that.

1384
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
No.

1385
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
The parking lot of a shopping mall?

1386
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Nope. I've never been in a brawl.

1387
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Not a brawl?

1388
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,000
You've just like bothered other kids, but maybe not a full-on brawl.

1389
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
What do you mean, I bothered other kids?

1390
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
You like hassled. Yeah, there you go.

1391
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
You hurt the water slide. You were up on the top.

1392
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Oh, that was just like... That was just tomfoolery.

1393
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Did you ever commit tomfoolery at a mall?

1394
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
No. Or a parking lot?

1395
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
No.

1396
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Did you ever like, I don't know, like grab the pennies out of a fountain and whip them at kids in a mall?

1397
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
No, I didn't do that stuff. No.

1398
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Oh, okay.

1399
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I rolled basketballs. I'm just looking for a story here.

1400
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
No, I didn't like...

1401
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I wasn't like a kid named Buzz just like, you know, picking on nerds.

1402
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Well, you were saving nerds.

1403
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
This is what we assume about you because you're...

1404
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,000
No, I rolled basketballs in the Six Flags. I mean, come on, that's different.

1405
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:15,000
That to us, to the good boys that are us, that is akin to just walking up to a group of a dozen kids in a mall and drowning them all in a fountain.

1406
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
That's how that reads to us, because we're good.

1407
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
We wouldn't do something like that.

1408
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Yeah, well, your boy coin's not doing good right now.

1409
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
What is it down?

1410
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Checking this. Oh, no, it's down.

1411
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
By how many boy points?

1412
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Oh, man.

1413
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Elon's out on the boys. He wants nothing to do with it.

1414
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Oh, man.

1415
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Now his employees aren't getting healthcare or boy coins.

1416
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Oh, my God. We're ruining the world. Boy coin is toxic.

1417
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:53,000
We'll cancel the program, and I guess we'll end this program unless anything else anybody wants to get in.

1418
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Would you everyone encourage people to go to Dinosaur's place?

1419
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Yes, absolutely. Yeah, definitely do it.

1420
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:14,000
If you can do it at night, try to make sure you have the YouTube geared up or the SoundCloud downloaded before you go and really try to time it well so you won't be struggling with it while you're driving.

1421
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Or you can do what we did and just listen to it on the way and you get it knocked out and then you can just focus on whatever else you want to listen to.

1422
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Well, here's what I would say. If you really want to do it, listen to it a couple times to study up on it beforehand.

1423
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
No. Yes, I would agree with that.

1424
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:39,000
And listen to it after I listened to about half of it after I did it when I was making notes for the show and caught stuff I didn't catch before.

1425
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
I did not do any of that.

1426
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:47,000
They're still finding new dinosaurs. They're still finding it's fun and they're discovering different stuff about the dinosaurs they did know about.

1427
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,000
And yeah, they they do a pretty good job with this.

1428
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:58,000
You know, I've heard of SoundCloud rappers, but I guess with this thing you have SoundCloud Raptors.

1429
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Anyway, continue. That's just good clean fun.

1430
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
And I think everyone can agree on that.

1431
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
If kids are listening, that's fine for you.

1432
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
You guys can take this as the podcast, the ride guarantee.

1433
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
It's better than the Star Wars land.

1434
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Wait, I don't think you I don't think we dislike the Star Wars.

1435
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
No, we like the Star Wars Star Wars.

1436
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Yeah. And this is better than that.

1437
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:27,000
It's oh, you're still you're saying, OK, because you've been to Star Wars land.

1438
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Yeah, once.

1439
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:34,000
And when you like you like dinosaur place better than Star Wars land.

1440
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Yeah, we all did.

1441
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I think you're operating on different expectations when you approach either of them.

1442
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,000
So I don't know that you would put them on the same level.

1443
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,000
I don't know. He's going to Monday is going to put them on the same level.

1444
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,000
There was a there was somebody in a dinosaur suit I wanted to mention as well that walked around.

1445
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:59,000
It's one of those. It's not maybe as good as the blue suit at Universal, but it's pretty good.

1446
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:05,000
And then the dinosaur walked up to my car, peered in, was disgusted that I was a man alone.

1447
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:11,000
And then he walked to the next car, which was that was a nice little bit that I didn't get that at mine.

1448
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Yeah, I get that in mind either.

1449
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,000
And then when I turned around, I turned a corner.

1450
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:22,000
The person had gotten out of the suit and the suit was just hanging on a rack.

1451
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
As if somebody had killed it and taken its skin.

1452
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
It was a dino hide.

1453
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
They should give you the opportunity to hunt them.

1454
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,000
If you're in your early 20s or teenager, I recommend working at this place.

1455
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
It seemed like a lot of fun. That would be good.

1456
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Yeah, that is a good piece of advice for sure.

1457
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:48,000
If there's the one see a teen, if Valencia teens are out of work now because Magic Mountain is closed, go and work at a Jurassic quest.

1458
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
So, yeah, I recommend it.

1459
01:20:50,000 --> 01:21:01,000
It seems like if your kid is like five to like eleven, maybe four to eleven, that seems like maybe the optimum time for the kids out of it.

1460
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I mean, I did it myself, but you just do. Yeah, there you go.

1461
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Yeah, Nick's got to pull his daughter back in because she liked it.

1462
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Right. What's your love to review that really matters?

1463
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
And it was her birthday. She did a good. You know what?

1464
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Here's the earnest thing. She's now obsessed with dinosaurs.

1465
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,000
She has dinosaurs. She goes, she like loves playing with dinosaurs.

1466
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Well, then that's I take that back. It's like two to eleven.

1467
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Yeah, just don't be Mike by himself complaining about the Disney Star Wars movies as well.

1468
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,000
I'm not like Mitchell. That's not like my whole identity.

1469
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Yeah, I think. Are you thinking of a different comedy podcast?

1470
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
No, I'm comedy podcasting.

1471
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Mike is talking about Star Wars at a Buffalo Wild Wings is.

1472
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Wait, is a Buffalo Wild Wings open for indoor dining right now in Texas?

1473
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Got to be right. Five minutes down the street.

1474
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
She five minutes paradise.

1475
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Well, guys, podcast the ride is moving.

1476
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Well, let's get to know we're going to just like Rogan.

1477
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:07,000
We're moving to Texas. We're going to and we'll be pulling up a booth at the Buffalo Wild Wings.

1478
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
We're inviting Ted Cruz. I bet he's got some fun Star Wars thoughts.

1479
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
I bet he does some fun Star Wars impressions. Oh, wow.

1480
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,000
If it's anything like his Simpsons voices, then I'm sure they're a delight.

1481
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Oh, God. Jesus. And they're all going to be extra funny when we all take Joe Rogan's DMT that he offers everyone.

1482
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:31,000
When you get into the state, get into the state. It's offered to new residents.

1483
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:36,000
When you guys in the DMT now, what's that? Are you guys doing DMT now?

1484
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,000
No, Joe Rogan always is talking about the empty, isn't he?

1485
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:47,000
No, not till we get to Texas. We'll be doing DMT. We'll be doing BWW.

1486
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Well, I mean, like BWW. That's what I like. That's my drug of choice.

1487
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Thanks for having me on.

1488
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Hey, wait, that's not as works. I say when you get I'll do it. We'll do it.

1489
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Nick Mundy, you survived podcast, the ride. Now you can say thank you.

1490
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I already did. All right. We covered it.

1491
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:17,000
What we didn't cover is exiting through the drive through gift shop. Nick, is there anything you'd like to plug?

1492
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
No, this show. Great.

1493
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Oh, and you just want to. So you'd like to plug the Steve Miller band, apparently.

1494
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
All right. Yes. Well, it's here to play.

1495
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
It's actually not me. Oh, it's not. Oh, OK.

1496
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Play us out, Steve. All right. Yeah. Sounds good to me. Thanks for subscribing. Thanks for listening.

1497
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Play us out, Steve Miller.

1498
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
We're just going to wait until we get to the park. Yeah.

1499
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,000
You didn't know that? Wait till this part. Here we go.

1500
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
We're all right. Now we're out.
