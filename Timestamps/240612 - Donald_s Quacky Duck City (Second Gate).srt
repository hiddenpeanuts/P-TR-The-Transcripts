1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,280
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:29,480
City of duckbills, city of web feet, city of quacking, and big old feathery seats.

3
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,760
We all need it, can't live without it.

4
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,880
Quacky Duck City, oh yeah.

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,640
Welcome to Podcast The Ride The Second Gate.

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,640
My name is Mike Carlson.

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,400
Joining me is always Jason Sheridan.

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,400
That was so nice.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,400
Thank you so much.

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,400
Scott Garner is here as well.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,400
That was really nice.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,320
What a sweet, lovely song.

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,320
Who wrote that song?

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,320
It's an original song.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,320
You just made up that song?

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,320
Yeah.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,320
I made up the melody and I wrote the words.

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,320
Wow.

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,320
Okay.

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,320
That's great.

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,280
I would hate to think that anybody unsavory wrote something so savory.

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,280
That's an original song.

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,280
Yeah.

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
Wow.

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,280
Do you mean like Big Pete?

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,280
What?

27
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,280
An unsavory character like Pete?

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,280
Oh.

29
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,280
Oh, you mean the cat Pete?

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
You call him Big Pete?

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
I've heard him called Big Pete.

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,280
I think he's called Big Pete once in a while.

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
Yeah.

34
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,280
Okay.

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,280
I know he shows up in this and yet my mind did not go.

36
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,080
What I fleshed too is that that is a hip hop or R&B artist who I am not familiar with.

37
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
Big Pete.

38
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
I don't know about Big Pete.

39
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,840
What did he do that was so bad?

40
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,720
Made a mouse drive a steamboat in a way that he didn't want to do?

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,720
Yeah.

42
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,400
He dumped some pudding on a character one time probably.

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
Yeah.

44
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,000
Was he a slightly more abrasive father than his dog neighbor?

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah.

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He's a bad guy though.

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Big Pete.

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So yeah.

49
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We won't talk about him.

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,800
But anyway, that song, yeah, well, if anyone wants to use that song, yeah, just credit

51
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
it to me.

52
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Yeah.

53
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
I wrote it and the melody.

54
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Sorry.

55
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Yeah.

56
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
Lovely.

57
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,680
So today, you know, I brought this up a couple of weeks ago, this topic, and I really before

58
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,800
I say it, I just don't want it.

59
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,560
I don't want this to be a jealousy episode.

60
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,840
I don't want this just to be me complaining today, but I was in the cards, but jealousy.

61
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,680
Well, I'm jealous of that.

62
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,680
We always talk about the Tokyo parks and we're always talking about how you're jealous of

63
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,680
the Japanese.

64
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
Yes.

65
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,080
So I'm just going to get out of the way.

66
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,020
This is so fun to me.

67
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,660
It's Donald's Quacky Duck City.

68
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,460
And I'm so jealous of the people who go to Tokyo Disney regularly because they get to

69
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,420
experience this.

70
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,780
And I just went to Disneyland.

71
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,940
They have Pixar Fest there, which is fine.

72
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,940
It's fine.

73
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,940
What happens at Pixar Fest?

74
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,020
Well, there's an area over by that theater where they did Mickey and the Magical Map

75
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,620
where they have like some characters and there's a little dance party and they have some like

76
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,460
they have I'm trying to think they have a parade at California and they have a parade

77
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,260
and they have special food items that maybe are bad.

78
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,180
I've seen people say that they're not very good.

79
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,260
The unique food items this year at Disneyland.

80
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,420
Believe it or not, something they made for a limited time is not so good food wise.

81
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,420
Looks good.

82
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,060
Impress photos, but does not taste good to the regular folks who go.

83
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,060
Yes.

84
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,060
Believe it or not.

85
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,620
So and there's like a there's like kind of a weird statue in the middle of the Esplanade

86
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,860
that's like a Pixar, like a tribute to Pixar.

87
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,140
And they got there's a lot of stuff.

88
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,260
I'm not saying there's not stuff and I'm not saying it's not fun, but is it as good

89
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:27,500
as what Tokyo is doing, which is something called Donald's Quacky Duck City, which transforms

90
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,580
Tokyo Disneyland into Quacky Duck City?

91
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,460
I believe it's not.

92
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,940
That's my premise for this episode.

93
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:41,940
It's Donald getting his flowers, getting his credit, getting his dream.

94
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,020
It's part of a series called Palo Palooza.

95
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:51,940
It sure is, Jason Palo Palooza, which I actually didn't even realize until recently that it's

96
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,300
a series of events highlighting the different characters, the big five or six.

97
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,900
I'm not sure how many they're going to do.

98
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,020
Surely not Mickey.

99
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,000
He's had plenty of lauding.

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,340
We're talking about his pals.

101
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,620
We're talking about his pals.

102
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,020
Yes, he's taking a back seat.

103
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:15,540
He wore like a polka dot outfit for the first Palo Palooza, Minnie's Thunderland.

104
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,540
Yes.

105
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,260
So that I didn't even realize was part of this.

106
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,220
Minnie had her own event, which now I feel bad because I'm now just so excited about

107
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,140
Donald's Quacky Duck City, but I should have been excited about Minnie's Thunderland.

108
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:33,340
Pretty sexist, I'd say, of all of us that we did not properly highlight Minnie's Thunderland.

109
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,540
I agree with you.

110
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,540
I feel like-

111
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,540
The male gaze, huh?

112
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,060
Well, yeah.

113
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,060
Wait, no.

114
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,060
The male gaze is like-

115
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,060
No, the male gaze is not technically-

116
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:46,300
No, I mean the kind of male gaze where we gazed over it, where we gazed so far to our

117
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,060
duck boy that we gazed past the woman.

118
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,060
Right.

119
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:57,340
We saw that feathery seat and we gazed right at it and just totally missed that Minnie

120
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,340
was there.

121
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,340
Yeah.

122
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,020
When we say male gaze, we mean at a duck seat.

123
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,820
I feel like they're going a lot harder for Quacky Duck City.

124
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,220
It feels like it, yes.

125
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,220
I agree.

126
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,180
It feels like they're going harder for Quacky Duck City, but Minnie had a lot of stuff and

127
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,380
she has her own original song as well, so we have to talk a little bit about it as well,

128
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,060
but I apologize to Minnie.

129
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,900
I was not aware of your Thunderland.

130
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,620
Oh, you're going to have a fight when she gets home.

131
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,020
Oh, in my where I live with her?

132
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,820
Well, yeah, you have a secret family.

133
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,820
Oh, yeah.

134
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,820
I have a secret family with Minnie Mouse.

135
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,620
You have a secret family with Minnie Mouse.

136
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,140
Mike asked us not to talk about that on the show, the fact that he's been quietly, discreetly

137
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,140
seeing Minnie Mouse officially when I have finally made it official.

138
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:45,620
And then I have kids with her like that Fox TV show that lasted like two or three episodes,

139
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,700
like 15 years ago.

140
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:53,580
I don't want to say this, but look, I really I think that your human daughter is beautiful,

141
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,400
but that son you had with Minnie, I'm sorry.

142
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,340
It's just weird to only have the one big mouse ear and then a much smaller human one.

143
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,820
I'm still getting used to it.

144
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:08,700
And again, this is just like, you know, it's a human centric view of things.

145
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:15,180
It's a different standard of beauty, because by my standard of beauty, your son is a freak.

146
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,460
But I'll get through.

147
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,980
I'm sure that in three years time, I'll be saying the opposite.

148
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,220
Well, it's weird that it went half and half like that, half one side, half the other.

149
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,740
That's generally not what happens when you mix genetics.

150
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,860
But I guess it's obviously it's possible.

151
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,860
You never know.

152
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,860
Yeah.

153
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,420
On territory, you know, that you're brave enough.

154
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,380
I've never fucked a sheep, so I don't know what that would lead to.

155
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,540
I don't know what it would either.

156
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,660
But one day maybe we'll find out.

157
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,940
Well, little little little we call them Mickey, which is weird.

158
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,940
That's weird choice, I guess.

159
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,940
It's a real power move.

160
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,700
It's really manipulative.

161
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:56,700
Now that we're revealing that this has actually happened here, a kid, OK, what's what's his

162
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,700
name?

163
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,700
Really?

164
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,700
Really?

165
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,860
I mean, I'm I'm flattered, but I'm weirded out to another room.

166
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,420
And you just hear crashing, crashing, punching the wall.

167
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,460
Mickey Walton with one of their shirts that says, I'm not the stepfather.

168
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,340
I'm just a father who stepped up.

169
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,420
Would you not want me as the dad?

170
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,260
I'm the richest being on earth.

171
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:26,860
Yeah.

172
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,620
I'm the richest animal in the history of America.

173
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,540
You want to cut me out for some podcaster?

174
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,820
Oh, Patriot.

175
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,820
Very good.

176
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,380
Yeah.

177
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,660
How about I'm a fucking trillionaire?

178
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,340
How about that?

179
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:45,300
Number two is that dog from the artist and he's passed away.

180
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,860
So it's only not even in the same bracket.

181
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,860
Whatever the dog's name was, I don't remember.

182
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,340
Yeah.

183
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,620
So anyway, yeah.

184
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:59,180
So that's I have a lot of explaining to do to Minnie, but Minnie had her own

185
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,460
Funderland where they celebrate it.

186
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,340
So this is great.

187
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,900
They celebrate all the other characters.

188
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,620
And I don't know, maybe maybe I'm crazy or maybe I'm just nostalgic for like

189
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,660
Mickey's birthday land.

190
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,820
But I like it when there was an event that felt kind of specific to Disneyland,

191
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,460
like we're only going to be able to do this at Disneyland or Disney World this

192
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,820
year, this summer.

193
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,500
And we're going and it felt specific.

194
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,460
Mickey's having a birthday.

195
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:20,660
All right.

196
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,620
Well, we got to go down to Disney World to check this out.

197
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,980
We have to see what's going to happen.

198
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:30,020
Do you think you're did your family go specifically to see Mickey's birthday

199
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,300
occur?

200
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,860
I think they decided the year.

201
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,740
And then when I looked and saw what was happening, I said, well, we got to see

202
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,740
this, we got to see what Mickey's up to.

203
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,020
It's his birthday.

204
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,380
So no, I don't think they were particularly moved.

205
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,540
They were happy to see it.

206
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,500
They were happy to ignore it.

207
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,660
Mickey acknowledged it, whatever the cake antics were at that show.

208
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:55,020
But to me, this don't you think Jason, Jason, come on, don't you think this

209
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,900
sounds better than a Pixar fest or a Seasons of the Force?

210
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,980
I'm not throwing that.

211
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,260
I mean, like, well, this is another OK, I should have said that before.

212
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,580
Seasons of the Force is their Star Wars event.

213
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,220
What does that mean?

214
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,380
Yeah, you know what I mean?

215
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,260
Like, it's not like, oh, Chewie's like Hootenanny or something.

216
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,460
If they had like Chewie was having a party and you got to go down to Disneyland

217
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,460
to check it out, doesn't that sound more fun celebrating the Star Wars characters

218
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,900
birthdays? Absolutely. Right.

219
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,140
Yes. It's Babu Frick's birthday.

220
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,380
It's Babu Frick's birthday all summer.

221
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,620
And you have to come and celebrate with him.

222
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,700
You're all going. You're buying the highest annual pass you can.

223
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,020
Frick Fest. You're getting the best.

224
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,500
You're paying 1800 bucks or whatever for the annual pass.

225
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,460
So you can go all summer.

226
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,180
Get your Frick on. Yeah. Frick Fest.

227
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,900
Yes. Better than like Seasons of the Force, where like we're very reverent

228
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,380
to the force and the wills and the midichlorians and stuff like.

229
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,660
No way. We want to blow.

230
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,620
I would also argue that there's no way that they are reverent to the will.

231
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,980
I know. I know. Seasons of the Force.

232
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,580
Some people there are, though.

233
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,740
Sure. Attendees. But it's not an official.

234
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,260
It's not a workshop where you go learn the wills work.

235
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,380
You're right. If it was will, if they were celebrating the wills,

236
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,780
also, we would be down there almost every day.

237
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,620
Big Willy style. Big Willy.

238
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,660
Be a name for that. Yes.

239
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,580
But the question was posed to Jason.

240
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,500
This is this again.

241
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,340
I think this is another one of those, Mike, where you're you want someone

242
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,580
to be arguing. Yeah, that's true.

243
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,900
And I don't think Jason Sheridan is the person who's going to argue.

244
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,700
No, I prefer Pixar Fest.

245
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,180
Keep Quacky Duck City in your pocket. Right.

246
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,900
You know, what I what we like, Jane and I liked about

247
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,140
the Pixar Fest stuff was they had people

248
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:35,420
playing all the girls from Turning Red and they had the boy band.

249
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,460
Well, that's great. I'm a big Turning Red fan.

250
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,900
And you can meet May and her mom.

251
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,900
But I don't know if it's enough, you know.

252
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,700
Well, it's just there's too much.

253
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,500
It's too generalized is what I'm saying.

254
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,100
If it was just like turning red, like I like the specificity of now,

255
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,900
if it was all the Pixar characters and they all suddenly had red hair

256
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,580
or panda ears.

257
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,940
Now we're talking.

258
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,900
If you start mixing up the characters, you know what?

259
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,060
They do have that.

260
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,660
They have like cars dressed as Woody and Buzz.

261
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,700
So they do. We're getting there.

262
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,060
We're getting there.

263
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,180
Again, there's fun stuff, but shows.

264
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,660
But how else do you? Yeah, that's a way.

265
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,740
If there's any feeling of like turning red didn't work

266
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,860
and we don't like these personal movies, we're not doing it.

267
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,540
Oh, God, I don't get me started.

268
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,340
Oh, boy.

269
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,860
Like, you know, well, maybe you didn't give it the full college try.

270
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,980
Maybe it may be if you said turning red is part of the family.

271
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,820
We're going to own it and be proud of it.

272
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,580
And all the characters are going to have red hair in the parks.

273
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,980
Now and now we've all been educated that turning red is in the canon

274
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,460
and we have to pay attention to it instead of this way

275
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,260
that they're releasing things, which is like, yeah, we put a movie out.

276
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,420
I don't know. Maybe you'll maybe like it.

277
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,180
Maybe you won't buy everybody like, yeah, the Disney people,

278
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,620
like the marketing people, like shield their eyes as they write

279
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,140
at the premiere, they're covering their faces.

280
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,540
They have done it in the past where they they are doing like more fun stuff.

281
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,940
Like the

282
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,860
you could buy cars, toys dressed like Star Wars characters

283
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,180
or the Muppets dressed like Star Wars characters.

284
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,340
That's done. Yeah, that was done.

285
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,060
Yeah, yeah. No more fun, of course, than the hyperspace hoopla.

286
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,700
Oh, I mean, so that's what everyone agrees.

287
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,100
And not just two people in this room.

288
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,060
What everybody agrees is one of the pinnacles of I've seen

289
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,220
a couple of people recently talking about that hoopla very wistfully online.

290
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,620
I had people I don't know. Yeah.

291
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,140
People that I didn't prompt a couple of people.

292
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,740
A well, I guess it is a phenomenon of all phenomena.

293
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,100
The sample size is representative of a bigger sample somewhere, I think.

294
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,420
But I'm just saying three people equals three thousand people.

295
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,500
That's what I'm saying.

296
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,020
So, yeah, I don't I don't think any of that stuff is coming back anytime soon.

297
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,820
Seasons of the Force is too serious.

298
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,860
It's too serious. We need more fun.

299
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,540
We need more fun.

300
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,860
Well, tell us about the fun before we get mad at the not fun.

301
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,860
I know I came in hot today.

302
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,180
I'm sorry.

303
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,300
So there's a fun thing.

304
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,740
OK, now, what would the fun thing remind?

305
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,940
We're getting that out of the way.

306
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,660
That's why I gave the qualifier.

307
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,100
I was going to get it out of the way.

308
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,820
We're cooling the room before we cool the room before you heat it up with fun.

309
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,260
Fun, fun, friction creates heat.

310
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,780
And that's what we're going to do now.

311
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,420
Fun friction is something that would happen at Babu Frick Fest. Right.

312
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,660
You get your freak on, have some fun friction.

313
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,100
Oh, man. Imagine they had like a little Babu Frick, like breakdancing

314
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,060
and like a circle, like during like a happy like a remix of Happy Birthday

315
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,620
played by like size noodles and Max Rebo.

316
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,180
We're we're going we're going Babu Frick work in the workshop.

317
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,340
He does. John Williams, isn't that?

318
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,620
Isn't he right? John Williams cameo.

319
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,260
So that would be John Williams, a bartender.

320
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,420
Yeah, I thought he was like a guy with like he's got like, you know,

321
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,140
the multiple lenses, like a guy who's going to like work with microscopic toys.

322
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,780
I don't think I knew this. He's in it. Yeah, yeah.

323
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,340
They finally. Yes.

324
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,020
Well, among the better things in Rise of Skywalker is that like a guy

325
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,260
and a cloak turns around and you're like, oh, it's John Williams, I think.

326
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,460
But they didn't, you know, if then he like Geppetto style,

327
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,100
made all the gadgets wherever they are.

328
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,940
I'll perform a big song to say Happy Birthday, Babu.

329
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,540
Oh, God. Of course.

330
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,180
Are you finding what he was?

331
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,140
This is John Williams' bartender.

332
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,900
He was a bartender, really.

333
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,580
So I think maybe he just I thought he was like a mechanic.

334
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,380
I thought he like slid out from under a space car.

335
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,020
Well, he has like I know what you're saying,

336
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,980
because he's in the workshop and he's got like a little thing over his eye.

337
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,020
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah, right.

338
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,500
That made me this as Barton.

339
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,100
So I don't know. Yeah, no, no, no.

340
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,580
That's that's probably right.

341
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,540
Kajimi is the plan.

342
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,260
I thought he was all like smeared up, all tarred up, like even working with with oils.

343
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,900
Yeah, he's an older fellow.

344
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,340
So I don't want him on the ground like that, because it might be hard.

345
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,500
It might get up. Yeah, yeah.

346
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,740
I know. I'm glad they didn't stage it that way.

347
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,060
Might have been a droid bartender, maybe making oil based drinks.

348
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,180
Yeah, that's true.

349
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,220
So, well, yeah, get him in there, get him in there.

350
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,660
Walk around, face characters of John Williams, unnamed Barty.

351
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,220
There's no way he's unnamed, right?

352
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,940
They name everybody in Star Wars.

353
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,540
I don't see his name.

354
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,900
I'll figure it out and I'll shout it out while we talk Quirky Duck City.

355
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,260
OK, so well, let's let's start.

356
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,100
I just so so they have like an original song, they have original parade,

357
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,100
and they're sort of a similar template for like I think the parade is basically

358
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,300
the same floats and then they just put some new stuff on them for each character.

359
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,020
So I assume. And this, by the way, just to say, Quirky Duck City

360
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,100
is there is a parade that's like the center of it,

361
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,380
but then it's this park wide celebration. Yeah.

362
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,620
And it also includes special menu items and merch and just decor

363
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,540
all around, especially the outside, the castle and World Bazaar,

364
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,020
which is their mainstay in the whole.

365
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,780
It's Golden Idol of Donald Duck and World Bazaar.

366
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,860
Wow. Golden Idol to worship their Main Street. Yes.

367
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,900
And the and the and the flowers outside the park is fully Donald's face.

368
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,500
Yes, which is fun.

369
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,020
And they did that with many as well.

370
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,220
I really like their do you call that?

371
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,820
That's I don't know if that's the Esplanade, whatever.

372
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,780
You know, the like entrance patio.

373
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,940
Yeah. Whatever is very unique.

374
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,540
And it doesn't look like the other parks.

375
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,180
It's not like because you don't have a train going around.

376
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,100
So it's just kind of a different layout.

377
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,180
And they send a lot of characters out. Right.

378
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,100
You're getting a lot of activity before you're even at the Main Street

379
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,540
equivalent or even seeing the castle. Yes.

380
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,780
I don't know if I ever shouted that out, but I really like whatever

381
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,300
you call that entrance plaza in Tokyo, Disneyland, I think is great.

382
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,460
And I really like it that they got Mickey out of there for a minute

383
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,660
and did a big Donald Topi area. Yeah. Great.

384
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,620
There's a lot of care.

385
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,660
Like it feels like almost like mingling, like you're at like a party or something

386
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,300
and you're being greeted by the people who live there.

387
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,660
It's kind of like, yeah, like casual drinks refresh.

388
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,100
It's like the thing between the wedding ceremony and the wedding party. Right.

389
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,460
Does everybody mingle cocktail hour? Right.

390
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
To know who you'll be hanging out with at your table.

391
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,540
And in Disneyland and over here, they have it

392
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,740
like when you walk into Main Street,

393
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,260
usually they do have a bunch of characters with lines and stuff.

394
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,380
So they kind of have it here, but it's on Main Street and it's still a little busier.

395
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,740
This one feels more casual in Tokyo. Mm hmm.

396
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,140
Mm hmm. More space to the Tokyo.

397
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,620
I was watching the Tokyo Disney Explorer.

398
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,380
That's his channel, Jason.

399
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,980
Yeah, Chris. Yeah.

400
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,620
Tokyo Disney. So a lot of the stuff I was watching and he's

401
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,900
he's got some good videos talking about.

402
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,340
He also tries all menu items.

403
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,700
Yes. Yeah.

404
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,820
Yeah, there is a TDR Explorer write ups about the thing.

405
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,460
And then just the TDR Explorer.

406
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,580
Excuse me. I said, yeah. Yeah.

407
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,740
And then Attractions magazine is a pretty good write up about it, too.

408
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:40,260
And Omar Trez is the name of Tress Trace.

409
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,340
Spelled like the number Trace is John Williams.

410
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,660
And yes, he does have a name. Oh, wow. What is it?

411
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,420
Omar Omar Tress.

412
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,540
Omar Tress. Wow.

413
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,580
I've also just learned from this full IMDb of episode nine that

414
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,380
radio head producer Nigel Godrich is the voice of a droid,

415
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,460
as is George Harrison's son, Danny Harrison.

416
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,660
Really? Yeah, apparently.

417
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,300
Then they don't say which or maybe it's just like a background.

418
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,940
Oh, it's FNT, FN2802 and FN0878.

419
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,060
I should have known they name everything.

420
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,220
So John. So, yeah, Omar Tress.

421
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,900
OK, Omar Tress. Wow. Yeah.

422
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,140
My top 10 Star Wars characters for me.

423
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,100
Omar Tress, the bartender

424
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,140
who can act a little bit, but who can conduct really good.

425
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,500
Well, that's center.

426
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,820
He should team up with Senator Grubbleebs.

427
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,140
Yeah, something tells me they'd get along.

428
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,180
Something tells me they might have collaborated in some other form.

429
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,780
Yeah. So let me read here.

430
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,980
This is the press release for Donald's Quacky Duck City.

431
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,980
And it takes place, you know, if you're if you're going to Tokyo Disney,

432
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,700
you still can do this.

433
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,060
It's it's through the 30th of June. It started April 9th.

434
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,060
This event series is all about having a blast with your pals

435
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,900
in the park in the park in a party like Palooza environment.

436
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,900
Following the first installment, featuring Minnie Mouse,

437
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,820
the second event, Donald's Quacky Duck City stars Donald Duck.

438
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,260
Guests can enter the extraordinary world of Duck City,

439
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,180
Donald's ideal world where he reigns as the ultimate superstar.

440
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,620
With this event, guests can enjoy the world of Donald's

441
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,700
imagination as the park undergoes a transformation

442
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,620
tailored to fulfill Donald's wildest dreams.

443
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,820
OK, now I love this.

444
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,260
I love what you have just read.

445
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,860
I love that it's Palooza like, but not necessarily full Palooza.

446
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,420
Full Palooza measures your expectations.

447
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,420
But also that might be accurate that it's only Palooza like

448
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:42,180
because this notion of like we are entering the ultimate Donald verse

449
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,860
in which he reigns supreme and all bow to him.

450
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,860
You get in there, I watch some video, unless I'm missing some things.

451
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,180
It's kind of like this four statues of Donald.

452
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:56,180
I don't know that the immersion of Quacky Duck City is so full and complete.

453
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,100
We are not like, I don't know.

454
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,340
There's not like a like a big, scary throne

455
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,740
that's part his face and the skulls of his enemies,

456
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,340
those being goofy and Pluto. Right.

457
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,820
Well, if you were eating the fettuccine and you were looking at like

458
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,420
the wall of merchandise, the immersion might be more.

459
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,460
If you at peak Quacky Duck City, you would feel more immersed.

460
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,300
Yeah, you'd feel more immersed.

461
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,540
I really like this drawing that I think was along with the press release.

462
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,060
Donald is wearing a crown.

463
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:35,540
Everyone else is wearing outfits inspired by Donald's sailor suit.

464
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,860
And then Pete is in the corner, kind of put out as usual.

465
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,140
He's upset. Good. You're not invited.

466
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,180
But Mickey seems like he's having fun with his friends.

467
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,140
Like he and he's wearing a Donald suit.

468
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,020
Like he's humble, you know.

469
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,780
Yeah, he could give the spotlight to someone else is the spotlight.

470
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,060
It's a little bit of a break for him.

471
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,140
Fine. Yeah. Hundred years of me.

472
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,980
We could do three months of Donald.

473
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,620
Well, what do you mean?

474
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,260
It's going to be a year of all the friends celebrate.

475
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,740
What do you mean? What do you mean a year?

476
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,100
What did I sign off on?

477
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,940
You know, I don't read that shit I sign.

478
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,620
I thought this was just three months and then it was back to me.

479
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,260
I was already mad enough about the things in America.

480
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,420
Seasons of the Force and Peck's Office.

481
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,060
Yeah. Where am I fitting into Seasons of the Force?

482
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,140
Who cares?

483
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,940
Giving Pluto a thing.

484
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,380
Pluto. Look, I love he's my dog.

485
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,020
I love him. He's my pal.

486
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,860
He can't do shit.

487
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,260
He sleeps in poops.

488
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,780
You're going to get a parade out of that.

489
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,980
Like to see you try.

490
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,780
Yeah. Make a golden statue out of one of his shits.

491
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,060
That people come from miles to see it.

492
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,700
Idiot can't even talk.

493
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,340
He's constantly outsmarted by Chip and Dale.

494
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,820
Chip and Dale are getting a month to fuck.

495
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,460
God damn it.

496
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,460
Oh, good. Yeah, big deal.

497
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,180
They're they outsmarted dog.

498
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,620
I'm very impressed.

499
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,900
There is so the I think the thing is you're referring to,

500
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,020
there is one like big, like a decent sized statue that Jason references,

501
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,020
golden idol of Donald in the middle.

502
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,420
But then there are other like they're like, I guess

503
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,500
they're not poster.

504
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,180
There's there's other things in that sort of area that are like trophies,

505
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,820
essentially, like posters of trophies or pictures of trophies

506
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,780
that Donald has won, declaring him the best chef or the strongest.

507
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,940
Best chef is really funny.

508
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,140
Chef. Yes. What is it?

509
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,060
What is the what back?

510
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:33,660
So these are Donald's deepest desires to be thought of as the best

511
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,380
chef is the strongest.

512
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,740
There's a picture of Donald's dressed as like a disco singer

513
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,940
or a dancer on the outside.

514
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,420
So I assume he wants to also be thought of as the best dancer.

515
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,900
And he's been awarded in this sort of weird scenario

516
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,300
where we're now giving into all of his deepest desires.

517
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:56,620
And it's more about we're all getting together to help our friend, I guess,

518
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,940
or to really boost our friend up.

519
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,580
But if we're going to really all right, like having having to be surrounded

520
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,020
by totems of his achievements is something.

521
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,820
But I kind of want what was described in that blurb that you read.

522
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,540
Mike was very, you know, that felt almost we're getting into

523
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,540
like North Korea territory.

524
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,980
And I think if you want to like really show your might

525
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,660
and that you're in charge, what do you do? Missile parade.

526
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,180
You got to do a missile parade.

527
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,940
So what I would like to see as much as I like the parade,

528
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,580
I'd also like to see missiles painted in Donald Duck's sailor suit patterns

529
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:32,700
go by just to show like, hey, you know, you know, Donald's got a temper.

530
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,820
If he if he decides to fire, if he gets mad and does one of his

531
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,780
like these things could go off and then boom, no more fantasy.

532
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,900
So there would be a trophy that says like best military strong man or something.

533
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,260
And Donald is dressed in like a general's outfit.

534
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,940
Yeah, yeah, yes. Yeah. Strongest military might. Right.

535
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,140
Yeah. I mean, I'm sure he has other fantasies

536
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,700
that weren't fulfilled by Quacky Duck City. Mm hmm.

537
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,620
He's starting.

538
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,740
We're starting with the PG fantasy. Right.

539
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,740
And then we'll get a little.

540
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,420
Yeah. Best like vanquisher of enemies.

541
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,340
Best. Yeah, like Mickey killer or something.

542
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,740
And it's like he's standing over Mickey and reigning supreme in Disneyland.

543
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,140
They're not going to say the darker stuff, I don't think.

544
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,860
Best. Well, you know, decapitator from Mr.

545
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,340
Duck Steps Out, one of my favorite shorts where he's basically just trying to get laid.

546
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,060
And he's getting messed up by the nephews.

547
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,660
So I guess like you'd have a trophy like best sex have her, I guess, potentially.

548
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,660
Sure. Best. Yeah.

549
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,140
These are all stuff I'm saying they're not doing.

550
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,780
This is all in the deep recesses of his duck brain.

551
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,820
Yeah. Yeah. So they maybe if there's a Quacky Duck City, too,

552
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,540
but that's best to ratter out of dumb nephews.

553
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,980
Right. As he like puts gets them in juvie.

554
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,140
Yeah.

555
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,580
These are longer titles for trophies,

556
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,580
but I think you could fit him on a couple of lines.

557
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,380
I'm going to make sure. I'm going to make sure.

558
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,540
I was starting to do Mickey and then I tried to switch to Donald.

559
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,540
Well, I've been trying to put off doing my Donald voice this whole time.

560
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,780
God, that's Stitch.

561
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,180
It all sounds so good.

562
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,380
It's just not good voice you choose from.

563
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,980
Yeah, which way? Good.

564
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,660
I'm going to get uncle Scrooge to change his will.

565
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,940
What did he say?

566
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,020
He said he's going to get uncle Scrooge to change his will.

567
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,180
Oh, that's good. Yeah.

568
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,820
Just during you sound like the I feel like that's what the villains

569
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,460
and Ernest scared, stupid sound like. Yeah.

570
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,300
OK, Scrooge.

571
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,540
But Scott, your point, yes.

572
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,060
OK, they didn't transform the castle necessarily.

573
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:51,900
That's something I obviously would prefer if he had the castle

574
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,260
look like a little sailor suit or something.

575
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,860
They're still dealing with the fallout of Stitch covering it.

576
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,460
And, oh, did it do that in Tokyo?

577
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,740
No, no, I just mean in Florida.

578
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,980
They're still you're saying that that people still grousing about that through.

579
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,340
Well, castle disrespect.

580
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,060
Right, because we talked about Castle Cake and stuff.

581
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,140
And that wasn't disrespect.

582
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,100
That was sanctioned.

583
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,580
But like maybe a takeover, maybe a character.

584
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,860
Yeah. We don't know how we feel because they haven't.

585
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,300
Yeah. Have they done anything like that since?

586
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,380
I guess the Stitch thing is the last time when they like

587
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,780
fucked with the castle.

588
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,740
I think besides like just adding more and more.

589
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,380
Yeah, they change the colors and like for the 60th.

590
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,900
They put that big Lone Ranger mask on it.

591
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,340
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

592
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,220
Yeah, that was weird.

593
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,140
Changed it to like kind of like a richer blue during the diamond.

594
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,540
Of course, the diamond celebration.

595
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,460
Or Scott remembers the diamonds.

596
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,420
Oh, 60th. Yeah, of course, Jason and I know 70th is coming.

597
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,300
What did we call that? What's the name of that?

598
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,460
What's the I don't know.

599
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,100
What's the 70th anniversary called the 70th anniversary?

600
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,620
I think this Disneyland 70th anniversary will be called disappointing.

601
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,100
Oh, we got what we could afford.

602
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,740
Is it next? When is it?

603
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,860
What year is it next year? Wow.

604
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,860
Oh, yeah. Nothing news opening for that.

605
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,140
No, they don't have time for.

606
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,660
Yeah, got jack shit for that.

607
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,020
Oh, round. Well, we did.

608
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,100
Tiana member. Oh, yeah, that's 13 months ago.

609
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,300
So that's what we did.

610
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,980
That's true. Aren't you happy with that?

611
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,580
We did it. And it was for.

612
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,660
Oh, I know it was for the 70th.

613
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,060
Yeah, no, we're going to know it.

614
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,980
It was all that. So we're getting a jump on the 70th.

615
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,580
Yeah. OK. Wow.

616
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,060
I can't I didn't even think about it being 70 next year.

617
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,420
Wow. We're going to do a lot of content for the 70th celebration.

618
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,740
Are we? Well, it's a big deal.

619
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,620
70th anniversary, Jason, have you found the name of it yet?

620
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,700
I'm looking up what you give.

621
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,060
Oh, what you give for?

622
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,060
Like, well, because that's what diamond.

623
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,180
Oh, is that what diamond means?

624
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,820
You give it. I think on the 60th anniversary.

625
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,700
OK. Traditional gift for the 70th anniversary.

626
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,140
Platinum. Oh, the platinum celebration.

627
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,460
Platinum celebration. That's pretty good.

628
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,300
That is cool.

629
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,020
The sound of it seems like an expensive material, though.

630
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,140
I don't know how many platinum decorations they're going to make.

631
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,900
I don't know. But yeah, so so they haven't.

632
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,380
I guess I guess my point was they haven't touched the castle.

633
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,700
Really, in a severe way in a while.

634
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,700
And I severe sound here.

635
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,180
Yeah, let's touch the castle in a severe way.

636
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,180
I want that sounds like carving it up.

637
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,500
I want that cake castle back.

638
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,740
I really, really do.

639
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,420
I want a cake castle again.

640
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,740
I don't see why not.

641
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,980
Yeah, I because I don't think they do anything that interesting.

642
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,620
Well, look, when they cover it in platinum, that horribly reflects

643
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,460
in the eyes of sunlight.

644
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,580
Yeah, it'll look like the houses in the curse.

645
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,780
And we'll have to go see it.

646
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,740
Everybody will flock for miles to see it.

647
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,100
OK, so in Quacky Duck City, though, they do have a lot of little stuff.

648
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,740
It's not big stuff. It's little stuff.

649
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,780
It's garbage cans.

650
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:01,060
It's it's a garbage can that shows Donald's front side and his seat.

651
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,940
So have you seen? Yeah.

652
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,820
So that's just cute little stuff.

653
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,700
There's topiaries of Donald.

654
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,700
They're sort of weird.

655
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,300
And we just talked about this with Mickey Mania.

656
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,820
There's there's decorations that look kind of like weird abstractions

657
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,220
of Donald deconstructed, right?

658
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:20,340
Just just like a white sphere and a duck bill hanging.

659
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,700
OK, as a as a fan of Mickey Mania, I like that we're heading

660
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,700
into this territory at all. Yes.

661
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,340
So we do have stuff like that.

662
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,420
I have some photos here.

663
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,540
I should have loaded them better.

664
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,060
But so it's a lot.

665
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,580
It's a lot more like little stuff.

666
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,980
It's like you're going to go and you're going to eat something.

667
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,500
And on the tray is a cartoon of Donald dressed as a chef.

668
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,340
And we're also we've got this aesthetic that's consistent to all of it.

669
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,140
That's very comic book.

670
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:51,060
Yes, which style and that kind and that that sort of printing with the party.

671
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,540
Yeah, which I'm sure is part of why I like it.

672
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,260
I do really obviously like that style.

673
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:00,940
But yeah, it just seems like I mean, Tokyo in general,

674
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:05,140
like the packages at the different like quick service food are different.

675
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,700
You do get more like detailed stuff.

676
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,100
So like this time they have like a specific Donald packaging

677
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:16,220
for your like chicken sandwich that you're getting at different places.

678
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,820
Well, at some places like you got a souvenir place, Matt, or a souvenir

679
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:28,340
coaster, yes, you are like pasta that look it's got some little stuff on top

680
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,740
that looks like his little seat. Right.

681
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,180
Yes. Well, look, the seat factors heavily into the food.

682
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:40,660
There are most things have like a Donald seat and like sticking out of your ice

683
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,660
cream, your dinner, your floats.

684
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:47,300
There's a lot of seat stuff happening in the food over there.

685
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,660
And there have been I had some sort of a seat like cone

686
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,980
when I was there a few years ago, where it's like sort of the ice cream is

687
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,380
is Donald seat.

688
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,500
And then there's a couple of little like cookies that look like his feet.

689
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,140
So it looks like he's upside down.

690
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,660
Like you put him in a trash can or you put him in the cone.

691
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,940
And now you're taking a big bite out of his seat.

692
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,380
And how do you do you like eating Donald's seat, Mike?

693
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,260
I did. The ice cream was really good.

694
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,060
And it's a fun little thing because you're eating his little feet

695
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,180
and then his seat.

696
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,340
I did like it. Yeah. Eat and see.

697
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,940
We have it. Look, we haven't done a lot of seat talks.

698
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:26,300
Got banned seat. I was got banned seat talk a couple of years ago.

699
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,140
I really shouldn't reveal.

700
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,500
I don't know if there was a bang.

701
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,460
Hang on. I think we're we're exaggerating that.

702
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,820
Perhaps a bit. There was no ban.

703
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,020
There was no ban.

704
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:40,100
Maybe an encouragement to take the temperature down on the seat.

705
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,620
I mean, people were spraying us with those, you know, spray bottles

706
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:49,020
you get for a cat and go, hey, that's a no, no word.

707
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:54,780
Yeah. Well, it just it started to feel like our following online audience,

708
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,780
like that there were, you know, like a new episode getting posted

709
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,620
would get one comment and then like seats would

710
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,860
there be some seat threads like, yeah, 75.

711
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,260
Everybody was so seat crazy.

712
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,660
I thought maybe we just needed to like, yeah, just let's just cool.

713
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,300
Just to take a break and then we'll be able to really appreciate seats more.

714
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,260
Right. So it's time for seats again, which I guess is now is today.

715
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,100
Today is the time for seats again.

716
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,500
OK, it's you know what it feels like is happy 90th anniversary

717
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,660
to our seat runner on the show.

718
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,380
That's that's how long it feels to me.

719
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,980
It does. Soon we're going to be celebrating

720
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,500
one hundred twenty five years of saying King Features Syndicate.

721
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,860
The platinum anniversary, the platinum anniversary of this podcast runner.

722
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,860
So, yeah, so so I was looking, especially that TDR Explorer.

723
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,140
I was looking because he had tried all this different stuff.

724
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,380
And, you know, you get like a little ice cream Sunday

725
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,660
and it looks like Donald's feet are sticking out.

726
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,580
I should have zoomed in. There's a lot of the whole seat thing

727
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:03,740
came out of Mickey's Philhar Magic and the moment where Donald propels

728
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,580
from the screen into the back of the theater and his big seat

729
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:12,420
and his kicking legs are like stuck in somewhere very, very much like

730
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,620
Winnie the Pooh in that famous short.

731
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,260
And I guess it's something that happens to Donald a lot is some catastrophe

732
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,700
like firing him into something.

733
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,100
And that's I feel that I do like that about these desserts,

734
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:28,300
that it feels like the dessert is a tableau of some kind of Donald disaster.

735
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,740
As if he was reaching for something and then fell face

736
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:37,220
first into a pudding or into a carbonara pasta.

737
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,300
Like I like that we are seeing like the immediate aftermath

738
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,860
of some kind of disaster. Yes, I like that a lot, too.

739
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,580
Sometimes it gets a little grim, because like if you let your drink

740
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,500
go a little too long, everything starts to get real melty.

741
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,220
Yeah, it's kind of not there.

742
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,580
So, yeah, you start to think it's like it's like he fell

743
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:59,980
into a vat of acid. Yeah, so is no is no more, Donald.

744
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,660
This drink here, this is a picture of what I assume

745
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,660
we're supposed to be as two feet and a seat.

746
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,140
But man, they have melted.

747
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,660
And it looks like Donald just got put in the dip.

748
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,740
Yeah, Roger Rabbit.

749
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:16,420
Well, you were you were showing kind of a later stage of the carbonara pasta,

750
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:21,940
which is like maybe the most primary savory depiction of Donald's seat.

751
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,020
And which is so.

752
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,300
So, yeah, duck dive pasta, duck dive pasta.

753
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,380
That is that. Yeah, that was that on that picture as well.

754
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,620
Where it's in that case, it's an egg.

755
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,740
And then like little little pieces of cheese that are the feet.

756
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,180
And then you're meant to mix all that up.

757
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:43,340
You're meant to like crack into his ass and mix up the innards.

758
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:47,300
So blue cheese or not blue colored cheese.

759
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,300
I think spring is confusing, not blue, not blue.

760
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,860
But blue colored.

761
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,020
Yeah. But what is that in this?

762
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,500
What I'm showing right now?

763
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,740
That's like a trail run.

764
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,780
What is that? Is that a discharge coming out of his seat?

765
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,820
What is the blue meant to be?

766
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,300
Well, it all comes out the cloaca.

767
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,460
If what? What was that?

768
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:13,460
I said it all comes out the cloaca.

769
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,220
The voices are getting worse and worse.

770
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,500
I still have an attempt.

771
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,420
Like what, how, how, how bad of multiple car accidents occurred

772
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,140
to whatever character this is to her?

773
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,460
This is somebody who was in multiple car accidents

774
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,340
and had the like throat taken out due to smoking.

775
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,700
Well, it's Mickey's.

776
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,420
It's Mike's mutant son.

777
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,620
Oh, that's what Mickey sounds like.

778
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,820
That's what he sounds like.

779
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,940
That's what young Mickey sounds like.

780
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,020
You're right. Yeah, I get me.

781
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,340
Something's wrong with my cloaca.

782
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,460
What are you saying? What is the?

783
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,140
Why does the mouse have a cloaca?

784
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,460
Like birds, birds have a cloaca.

785
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,380
What is a cloaca?

786
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,300
It's like where like poop and pee come out for birds.

787
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,140
But we don't have cloacas.

788
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,140
We do not have cloacas. No. Interesting.

789
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,540
How do you know that?

790
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:06,380
Just from just from nature, from being smarter than nature documentaries,

791
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,660
I feel like.

792
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,940
Did they? Does a bird have seen a diagram of one on a frog?

793
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,500
All right.

794
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,700
Do birds have vas deference?

795
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,020
Oh, I don't know. I can't speak to that.

796
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:22,380
OK, listener, don't Google image along with this.

797
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,700
I'm looking at some terrible things.

798
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,020
Oh, God, I don't want to see that.

799
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,780
Jason has brought cloacas into the conversation.

800
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,700
And maybe they're being disturbed.

801
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:36,100
Maybe that will replace seats from here on out with the little cloaca.

802
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,060
Donald's little cloaca.

803
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,620
Oh, you managed to.

804
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,940
All right, if this is all a

805
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,260
this is all an effort to give me a like seat talk.

806
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,380
This might be like when you put stuff in the movie that the MPAA

807
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,380
is going to rule out just to soften it.

808
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:52,820
That's right.

809
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,820
I guess you brought me back around to preferring seats.

810
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,620
I don't know.

811
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,020
Look, if the listeners pick up on it and run with it, that's not.

812
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,460
That's not our fault.

813
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,060
Social media is all about cloacas now.

814
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,620
What happened?

815
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,740
What have we harbored here?

816
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:10,220
Yeah, you're talking about the pasta, Scott.

817
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,100
Did you see the rice?

818
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,340
Did you see Donald's special set omelet rice with meat patty?

819
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,060
Is this where this is like a big this is like a hamburger patty?

820
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,580
Yes, it looks it's very like sloppy.

821
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,540
It's a very sloppy.

822
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,220
This is at Grandma Sarah's restaurant,

823
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,860
which is the restaurant next to their Splash Mountain.

824
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,940
And this is I will I think I like it,

825
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,340
but this is the most horrifying meal you can get at the Quacky Duck City.

826
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,060
It is just disgusting looking.

827
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:46,220
And then on top is a little egg with Donald's like two pieces of cheese

828
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,420
that are Donald's feet.

829
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:53,060
And then it just looks like a messy pile of like vomit with rice on the bottom.

830
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:58,500
I think there's egg and then a big like hamburger patty really does not look good to me.

831
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:02,260
I could see it tasting good, but it certainly doesn't look good

832
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,060
because the food in general is better at Tokyo.

833
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,420
But this one looks like a messy.

834
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,980
This looks like Donald was in some awful accident.

835
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,100
Yeah, it's deconstructed Donald.

836
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,580
Yeah, this looks like he was shot in somewhere and he exploded

837
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,100
in just a bunch of like brown blood.

838
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,140
Like like all that's left is his bottom half and his feet.

839
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,220
And he just is a mess on the ground.

840
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,540
This is if you're at the if you're at the funeral and that's what's inside the coffin.

841
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,620
Yeah, yeah.

842
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,500
Maybe we close it. Maybe we got to close it. Right.

843
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:38,500
Donald is best chef, best actor, best exploder.

844
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,100
Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

845
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,820
And this is yeah, you cut into a seat here and the egg,

846
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:50,260
the inside of the egg runs out into the already messy dish.

847
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,420
Well, I know omelet.

848
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,100
I think you you basically it's an omelet on top of rice.

849
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,500
Sometimes I've seen it done

850
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,140
where you cut open the omelet and kind of folds out.

851
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,660
But this seems like a different execution.

852
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,020
It seems like Jason, are you interested in eating this?

853
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,020
Oh, give it a shot. Sure. Yeah.

854
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,140
I'll tell you the food that I don't want.

855
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:17,300
At one of the table service, I believe there are some duck dishes.

856
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,940
And I think that's too morbid for me to eat.

857
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:25,460
Donald eating to eat, celebrate during the Donald's best duck.

858
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,900
Yeah. And I love duck.

859
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,660
You're a duck guy. I'm a duck guy.

860
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,340
I don't know that I've ever had.

861
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:37,340
Really? It's like a dark, like really greasy or dark meat chicken

862
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,900
or turkey meat guy. Oh, that's interesting.

863
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,060
You wouldn't like to.

864
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,940
Yeah. If I go to Zankou chicken, I'm usually clicking that at a dollar.

865
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,980
And then you only get white meat.

866
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,700
Oh, I make it all dark. Really? Yes.

867
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,380
I didn't know that about you.

868
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,700
Yeah. Interesting.

869
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,380
Just because it's like a it's more it's richer, it's like fattier.

870
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,780
Yeah, yeah. A little fattier.

871
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,820
And Jason's been trying to eat fattier this year.

872
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,180
So does. Yes.

873
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,460
More dark meat. Yes.

874
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,340
More dark meat. More sodas.

875
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,700
Doctors orders more duck juice.

876
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,620
We're just drinking a sip.

877
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,180
I'm in every recording.

878
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,620
I'm drinking a big like bottle of duck juice.

879
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,380
You hear a slurp know that that's pure duck juice.

880
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,060
Got the double walls.

881
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:28,100
It stays cold. The double walled bottle.

882
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,140
I guess you want it hot unless you're doing it caffeinated.

883
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,700
Is a. Oh, yeah.

884
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,500
Too acidic. It's hot.

885
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,420
Is Logan Paul released a new duck flavored prime energy drink?

886
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,620
That might be. I don't know.

887
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,580
Yeah. Would you try?

888
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:46,100
Um, I I've tried some prime.

889
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,180
I've tried. Oh, you've tried.

890
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,220
I haven't tried. Have I tried prime?

891
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,700
I tried like the rocket pop flavor prime.

892
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,260
I've seen that.

893
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,180
It's delicious. It's like chemicals.

894
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:56,980
Why are you trying?

895
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,380
You're trying Logan's Logan Paul's energy drink.

896
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,820
He is. He is.

897
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,940
I don't think I tried it because I bought it.

898
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,060
Somebody maybe offered it to me or maybe I haven't tried it.

899
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,860
I miss or maybe I'm remembering mundane situation.

900
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:17,580
Maybe I've tried it because it was offered to me or Jason brought me a prime.

901
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,340
That's what it was. Oh, I bought you some.

902
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:22,340
Bought me a. I bought you some prime and some Zoa.

903
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,580
And now because of what's happened recently on the show where there's been

904
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:29,100
a couple of times where you have said that you only wanted to buy one,

905
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,460
but you were forced to buy a few.

906
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:34,780
I'm wondering maybe if you were forced to buy multiple primes that those

907
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:39,020
I think I picked up at a liquor store where, like, they just have individual.

908
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,820
I'm wondering if every gift you have ever given me was just because they

909
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,540
force you to buy more than one.

910
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:47,420
This is me. I have clocked that there has been two things recently

911
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:51,300
where you give us a gift and then said you had to get it because there were.

912
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,780
It happened twice in the last couple of months.

913
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,580
Oh, wow. A gift. Oh, wait.

914
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,540
The markers were forced.

915
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,860
The markers and the markers.

916
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,140
I just wanted to share the markers.

917
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,300
Oh, I thought you had to buy more than one.

918
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,820
You do. Yeah, there it is.

919
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,220
Well, no, it was a box.

920
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,140
I ended up with a box of them that I wanted to share.

921
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,100
But if you had the option to buy just one.

922
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,740
No, you didn't have the option.

923
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,380
You wanted that. That's what I'm saying.

924
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,060
Yeah. Yeah.

925
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,780
If you had been able to buy just one of the pens and just one of the noisemakers,

926
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,460
I think you would have bought just one.

927
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,140
Yeah, of course.

928
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,180
I mean, I wouldn't spread it around.

929
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:28,780
I wanted to have some fun, you know.

930
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,220
Well, we know that. We believe you.

931
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,700
We believe you.

932
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,100
So I don't know. I've lost my place.

933
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,660
This is one of the pictures that's on a couple of different pieces of merchandise

934
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:41,820
that I really like is this Donald with like kind of a furry cape.

935
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:45,180
And he's holding his trophies and he's just on cloud nine.

936
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,660
He looks he's elated.

937
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,220
And it's like a very comic strip style.

938
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,540
Well, do you like seeing him get some wins?

939
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,860
Is that what I think on some level it is?

940
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,580
It's it's the same thing where like

941
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,740
the Trix rabbit or the Lucky Charms guy is a kid.

942
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,980
I always wanted them to get the series like the whole bit was generally that.

943
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,060
Or was it the Lucky Charms guys bit?

944
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,420
He couldn't get it.

945
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,580
The Trix rabbit couldn't get it.

946
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,620
Lucky Charms guy was giving it out.

947
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,300
Lucky Charms guy, as we all know him.

948
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,340
Lucky that Lucky Charms guy.

949
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,180
The leprechaun.

950
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,660
So Trix rabbit specifically, because they had a contest where like kids would vote.

951
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,060
Do you want to give this rabbit his cereal?

952
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,500
And I was like, yeah, of course,

953
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,620
because it was so frustrating to me that he wasn't allowed to have a cereal.

954
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:33,420
So when Donald usually loses, it's funny to watch him get frustrated.

955
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:37,060
So it is like, oh, like, did it become like Jim and Pam where the

956
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:41,780
the show got a little worse after they finally gave the Trix rabbit cereal?

957
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,420
Right. But I didn't know you lost that under the underlying tension.

958
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,300
If I was a kid watching the office, of course, I wanted Jim and Pam to get together.

959
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,580
I wouldn't have known that that was going to sort of take the wind out of the whole show.

960
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,500
I didn't know that. Yeah.

961
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,340
I was naive.

962
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,220
We have a rabbit running around who wants cereal.

963
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:59,740
That's like something that would come from the twisted mind of John Krasinski.

964
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,860
Only his crazy imagination can conjure such a thing. Right.

965
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:11,420
If if only if you could think of something that crazy.

966
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:16,860
Yeah. So I think part of it is that Donald is a perpetual loser,

967
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,740
which is what's fun and relatable about him, I suppose,

968
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,820
if we're really breaking it down here for deconstructing him.

969
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:27,660
But yes, he this is a time for him to win and for all his friends to get behind him.

970
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:29,620
And it's fun.

971
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,300
It's it's nice because all the other characters get wins.

972
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,620
Even I mean, Goofy gets his ass kicked a lot.

973
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:38,660
But I feel like Goofy gets more wins than even in the sports things

974
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,060
where there's a lot of calamities.

975
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:43,980
Maybe, you know, maybe he ends up eating ice cream while in traction.

976
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,020
You know, right.

977
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,380
There's there tends to be a happy.

978
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:50,140
But you're more likely to leave Donald in a situation like we see in the desserts

979
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,740
and the food. Yeah. His seat is stuck in something.

980
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,500
Right. Going back.

981
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,940
And you yeah, we're for once, you know,

982
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:02,300
giving him a happy note to go out on before they retire the character forever.

983
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,500
The plan after this.

984
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,700
Yeah, they're retiring.

985
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,140
This is a good buy to Donald.

986
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,460
They're retiring all of the. All of them. Yeah.

987
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,380
I'm making sure I'm retiring to myself.

988
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,140
They've been here too long.

989
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,460
They're threatening my throne.

990
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,580
I'm going to move up a couple of C Lester's.

991
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,180
The Danny DeVito character from Hercules.

992
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,180
Danny DeVito from Hercules.

993
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,380
The Wizards of Waverly, please.

994
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,940
What do you mean they're adults now?

995
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,500
I don't give a shit. Make them kids again.

996
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,180
The book with the eye from Hocus Pocus.

997
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:37,100
He's going to be doing a lot more heavy lifting from now on.

998
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:41,060
Some character from one of those old point of vista pictures movies.

999
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:43,220
I don't know. Just find one.

1000
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,700
It doesn't matter. They're the big five now.

1001
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:50,140
Taylor Negron, the helper of the angels in the outfield.

1002
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,540
I know he passed away, but we'll be.

1003
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,660
It'll be a facsimile of him. Change the part.

1004
00:45:55,660 --> 00:46:00,220
Big five. Change the parking garage to reflect the new five.

1005
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,020
The levels will be.

1006
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:05,340
Four of them are skeletons from the skeleton dance.

1007
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,260
They'll do anything.

1008
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,940
Don't don't name them skeletons.

1009
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,180
Two, four, five and seven.

1010
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,780
They get cocky when they get names.

1011
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:18,300
They got to wear numbers because I get real fucking skeletons.

1012
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,620
You can't tell them apart.

1013
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:24,260
John Williams doesn't shut the fuck up since we called him Oma Tress.

1014
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,420
Oma Tress is number eight of the big eight.

1015
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,420
He's a new parking name.

1016
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,700
The new parking lot after him.

1017
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,740
Oh, my trash parking.

1018
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,980
Babu Frank is not involved.

1019
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,340
He jumped in Netflix. Too popular.

1020
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,380
Fucking too popular.

1021
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:45,060
An hour long special two seasons straight to series.

1022
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:49,220
This is like when Letterman put Tom Snyder after him.

1023
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,980
He didn't want him to overshadow him.

1024
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,300
He wanted something less.

1025
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,540
What a weak lead out.

1026
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,700
Send people to sleep.

1027
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,340
The so so they haven't announced.

1028
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:05,620
I was going to say, I don't think Pete is getting his own celebration,

1029
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,700
but I don't know that, actually, now that I say this out loud.

1030
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,740
Oh, he so I think it's he's in the parade.

1031
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,820
He is in the parade. Yeah, of course he is.

1032
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:15,500
At Tokyo Disneyland for the first time.

1033
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,260
Yeah. So you know what? Let's do this.

1034
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,940
Let's play the song.

1035
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:20,860
Oh, yeah. OK.

1036
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,740
Did you hear the song already, Scott?

1037
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,860
A little bit in just a bad shooting of the parade.

1038
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,340
I heard it in nice quality and beautiful quality.

1039
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:33,220
Uh huh. Yes. So this is a big part of why I like this.

1040
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:36,500
I just like an original song theme park exclusive song.

1041
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,140
Yeah. And there there's you before we hear it.

1042
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,940
Would you as you've called many pieces of theme park music,

1043
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,180
would you call this cool?

1044
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,460
That's a good question.

1045
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:49,180
I guess I for theme park music, I would call it cool,

1046
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:54,100
but it reminds me very much of like kind of J-pop or city pop

1047
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,740
or whatever you would call it.

1048
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:58,700
The mini now the mini song, which I will play also,

1049
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,220
is much more even in that vein. OK.

1050
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:06,100
This has what I believe in American influence.

1051
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,780
And I'll see if you guys feel the same way about it,

1052
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,100
because there's sort of singing part.

1053
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,580
And then there's more of a rapping hip hop

1054
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,860
spoken word type of section.

1055
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,540
And it reminds me of a certain individual.

1056
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:21,180
And I'll see if I'm crazy about it or see you crazy about that thought.

1057
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:47,020
More and.

1058
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,940
I'm gathering that they love Donald Duck.

1059
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,300
Yeah, here we go. Here's this part I'm talking about.

1060
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:38,540
So that to me feels very diverse, there's feels very pitbull to me.

1061
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,580
This is not I was if you had asked us to name it,

1062
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,580
I don't think we would ever we wouldn't have gotten there

1063
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:48,540
because Jason and I do not have pitbull on the brain as much as you do.

1064
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,300
Well, that's true.

1065
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,380
I'm not saying it's not part of why I think that is because I'm thinking

1066
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,940
about pitbull a few a few minutes during the day every day.

1067
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,220
I'm pretty familiar with pitbull.

1068
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:01,380
And Jason was insulted, by the way, that you said that.

1069
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,860
But I took you out of I don't know.

1070
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,860
I just don't seem to be the pitbull head that Mike is.

1071
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,260
Well, I know.

1072
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,100
No, I can't.

1073
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:12,500
I rarely leave the conversation to be about pitbull that wasn't about pitbull.

1074
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:16,580
I mean, the way this episode came about is I got in Mike's car one day

1075
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,700
and he started playing the song and he's like, you know what?

1076
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,820
This is Quacky Duck City.

1077
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:25,980
And and we talked about the pitbull ask influence.

1078
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:29,700
Yeah. Now, you were primed for this in the mix, though, that is low.

1079
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,620
I don't know why it feels like that should be a little bit louder

1080
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,660
to hear the lyrics about how crazy Donald is.

1081
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,940
And but I don't know.

1082
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:43,660
So that song to me is is cool for a Disney Park song.

1083
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:44,740
Mm hmm.

1084
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:47,500
Like I'm glad you there's a little bit of you backed it off.

1085
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,620
I backed it. Well, I usually say cool for Parks Music,

1086
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:54,220
which I called Mickey's Mix Magic Song cool for Parks Music.

1087
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:55,900
I don't think I said cool.

1088
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,300
I don't think I just like it.

1089
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:01,260
I think there's been some unqualified cool for songs that then you put on

1090
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:05,500
and like we're having a celebration today.

1091
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,260
Lots of magic.

1092
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,300
There's no I've never called this one of those songs where they're like

1093
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:14,940
magical wishes and dreams are like tape.

1094
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,580
But all it would take is if it was just that, sure.

1095
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,460
But if it had to, you would say, it's kind of cool.

1096
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,460
I think it's a little bit cool.

1097
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:25,700
Let me play Olivia Rodrigo a little bit, a little bit of pitbull.

1098
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,260
Let me play Minnie's Funderland, because this is much more like J Pop stuff.

1099
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:31,740
Cool or cool for theme music.

1100
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:36,740
Let me hear it again and let me assess in real time if it's cool.

1101
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:40,180
Maybe I will take off the cool for theme park music to say cool. Hold on.

1102
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:30,260
Like a lot of video game sound effects in there.

1103
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:45,500
We're gonna have to force that laptop out of your hands to get this song playing, aren't

1104
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,500
we?

1105
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,500
This file is 28 minutes long.

1106
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,500
You know what?

1107
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,500
I'll call it cool.

1108
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,500
I won't even qualify it.

1109
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,980
It's closer to what you're...

1110
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,300
Yeah, yeah.

1111
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:01,180
I wonder if the Quacky Duck City was made for the idea that maybe they could put it

1112
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,620
in the American parks somewhere, because they've done that before where they take music from

1113
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:07,700
Tokyo and use it elsewhere.

1114
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:11,300
Obviously, this one is much more in Japanese and very specific.

1115
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,300
Yeah, I don't think you can easily drop that in America.

1116
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,300
Yeah.

1117
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,580
Because it is Donald's 90th birthday.

1118
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,580
That is what...

1119
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,580
I don't even know if we...

1120
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:18,580
Did we say that?

1121
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,580
Yeah, you said it.

1122
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,580
They're half celebrate...

1123
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,580
They're kind of celebrating it in the parks here.

1124
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:26,540
There's a little merchandise area with some stuff, but they're obviously not going all

1125
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:27,540
out.

1126
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:28,540
You shouldn't even give them that credit.

1127
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:29,540
I know.

1128
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,540
That doesn't sound like a celebration to me.

1129
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,540
I'll edit that out, that I just said there.

1130
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,020
That's not even close to being Palooza-like.

1131
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:38,400
Yeah, but obviously Quacky Duck City much more like it's in English and maybe we'll hear

1132
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,400
it here and there.

1133
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,400
I don't know.

1134
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,400
I'm not sure.

1135
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,100
But this one, yeah, this is really...

1136
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,900
You go and hear a Japanese Disney song.

1137
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:52,380
In this one, yeah, this has level ups and power ups and it's good.

1138
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:54,180
It's just good.

1139
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,180
I don't know what to tell you.

1140
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,180
I can't even say anything else.

1141
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,180
I'm fine with it.

1142
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,180
I'm fine with it.

1143
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,180
Yeah.

1144
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:00,180
But are you...

1145
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,180
No, wait.

1146
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,180
Actually, I kind of glazed over something.

1147
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:03,180
Yeah.

1148
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,020
Do you just drive around and listen to these songs?

1149
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,940
That sounds like that's what was happening when you picked it.

1150
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:10,300
Or did you put it on because Jason was getting in the car?

1151
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,300
I think it was that.

1152
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,300
Okay.

1153
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,300
I don't think it was that.

1154
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,300
Oh, okay.

1155
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,300
Never mind.

1156
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,300
You just had Quacky Ducks.

1157
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,300
You were just blasting Quacky Ducks City.

1158
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:24,460
Now that I have a child, not the Mickey child, the human child, I use it as an excuse to

1159
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:26,100
play some of this stuff more often.

1160
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,100
I see.

1161
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,100
I have to be playing.

1162
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,100
Right.

1163
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,860
I listen to a lot more Chuck E. Cheese music now because I have a daughter.

1164
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,420
She's little and she likes it.

1165
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:35,420
Because of her.

1166
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:36,420
Yeah.

1167
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,740
So she likes the Quacky Ducks City song.

1168
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:41,580
She dances to Quacky Ducks City.

1169
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:45,900
You're not going to believe me when I say I haven't pushed this, but boy has my son latched

1170
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:51,220
on to a lot of Beach Boys and not even good Beach Boys, the people.

1171
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:54,020
He just got into one of the 90s ones.

1172
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,020
Wow.

1173
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,020
Lahaina Aloha.

1174
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,020
Well, you're playing it though.

1175
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,020
You have to take credit for this.

1176
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,020
I had it on.

1177
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,020
Yeah.

1178
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,020
But it was not put.

1179
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,020
I swear.

1180
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,020
I swear.

1181
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:06,580
None of these are put on in a way of like, hey, check this one out.

1182
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:13,540
Just I happen to be listening to admittedly terrible, early 90s Beach Boys and then he

1183
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:14,540
walks in.

1184
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:19,820
My daughter does latch on to stuff like she likes Can't Stop by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

1185
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:22,160
I didn't force her to like it.

1186
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,460
And there's plenty of like Wilco songs I've played that she didn't seem to be as into

1187
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,460
as Can't Stop.

1188
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:33,900
So it's not like it's not like I'm like you need to like Ashes of American Flags.

1189
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:34,900
You know, it doesn't work.

1190
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,740
It's what I'm saying is that doesn't work like that.

1191
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:39,620
We're obviously the reason you're hearing this.

1192
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:42,620
But the like when she dances to stuff, it's her own choice.

1193
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,020
I'm not moving her arms around.

1194
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,020
Yeah.

1195
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:49,220
Well, I can't get my son on board with any of Pet Sounds, but he did latch on to the

1196
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:54,860
song Santa's Got an Airplane, a Beach Boys Christmas song that was actually rejected

1197
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,540
by the record label in the 70s.

1198
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:58,680
That's how bad it is.

1199
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,340
Did it make it onto any?

1200
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,620
When did it finally come out?

1201
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:08,260
In some like, you know, Beach Boys CD collection, you know, in the 2000s when it's like, what

1202
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:09,260
else is in the vault?

1203
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:10,260
Right.

1204
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,260
We put out everything good.

1205
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:12,260
What else we got?

1206
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:13,260
We got an airplane.

1207
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,260
All right.

1208
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,460
We'll see if these fuckers will buy it.

1209
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:19,220
And I'm one of the fuckers and I do bought it.

1210
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,220
Yeah.

1211
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,780
And do you like Santa's Got an Airplane?

1212
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:22,780
I don't.

1213
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,780
I don't.

1214
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,860
I put that on because he likes airplanes.

1215
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:31,180
So now just year round in May, I got to listen to Santa's Got an Airplane.

1216
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,820
Yeah, I did it to myself.

1217
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:35,540
I am getting my Beach Boys Just Punishment.

1218
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:36,540
Right.

1219
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:37,540
Yeah.

1220
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:40,580
And then my wife is caught in the crosshairs who doesn't deserve any of this.

1221
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:45,180
Do you think you should take him to see the Mike Love Beach Boys?

1222
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:46,180
No, no.

1223
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,180
You don't think so?

1224
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,180
I don't think that would read.

1225
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,180
Really?

1226
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,180
Okay.

1227
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:53,980
Do you think you should take him to see S.E.A.?

1228
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,260
What?

1229
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:58,820
Do you think you should take him to the sea?

1230
00:56:58,820 --> 00:56:59,820
To see?

1231
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:00,820
Oh.

1232
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:01,820
What does he mean?

1233
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:02,820
The Society of Explorers?

1234
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:03,820
To the beach?

1235
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:04,820
Yes, he's been to the beach.

1236
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:05,820
Oh, okay.

1237
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:08,820
Why did you call it the S.E.A.?

1238
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:15,460
Well, you know, it might be more Jimmy Buffett like being, I don't know, who sings more about

1239
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:16,740
the beach and the sea?

1240
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,700
The Beach Boys or Jimmy Buffett?

1241
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:22,140
I don't think they're calling it the sea that often because they're the Beach Boys.

1242
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,140
They got to stay on.

1243
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,140
Yeah.

1244
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,140
They got to frame it as the beach.

1245
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,140
Right.

1246
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,140
Well, the S.E.A.

1247
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,140
He's been the S.E.A.

1248
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,140
Yeah.

1249
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,140
That's interesting.

1250
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:31,420
I think, well, you know what?

1251
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:35,300
What's good is like maybe he's not ready for it now, but in 10 years, you can take him

1252
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,660
to see the Mike Love Beach Boys.

1253
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:37,660
I know.

1254
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:39,820
I think I will still be able to.

1255
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:40,820
Right.

1256
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,420
And then he'll get it.

1257
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:43,420
It'll make sense.

1258
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:48,140
I don't feel great about Brian's current health and I don't know how much longer we got on

1259
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,300
Brian Mike, I think.

1260
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:56,060
But whatever it takes, Android parts, no matter how much Steve Harvey red light it takes to

1261
00:57:56,060 --> 00:58:01,220
get him, he will be, he will drop dead on stage at a hundred and maybe later.

1262
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:04,900
He'll be like Frankie Valli.

1263
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,340
I think Frankie Valli is doing his last show soon.

1264
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,020
Good.

1265
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,020
Good.

1266
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,420
Having watched some recent Frankie Valli, I forget if we've talked about this on the

1267
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:18,060
show, but I somehow got algorithmed a recent Frankie Valli performance in Las Vegas where

1268
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:20,020
he is Mr. Burns.

1269
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:21,900
His arms are hunched over.

1270
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:27,060
He walks like Mr. Burns when he performs Walk Like A Man.

1271
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:28,500
This needs to stop.

1272
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,500
Does he not?

1273
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,500
Well, and he's lip syncing.

1274
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,180
Whoever's making this happen, let him rest.

1275
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,180
He's lip syncing.

1276
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,180
Oh, yeah.

1277
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,300
He's not singing and it's in, yeah, Vegas.

1278
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:39,500
And I think I saw him maybe final performance, but maybe, I don't know.

1279
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:45,100
I fingers crossed not because I want him to, if anything, I want him to live a long happy

1280
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,460
life without having to do these same old songs.

1281
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,980
But when people stop, sometimes that's it for them.

1282
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:53,580
So maybe you're cursing him.

1283
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:56,980
Maybe you should do this show for another 10 until he's a hundred.

1284
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:59,660
Well, and we got to, we got to do the same thing.

1285
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:00,660
We got to be up there.

1286
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:05,460
We got to be out talking about seats and King Features Syndicate.

1287
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:12,340
Jason lip syncing lines about King Features Syndicate at a live show in 60 years.

1288
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,180
And I like Scramble.

1289
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:20,100
His mouth didn't even move.

1290
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:23,980
Trying to eat like Dagwood's sandwich, like, oh, isn't that funny?

1291
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:26,740
He's got a big sandwich and my jaw just falls off.

1292
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:28,540
Right in Stimpy Joke.

1293
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:32,180
Why did they bring out a curtain and put it in front of him right when he had to eat the

1294
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:34,180
sandwich and then it was gone almost instantly?

1295
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:37,380
Enough time for even a young man to eat a sandwich.

1296
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:41,580
We'll have young hosts, though, as well, too, to keep up like John Stamos of the show or

1297
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:42,580
something.

1298
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:43,580
Yeah.

1299
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,580
Well, yeah, just like seven anonymous.

1300
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:45,580
Yeah.

1301
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:46,580
Hosts.

1302
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,420
Guys who sort of look like us.

1303
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,220
Hawaiian shirts.

1304
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,940
And those guys haven't been born yet.

1305
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:52,940
Yeah.

1306
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:55,100
That's a thought.

1307
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:59,420
Listeners potential job opportunity for unborn children of yours.

1308
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:00,580
All right.

1309
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:05,420
The last thing, I guess, really, just to talk a little bit about the parade itself, which

1310
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:10,500
I guess is sort of the big, big piece, I suppose, of the whole event.

1311
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:16,100
And it's all the friends coming together to wear, yes, as we said, wear Donald's colors

1312
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:18,500
to celebrate him.

1313
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,300
And it's not as weird.

1314
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,860
I wish it was weirder like Mickey Mania.

1315
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:24,060
That's a criticism I might have.

1316
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,060
It is definitely not.

1317
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,060
Yeah.

1318
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:28,780
I mean, you've got your character across, so you've got everybody dressed like Donald

1319
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:35,140
and you've got like beautiful young women dressed in Donald Duck sailor suits, which

1320
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:37,140
made me feel very confused.

1321
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:38,140
Oh, yeah.

1322
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:39,140
There's all sorts of.

1323
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:43,340
And they have like I was just excited for the video to be over, so I don't have to ponder

1324
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,340
anything.

1325
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:49,980
It's a real dad, a real dad comment.

1326
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:55,180
And they have like big like kind of blue hair, like wigs, like very like I feel like Nickelodeon

1327
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:56,180
style.

1328
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:57,180
Buffon.

1329
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,180
Buffon.

1330
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:03,140
I guess that's that's kind of like a feather equivalent of hair.

1331
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:07,980
And they have is is yeah, there's a well, there's a couple different looks for the ladies.

1332
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:14,060
Some of them have the full seat and like yellow leggings and then a top hat as well.

1333
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:15,060
That's what you're talking about.

1334
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:16,060
Strangest.

1335
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,060
Oh, wow.

1336
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,060
Yeah.

1337
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:19,060
No.

1338
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:24,260
Buffon wigs get us into a territory that I well, it's because like your brain is reading

1339
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:28,780
it as the ladies are wearing little shorts, but they're really wearing Donald's feathers.

1340
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:30,060
Bright yellow duckling.

1341
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,060
Yeah.

1342
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:32,060
Yeah.

1343
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,300
So that's what your brain is to put this video in a closet.

1344
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,300
Your brain is getting confused.

1345
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:41,620
Your brain is getting confused with it because you want to celebrate your friend, but also

1346
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:44,220
you're a dad.

1347
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:47,380
So I don't know why dad has anything to do with it.

1348
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:50,900
Just I guess it doesn't have anything technically to do with it.

1349
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:54,780
It's just as we've talked about before, the dad at a theme park.

1350
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:59,420
Well, it's something dad's there and he's he's got a couple of things he likes air conditioning

1351
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:04,740
and there's like a nice looking lady and these are things that's what's happened.

1352
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:11,820
I mean, I guess I can't say a woman is attractive without it being a dad thing to say this comes

1353
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:12,820
from a dad.

1354
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:16,660
Well, but it was specifically about the ladies dressed as Donald Duck in a Disney parade.

1355
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:22,060
Yeah, I know, but I think I would have been as as weirded out by this when I was 23.

1356
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,060
All right.

1357
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:26,500
I don't think I don't think leave my child out of this observation.

1358
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:29,940
If you had been saying, you know, I was out at the club last night and there were some

1359
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:35,540
dynamite looking ladies or something, I would say, well, that's more of just a regular heterosexual

1360
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:37,020
man thing to say.

1361
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:41,060
But when you're talking about the ladies dressed as Donald, to me, it feels very dad comment.

1362
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:45,420
There would be no comment to make if it wasn't women dressed as Donald.

1363
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:47,060
Sure wouldn't have been a story.

1364
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:52,100
If my story was I was out at the club last night and I saw some fetching ladies.

1365
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,740
Why am I even saying that?

1366
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:54,940
What club are we talking about?

1367
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:55,940
I don't know.

1368
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:59,740
I'm just saying that the the Disney Park specific to me makes it feel like a dad.

1369
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:02,140
What I was watching, it was my job.

1370
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:07,400
My job today was to watch a video with some weird Donald costumes.

1371
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,980
That's just my feeling about it.

1372
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:09,980
Jason, I don't know.

1373
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:10,980
What do you feel about this?

1374
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:11,980
What do you feel?

1375
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:13,580
You don't have a kid.

1376
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:18,060
Did you did you have odd feeling seeing the ladies dressed as Donald with the leggings

1377
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,060
in the seat?

1378
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:25,380
Hey, look, we all got needs, even daddy's, you know, sidestepped that question that was

1379
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,660
not answered at all and it made it much creepier.

1380
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:31,260
I mean, I never called myself a daddy.

1381
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:34,380
I think the outfits look nice.

1382
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:35,380
I don't know.

1383
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:36,620
I think everyone looks fun.

1384
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:37,620
Neutral thing.

1385
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:38,620
Everyone does look fun.

1386
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:39,620
I agree.

1387
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:40,620
It was confusing.

1388
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:44,580
They looked attractive and they looked attractive in wardrobe that was Donald Duck.

1389
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:47,940
And then I was like, why that's why do I stand?

1390
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:50,060
I get what you're saying.

1391
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,060
Heard me out.

1392
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,060
I hear that.

1393
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:55,620
Let's let's let's move away then.

1394
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:56,620
Quack quack sticks.

1395
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:59,820
Well, we're still talking about the we could talk a little bit more about the parade or

1396
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:00,820
you want to know.

1397
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:01,820
You know what?

1398
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:02,820
Never mind.

1399
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:03,820
Who cares about the parade?

1400
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:04,820
Quack.

1401
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:05,820
We're talking quack quack sticks.

1402
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:09,220
Oh, I just didn't want you to forget quack quack sticks on the quack quack sticks.

1403
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,220
They're little parades.

1404
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:14,340
Little there are little sticks you shake.

1405
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:21,780
And it says and they make quack sound and says on Attractions magazine, Disney encourages

1406
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:28,620
guests to shake their quack quack sticks during performances of quacky celebration.

1407
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:29,620
Donald the legend.

1408
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:32,860
So I was out of the nightclub and I was, you know, just getting out there shaking my quack

1409
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:33,860
quack stick.

1410
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:37,980
I saw a couple of very fetching young that has nothing to do with being a dad.

1411
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:43,460
And you're really part of it, not supposed to shake your quack quack stick out in public

1412
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:48,260
or a private thing, but they're encouraging it in Tokyo, Disneyland.

1413
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:49,260
I don't know.

1414
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,260
I don't know.

1415
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:53,020
There's, you know, I don't know.

1416
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:54,020
I don't know what to say.

1417
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:55,020
Yeah.

1418
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,020
Scott's had a kid.

1419
01:04:56,020 --> 01:05:02,900
He still goes out to nightclubs and getting his quack quack stick wet.

1420
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:03,900
Maybe it means something else.

1421
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:04,900
I don't know.

1422
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,500
It means something else.

1423
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:07,500
That's for sure.

1424
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:12,820
Also, by the way, you wouldn't have found it weird if I was, if I was just telling you

1425
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:18,020
about going to a nightclub and looking at that's fine with a kid in that world.

1426
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:20,500
I would think it's a little weird because it's about a character.

1427
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:24,140
Would you think it was weird if the music they were playing was the music from Minnie's

1428
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:26,580
Thunderland, which is cool?

1429
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:29,460
I would think it was cool and weird.

1430
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,020
I would think it was both.

1431
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:35,420
Scott's a little weird, but also cool because he goes to that nightclub that plays Thunderland.

1432
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:36,420
Yeah.

1433
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:43,620
Did they exclusively play music that seems like it plays it with the end credits of anime?

1434
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:44,980
Or the first, the front credits.

1435
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:45,980
Or the opening credits.

1436
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:46,980
Yeah.

1437
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:47,980
Yeah.

1438
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:48,980
Mm hmm.

1439
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:49,980
There's, okay.

1440
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:50,980
Yeah.

1441
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:51,980
You want to go to merch?

1442
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:52,980
Let's do merch real quick.

1443
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:53,980
I don't know.

1444
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:54,980
You probably picked up the funniest merch.

1445
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:55,980
Honestly, Jason.

1446
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:56,980
Quack quack sticks.

1447
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:57,980
Quack quack sticks.

1448
01:05:57,980 --> 01:05:58,980
Yeah.

1449
01:05:58,980 --> 01:05:59,980
I mean, they got a lot of good plush.

1450
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:02,740
It's like all the merch at Tokyo Disney also is like they make a lot more like specific

1451
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:03,740
stuff for events.

1452
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:06,940
It's the same gripes I've had forever.

1453
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:07,940
They do.

1454
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:08,940
They have like little towel.

1455
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:09,940
You can get little towels.

1456
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:14,660
I feel like you can't get little towels here anymore.

1457
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:17,220
Like a dish towel?

1458
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:18,820
Like a decorative towel for the kitchen?

1459
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:19,820
Like a little hand towel.

1460
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:20,820
Yeah.

1461
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:21,820
Oh, okay.

1462
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:22,900
You can't really get, can you get a hand towel at Disneyland?

1463
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:27,980
I think you can get linens, but I don't know about souvenir, like a souvenir spoon, souvenir

1464
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:28,980
towel.

1465
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:29,980
When you say linens, you mean?

1466
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:33,620
Like, a nice napkin?

1467
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,020
Like towel sets, like towel sets or sheets.

1468
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:38,020
Oh, maybe.

1469
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:39,020
All right.

1470
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:40,020
Maybe you can do it then.

1471
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:43,060
I think some of those Disney spring stores have more like home goods sort of things.

1472
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:44,060
Oh, yeah.

1473
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:49,420
Disney Home, which we didn't cover because we had, it was after Downtown Disney Ordeal,

1474
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:50,420
I believe.

1475
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:51,420
Does anybody remember?

1476
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:52,420
I think so.

1477
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:53,420
Everybody's missing out.

1478
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:54,420
Everybody's missing out on Disney Home.

1479
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:55,420
It's never going to happen.

1480
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:56,420
We're never going to cover it.

1481
01:06:56,420 --> 01:07:00,900
So your complaint is you can't buy Disney hand towels in this country.

1482
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:02,180
A little washcloth.

1483
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:03,180
Tea towels.

1484
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:04,180
Tea towels.

1485
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:05,180
There you go.

1486
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:11,460
And there's just a lot, like there's, you can get a beret with, that's Donald's seat

1487
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,980
with his feet in the air, which is cute.

1488
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:17,100
I'm not wearing it, but it's cute.

1489
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,100
You don't think that's cute?

1490
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,100
I don't know.

1491
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:22,640
I think that, does he have a little hat?

1492
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,100
Is that like Donald's little hat?

1493
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,100
Well, he's got the like.

1494
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:26,100
His hat's like a hat.

1495
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:28,300
It's his hat with his seat on it.

1496
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,300
It's a butt hat.

1497
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:30,300
It's a seat hat.

1498
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:35,900
If Jason's, your knee jerk would have been, it's cute if you thought it was cute.

1499
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:36,900
Yeah.

1500
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:37,900
Yeah.

1501
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:38,900
No, he's right.

1502
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:39,900
Jason doesn't think.

1503
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:42,300
I think I was trying to figure out what kind of hat it was.

1504
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,580
Like if it was, if he's the best chef, maybe it was a toque.

1505
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:46,580
It was what?

1506
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:47,580
What's that?

1507
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:48,580
Is that the type of chef's hat?

1508
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:50,260
Those chef's hats are called toques.

1509
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:51,260
Are they really?

1510
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:52,260
I didn't know that.

1511
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:53,260
I believe so.

1512
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:54,260
Toque.

1513
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:55,260
How do you spell that?

1514
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:56,260
I am not sure.

1515
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:57,260
Canadian term?

1516
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:58,260
I didn't know that.

1517
01:07:58,260 --> 01:07:59,260
Toque.

1518
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:02,460
Well, he's the greatest chef and he has the greatest toque.

1519
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:04,420
Those can be like knit hats though.

1520
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:05,860
At least that's the Canadian.

1521
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:08,980
I mean, probably a chef's hat works for that, but.

1522
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:09,980
All right.

1523
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:14,020
Well, how long, we can, here's, here's what I'll say.

1524
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:20,780
Like I think that on this podcast, sometimes we need to celebrate each other more as well.

1525
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:25,420
So I think that we should, at least for in the future, we should celebrate Jason in a

1526
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:29,040
way, Jason the legend.

1527
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,880
And I don't know what city he wants us to sort of like brand the podcast, but I've talked

1528
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,080
about Jason month for a long time.

1529
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:38,680
And when we eventually do do Jason month, which we will, I would like to brand it in

1530
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:42,640
a way that mimics this Quacky Duck City.

1531
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,900
Can I just steal Quacky Duck City?

1532
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:45,900
Can I say my city?

1533
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:46,900
You could.

1534
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:49,240
Can you change one word at least?

1535
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:52,280
Quacky Duck.

1536
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,280
Quacky Jason City?

1537
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:56,040
Feels a little lazy to me, but.

1538
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,040
It's lazy.

1539
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,960
A lot of Jason might feel a little lazy.

1540
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:03,520
That's the spirit.

1541
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,560
So I'll come up with a song.

1542
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,720
I'm all for Jason month.

1543
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:11,000
If Jason chooses all the topics, does all the research and edits them all or I'll, I'll

1544
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
do that tomorrow.

1545
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,280
Let's do it next week.

1546
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,280
Oh, okay.

1547
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,440
Well, we'll, we'll, we'll be less on board with the Jason.

1548
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:20,840
We'll be in deep discussion about what Jason month means, and I'm not saying it's coming

1549
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:26,760
soon necessarily, but there will be a Quacky Duck City style song, original song for Jason

1550
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:27,760
month.

1551
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,000
I like that.

1552
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,400
And when it happens, composed by Jason and performed by Jason, correct?

1553
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,400
Yeah.

1554
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:34,400
Yeah.

1555
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:35,400
Great.

1556
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:36,400
All right.

1557
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:37,400
Whoa, whoa.

1558
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,400
We love Sheridan.

1559
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,400
Whoa.

1560
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,400
It sounds like he just recorded it.

1561
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,400
I think.

1562
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,400
Yeah.

1563
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:43,400
We'll just play it there.

1564
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,400
So eventually, yes.

1565
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,400
So that's what I kind of, that's the template.

1566
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,880
Quacky Duck City, I think is the template for Jason month.

1567
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,160
Could there be Mike Scott month?

1568
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,160
Yes.

1569
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:56,480
But the priority is Jason month and Jason's Quacky Jason City.

1570
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,440
People will be coming eventually.

1571
01:09:58,440 --> 01:09:59,440
I don't want to promise it.

1572
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,920
Why are you, why are you quacky though?

1573
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:11,920
Oh, I'm just always quacking up a storm, you know, I'm always grousing and quacking.

1574
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,080
I guess I see it.

1575
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,080
Yeah.

1576
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,080
I mean, I see it.

1577
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,960
I mean, it's, but it's up to, ultimately it's his wish fulfillment.

1578
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,960
We don't have to eat pasta that looks like Jason's seat, do we?

1579
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,440
If we, if he wants it, if he wants to do it.

1580
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:31,440
Now that's a month where it's okay to eat duck dishes, you know, it's not so morbid.

1581
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,440
Right.

1582
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:33,440
So there's going to be a lot of duck.

1583
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,360
So one of Jason's decrees is that we all eat a lot of duck.

1584
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,240
He wants us to eat a lot of duck, a lot of dark meat chicken.

1585
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,520
Let's get real sweaty with duck.

1586
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,520
No white meat.

1587
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,480
Right before and during all these records.

1588
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,480
Yeah.

1589
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:49,320
And we, and Jason, you will have to come up with a couple of dishes that will rival that

1590
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:54,360
weird omelet thing that is just like a hamburger patty on top of an omelet covered in salt.

1591
01:10:55,280 --> 01:11:03,120
Is it just like a, that looks more like loco moco, a Hawaiian, a Hawaiian dish with a hamburger

1592
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,000
patty and gravy.

1593
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,080
Maybe that is what it is.

1594
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,080
I guess.

1595
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,080
Seems like in that world.

1596
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,080
Yeah.

1597
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,080
Yeah.

1598
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,960
But you'll, you'll, you can make one of your pies, I guess, for Jason.

1599
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,240
Oh, I can make a pecan pie.

1600
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,240
Yep.

1601
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,240
Do you make pecan pies?

1602
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,240
I can't.

1603
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,240
Yeah, I have.

1604
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,240
That's his specialty.

1605
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,240
Yeah.

1606
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,240
Really?

1607
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:22,240
When was the last time you made a pecan pie?

1608
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,240
Not in a while.

1609
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,240
Not in a while.

1610
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,120
I have.

1611
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,120
Yeah.

1612
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,120
Really?

1613
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,120
How is it?

1614
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,120
It's good.

1615
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,120
Wow.

1616
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,120
And can you put little feet sticking out of it?

1617
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,120
Um, I think I could, man.

1618
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:38,000
I mean, I think I'd probably shape some of the pecans to just like make little feet.

1619
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,440
Or you could just buy two, you could just buy baby shoes and stick them.

1620
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,440
Oh yeah.

1621
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:43,440
Just want some baby.

1622
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,440
Either way.

1623
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:50,240
For sale, baby shoes worn in pie.

1624
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,240
Used in decorative pie.

1625
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,960
We'll be making that reference constantly.

1626
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:54,960
Yeah.

1627
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:55,960
Yeah.

1628
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:59,840
It's a really short story, so you can make it very easily.

1629
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,840
Well, eventually.

1630
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,600
I'm not saying it's this year.

1631
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,240
Maybe it's for our platinum celebration.

1632
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,240
I don't know.

1633
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:09,360
I don't know how long it'll take, but I would like to declare it.

1634
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,080
I would like to declare it here.

1635
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,600
It might take 68 years.

1636
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:17,740
We may do it when we're 90 and singing walk like a man.

1637
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:20,320
Our version of whatever that means.

1638
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,920
So yeah, I don't know.

1639
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,960
Any other thoughts on Quacky Duck City?

1640
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,600
I'm jealous.

1641
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,320
I wish we had Quacky Duck City here and I'm not going to get to see it.

1642
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:30,320
I don't think.

1643
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:34,280
I don't think I'm headed to Tokyo in the next three weeks.

1644
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:35,280
I don't know.

1645
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:39,160
Maybe, maybe if some like divine intervention happens and somebody like forces, I don't

1646
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:43,200
know the scenario where I have to go to Tokyo, literal hand of God picks you up and takes

1647
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,200
you there.

1648
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,200
Yeah.

1649
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,200
I wake up there.

1650
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,800
Somebody drugged me and took me on like a cargo ship.

1651
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:49,800
You're all for it.

1652
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:55,600
You would love to be drugged and dragged as long as you're planted in the middle of Donald's

1653
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,960
Quacky Duck City.

1654
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,760
Yeah, I would be freaked out and then I realize where I am and it's Quacky Duck City and I'm

1655
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:01,760
happy.

1656
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:07,280
Donald gets a trophy for best human trafficker.

1657
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,280
I guess we did it.

1658
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:09,280
I think we did it.

1659
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,280
Yeah.

1660
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,280

I don't know.

1665
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,360
I don't know if you do feel good.

1666
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,240
You hear you're also you also have this energy of sadness.

1667
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,360
Yeah, you started and ended sad.

1668
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,360
I'm upset.

1669
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,240
You said this is how it was going to go.

1670
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,640
I feel like you said like I called it.

1671
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:39,200
Yeah, you called like I'm just going to complain.

1672
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,760
We don't have this here.

1673
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:43,960
Yeah. Well, you recognize that it could happen.

1674
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,080
Didn't change your behavior.

1675
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,640
No, I leaned into it.

1676
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,760
In fact, it got worse because I did the episode.

1677
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,720
Wow. You know, you're supposed to have like talk like therapy and talk it out and stuff

1678
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:55,560
and it's supposed to make it better.

1679
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,560
Not this time.

1680
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:01,960
This made my feelings worse and it will cast a shadow over the rest of my day and maybe

1681
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:03,760
weak. Yeah.

1682
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,480
So I want to listeners, I hope you have a better week than Mike does.

1683
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:10,680
Yeah, I hope you do, too, because it's going to be bleak.
