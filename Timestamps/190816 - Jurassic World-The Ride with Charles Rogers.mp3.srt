1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Warning.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
They put up screens.

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
They put up a tiki bar with fun drinks.

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
They were so preoccupied with whether or not they could do an overlay of an old attraction,

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
they never stopped to think if they should.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Charles Rogers from Search Party joins us to question those who would play God.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's Jurassic World on Podcast The Ride.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,880
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the podcast hosted by three guys who wish they were all Owen Grady's,

11
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,240
but in reality are all Lowry Crothers.

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,080
I'm Mike Carlson.

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,960
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,000
Is Lowry Crothers BD Wong's character?

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,160
No, that's not right.

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,160
Also Scott Garner with me.

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,160
Lowry Crothers.

18
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,160
Oh, I know who it is.

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,160
Can I guess that Lowry Crothers hosts the auction in Fallen Kingdom?

20
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,160
No, incorrect.

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,160
We saw a toy of Lowry Crothers.

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:19,160
You know him as a co-creator of Search Party and from the podcast The Problem with Charles

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,160
and Casey.

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,160
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Charles Rogers.

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,160
Thank you for being here.

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,160
Can you answer the question?

27
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,160
To me, Lowry Crothers is Scatman Crothers.

28
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,160
And you're just talking about The Shining.

29
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
That's what I wish I was talking about.

30
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,160
Crothers is mental real estate for you.

31
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
I think I have it.

32
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,160
I think I know because you apologize for this joke.

33
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,160
Is that the lawyer who gets eaten on the toilet?

34
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,160
Not correct.

35
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,160
What?

36
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,160
It's got to be Jurassic World 3.

37
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,160
It's Jurassic World specific.

38
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,160
Lowry Crothers.

40
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,160
And not Fallen Kingdom.

41
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,160
No, no.

42
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,160
First one, Lowry Crothers.

43
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,160
It's who Judy Greer is divorcing.

44
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,160
No, that is all three of us though.

45
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,160
We are that type of gentleman.

46
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,160
Or her lawyer.

47
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,160
No, no, no, no.

48
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,160
Uh-huh.

49
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,160
Is it, do we see a toy of it?

50
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,160
Is there a toy of it?

51
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Oh, is it Jake Johnson?

52
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
Yes, there it is.

53
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
Okay.

54
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,160
He has a last name.

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,160
Yeah, Lowry Crothers.

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,160
By the way, it took me four websites to find the full name.

57
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,160
Not even the IMDB had it.

58
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,160
Yes, it does.

59
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
That's correct.

60
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
It said Lowry.

61
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,160
And then I finally found it was Lowry Crothers.

62
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,160
In a fan fiction site probably.

63
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,160
It might have been fan fiction.

64
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
He was having sex with other famous characters.

65
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
So yeah, that is who it was.

66
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:42,160
I think, I don't know if it's spelled the same, but there's a character, Mrs. Crothers, who is a teacher played by Marshall Wallace on Full House, who is after Uncle Joey.

67
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,160
Uh-huh.

68
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,160
Like she's, you know, kind of like a tacky woman who really wants to-

69
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
Oh, I remember that.

70
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,160
Grab Joey's ass essentially.

71
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,160
Tacky, sounds like she's horny.

72
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,160
I just mean like style-wise, she's very gaudy.

73
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
I see, I see.

74
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:05,160
And so maybe Mrs. Crothers from Full House is related to, is an aunt or something to Lowry Crothers, eventual operations employee of Jurassic World.

75
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,160
I think that's a good possibility.

76
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,160
I think so.

77
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,160
Full House really disrespected Uncle Joey's life.

78
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:18,160
Like he never had a real like job or he was always like available to be like playing the piano while the kids danced or something.

79
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,160
He was just the character that, it doesn't matter, no one's talking about this.

80
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

81
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,160
I know what you're saying.

82
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,160
Well, he'll hold it down and it's a showbiz career, which look, are not steady.

83
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
Yeah, that's right.

84
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
You know, it's a good lesson.

85
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
He's struggling.

86
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:36,160
You know, it should have been a lesson to all of us, just in case, like, hey, know that you could have a life like Joey where you're-

87
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
It's a cautionary tale.

88
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Yeah, yeah.

89
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:47,160
Maybe you win Star Search one day, but are a, you know, a kids show puppet host the next or just a drive time DJ.

90
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,160
All these are great jobs as I described them.

91
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
Yeah, that's true.

92
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,160
Even if he only holds them briefly.

93
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,160
I do think putting him in the basement sort of made Joey like lesser than.

94
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,160
Completely. They silenced the lambs, Tim.

95
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,160
Yeah, they locked him away.

96
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,160
They locked him away.

97
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,160
Did he move up to the attic later on?

98
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
That's Jesse. No, no, no.

99
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,160
Oh, Jesse.

100
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,160
And Becky.

101
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,160
Oh, Joey is the, yeah, he's the com- Yeah.

102
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,160
Yeah, they sort of made, they sort of made the house bigger.

103
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:20,160
Imagine, like, looking at that strip of houses in San Francisco and being like that many people, like that world is inside that house.

104
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,160
Like, there's like multiple levels of like marriages in this one house.

105
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,160
Yes, three entire families, lots of children, many, many children live in there.

106
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,160
And a point I'm always making.

107
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,160
Multiple generations.

108
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
Yeah, yeah.

109
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,160
And now today, if you include Fuller House, even more.

110
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,160
And the point I'm always making is how all of San Francisco's major media figures all live in that home.

111
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,160
It's true.

112
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:55,160
The two hosts of the most popular morning show, this Joey, a titan of various medias, and the, and Jesse, the singer of the most major band in San Francisco, and a nightclub owner.

113
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,160
Like how, in what it'd be like, I don't know what's an equivalent.

114
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:09,160
Like, you know, finding out that Al Roker lived in the same house as who's a big New York stand up.

115
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,160
Bill, Bill Bird.

116
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Yeah, it's basically a Bohemian Grove or something.

117
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,160
It's just a summit of powerful people.

118
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:28,160
Well, but on Fuller House, like the whole family is getting evicted by like some tech sociopath who really wants to tell you about fasting.

119
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,160
Really?

120
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,160
No, I don't know.

121
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
I would assume.

122
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:39,160
I also felt like bringing up Full House, we all apparently really wanted to talk about Full House.

123
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,160
I just was the other night.

124
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,160
I'm confident in that conversation from two days ago.

125
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
Oh, so you just did this.

126
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,160
I've just been in a Full House run.

127
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Yeah, I try to be as much as possible.

128
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
But what were you saying?

129
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,160
I was just saying it felt like Full House was brought up when you all like, we're like, yeah, let's talk about Full House.

130
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,160
Yeah, I'm happy to talk about that instead.

131
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,160
We got a letter from the government saying, hey, you've had a podcast for a little while now.

132
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,160
We noticed you hadn't talked about Full House much with your age and Democrat.

133
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,160
You really you have to.

134
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Sure.

135
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
Where our tax money goes.

136
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
Yes. Yeah, yeah.

137
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,160
We'd have to pay the penalty if we didn't talk about it.

138
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:20,160
I'm working on a think piece about why Kellyanne Conway is kind of like the Kimmy Gibbler of the Trump administration.

139
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
I think that's a good point.

140
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,160
Oh, mine is just called Stinky Feet.

141
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,160
Mine is called We're All Lori Laughlin.

142
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,160
Slash Lori Laughlin Innocent.

143
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,160
You're a Lori Truth or somebody.

144
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Well, there'll be a Patreon episode of some kind, I guess about the Smash Club.

145
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
I think that's a place.

146
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,160
That was Jesse's club where the Ripper would play.

147
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,160
That's where his evil cousin Stavros stole the money, which is maybe my favorite episode of television.

148
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,160
That's a good call.

149
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,160
Evil cousins always a good thing.

150
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,160
And also a nightclub that is always children's entertainment.

151
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
It's always elementary school fundraisers.

152
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
Right.

153
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,160
Little Richard and then those three cowgirl singing ladies.

154
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,160
Remember the three cowgirl singing ladies vaguely?

155
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
Yes.

156
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,160
They were on like peewee specials.

157
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Oh, right. Yeah.

158
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,160
That's if I forget their names.

159
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,160
I know I have looked up the names of the three girls singing ladies before.

160
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
Sure.

161
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,160
If anyone's yelling at their phone about this one.

162
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,160
Tell yourself.

163
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,160
Yeah, come on.

164
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,160
Useless info.

165
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,160
So, yeah, let's get out of the Full House talk.

166
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,160
Let's just get back into theme parks.

167
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
The topic of the show.

168
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,160
Yeah.

169
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,160
So, Charles, you contacted me a little while ago.

170
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,160
It seems like you're into this stuff.

171
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:43,160
We don't really we haven't talked too much, but let's like let's how how hard do you go in this theme park world?

172
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,160
You know, I have shame.

173
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,160
So the shame holds me back.

174
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,160
So we're here.

175
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,160
All aspects of life, but particularly here.

176
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,160
This is a place don't know shame here.

177
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
No shame.

178
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
Yeah, finally.

179
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,160
I'm finally free.

180
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,160
Open place.

181
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,160
Talk to me.

182
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,160
We are. Yeah, we roll in our own slop every episode.

183
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
That is what this is.

184
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,160
I think we're all filled with shame, but not about theme parks.

185
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
Yeah.

186
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
The only area we're confident in.

187
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
Yeah.

188
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,160
I mean, I love I love theme parks like I don't love all.

189
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,160
I don't like I wouldn't go to like Busch Gardens or something and like but I love like Disney and Universal.

190
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,160
Those are like I've always loved.

191
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,160
Right. So you like more the higher more highly themed experience maybe versus just roller coasters.

192
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
Yeah, I think so.

193
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,160
I think so.

194
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,160
And I like how Disney is.

195
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,160
I mean, I like the window into the past.

196
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:40,160
The Disney is like I think the best thing about it is like pirates or like haunted mansion.

197
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,160
Just being like, so this is what people wanted is entertainment in like the 50s and 60s.

198
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,160
And I get to still live through that like point of view.

199
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:59,160
It's so weird that that like nothing else is still intact like that in America where you can like enter a point of view about fantasy besides like watching movies or hearing music or something.

200
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,160
But like, yeah, it's still intact, which is cool.

201
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,160
But the past is racist, too.

202
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,160
So it's not it's not a purely good like nostalgia to have.

203
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,160
Things have happened in pirates.

204
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,160
But they've had is there's nothing racist going on.

205
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,160
Haunted Mansion is there.

206
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,160
I think there's I think they're fine.

207
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,160
Yes, unless it's true.

208
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
Ghost racism.

209
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
Yeah.

210
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,160
The lack of diversity, I guess.

211
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,160
It's all white.

212
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,160
They're all translucent.

213
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
Yeah.

214
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,160
So it's like a nice you have you ever been to Knott's?

215
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Because that's scary.

216
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,160
It's not scary.

217
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
Oh, nice.

218
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
Because like Knott's is older stuff even.

219
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,160
Yeah.

220
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:43,160
It is interesting to be like, yeah, everyone like this is basically the same as it was certain parts of it, the same as it was 50 years ago or 100.

221
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,160
Not this case, 7500 years ago.

222
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
Take your way.

223
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,160
It's hard for me to to like going to I just went to Universal on Sunday to a week ago to do the Jurassic World.

224
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,160
Right. And it's like hard for me to like accept changes in theme parks.

225
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Like I don't care about like any new IP like Fast and Furious.

226
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
I'm like, this is bad for the world.

227
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,160
Like Transformers is bad for the world.

228
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,160
Like so many things that I'm like, this is not like the right side of history culturally.

229
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,160
And I don't want that.

230
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,160
I don't know.

231
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,160
I have a hard time with like what's like the newest ride that you like.

232
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,160
I really liked I mean, I guess Jurassic World was a revamp, but I really I did really like it.

233
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
Yeah.

234
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,160
Yeah.

235
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
I liked it.

236
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
I like. Yeah, I like a lot, too.

237
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
I thought they did a lot of great stuff with it.

238
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,160
Yeah.

239
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,160
We'll get into.

240
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:41,160
I find I've said before how right like even if I don't like the franchise that a ride comes from so much, it's still like it can transcend property that I don't particularly love.

241
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,160
Fast and Furious, I don't think does.

242
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,160
It's bizarre.

243
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Yeah.

244
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
Ride is bizarre.

245
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,160
Like there's that party.

246
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Yes.

247
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,160
It starts with like a like a spring break party and then like the FBI is like, get out.

248
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,160
And then they like talk to you and they're like, you just witnessed something.

249
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
You're a witness.

250
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,160
And then you drive really fast and you're like, I have no idea what just happened.

251
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,160
Better synopsis than I could have done.

252
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
I have no idea.

253
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
I've done it twice and I'm trying to figure out what happens.

254
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
It's really over scripted.

255
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,160
I haven't done the version in Florida, but they adapted it for a standalone ride in Florida.

256
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
But I think it's the same.

257
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
It's just the same.

258
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
Does it make more sense?

259
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
I don't think so.

260
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
I'm not sure.

261
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,160
More elaborate.

262
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,160
Yeah, I'm not really sure.

263
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:29,160
I don't know why they weren't just like, oh yeah, this garage is usually just storage

264
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,160
for the part.

265
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,160
There's a party going on.

266
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Like they set up throughout the tour that like we've got a secret agent on the ride.

267
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,160
There's a lot of like, you're just being talked to in a pre video that you're in.

268
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,160
You're just like, I can't, I'm trying to listen, but I just can't.

269
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,160
Like everything is just washing over me.

270
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
I can't hear you.

271
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,160
There's a lot of modern rides that have a little too much plot.

272
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
That's probably the worst example of one.

273
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Yeah.

274
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,160
Like of like, just like I'm zoning out.

275
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
I don't know.

276
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,160
The Avatar ride in Florida, which is fantastic.

277
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
I haven't done that.

278
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,160
It's fantastic.

279
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,160
That being said, we're going to do it in October.

280
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
The plot.

281
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
Ooh.

282
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
Try to follow it.

283
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,160
Like explaining like we're going into a lab now.

284
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,160
We're going to take your like heat signature and what's going to happen now is you're going

285
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
to be scanned.

286
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,160
When you're going to be scanned, then you're going to put your body into an Avatar.

287
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
You're going to ride on the back of it.

288
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,160
And it's like just that's like a 10th of what it is.

289
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,160
And you're just like, I don't know what I'm so am I riding in the back of a monster?

290
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
Great.

291
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
That's all you need to know.

292
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
Back of a monster.

293
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,160
Great.

294
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,160
And I'm having fun.

295
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,160
Fantastic.

296
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,160
But like it's yeah, there's a need.

297
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,160
I think people want to like really like give them the experience.

298
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,160
Like most people are zoning out.

299
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
Right.

300
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
They're tired.

301
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
It's hot.

302
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
They're drunk.

303
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,160
Who knows?

304
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
Yeah.

305
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,160
Yeah.

306
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
I like Harry Potter.

307
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,160
I think the Harry Potter ride is great too.

308
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,160
Yeah.

309
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
It's really simple.

310
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
Open house day at the school.

311
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
Come in.

312
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,160
See everything.

313
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,160
Yeah.

314
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,160
Get changed.

315
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
And there's like when I just redid it and like Dumbledore tells you you're brave at the

316
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,160
end and you're like, I am brave.

317
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,160
And then I did the what's the other right.

318
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,160
The Transformers, which I have no like feelings about that franchise.

319
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
Yeah.

320
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
And at the end they're like, you're bravery.

321
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
And I'm like, fuck you.

322
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
Like I wasn't brave.

323
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
Like you don't know me.

324
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
It's like a totally different.

325
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,160
I didn't earn this compliment.

326
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
Talk about this.

327
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,160
Mike loves this.

328
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
I love.

329
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
Yes.

330
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
I love when a character.

331
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,160
Doesn't matter if I like the character or not.

332
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
It tells me I did a good job.

333
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,160
Yeah.

334
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,160
It just feels good.

335
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,160
It feels good.

336
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
Because Optimus Prime, which you're talking about on that Transformers ride.

337
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
And I as a kid, I was Ninja Turtles Ghostbuster kid.

338
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
Didn't care about Transformers.

339
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,160
But when he leans over and he goes, thank you for your bravery or whatever he says, I'm

340
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
like, it touches you.

341
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
It does.

342
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
It's like a nice.

343
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
I hear him telling me like who to vote for.

344
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,160
And I'm like, no, no.

345
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
Control this narrative.

346
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
I have agency in this story.

347
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
I can do shit.

348
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
I can do shit.

349
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,160
I can do shit.

350
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
I can do shit.

351
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
I can do shit.

352
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,160
I can do shit.

353
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,160
I just said R.

354
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,160
90% of your budget came from the Defense Department.

355
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
This makes me feel weird.

356
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,160
I mean, Michael Bay is my father is like really what he said.

357
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
Like I am.

358
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,160
I have a certain set of values.

359
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,160
That is the right to me.

360
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,160
But I overlook that when he just says, I just feel good, you know, whatever makes me feel

361
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
good, whatever makes me feel good.

362
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,160
Yeah.

363
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,160
But yeah, they got to pair these plots down.

364
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,160
It's got to be a little more.

365
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
You need a thing or no story.

366
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,160
Sort of there.

367
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,960
Yeah, it is to be like, you know, your big thunder mountain railroad is just like, it's

368
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
a wild ride.

369
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
Here you go.

370
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,960
It doesn't matter.

371
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,680
We don't need like justifications to be on rides.

372
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,400
It's like, yeah, the ride is the ride.

373
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,560
Like we don't need at some point the ride to change into another type of ride.

374
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,560
Yeah.

375
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,560
Jurassic world.

376
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,560
Pretty simple.

377
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,440
What they did with this ride, honestly, for me, squared the circle of the logic of the

378
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:42,360
Jurassic Park for it because that one you get knocked off course by a dinosaur and the

379
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
parks out.

380
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,400
This one you're just, oh no, the super smart killer dinosaur broke out.

381
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,160
You were on your path.

382
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,840
And then all of the warnings and everything are done in theme park style.

383
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,880
Like the Owen, Owen, hold on.

384
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,880
I wrote this, these names down and I think Scott, I saw you too.

385
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
Of course I got him.

386
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,680
Owen Grady and Claire Dearing, the characters we all know and love.

387
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,320
I said Owen at the top of the show.

388
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
But the full names, I can never remember the full one.

389
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
You did.

390
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
Yeah.

391
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
Okay.

392
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,160
Because who would ever miss an opportunity to say Owen Grady?

393
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,480
I say it all the time.

394
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,480
Just the thing I say.

395
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,120
So it's just like boy name, girl name, those two names.

396
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
Pretty much.

397
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,120
I don't like that.

398
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,560
Now, why is that?

399
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:34,160
Why do we think like, what's an example of a better, like why do we remember Dr. Grant

400
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,240
or whatever?

401
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
What's Dr. Grant's first name?

402
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
Alan.

403
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,240
Thank you.

404
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,960
Why does Alan Grant feel better than Owen Grady?

405
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,200
I trust the point of view of the people behind it more.

406
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:50,720
Like it's just like Jurassic Park deserves such a better franchise than it's gotten like

407
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,120
from the first movie on.

408
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,720
And that's always like, I'm really flawed history past the number one.

409
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
Yeah.

410
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
Well, I kind of like the sequel.

411
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Like, I kind of like the lost world.

412
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,640
I think that there's still like Spielberg in it and you can feel like you can feel like

413
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,480
the Spielberg glowing unconscious brain, like channeling in it.

414
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,680
But then like the third one is just like a comic book.

415
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,240
Like it's so paper thin.

416
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,200
And then the new ones are like so gendery and like, like he's, he's macho and she's

417
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,400
like an uptight high heel.

418
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,720
It's just like, what is the, like, yeah, she's a scientist who runs in heels.

419
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
Yeah.

420
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
Doesn't want to get, yeah.

421
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,760
She's like a bad aunt is the lesson she has to learn.

422
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,760
It's like, who cares if you're a bad aunt?

423
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,920
Like you like, that's not a real thing.

424
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,000
Like no one has ever like Aunt Claire isn't paying attention to it.

425
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,320
That's not an issue to overcome.

426
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
Expectations are pretty low.

427
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:52,800
It's like, yeah, she's like a very successful person running a theme park.

428
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,840
And she got you in for free.

429
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,440
Like in this, in, in falling kingdom, they very, those kids are gone.

430
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Boys are gone.

431
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,640
There is a kid which gets very complicated in it, but I did, I liked falling kingdom

432
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,720
just cause it pretty quickly became a haunted house movie.

433
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,200
And I think it was just a better director.

434
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,720
It's just the first thing, new thing that franchise has done too.

435
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,680
It's like, oh, now it's going to be in a house and there's an auction.

436
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,680
And I was like, okay, cool.

437
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,040
Like it's inventive again.

438
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:24,320
And I think Jurassic, the Jurassic franchises share like DNA with like men in black where

439
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,720
it's like, I like the world.

440
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,640
I like the reoccurring aesthetics.

441
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,640
Yeah.

442
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,960
Frank the pug, the dinosaurs, the neuro, the neuralyser, like I like all that stuff, but

443
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,120
sometimes the execution doesn't always nail it.

444
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,760
You can just really feel the studio first feeling and like the new ones where it's just

445
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,200
like a board of people making decisions and then sending people off to write.

446
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,160
And there's none of that like coming from an artist first version that the original

447
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
was.

448
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
Yeah.

449
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
Yeah.

450
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,880
I think stuff in there, like I think like the updated color schemes, which you see in

451
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,640
the ride, the blue and kind of silver and stuff that makes sense.

452
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,640
Yeah.

453
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,640
The ride makes a touches on a little of like the one, one of the things I did like for

454
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,400
Jurassic world of just like the idea of the park is open.

455
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Yeah.

456
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,880
Like the part, the people come to the park and they have to worry about attendance and

457
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
new attractions.

458
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,880
Yeah.

459
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,880
Right.

460
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,880
Yeah.

461
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,760
Like an attraction at a theme park that starts to break down.

462
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:32,840
They do a pretty good job of like, of not dismissing the originals too.

463
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,280
Like they, they'll like keep little like novelty things in the movies.

464
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,360
And like, I liked how they had like the old Raptor and then like the new Raptor, like

465
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,800
in some of the old animatronics in the ride, they were like slightly cleaned up, but like

466
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,200
still are kind of janky.

467
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,840
It's nice.

468
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,360
It's nice to like not eclipse the past completely.

469
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,280
It makes me like believe it's not all money.

470
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,280
Yeah.

471
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,280
Yeah.

472
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,280
Yeah.

473
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,800
Well, universal is like a little less.

474
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,960
We've said this many times, I think like universal less precious with their classics ride wise.

475
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,880
Like they will burn a ride down.

476
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,880
They'll burn ET down.

477
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
I know.

478
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,000
Like ET is like a magical iconic.

479
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,680
I mean, that's the only one where I'm really like just leave ET.

480
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,680
Why?

481
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,080
Is anybody that fond of revenge of the mummy?

482
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,080
Yeah, right.

483
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,280
It's like you didn't replace it with a really unpleasant.

484
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,280
Well, and it's like, I totally agree.

485
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,280
It's really caustic.

486
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,280
It's like not the full experience.

487
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
Right.

488
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
Yeah.

489
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
The Florida one is great.

490
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,160
And then this is so like blacklight in a like fun house way.

491
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,000
That's like, well, this doesn't really remind me of the movie at all.

492
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And it's like short.

493
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's like a minute short.

494
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's like a short version.

495
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,520
Like you're like, you go all in there.

496
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
I think I've said this before.

497
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,720
It like shoves my extremities inside them.

498
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,120
Like the seats are unpleasant.

499
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,120
Like I go inside of myself.

500
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,440
I'm not trying to be too graphic here, but it's horrible.

501
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,120
I'm a tall man and I'm saying in the seats, I have to like adjust so much.

502
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,120
Yeah.

503
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,600
And then I'm like freaked out because I'm already in there and that's yelling at me.

504
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
A mummy's yelling at me.

505
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Yeah.

506
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,520
And it's very, that are really close, but not in like, oh, I feel the heat.

507
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,520
It's like, I don't know.

508
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
That hurts.

509
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,400
I'm trying to get outside already.

510
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,600
I can't even.

511
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,240
I can't even adjust my pants as like those skeletons come down.

512
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,240
I'm like, I'm not ready.

513
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,760
And that's good to get another minute.

514
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,920
I will say if we're rebooting everything, bring back Brendan Fraser mummy.

515
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,920
I agree.

516
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
It's so good.

517
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,800
I just rewatched the original mummy and I think it's great.

518
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Yeah.

519
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
First one's great.

520
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,720
Second one has its moments.

521
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,720
I don't remember.

522
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
CGI doesn't hold up a lot of stuff.

523
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,160
And that doesn't hold up as well, but the first one's really fun.

524
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,560
Yeah, I love any movie where like they just like, like everyone in the original mummy

525
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,480
is just like, you know, the lost city of Hamunatra.

526
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,960
And it's like, why do you, why is that something everyone knows about?

527
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,160
Like, yeah, we all know in this world.

528
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,400
Do you know how to get there?

529
00:20:53,400 --> 00:21:00,240
That was my favorite search party episode too, where they go to the lost city.

530
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
Everyone knows what you're talking about.

531
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
Everyone in Brooklyn knows.

532
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,920
Turns out universal doesn't own Turner.

533
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,280
Who can keep track now?

534
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,280
Yeah, who owns what?

535
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,960
In a couple of years though, it'll all work itself out.

536
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,680
We all work for the company.

537
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,960
It's Coke.

538
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,320
We're all laughing, ha ha ha, cut to 20 years and that's a reality.

539
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,320
Yeah, that's true.

540
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,040
They should just lengthen.

541
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,160
Let's just lengthen the mummy, right?

542
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
Just give it the rest of it.

543
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,160
Yeah.

544
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,880
You know, don't take it because I think they would need to build a second sound.

545
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,400
I think they fit into whatever sound stage.

546
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Build a bigger one.

547
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,640
Well, they make it like you go to the end of the track and then you switch on to another

548
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,240
track and go in reverse and they try and convince you that you're still on the same track going

549
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,720
in reverse, right?

550
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,080
Because by the time you go back to the beginning, it's not like you're literally on the same

551
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,040
track the whole time.

552
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,240
I think that you go to the end of the ride.

553
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,240
No, no, no, no, no, no.

554
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,040
We're just trying to figure out what you're saying.

555
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,480
We are fascinated by tracks.

556
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,480
I was thinking about this.

557
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,800
I'm like, you go to the end of the track and then you stop and then you actually like switch

558
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,720
on to another track and go in reverse.

559
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
Right, right.

560
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,640
They convince you that it's the same track because it's all the same black light.

561
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,640
Oh, yeah, yeah.

562
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,280
You're trying to make you feel like you're going backwards because you're seeing the

563
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,280
same signage.

564
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,080
But of course it's a different.

565
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

566
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,080
Which I feel is like a waste of space.

567
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,600
Like I would have rather done just going.

568
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Yeah.

569
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,320
If they had twice as much track to play room to play with.

570
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,320
I see what you're saying.

571
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,960
You could have been a longer thing.

572
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,160
Yeah, that truly went just backwards.

573
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,960
The whole I'm sure it's a capacity only.

574
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,520
It's probably a capacity thing because they probably can write run to it once.

575
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,680
And this way they'd have to only you can only do one.

576
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,840
Yeah. But I see what you're saying.

577
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,400
Because it would be double different place.

578
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,400
That right. Like how do you have to end up in a different ending location?

579
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,240
Right. You need a different track to write.

580
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,080
You guys work for that.

581
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,720
You guys work for the money.

582
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,320
I wasn't trying to argue.

583
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,520
We're we're two kinds of people.

584
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,360
They would burn money for a few years of like when you got off,

585
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,160
there's all these mummies and one of them would be a person who would jump out at you.

586
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,160
Oh, well, like that's an actor you have to pay and rotate in and out in the exit.

587
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,880
There's like the mummies on pedestals and there's one or two empty pedestals

588
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,920
where like scare actors would be there.

589
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,920
That's fun.

590
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:33,120
Yeah, that's a real like final frontier of rides that isn't like like the human

591
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,480
participation on rides.

592
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,640
I feel like they've tried it at various times.

593
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,480
They was on Haunted Mansion, apparently.

594
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,760
Yeah. Oh, people would scare you.

595
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,520
Yeah. There would be like a person that would just like like in the suit of armor

596
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,400
or somebody else who would just like lunge in front of the cars.

597
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,880
And apparently I think somebody got punched.

598
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,200
And I think that's when they stopped.

599
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,640
I think a lot of people gotten punched that were scare actors.

600
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,160
That's probably a tradition among them.

601
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,360
A rite of passage, probably like some dad.

602
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,480
It's like, oh, I was working with somebody who told me a story

603
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,600
of being in like a Iowa corn maze or something where a guy jumped out

604
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,400
and then he really clocked him like to the hospital.

605
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,360
Oh, yeah. And then he's like immediately.

606
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,880
I didn't mean to. I don't.

607
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,120
It was just an impulse.

608
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,320
I'm not like trying to hurt anybody.

609
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,040
He was severely traumatized.

610
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,480
Every year at Halloween season, there's a new story.

611
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,360
This happened like so much.

612
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,440
I've been especially the smaller haunts where like people are just doing it

613
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,440
skin to their teeth, like just figuring it out.

614
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,560
They don't have the rules and regulations that Disney and Universal do.

615
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:41,440
I did a haunted house when I was like 15 and all of the performers took my pants off.

616
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,560
They pinned me to the ground.

617
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,560
What took my pants off?

618
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,880
What? I swear.

619
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,920
OK, I know.

620
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,080
I always tell this story and people are like, are you OK?

621
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,600
And I'm like, I think I'm fine.

622
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,640
I've been working through it.

623
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,000
I got back on and ran out.

624
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,400
That was the end of that.

625
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,960
Hmm. Was that a thing they probably did a lot?

626
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,840
I think that they were just like all other like 18 year olds

627
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,800
and like just were like trying new things every night.

628
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,040
Sure. Like they just got bored.

629
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,400
Where was it?

630
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,560
In Brownsville, Texas, on the border.

631
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,080
That is a common prank.

632
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,880
It's a high school prank. Right.

633
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,000
Removing pants, pants or pantsing, whatever you'd call it.

634
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,400
Sure. I'm scared already to be in a haunted house.

635
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,120
And that happens. Yeah.

636
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,560
Have you got let me ask a question.

637
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,160
Have you been pantsed or deep pantsed ever in high school?

638
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,520
No, no, no.

639
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,920
No, I don't. Yes.

640
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,520
Oh, no. What happened?

641
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,600
Gym class.

642
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,080
I believe Tony Young sang his name.

643
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,680
I think Tony Young, who I liked,

644
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,480
ran up to me and pulled my pants down, my gym shorts down.

645
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,800
And I believe it was he pulled everything as well.

646
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,200
I remember I'm just on the track.

647
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,080
It was gym class.

648
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,440
So for whatever reason, the stakes felt less.

649
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,360
Yeah, it wasn't like in the hallway or anything.

650
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,320
But I was like pantsless for two seconds.

651
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,160
I couldn't pull them up.

652
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,560
My hands are floppy.

653
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,760
They won't pull the pants back up.

654
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,600
So yeah, it happened.

655
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,720
Closeted high school.

656
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,160
That would have been like my Christmas day.

657
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,480
Getting to see another point deep pants.

658
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,560
That would have been like forever remembering that.

659
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,080
Mine was it was not.

660
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,720
I'm sure I just like looking like struggled.

661
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,480
And it was very unpleasant.

662
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,000
Yeah, nothing good about it.

663
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,440
You from Texas? Yeah.

664
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,000
What was the where the theme parks growing up?

665
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,960
Well, six flags over Texas.

666
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,320
Exactly. I went to that a lot.

667
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,040
And my mom went to that as a kid.

668
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,600
And that was the first six flags.

669
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,000
And first of all, the first of all, because like,

670
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,200
I mean, you guys probably know this, but like six flags is because there were six

671
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,240
flags of Texas, like they're different.

672
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,200
OK, like ruling one of the ruling empires of ruling and conquered

673
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,200
different kingdoms.

674
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,680
Confederate.

675
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,640
Probably. I think.

676
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,520
Yeah, it is.

677
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,800
Yes.

678
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,240
And and so like she went to it before it was like this national six flags chain.

679
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,560
It was just like six flags over Texas.

680
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,600
And then Fiesta, Texas is the other one I went to a lot.

681
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,200
And Schlitterbahn. You guys know what Schlitterbahn?

682
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,240
Yes. Yeah.

683
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,240
Schlitterbahn was a great in my memory.

684
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,400
You buy that like you're by the Bomega one, like the really great.

685
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,960
I mean, I traveled for it.

686
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,120
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

687
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,200
But then they open one up in where I grew up at South Padre Island,

688
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,880
which was like a beach destination.

689
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,520
And there was like the beachy one.

690
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,000
Yeah, it was jankier than it wasn't the magical like

691
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,640
the fully the you think you're actually in Austria or whatever.

692
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,360
Yeah. And it wasn't the criminal one in the Midwest.

693
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,720
Yeah. Someday I'll make it to the homeland.

694
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,000
So so yeah, it was like a kid like so you were going to these places,

695
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,680
but it was like, were you roller coaster?

696
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,560
Were you more like as a kid?

697
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,080
I was a Tilt-A-Whirl kid, but not a roller coaster kid.

698
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,520
Oh, that's rough. Tilt-A-Whirl is intense now.

699
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,200
I can't do spinning now.

700
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,400
Spinning and dropping are like, I can't do it.

701
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,280
But I was I think I was a roller coaster kid because I felt like I had

702
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,560
like in the same way that like my friends like I was like a part of like

703
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,040
a group of like boy, like skater boys from like through junior high

704
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,880
until like freshman year of high school.

705
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,600
It was a college until my mid 30s.

706
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,280
And and then like I started to be like, actually, this isn't my vibe.

707
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,520
And like, I kind of want to be friends with everybody and like the other

708
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,800
closeted kids who just were like kind of drawn to each other.

709
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,720
But like I so I felt like they all like slipknot and shit.

710
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,600
And I like and so I was just like, yeah, me too.

711
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,120
You know, and I didn't even know what I was saying.

712
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,000
So in the same way, we're like, yeah, we're going to ride roller coasters.

713
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,520
Like, I think I convinced myself that I love that.

714
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,160
But in my heart, I'm like, I mean, honestly, like I'm I'm like

715
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,360
like, what the fuck?

716
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,840
The people of tomorrow, what's the like the it's a great big.

717
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,840
So progress.

718
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,200
So progress. That's that's what I love.

719
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,840
Like, I love psychosis.

720
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,400
Like, I love the like the crazy like propaganda aspect of like Disneyland

721
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,600
that feels like Cold War and like in it.

722
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,640
So it's like, why is it still here?

723
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,320
And then in order to get all this stuff built, they have to include corporate

724
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,400
messaging, which can be sort of odd and nefarious.

725
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,440
And yeah, totally.

726
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,280
And like invisible to a lot of people who mostly are like,

727
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,720
that's a nice song and everything.

728
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,040
Yeah. Yeah.

729
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,880
Weird G.

730
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,040
Yeah, but by Pepsident and like. Right.

731
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,000
But then in an odd bit of postmodernism, a lot of those rides still around

732
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,800
with no sponsors or different sponsors. Right.

733
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,080
But like the heart of the way. Yeah, I know.

734
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,200
Or Epcot. I loved Epcot.

735
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,520
Like, I just loved anything that was like, this has a vision to it.

736
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,760
And I don't know why we're doing it, but like it's here.

737
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,920
And so it's just take advantage of it.

738
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,880
Really specific. Yeah.

739
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,640
No other theme park is nothing like, you know, we should do is gigantic

740
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,720
like steel pavilions about like the very general themes.

741
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,000
Right. And then the nations of the world.

742
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,680
We'll give it the worst title for a theme park ever

743
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,480
that no one even knows what it means.

744
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,680
Like no one can remember the environmental protection agency or whatever it is.

745
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,880
You can't.

746
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,560
Protection.

747
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,840
Yeah, it would.

748
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,600
I was going to say, though, because it's so it became it comes

749
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,640
around to being the best, though, in my mind, Epcot becomes the best title

750
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,520
because of. Yeah, right. Right.

751
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,320
Because it's just so specific.

752
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,480
It's funny, like because all that stuff in Epcot and everything, it's like

753
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,360
you're talking about like a comedian as a voice and like a show or what?

754
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,800
A Quentin Tarantino is a voice or whatever.

755
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,600
But it's like Epcot does have a voice.

756
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,760
There's a voice of classic Epcot that like that is what I feel like.

757
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,480
If you like it, that's what you're responding to.

758
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,360
You're like, I know this is so odd and specific and why the 80s?

759
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,160
Like, yeah, and all like this bizarre educational thing.

760
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,320
Edutainment, Edutainment.

761
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,240
Yeah, which is strange.

762
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,480
In a conflict that has hit all times.

763
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,200
Yeah, I mean, struggling with like that message being like, well, we decided

764
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,080
it's that's what it is. Yeah.

765
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,120
It'll be gone in five.

766
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,360
Like that vibe, I think for the most part will be any education contained.

767
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,400
And spaceship. Yeah, that's what I mean.

768
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,800
Spatial birth will still be that I think will still be.

769
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,520
That'll be probably the last.

770
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,960
Yeah. Vestige of old Epcot.

771
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,280
And everything else is going to be like some corporate sponsored,

772
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,480
like new computer thing.

773
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,480
This is where the living sees as Dr.

774
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,840
Strange's laboratory, Dr.

775
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,920
Strange's fish tank.

776
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,400
You're looking at his personal fish collection.

777
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,640
Yeah. Well, the Guardians' Coaster,

778
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,320
there's a building at Guardians of the Galaxy Coaster,

779
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,000
but it's supposed to be a nod to classic Epcot and at least in the line.

780
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,680
So you'll get a little of it.

781
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,880
But that to me is a sign.

782
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,080
It's like they are acknowledging lately that there is a voice like they're like,

783
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,680
not getting in touch with its roots again.

784
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,200
That is like they are.

785
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,880
And like putting little like Easter egg, like, like,

786
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,320
oh, you can kind of see those those ride emblems, like what our logo is based on.

787
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,360
Like they're incorporating those again, a little more.

788
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,040
That's true. And the color scheme.

789
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,200
Well, they're acknowledging it in ways that don't cost them a lot of money.

790
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,400
They're not building new rides to it, but they'll do a nighttime show about it.

791
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,760
They'll put it in cues.

792
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,440
They'll sell merchandise theme to it.

793
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,880
Yeah, we're suckers who will buy that stuff and we will buy it.

794
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,720
Yeah, yeah. Yes, absolutely.

795
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,640
So, yeah, there's there's yeah, it won't be gone completely.

796
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,880
I shouldn't say that, but it'll be it'll be a little hidden areas.

797
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,800
Well, how do you I mean, do you guys feel maybe you're not allowed to talk about this

798
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,000
because you're you're being treated so well by these companies?

799
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,840
Oh, no, but it's not doing great.

800
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:56,000
But like I just like I went to Disneyland, like maybe it was like a month ago.

801
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,880
Or like the Star Wars right had just opened in this land.

802
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,480
But I was like there's no way I was going to get in.

803
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,960
I didn't do any of the preparation for it.

804
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,960
I was like, I'm actually just going to Disneyland.

805
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,320
And but I just I feel like that should be in California.

806
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,080
Like it doesn't it feels sacrilegious to like all in California venture.

807
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,320
Yeah, I see.

808
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,600
It just feels like like I guess we just come to accept Disney as an ever changing

809
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,440
concept. But like, yeah, it's like, why are you like,

810
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,640
like just piecing in this like very new like financial feeling?

811
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,720
It just feels like a property that's like stuck on.

812
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,960
And it's like, oh, I feel like it should have just been like California

813
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,600
adventure should be like where you can just like throw whatever into and like

814
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,920
less precious and they can just which I think is what it is.

815
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,720
Like with with everything else, like all the Pixar stuff goes there.

816
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,960
Marvel goes there and it doesn't have to be as congruous.

817
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,680
Yeah, you're just saying.

818
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,520
And maybe in another world where they had more room over there.

819
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,840
That's what they would do.

820
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,440
Yeah, I mean, I could see maybe my justification would be, well,

821
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,680
if this is where the great tales live,

822
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,000
fairy tales, a bigger, it's a bigger property. Yeah.

823
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,480
It like like it's, you know, really one of the greats like, you know,

824
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,160
like modern stories.

825
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,000
So it does belong there or like that there already is Star Tours in Indiana

826
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,520
Jones. Yeah, that's true.

827
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,960
If we're talking about Lucas is the new Walt Disney.

828
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,000
Yeah, sure. Maybe.

829
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,880
And that of course, and that JJ and Rian Johnson are the new Walt Disney.

830
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,640
And a bunch of all those Trevor.

831
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,840
Trevor almost made it.

832
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,920
I don't know.

833
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,080
I have mixed feelings about him.

834
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,560
Walt Disney 3.0.

835
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,480
Colin Trevorrow.

836
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,280
Yeah, so serious.

837
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,240
I mean, we'll probably all meet him one day, but like he like.

838
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,680
We just look so serious from a distance.

839
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,280
We all we were hoping to ride the ride with him because we went to the press

840
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,880
event, but we thought him.

841
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,720
I should. I guess we should.

842
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,960
The three of us went to the opening event for it.

843
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,600
Yes. Yes.

844
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,200
Yes, we said we we were not originally invited.

845
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,640
We said I complain and I complained on this show, right?

846
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,680
I think. Yes.

847
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,960
Is that why you guys got?

848
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,240
No, I don't believe so.

849
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,200
No, I don't think anyone wants to hear us talk about anything.

850
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,400
A politely worded email.

851
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,600
I would be very impressed if any anyone's PR department is like

852
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,280
listening to us every week.

853
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,600
But maybe the main question of Edwin the dog.

854
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,200
Yeah, we're talking about Edwin.

855
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,480
What do they think? Do they like the plus ups or not?

856
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,960
Jason's hot dog eating like. Sure.

857
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,320
That's really what they're listening for.

858
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,000
Do they think the price point at Island New Bar is acceptable?

859
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,440
Very hard fish. Very hard.

860
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,520
Mahi Mahi.

861
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,680
There was a little hard as a rusty frost.

862
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,320
That guys didn't get sick, but not tender.

863
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,560
I like the pork. I had the pork pork.

864
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,440
The pork was good. Yeah, they were very happy.

865
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,920
Everybody there was like had the like new opening happiness to it.

866
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,160
Yeah. Although the Jurassic Park people felt happy to be.

867
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,920
The whole Jurassic World area, like redo area looks great.

868
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,920
Yeah. Yeah.

869
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,160
Elan New Bar is great.

870
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,160
We yeah, we we can't we didn't get a good like

871
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:05,760
regular person view of it because it was a it was a open bar.

872
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,760
We got to dinner.

873
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,480
So it was very nice.

874
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,360
By the skin of our teeth.

875
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,480
Oh, really? We're moving a little.

876
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,800
We took our time.

877
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,440
You did it at night, right? Yeah.

878
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,080
What was that like? That was probably fun.

879
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,240
It looks great at night.

880
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,080
I have to say the ride.

881
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,400
I've never been on the previous ride at night.

882
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,720
So yeah, yeah.

883
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,440
No iteration had I is pretty cool.

884
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,280
I got soaked. You guys get I was like I did it three times.

885
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,240
And what rose what rose the first and the last first last first.

886
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:33,840
That's why.

887
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,480
Oh, first I think you get soaked a little bit.

888
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,600
But the Moses like right off the bat, the like Moses oris just like soaks you.

889
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,840
It's like, all right.

890
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,800
Yes. Yes.

891
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,560
This is the first second I've been on this ride.

892
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,520
Yeah. Universal does not hold mind.

893
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,080
Yeah. The only thing that Disney does that's crazy is that second to last

894
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,000
splash mountain drop in the dark.

895
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,840
Yeah. In the dark.

896
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,200
That one, because the big one doesn't get you that crazy wet.

897
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,040
But that second to last one just literally slowly dumps 10 gallons into the log.

898
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,480
Yeah. And water in the dark is different than water in the light.

899
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,040
It feels different.

900
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,760
I mean, I want to argue with that.

901
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,760
Yeah. Like more nefarious.

902
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,000
You're in a flood or something.

903
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,880
But it's in what insects you're circling around the toilet.

904
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,600
Uh huh.

905
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,600
Yeah.

906
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,280
The splash mountain one, though, feels like because everything else is just like

907
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,760
a giant splash and oh, no, I'm really soaked.

908
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,440
And that one just feels like you're there's you're immediately wet.

909
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,160
You're immediately just like you fell into a bathtub.

910
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,240
That's totally different.

911
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,280
It comes over the side.

912
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,400
Yeah. It's your pants and universal.

913
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,400
Yeah. Universal in general, just more aggressive with their water.

914
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,080
Yeah. And I will give them credit.

915
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,240
I mean, we'll go we'll go back real quick to the press event, but that that first

916
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,920
effect that the Mosasaur like shoot, that is cool.

917
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,240
I will say I didn't see it coming like that.

918
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,160
Yeah, I didn't see it coming. Very impressive.

919
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,760
They kept like pushing the crack being a spray on the inside.

920
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,720
I was like, that's the thing.

921
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,000
And then I liked that. Yeah.

922
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,800
But you see it's like three elements and you see the Mosasaur pop up.

923
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,240
There's a music sting.

924
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,000
There is like the big the song, the Giacchino.

925
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,720
Jurassic World song.

926
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,760
And then you get hit by the water like simultaneously.

927
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,520
And I watched a bunch of ride throughs and it happens every time.

928
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,200
It's great. Yeah, I loved it.

929
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,880
And I love seeing those like big doors.

930
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,320
Like I didn't mind that it wasn't the Jurassic Park doors, that it was just

931
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,240
the like Jurassic World doors that have.

932
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:32,400
Sure.

933
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:32,800
Yes.

934
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,920
So great.

935
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,880
Or significant.

936
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,200
You're not.

937
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,760
Every level.

938
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,360
Yeah, emotions aren't.

939
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,320
And just like the wind dinosaurs ruled like everything about the very beginning.

940
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,040
I was like, oh, like I'm I'm I'm transcending.

941
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,920
I love this.

942
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,440
I think this is this is nice.

943
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:45,840
It's neat.

944
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,640
It looks good.

945
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,800
It's enclosed a little more so you see less of parking garages and hotels.

946
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,600
And that must have been some of the strategy that so that like that the grand reveal and

947
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,240
some people a lot of people don't like this redo.

948
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,360
And there's some of their point is like we used to get this big vista and the

949
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,400
Brontosaurus is there.

950
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,360
So I but you're right.

951
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,240
You also get parking garages and stuff that doesn't belong.

952
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,760
Well, and those dinosaur animatronics, the tall ones, the Ultra Sword age, they are

953
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,640
hit by sun and occasional rain and the elements.

954
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,400
They aged a lot over the years.

955
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,320
So tough for maybe some of the toughest theme park to keep up.

956
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
It was like welcome to Jurassic Park.

957
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,760
All of our dinosaurs are sick.

958
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,480
They're all dying.

959
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,080
The lysine issue that they have.

960
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,320
Welcome to.

961
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,920
But in terms of screen and screen, then you get hit by water.

962
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,960
This the Mosasaur aquarium is is great.

963
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,920
Yeah, so great.

964
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,400
The crack at the end is legitimately unnerving to me.

965
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,480
It's a real like you got to figure that out.

966
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,200
Jurassic World, if your Moses horse is cracking your tanks.

967
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,040
Yeah, that fast.

968
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,840
This is an indominus created situation.

969
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,200
It's just poor parking.

970
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,320
And then the problem becomes the indominus.

971
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,040
But wait a minute.

972
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,720
It's like there are problems.

973
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,640
We get a lot going on.

974
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,760
That's happening today.

975
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,760
Yeah, Carly Weisel in her write up, a past guest of the show,

976
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:20,000
said like this ride is is much more meta now of like the theme park

977
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,880
within a theme park element of it and like the ride breaking.

978
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,080
Stuff is going wrong.

979
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,240
Right.

980
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,120
This theme park.

981
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,560
Yeah, that's true.

982
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,040
Down to like the mural, the murals in Eastland or whatever the restaurants.

983
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,840
Is it the restaurant?

984
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,360
Is the Jurassic Cafe?

985
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,320
I think it's the restaurant.

986
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,160
The murals are like the T-Rex fighting the indominus.

987
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,920
And it's like, so your murals are like of the worst day your park has ever had.

988
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,440
Like you're just like immortalizing this 9-11 of theme parks.

989
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,480
Everyone died is forever on our cafe wall.

990
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,800
OK, the logic on that's a little not.

991
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,000
Not as bad.

992
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,040
No one.

993
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,840
Yeah, but it is worth the store eight, the indomitant.

994
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,640
Then how much money did it cost to make the indomitant?

995
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,440
So that's that's so much down like stocks.

996
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,600
Yeah, that's a disaster.

997
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:15,280
In the original narrative of the ride area, I would assume it's like the park is good.

998
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,040
It works like they're not trying to remind you of any disaster until you're on the ride,

999
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:24,320
which in the narrative is like you're experiencing for the first time the park going crazy.

1000
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,360
Whereas like Jurassic World, it's like the park goes crazy all the time.

1001
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,040
Yeah, you know what the drill is.

1002
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,840
Like, yeah, they're going to chomp at you.

1003
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:34,960
It's fine.

1004
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,960
Don't worry about it.

1005
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,200
Yeah.

1006
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,600
Are we where are we in the timeline in dress?

1007
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,720
It's sort of the experience of Jurassic World, I think.

1008
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:44,960
Yeah.

1009
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,080
The endominus is it like you're saying is it what we're experiencing to the events of the film?

1010
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,040
In the first film, they are about to open up the endominus.

1011
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,160
OK, I believe sponsored by Verizon, which is a funny theme park gag.

1012
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,400
Sure.

1013
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:05,760
But I'm saying is the ride the ride is taking place at that time?

1014
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,960
I think, yeah, because I mean the same day that that happens.

1015
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:09,760
Yeah.

1016
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,200
Yeah, maybe.

1017
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,440
I mean, the park is open for a while in the movie for at least a few years.

1018
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:15,840
Right.

1019
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,880
Claire and Owen are there.

1020
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,000
Right.

1021
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,200
They've had a thing.

1022
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:19,360
Right.

1023
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:19,920
A brief thing.

1024
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,720
They've had their thing.

1025
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:20,880
Right.

1026
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,120
Yeah.

1027
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,200
Where are we in the timeline of their thing?

1028
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,680
It's sort of in an alternate timeline universe to the to the Jurassic World.

1029
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,640
Like it's kind of like somewhere in the movies.

1030
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:31,840
Yeah.

1031
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,000
BD Wong is in the Q video.

1032
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,240
Yeah.

1033
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,600
Which I didn't see.

1034
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:42,320
We got on the ride at the press event and we were given ponchos so we didn't get super wet.

1035
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:49,440
And then we went to like use the bathroom and then get more drinks and I made a dessert plate.

1036
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,840
And then we went to try to get back on the ride and they had already shut it down for the night.

1037
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,760
So we got on by the skin of our teeth.

1038
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,720
And then we were just hanging out in matching ponchos.

1039
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,000
Just hanging out in ponchos.

1040
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,800
They made us take a picture.

1041
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,040
Right.

1042
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,320
Because we look embarrassing.

1043
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,520
You guys are just having drinks in ponchos.

1044
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:05,680
Right.

1045
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,200
There wasn't like what are you doing?

1046
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,320
Why are you wearing that?

1047
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,680
And we're like we just got off the ride.

1048
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,160
We just got off.

1049
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,040
I felt a little sick.

1050
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,600
This is what you do.

1051
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,240
Yeah.

1052
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,200
We saw Colton Dunn, Superstars Colton Dunn who we know from UCB.

1053
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:17,760
He was there.

1054
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,560
And then we met some of the dinosaurs.

1055
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,280
Oh yeah.

1056
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,320
Blue was walking around.

1057
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,440
Julie had the Triceratops.

1058
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,840
Did you meet the blue or triceratops?

1059
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,080
No.

1060
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,200
There's a Triceratops?

1061
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:27,520
Yeah.

1062
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,240
I didn't know that.

1063
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:28,960
Very impressive.

1064
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,200
The walks around.

1065
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,000
I've seen blue like I went to Universal like a year ago and I feel like there was already

1066
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,720
maybe it wasn't blue but I saw Willow Smith watching blue last time I was there.

1067
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,040
Whoa.

1068
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,160
That's great.

1069
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,120
Wow.

1070
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:43,920
That's really good.

1071
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,280
Was there like a promotional?

1072
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:45,680
Jaden.

1073
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,800
I saw Jaden.

1074
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,520
Jaden Smith.

1075
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,000
Oh.

1076
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,800
And now we all lose.

1077
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,440
We're all like oh.

1078
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,080
No.

1079
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:50,720
No.

1080
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,840
Only Jaden.

1081
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,560
All right.

1082
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,080
She's got the better song that I like.

1083
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,360
That's yeah.

1084
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:55,680
Yeah.

1085
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,560
That's the only reason.

1086
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,200
That's where I land.

1087
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,240
I'm not against Jaden.

1088
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:58,560
Yeah.

1089
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,200
And yet look at the feel the energy drop.

1090
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:01,680
It sucked.

1091
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:01,840
Yeah.

1092
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,320
We sucked.

1093
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:02,880
Yeah.

1094
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,840
Goodnight everybody.

1095
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,400
Oh man.

1096
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,760
Let's think about Willow some more.

1097
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,000
Jaden has the cartoon.

1098
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,640
The Netflix.

1099
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:08,880
Yes.

1100
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,760
Jaden has a cartoon.

1101
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,480
He's a character.

1102
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,680
He's got the water company.

1103
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,200
The water company.

1104
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:13,600
Right.

1105
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,080
Oh right.

1106
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:14,960
The water company.

1107
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,760
Box water?

1108
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,320
Is that him?

1109
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,520
I didn't know he had a cartoon.

1110
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,800
I don't know if it's box water.

1111
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,760
It might be box water.

1112
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,640
It might be something else.

1113
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,880
There's a Jaden Smith cartoon.

1114
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,400
It's him and Vampire Weekend.

1115
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:26,720
What?

1116
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,200
Keening.

1117
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:28,880
Is that right?

1118
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,320
Keening and Jaden Smith are like.

1119
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:30,960
What are you talking about?

1120
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,240
Oh I know what you're talking about.

1121
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,680
It's like set in the future right?

1122
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,080
Yeah.

1123
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,320
Yeah.

1124
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:34,480
Yeah.

1125
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:34,720
Yeah.

1126
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,760
It's actually good right?

1127
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:35,920
Yeah.

1128
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,800
It's supposed to be good.

1129
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:36,960
Yeah.

1130
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,040
Yeah.

1131
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:37,680
Neo-Yokio.

1132
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,160
Neo-Yokio.

1133
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,240
I just went from being against it to liking it.

1134
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:40,960
Oh yeah.

1135
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,520
Huh.

1136
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:41,840
All right.

1137
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,680
Let me find this water company.

1138
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,160
I'm so sorry.

1139
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:44,880
I just need to do this.

1140
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:44,960
No.

1141
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,600
Yeah somebody was.

1142
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,800
Is there something like hoaxy about it that's funny?

1143
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,560
Just water is the company.

1144
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,120
Oh okay.

1145
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:51,840
Not box water.

1146
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,320
Not box.

1147
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:52,480
That's right.

1148
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,120
You get sprayed exclusively by just water on this ride.

1149
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:56,960
Drink it up.

1150
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,240
Sponsorship.

1151
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:58,480
Yeah.

1152
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,920
When that mosa sort of splashes you.

1153
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,160
I love the idea of a water ride that you're supposed to like drink as much of as you go through.

1154
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:04,480
Go.

1155
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:04,880
Hurry.

1156
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,240
Get electrolytes.

1157
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,840
Wow it's flavored water too so.

1158
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:10,880
All right.

1159
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,360
Look at this.

1160
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,240
I like honestly.

1161
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,120
I like the look of this.

1162
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:13,920
Uh huh.

1163
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,240
Yeah I've seen that.

1164
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:14,880
That's very pleasing.

1165
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,440
I've seen that water.

1166
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,200
Go to just water.com.

1167
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,680
Know what Mike's excited about.

1168
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,840
You won't be disappointed.

1169
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,080
No.

1170
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:23,760
But yeah.

1171
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,680
Wait wait dinosaurs.

1172
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,320
You saw blue.

1173
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,280
I saw like I thought I saw blue.

1174
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,320
I think it's.

1175
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,280
Blue's been walking around.

1176
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,800
They've had the blue puppet for a while.

1177
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,960
I don't have a huge allegiance to blue.

1178
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,280
Okay.

1179
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,680
But I liked the animatronic a lot in the in the like when you go up to the like the last part.

1180
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,960
I thought that was I don't know if you want to not skip to the end or what.

1181
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:46,480
We can jump around.

1182
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,120
I'm sorry if and around.

1183
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:47,920
The running animal.

1184
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,080
There's a running raptor in it.

1185
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,520
That is blue right.

1186
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,520
Yeah I think it's supposed to be blue.

1187
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,000
Yeah.

1188
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,600
It's kind of far from a distance.

1189
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:01,840
I mean that was one of the big the mosasaur and the new entry and then the within the building

1190
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:07,680
the t-rex habitat that all just used to be pipes and barrels and now it's filled with vegetation

1191
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,280
and moving animatronics.

1192
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:09,840
I love it.

1193
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,480
It's great.

1194
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,200
It was a good that I didn't know anything about so it was like such a big good surprise to like

1195
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,120
go up in there and be like oh like this should have been like it would the original was so 90.

1196
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:23,680
It was that like I remember there was like a video a sega version of Jurassic Park where like

1197
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,160
so much happened in like a pipes world and like there was that side of the 90s that was always

1198
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,400
trying to like put us in pipes world all the time and it's like it's just like that no one

1199
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,160
really wanted ever be in pipes world.

1200
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,640
That was the game where you could play as a raptor killing humans or you could play as

1201
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,320
Alan Grant with a gun.

1202
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:40,640
Yeah.

1203
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,120
Oh yeah.

1204
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:41,680
Walking around.

1205
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,760
And dying was always like ah, like fall.

1206
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,400
Do you know that in pipes worlds that there was a big I watched I did a ride through of

1207
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:55,360
the original ride and there's a pipe that says steam supply.

1208
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,040
Does what?

1209
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,920
The point of it was to corral their steam.

1210
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,080
Why do you need steam?

1211
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:08,880
The most generic like like anyone who has never thought of pipes just makes steam supply.

1212
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,120
Yeah.

1213
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,320
That's the first yeah.

1214
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,840
Why do they why are all these pipes around?

1215
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,960
What are they Gary?

1216
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,240
That's also one of those things though depending on the intention I either love it or I'm very

1217
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,120
confused by like.

1218
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,400
If it's like meta joke.

1219
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:20,720
Right.

1220
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,520
I love it.

1221
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,600
Steam supply is great but if it was just like I don't know pipe and steam supply you're like

1222
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,080
what is it?

1223
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,440
Yeah, it's a genius joke.

1224
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,680
Drip storage.

1225
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,120
It's where we keep all our drips.

1226
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,640
That's good too though.

1227
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,440
That's a funny.

1228
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,080
Yeah.

1229
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:34,400
Yeah.

1230
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,440
If that was the intention.

1231
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:41,520
There's some hydroelectric engineer listening to this going like you need steam you fools.

1232
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,840
You fools that was authentic.

1233
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,720
That's the one authentic.

1234
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,840
So we supply.

1235
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,080
Yeah.

1236
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,800
If Jurassic Park had a full enough steam supply they wouldn't have any problems.

1237
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,080
Beat it to those dinos.

1238
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:59,680
I do as like I don't really have like Jurassic World is like all it kind of does is like

1239
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,720
make me think of what I'd rather see like whenever like what I'd rather the movies be you

1240
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:12,240
know like but I agree I liked Fallen Kingdom more but like there just isn't like enough

1241
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,560
soul to Jurassic World but.

1242
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:20,800
It's not this so the story of being a good aunt doesn't pull you in.

1243
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,280
Yeah.

1244
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,040
Well none of the moments are like really lived in in the way that I want like in Jurassic

1245
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,760
Park like when they see the dinosaurs for the first time you're so with them and they're

1246
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,520
like emotional head space and it's like so you want to cry.

1247
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,400
It's so powerful.

1248
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,920
Well I think they tried to do that because remember they like and there was a lot of

1249
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,960
like stuff firing in my brain when they get on a monorail to go to Jurassic World and I'm like

1250
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,600
yes I like this and then the reveal right but it's so like CGI.

1251
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:56,960
It's to CGI and it's to all at once like you know you it's not through like all CGI shit now is so

1252
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,000
like I let's just see everything now and it's like but I want to see it through the character

1253
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:08,240
and those kids don't care like the kid the larger kid is like yeah bored it's like well that's I'm

1254
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,480
going to be bored like if your characters are bored I'll be bored like that's also a weird thing in

1255
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,720
the movie where it's like the one kid who's bored and it's like well there aren't dinosaur theme

1256
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,080
parks in every state.

1257
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,960
I know I know it's not like $15,000 to go.

1258
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,840
Yeah this is a high end thing where I think somebody would be at least like not on their

1259
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:30,720
phone when a giant water dinosaur eats another thing like yeah it's yeah it's like I don't know

1260
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,440
if the lot that was my thing with the movie was like just the logic of how everyone's acting

1261
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,560
makes sense like no yeah it's kind of like skipping ahead to a future that doesn't exist

1262
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:47,040
either in like I like that I like the idea of the gyrosphere but it's like that but that doesn't

1263
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,080
exist like you can't convince me that that exists.

1264
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:58,320
Like it's a gyrosphere and it's like no but what is that like unless we get the rumor of like

1265
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:02,800
an eventual gyrosphere ride yeah maybe maybe like that's a good thing.

1266
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,520
Imitate art.

1267
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,600
That has been there's a big announcement big announcement coming this week.

1268
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,800
Oh yeah that's right.

1269
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,720
Universal doing a press release at the Orlando Convention Center.

1270
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,520
It'll probably but this will probably be out by the time that happens.

1271
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,400
There's a big announcement Universal Orlando coming.

1272
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,360
Oh really?

1273
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,880
So we'll see if it's involved.

1274
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,080
What do you think it's going to be?

1275
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,600
Their new theme park.

1276
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,200
Oh we'll see if we're right or wrong.

1277
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,240
The fourth people will know.

1278
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,680
And like theme park inside Islands of Adventure or?

1279
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,040
No inside.

1280
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,080
Full another one.

1281
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,080
The next one after Islands of Adventure.

1282
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,120
It's called Fantastic.

1283
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,000
Third one.

1284
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,360
Their water park.

1285
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,600
I hate calling Volcano Bay the third park.

1286
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,480
I hate it.

1287
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:42,960
I hate it.

1288
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,080
It is not the third park.

1289
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:48,560
Scott Hollis we ask that's the only thing we've asked you to ever play ball on.

1290
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,440
What if I do this?

1291
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,480
What I get at this is I like I just have an emotional breakdown.

1292
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,600
Don't put me in a box.

1293
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,760
I really I basically like honestly and I feel like you guys do buy into the brand.

1294
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,840
You were like every time call it the fourth.

1295
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,720
Well it's because they.

1296
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,440
Fuck that child.

1297
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:05,840
All right.

1298
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,480
He didn't know.

1299
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,840
Charles didn't know what we were talking about.

1300
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,880
I was lost as hell.

1301
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,840
A whole new gate.

1302
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,760
A whole new gate at Universal Florida.

1303
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,040
That's the that's the big thing.

1304
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:15,920
What do you think it's going to be?

1305
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,040
Well there's a lot of.

1306
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,360
Well a lot of it's like half confirmed.

1307
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,200
We've got like there's articles for it.

1308
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,240
There's articles.

1309
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,080
Real quick in case listeners I'm sure I've said this before.

1310
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,280
Universal Monster Classic Monsterland.

1311
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,520
New like Crimes of Grindelwald land probably.

1312
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,440
Some bricks.

1313
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,840
How to Train Your Dragon I believe.

1314
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,800
Yeah how to train your dragon.

1315
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,280
And then.

1316
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,760
There's where you see Claire Dearing's penthouse apartments back in the mainland.

1317
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,280
It's just like Claire Dearing's life.

1318
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,760
You know there's a book that you like there's a like how I did it by Claire Dearing.

1319
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,640
There's a book.

1320
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:50,960
What?

1321
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,040
It's a paperback book.

1322
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,640
That is a thing because there's the book in the Ghostbusters.

1323
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,280
How to Answer Your Call the paranormal book.

1324
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,640
They made one.

1325
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,840
They made it for one.

1326
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,080
Wow I'd rather buy that like.

1327
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,600
Yeah like I saw like Bryce Dallas Howard's Instagram like a year and a half ago was just

1328
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:13,360
like her posing with the book being like so proud to be playing a scientist.

1329
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,760
Who is this for?

1330
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,720
An entire book of the Claire Dearing bed story.

1331
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:21,760
Wow.

1332
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,800
Oh I can't wait.

1333
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,120
That's it.

1334
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,000
I'm gonna buy copies for you guys.

1335
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,520
We're gonna do a Patreon episode about it for sure.

1336
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,240
That's our first book club book is the Claire Dearing.

1337
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:30,880
Yeah.

1338
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,160
Claire Dearing.

1339
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,600
That should be the new land.

1340
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,840
I think that's a great idea.

1341
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,480
Yeah yeah.

1342
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,960
I love the idea of the monster land but it won't be that.

1343
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,240
But I love that.

1344
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:45,920
That's still I'm optimistic about that being the case because it survived so many rumor cycles.

1345
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,120
So I would I wouldn't put a ton of money on it but I put some.

1346
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:53,840
But I'm disappointed in how I was so happy to see a Frankenstein and Universal Studios

1347
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,560
like walking around and I'm yeah I'm disappointed that they've kind of like

1348
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,320
like gotten rid of that.

1349
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,400
That's like I love like the old hot.

1350
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:06,880
I just feel like the park should feel like a continuum of like old to new not like just.

1351
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,080
Like Disney.

1352
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,440
Yeah like more so.

1353
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:09,680
Right.

1354
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:17,680
I think because the dark universe movies didn't work out the it could lead to the if the universal

1355
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:22,480
monsters are in this new Orlando park it could lead to it being better because the stock is so

1356
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:22,720
low.

1357
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,120
Yeah right.

1358
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,920
So they let Universal Creative have more fun with it.

1359
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:31,200
There's I mean there's promo art and I think like for sure the whole thing is whether or not they

1360
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,600
green light it the whole thing is designed there's like promo art of what looks like

1361
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,800
a Dracula's castle like e-ticket with all the monsters in it.

1362
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,440
I'm so excited.

1363
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,920
So there's a good chance.

1364
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,520
Because they all live in one castle together.

1365
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,880
I believe that's the case.

1366
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,920
I believe there is a.

1367
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,640
It's full house.

1368
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,520
Like full house.

1369
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,680
I knew we talked about it for a reason.

1370
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,560
All the major monster personalities all live in one house.

1371
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,480
Okay which one is the exhausting ventriloquist uncle.

1372
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,320
Oh was there.

1373
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,080
Which is it the invisible man.

1374
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,280
He's got a little mummy.

1375
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,320
Yeah it's a mummy.

1376
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:10,160
So supposedly like maybe a kooka arm Harry Potter ride vehicle through Dracula's castle.

1377
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,960
And it could be like legit like pretty scary but well again I'm not.

1378
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,600
So fun.

1379
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,280
That sounds like the greatest.

1380
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,120
But yeah we'll see.

1381
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:23,360
I'm hoping because they are supposed to be four worlds and the last one is.

1382
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,240
What am I forgetting Nintendo it's Nintendo.

1383
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,600
Oh it's not Jurassic World.

1384
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,720
There's rumors Jurassic World but there's also rumors that they're just going to

1385
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,560
expand out on building a new Jurassic Park coaster in Orlando now.

1386
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:35,520
Right.

1387
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:35,920
Blue.

1388
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,840
It's a coaster coaster though.

1389
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:42,000
It's a coaster it's not a job but there but there was a patent for that

1390
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,640
vehicle for the Jurassic World vehicle a while ago so.

1391
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:49,200
I don't understand coasters that are still supposed to be like within like the Hagrid

1392
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:53,840
or not but the hippogriff one and like I know it's like for kids but I don't understand like

1393
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,360
coasters that are like semi in that like I'd rather.

1394
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,280
Oh that was there for years and they kind of retro.

1395
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,000
Oh really.

1396
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,800
Yeah okay.

1397
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,960
What is it to them to the Harry Potter.

1398
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,280
I know where does it land in their brains.

1399
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,840
This is like a roller coaster next to their school.

1400
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,000
It's a hippo it's the flight of the hippogriff.

1401
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,520
That was that was called.

1402
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,600
And you see the flying it.

1403
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,960
Can you fly that in the movies.

1404
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:19,360
I forget.

1405
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,600
You're supposed to respect it.

1406
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,200
They do at some point right.

1407
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:23,840
I don't remember.

1408
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,000
Is it like the mighty Akron.

1409
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,880
Well you see it you go by the animatronic and it bows to you.

1410
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,520
They're constantly bowing to the hippogriff.

1411
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:36,560
Hippogriff is the character I know is the hippogriff that you see which is a great robot.

1412
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,240
Anyway we'll look into that.

1413
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,000
You're a great robot.

1414
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,520
That's what I say.

1415
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,240
You're very brave.

1416
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,320
I try to pay it back now sometimes.

1417
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,880
So when I see you're a great robot and you make me very happy.

1418
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,120
Try to bow to robots.

1419
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,120
This is the future when we all work for the company or have to compliment the robots.

1420
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:55,920
We will have to.

1421
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,440
Yes won't be a choice anymore.

1422
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,440
We all have to talk to Optimus Prime and see what a good robot is.

1423
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,080
But we started all this by saying by being at this premiere that we got to be in close

1424
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:10,080
proximity to Mr. Trevorrow Walt Disney 3.0 as I call him.

1425
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:10,720
What did you think.

1426
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:18,160
I just I felt I felt more creative having been in his having walked behind him creepily for 20

1427
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:18,560
steps.

1428
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:21,040
I felt I felt imbued by his really.

1429
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,560
Man he's a guy.

1430
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,040
We thought he was getting on the boat and we're like we got to get it.

1431
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,240
We were like trying to say that we rode dress.

1432
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:30,400
Yeah.

1433
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,000
We would buy the picture.

1434
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,640
Yeah.

1435
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,280
Yeah.

1436
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,640
But he was just leaving.

1437
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:39,200
I just feel like anytime I've seen it and if he ever hears this I'm really sorry.

1438
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:45,280
But like anytime I've seen him on it's like Spielberg has such levity and life and

1439
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,840
Trevor is so serious so self serious about Jurassic World and it's like this is Jurassic

1440
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:56,480
World like be fun like you're making a fun movie and like his smile like he only closed

1441
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:03,360
mouth smiles and pictures and and like he and it's it's like he's like everyone knows I'm King.

1442
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:03,760
Right.

1443
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,720
Like that's the vibe.

1444
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,200
I don't know.

1445
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,920
I'm like it makes me sad that that's like the owner of this franchise.

1446
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:14,960
You got to watch the making of book in Book of Henry feature to really understand.

1447
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,160
The joyful Trevor.

1448
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,280
It does explain so much.

1449
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,080
It explains.

1450
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,120
It is more yeah.

1451
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:21,680
Yeah.

1452
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,400
That's yeah.

1453
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,520
When you're dealing with a character like Sickleman and you can really.

1454
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,000
That's that's an exciting.

1455
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:28,720
Henry right.

1456
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:28,880
Yeah.

1457
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,200
Yeah.

1458
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,080
The villain is the bad character is named Sickleman.

1459
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,320
Is that Dean Norris?

1460
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:42,160
That's that is who wants to like touch kids and his brother is in charge of child services

1461
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:42,960
so he can get away.

1462
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,440
All right.

1463
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,800
That's really got to see it.

1464
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,920
I can't believe I haven't seen it.

1465
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,440
You have to everyone listening Book of Henry.

1466
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,760
We put those Twitter claps in between a Book of Henry.

1467
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,680
Is that supposed to say the Twitter claps out loud or are they not meant to be said out loud?

1468
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,720
No I think you have to clap.

1469
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,800
Is it on the word book?

1470
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,000
No it's after the word.

1471
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,040
It's after book of Henry.

1472
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,360
It's like what is now say it with me.

1473
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:13,520
But Henry it's like every Brooklyn comedian's trick now.

1474
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,400
No punch lines just claps.

1475
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,400
It's like and what is that book?

1476
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,240
It's always Book of Henry.

1477
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:25,280
What was this year's what was that one with McConaughey and Anne Hathaway that you're

1478
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,000
like you got us.

1479
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:26,800
Oh is it Serenity.

1480
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,440
Serenity.

1481
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,320
Yeah.

1482
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,360
Movie called Serenity.

1483
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:35,680
It's an exciting time because you don't get like most bad movies are pretty boring and

1484
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,040
it's rare that you get like holy shit that is fun front to back.

1485
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:41,520
Yeah.

1486
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:45,680
That is such a balls out nutso movie and Book of Henry was the one Serenity.

1487
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,400
Serenity.

1488
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:46,800
Yeah.

1489
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,200
Yeah.

1490
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:47,680
Good stuff.

1491
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,960
Was a good bad movie.

1492
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:49,840
It's the best.

1493
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,000
Yeah.

1494
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,960
It's so like oh you can get so tricked and any weird like you know every

1495
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:01,600
every sharkasaurus offshoot kind of movie it's usually so fucking boring or they know

1496
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,240
it's campy.

1497
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:06,160
Well that is the problem usually is like you know we're like we're just making a bad thing

1498
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,680
and it'll be funny because it's bad but it's like no no no no you want a sincere effort.

1499
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,320
Yeah.

1500
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,520
That's what makes it good.

1501
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:11,920
Right.

1502
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,160
Yeah.

1503
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:16,640
I thought Rampage would be a good like wind down like oh this would be a dumb action movie

1504
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,800
and I was just like oh no this is so.

1505
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,240
Like not even trying.

1506
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,960
This is yeah I was like oh this is bumming me out.

1507
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,760
What's the gorilla is it or an ape what's the monkey's name.

1508
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:28,400
Yeah I forget.

1509
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:28,800
George.

1510
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,440
I forget.

1511
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:29,920
George.

1512
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,200
Yeah I like George.

1513
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:31,920
George was good.

1514
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:38,160
I liked him but I I mean I just wanted to see the monsters from my friends from the old arcade

1515
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,600
game the old monsters we used to destroy the cities together.

1516
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,240
Hey folks podcast the rides live show is one week away.

1518
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:56,480
But not affiliated with it in any way and thank God because we don't want their baggage

1519
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,560
we don't want all the crap they're bringing to the table we're putting on our own show

1520
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:04,080
it's going to be bigger and better than whatever they're doing I don't know what it is but ours

1521
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:04,720
is going to be better.

1522
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:10,320
And also they denied us press passes so we will not be going to the convention unless some magical

1523
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:15,840
savior whisks free passes in our way because now the convention is sold out so we're not going to

1524
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:21,360
be at that convention but we will be at the Anaheim Hotel August 24th and we have a very

1528
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:36,160
It's going to be great whatever it is and way greater than what those stiff shirts over at the

1529
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,600
big convention center doing what they have to prove.

1544
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:43,920
presentation and he there was this odd assertion by a couple people that like the feat that you

1545
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:48,320
know people who grew up on Jurassic Park the ride will now get to bring their children to

1546
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:54,800
Jurassic World the ride and I which I don't is anyone going to I mean people will literally do

1547
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:59,760
that that is really like like son this was very important to me.

1548
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,400
It's also assuming we're going to start flume ride children at like 24 or two it's like yeah

1549
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,880
that's a little like scary yeah and we're in Los Angeles people take their time

1550
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,400
nobody's getting right through grandchildren ride.

1551
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:20,320
They also thanked two people well first off they shot Pyro off really close like that was great

1552
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:26,560
that way it was great but then they also thanked two people who could not be here tonight one of

1553
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:30,720
which is Steven Spielberg he's off making West Side Story right now and the other is Michael

1554
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,760
Crichton Michael he's away a few years ago.

1555
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,240
Yeah the dead one first he did the dead one first.

1556
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:44,400
Oh yeah yeah and then Spielberg he closed with the not deceased yes which made us feel when

1557
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,400
they said Spielberg you go is this is this how we're finding out that Spielberg died right.

1558
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:59,200
Trevor gives a ride opening yeah and like what he did when I was also like kind of surprised they

1559
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,400
brought up Crichton because I feel like they don't bring him up a lot and I feel like at the

1560
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,160
end of his life he was starting to get a little yeah became such a like a truth about like the

1561
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:11,120
truth about global warming right yeah yeah yeah yeah I just read Jurassic Park for that I never

1562
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:15,040
read any Crichton books and I never read Jurassic Park and I just read it like two or three months

1563
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:21,440
ago and it was and I was like oh this is Crichton that's interesting like he's like ideas it's so

1564
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:26,880
different from the movie and that like it's full of like all the ideas and the philosophy that gets

1565
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:31,200
spouted in the movie which I think makes the movie so good because by the time the dinosaurs

1566
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:36,480
attack you felt the weight of all the morality and stuff because they've just yeah right to death

1567
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:42,640
you're like oh I get it but then in the book it's sort of like the characters like emotional lives

1568
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:48,320
don't like work half and like there's this sub story about how like there's they know that there's

1569
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:53,600
raptors on a boat going to Costa Rica and like they need to get back to control to stop that

1570
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:58,080
boat yeah yeah and it's like no you're like fighting for your life and they like they would

1571
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:02,080
like almost die and then Dr. Grant would be like and we have to get back because we know that that

1572
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:06,560
boat has raptors and it's like um like I'm sure that like when they wrote the script there the

1573
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:09,680
first thing they were like let's cut the boat thing like that was confusing there's just a lot

1574
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:14,240
of like oh you wouldn't actually act that way like moments like in the book that every he was a

1575
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:20,560
strange guy characters die too right and stuff the lawyer is like a jacked up guy that survives in

1576
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:25,360
the book right and he's a cowardly man who gets eaten on the toilet but but I think Malcolm dies

1577
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:30,480
in the book he does it was such a hit they're like uh he survived he's back for lost world yeah and

1578
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,320
then in the boat and like lost world I think it's literally just like Malcolm comes in with a cane

1579
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:39,520
and he goes like rumors of my demise were greatly exaggerated yeah that's all they do and you're

1580
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:44,640
like okay it's an old adventure serial gag like the emperor that's what they're gonna do in

1581
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,160
and rise of skywalker

1582
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:56,000
yeah everyone I feel like everyone was unpleasant in the Jurassic Park book completely like there's

1583
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:01,600
so because you with so many great characters even Dr. Grant is like a lovable curmudgeon who

1584
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:07,280
doesn't like kids but of course he does like kids but everyone's just like mean and yeah like it's

1585
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:13,200
weird and Ellie's and I don't know Lex is like I don't like a kill Lex in the book like she's just

1586
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:17,920
always like I'm hungry yeah every day and then it was clearly like when they adapted it like

1587
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:24,480
I forget that guy's name that adapted it but David Kep is his name but he was like I wanted to not

1588
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:31,360
make Lex be like a bad role model for young girls like she is like they gave her the computer savvy

1589
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:37,440
and like right agency they made her smart they swapped ages I believe too I believe the boy was

1590
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:44,400
older in the book and then Hammond is a real piece of shit like a super capitalist yeah like

1591
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:49,600
a real asshole and they made him he's like reaming people out and he's BD Wong's character out at a

1592
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:55,040
certain point yeah and especially by the end of Fallen Kingdom they've elevated him as like the

1593
01:05:55,040 --> 01:06:02,160
moral core yeah of it so much and later we find out about his business partner James Cromwell who's

1594
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:08,400
just strange I think it's strange there's cloning starts to get involved and like they definitely

1595
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:13,680
would in the movie the first movie they were like Hammond is like Walt Disney right because or was

1596
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:19,920
he Santa no he was Santa Claus already right from now that was after what what year is it at 95 yeah

1597
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,560
that was post wait wait I do define when he becomes Santa Claus when he was in the movie

1598
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,560
Miracle on 34th Street

1599
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,560
I went to go to Jurassic World

1600
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,560
in the universe

1601
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,560
the ascendancy level

1602
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:36,560
the straight to TV special Christmas on Jurassic Park

1603
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,560
we went to Gandhi before all of this

1604
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,560
oh yeah right yeah and Chaplin

1605
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,560
right

1606
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:44,560
oh it's that right the same Attenborough

1607
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,560
Richard Attenborough

1608
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,560
and then how is he related to the brothers

1609
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,560
it's brothers the earth

1610
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,560
David Attenborough

1611
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:56,560
is there a director who's in close encounters

1612
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:00,560
oh that's um uh uh the French New Wave

1613
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:02,560
is it John Huston

1614
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,560
oh no no no is Truffaut

1615
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,560
yeah it's Truffaut yeah wow wow

1616
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:10,560
oh yeah okay uh yeah so big Spielberg history of great directors

1617
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:16,560
you can see in like behind the scenes stuff of Jurassic Park like Spielberg loved having Richard Attenborough there

1618
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:20,560
because he like respected him and he was always like he would like talk you can like tell he's like

1619
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:24,560
like they're actors that you have to like kind of like just keep happy and like just get along too

1620
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:30,560
yeah and then like and then he's like but you old dog like there's this like relationship between them

1621
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:36,560
sure yeah you know it's funny that how Jurassic Park I don't there probably was never a movie that had more

1622
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:44,560
how it was made interest surrounding it and that was sort of a peak era for Universal Studios

1623
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:50,560
like now people just don't care about how movies are made and it's all kind of like yeah it's green screen computers

1624
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:56,560
but like I feel like every scene that we know some detail or have seen some footage or some cool photo

1625
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:02,560
I think it makes sense that like if that was a height of people come to this place because they want to see how movies are made

1626
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:08,560
because you truly don't it's so confusing how Jurassic Park could have been made so complicated

1627
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:12,560
I miss those like lights camera magic shows that used to be on TV

1628
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:18,560
Discovery Channel kind of stuff yeah yeah yeah and they would get Hocus Pocus one yeah they was always in Twister

1629
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:26,560
Twister and Hocus Pocus were like and and Terminator 2 too was oh yeah yeah all of them and they all involved

1630
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:34,560
the abyss was always like those water globs oh yeah right right remember like doesn't it make you nostalgic for that time

1631
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:44,560
I know yeah movies are made oh yeah there's less love in things now like there's just less passion and less love and like every like

1632
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:54,560
movies don't even exist anymore it's really sad like well got easier it got easier yeah and everything is so corporately funded now

1633
01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:04,560
that like I always was but like there was more like a Tori's like feeling in Blockbusters like in the 90s like yeah and they're so original

1634
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:12,560
and concept and there's everything is like really derivative now it's like it's like it's upsetting to me and that but the nice thing about Jurassic World

1635
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:22,560
Ride was that I felt like I could appreciate what was new about the series and then like still have like an assurance that they didn't like

1636
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:30,560
forget why this whole series exists at the same time and there's still like Jurassic Park in its DNA it's the only thing keeping Jurassic World tethered

1637
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:37,560
and not the worst thing you've ever seen that there is yeah they are building on the core idea and there's respect for the original yeah film even as

1638
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:45,560
messy and strange as these movies are yeah and the ride doesn't stray from that you're dealing with like I think like these I don't know what

1639
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:55,560
Universal creative and then Imagineers like maybe you people didn't like the new Star Wars very much but like you can feel like in that land I do think like

1640
01:09:55,560 --> 01:10:05,560
you're like all these people really give a shit about the history of it and they're like real fans and like I feel you can feel that on the ride sometimes more you can feel it in the movies

1641
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:14,560
right for things so you can tell just from the pictures of the Star Wars land that it like brings you back to the thing you love that feeling yeah like so for sure and tells a new story

1642
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:25,560
takes you to a new place that they got to invent from whole cloth and you can tell how much love they did it with and one of the few subsects of the entertainment industry were like

1643
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:53,560
yeah Imagineering Universal creative has to think people are going to go on this for a decade plus it's not like a movie they live in for two hours the movie comes out in theaters it terminates on Blu-ray and streaming and at best we can hope people see it in the movies and on Blu-ray but like we have we're committing to an attraction or a land or something for probably 15 to 20 years

1644
01:10:53,560 --> 01:11:13,560
yeah yeah it's like a movie that's always playing in a theater somewhere yeah yeah so it has to they have to think about the long sustainability long game a little more than like when that T-Rex flings out at you at the end I was so overjoyed like I really was like oh I'm seven again like I'm so happy to be seven again

1645
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:43,560
last trip it was like oh yes this I really felt like I think they like updated how the T-Rex comes out at you it's like more impressive now so you mentioned this to me a week ago and I heard this again on another podcast and this I think it was one of Jim Hill's podcast yeah the final scene is not supposedly the real final scene it's a temporary scene wait in the ride in the ride oh and they're going to do something new so that it's going to be a little bit of a

1646
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:56,960
different story and that other dinosaur is in like is not the real animatronic because it's kind of limited movement it's just really moving its head and even in like the early rumors of this ride it was that you're supposed to get attacked by the

1647
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:26,960
and then the T-Rex comes out like it always does and like in the movies the T-Rex kind of states them yeah so I should I because so I what my first thought was like wow T-Rex is out early did you have the same experience the timing was perfect on the first perfect on the first one and then it was like off the second and then back on the first okay so he did come out like in a similar way that the initial original ride he kind of pops out right as you're going down yeah but I feel like he used to come down more and now

1648
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:56,960
he swings out but maybe I'm just imagining that I think he always had correctly I think he's had this wing out a little bit like this but then I think he would kind of dip down a little bit to be attached to see flying it's a good question his feet are on platforms I saw like the whole so like the whole body is like on some sort of like platform okay it's just that they're so far back that it kind of drops in a shot yeah he's standing on a pipe it's one of these I think I've said a front

1649
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:26,960
row though like last time I went on this front road like he pops out and it is scary it's so good it's great I mean it's great and he pops out so I'm always impressed by that but when we went on it correct me if I'm wrong it felt like T-Rex was outer ready and we were still 20 seconds from going down the hill I think that's right I thought his complaint was like so he had the same thing shock isn't there because he's out they have to get him out to have him interact with the indominus

1650
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:56,960
we held the second time we got held like there for like 10 seconds or something like and so then but it was like all off by the time we went right so it feels like right now what they're running is the indominus is like poking his like be mode head out but he's not getting close to you and then T-Rex has to come out earlier because he would technically eat you you know what I mean he has to come out earlier to stop whatever is going to happen before you get to

1651
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:15,840
the raft whereas I think what was at least pitched to what I've seen online was the idea is like you're going along you're pretty close to the end this giant thing comes out to get you and T-Rex comes out to save you where you get close to the other dinosaur and then T-Rex comes out and I don't know I assume they're not going to touch that would be insane.

1652
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:16,920
Oh yeah.

1653
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:18,380
I see me just.

1654
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:26,160
And if he doesn't show up the robot eats the raft.

1655
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:27,960
Right that's not going to be good.

1656
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:35,560
Everyone gets even on good but you're saying that there's some like bigger effects that we might say different robot is what I heard.

1657
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
So the indominus like attacks you.

1658
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:45,360
And yes you're one so in a future one supposedly it's a totally different indominus robot that is like bigger and can do and can reach out farther.

1659
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:52,680
Yeah come into the sea which makes a lot more sense because I saw that last scene I was like this is very cool I go but it sort of takes away that kind of scary thing.

1660
01:14:52,720 --> 01:15:06,560
Yeah because it's set up earlier in the ride that and this I thought was very cool because you used to be going towards hadris or cove and then get knocked off course this one the heightening you're just full on going to predator cove which is very funny.

1661
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,480
Predator in 2019 2019.

1662
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,000
No.

1663
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:24,960
Yes they had to put predator cove and be mode to after some court proceedings came up recently that kind of delayed it.

1664
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:30,800
But yeah all that whole scene it's just now covered in blood.

1665
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:31,680
I will say I like.

1666
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:32,720
The right.

1667
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:50,000
There was rumors of this thing being scarier which I think maybe the ending in the way it eventually will be will be scarier because I could see if it was as dark as the old one was and also flashed like a strobe dinosaur attacks you and then another dinosaur that would freak you out of on the first try.

1668
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:54,440
Yeah this was well lit and I was like oh I like the scene but here we go like.

1669
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:54,880
Right.

1670
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:01,600
It wasn't as shocking but I will say the there wasn't blood on the last ride so I give him credit for that.

1671
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,040
Yeah there was what do you mean.

1672
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:07,880
There's a like there's like a wall covered in blood like a whole wall covered in blood.

1673
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,800
But you know what I did see that.

1674
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:10,720
Wait you didn't see that.

1675
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:14,400
We know I'm seeing the old ride like a horror.

1676
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,960
But then I'm off in a corner you can kind of miss the blood.

1677
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:20,480
Yeah I did the second time but that Pteranodon or Pterodactyl.

1678
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,120
Yeah there's a there's a corpse of a Pterodactyl in that scene too.

1679
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,800
That just makes you like oh I can't wait to see him.

1680
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:28,360
Yes.

1681
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:28,880
Yeah.

1682
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,120
And it doesn't look very good.

1683
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:37,480
It's the one and it's like it looks really foamy like one like I like the idea of it but I was like I want this to look a little better.

1684
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:43,280
I think I think that I think that the aquarium scene is fantastic.

1685
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:48,000
Yeah we all agree on that and that gets you going like oh this is like oh this is a whole new thing.

1686
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,040
This this fucking rules.

1687
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:54,320
And then the set design of everything is really cool like in Predator Cove.

1688
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:59,360
But then you start to feel like I want to see more robots though.

1689
01:16:59,400 --> 01:16:59,640
Right.

1690
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:00,720
Where they all go.

1691
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:05,800
We I don't think he would mind us saying this Colton had a good plus up now we didn't ask him for it.

1692
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:09,520
But even there's that spot around Predator Cove where it feels a little quiet.

1693
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,280
It used to be where the truck or the Jeep would fall.

1694
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,280
Which hadn't worked for years.

1695
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:18,760
And like he was like he goes there should be a guy that like and there's an open and ominous Rex cage.

1696
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:23,080
He goes should be like a guy that runs out and he's like bloody and he's like oh god or whatever.

1697
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,720
I'm like that's pretty pretty good.

1698
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:27,360
Like humans on the rise if they could pull it off.

1699
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,720
Norman Bates run out to the tram every time.

1700
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:30,080
Right.

1701
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,960
We have a hot Norman Bates.

1702
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:33,400
Really.

1703
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:40,720
I hope he keeps booking because you have to get like I imagine they have to get a type because of the Anthony

1704
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:46,960
Perkins face and like he was you have to get a very specific like neat taken care of man.

1705
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,400
I assume you could go a couple ways.

1706
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:54,200
You could because he's a handsome guy but you could go into very just like pasty odd guy.

1707
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:54,760
But like.

1708
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:55,000
Right.

1709
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,480
Like two Crispin Glover or.

1710
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:00,440
If you don't consider Crispin Glover a hot guy.

1711
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:04,440
Do I?

1712
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,120
Someone does.

1713
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:07,280
Mrs.

1714
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:07,760
Glover.

1715
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,960
If there is one I wonder if there is one.

1716
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,000
I stan Willard.

1717
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,240
I stan the Rat King.

1718
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:17,320
Yeah there's something hot about Willard in a hot topic kind of way.

1719
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,560
Is Willard his hottest role?

1720
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,640
George McFly is a dream role for me.

1721
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:24,200
I would love to.

1722
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:24,680
Oh.

1723
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,120
Confrontation.

1724
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:32,800
Yeah.

1725
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:34,000
Fantastic.

1726
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:37,800
I thought there was some good timing plus up like coming after.

1727
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:41,640
I mean the lift hill has a lot more going on the glitching TVs and stuff.

1728
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,200
They kept the one Raptor that comes through the ceiling.

1729
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:58,200
But that splashdown at least when I when we did it and then some of the videos I saw like the splashdown of that little hill the lights come on and a spitter gets you right as you drop.

1730
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,640
Like I thought that was a good fun reveal.

1731
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,800
And then also just all the vegetation.

1732
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,800
And I thought the T-Rex coming through the ceiling was working really well too.

1733
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:14,960
Some of this stuff they may have just like spruced up cleaned up make sure it was running at top capacity.

1734
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:15,320
Yeah.

1735
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,800
I wonder if there's there was a little like on the same.

1736
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,880
All my sources are from Jim Hill's podcast.

1737
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,640
This was in his Inside Universal podcast.

1738
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,120
I think there also was a chance there's more stuff too.

1739
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:30,520
Like maybe there is something else they add along that little.

1740
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:31,160
Yeah.

1741
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:31,840
It felt like.

1742
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:35,080
Pulling up I kind of wanted like something to happen.

1743
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,040
Because I feel like there was a rap there was something before.

1744
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:41,440
Well the Raptor comes down there was a rapper that comes down like holding to.

1745
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,120
Wires.

1746
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:42,520
Wires.

1747
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,760
It was a second one of those.

1748
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:45,920
It is goofy.

1749
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:46,240
Yeah.

1750
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,120
But I do like the 90s.

1751
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:48,920
I like that.

1752
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:52,520
If you're going to have blue then can you also do a 90s like.

1753
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:52,880
I don't know.

1754
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:53,560
Yeah it is good.

1755
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,280
It is campy.

1756
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:58,200
Have a human's head in your mouth or something like do something scary.

1757
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:58,440
Yeah.

1758
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,160
But was did was there was spitter there.

1759
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:02,040
I forget what was there was.

1760
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:04,960
I think there was a second ceiling Raptor on that hill.

1761
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:05,280
Right.

1762
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,440
That they replaced with the TV.

1763
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:08,520
Now it's.

1764
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:08,800
Yeah.

1765
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,160
This is what he said.

1766
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,360
This is Owen Grady.

1767
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:12,080
What.

1768
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:13,760
Why am I so obsessed with these names.

1769
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,040
The fact that they say them.

1770
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,240
Listen this is Claire Dearing.

1771
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,280
I need you to stay.

1772
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,040
The ridiculous.

1773
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:20,840
Board game names.

1774
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:21,440
Yeah.

1775
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,000
Yeah.

1776
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:22,400
Yeah.

1777
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:26,720
Like a really thin like why a mystery novel.

1778
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:31,760
And why if you were OK if you were really in the shades.

1779
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:32,360
Actually.

1780
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:33,720
Yeah.

1781
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:40,240
And it's just so like if you were on a Disney ride and then there was a problem like in

1782
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,120
reality.

1783
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:41,760
Right.

1784
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,240
Like.

1785
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:49,880
You know a real gorilla was loose on expedition Everest or something.

1786
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:54,200
And then all and then on the loudspeakers somebody's like attention this is Sharon

1787
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:54,880
Brown.

1788
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,360
Why are you telling me your name.

1789
01:20:59,040 --> 01:20:59,920
I know it's so true.

1790
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:02,480
You're a Disney person.

1791
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:03,560
And you're going to help me.

1792
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:05,640
Or it was like Bob Chapek.

1793
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:11,000
Attention this is head of parks and resorts Bob Chapek telling you please.

1794
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:11,400
Sorry.

1795
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,440
Parks.

1796
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:12,680
Yeah.

1797
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:16,720
As soon as I said it I know products and experience.

1798
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:19,240
That's his real insane title.

1799
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:19,920
I got it wrong.

1800
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,520
Full credit as you're about to die.

1801
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:24,800
I know.

1802
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,360
And then he has like nothing to offer.

1803
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,360
He's just like just hold tight.

1804
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:30,640
You're fucking Jets.

1805
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,520
Breathe.

1806
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:32,240
Good thing.

1807
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:33,640
How much do they pay you.

1808
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,200
This is his second appearance on a ride.

1809
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,160
He is now I have two has two rides.

1810
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:43,640
You will have three when the coaster opens up in Florida.

1811
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:45,160
Oh well you don't have the same character.

1812
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,280
It'll be the same Peter Quill character.

1813
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:52,800
Yeah it's sort of actually oddly similar scenario where it's a plus up of an

1814
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:58,360
existing ride plus up to have screens and Chris Pratt is on the screens and they

1815
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:01,680
are not 3D screens but they're very good screens.

1816
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:02,240
Screens.

1817
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:02,480
Yes.

1818
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:03,320
On both.

1819
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,920
They're being guardians.

1820
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,920
I was going to throw this trivia question everybody's way.

1821
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:14,200
Can you think of anyone else who at the same time was appearing in both a Disney

1822
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,080
attraction and a universal attraction.

1823
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:19,360
Oh I can only think of one that was ever.

1824
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:20,760
Hold on.

1825
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,720
I can I can hint if you think.

1826
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,760
I think I know it.

1827
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:26,760
So whoopie Goldberg.

1828
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:27,520
Whoopie Goldberg.

1829
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:28,960
You got it.

1830
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:36,120
On the host of the studio tour when I did a studio tour in 2006 and at the same

1831
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:41,760
time was still appearing as Khalifa the spirit of California in golden dreams.

1832
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:45,680
The very sleepy film.

1833
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:50,920
It's a California which is now Little Mermaid in California Adventure or that

1834
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:51,680
that building.

1835
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:52,080
I said yeah.

1836
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:52,280
Yeah.

1837
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:54,320
It's not into the woods last night at the Hollywood Bowl.

1838
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,040
Oh I saw that.

1839
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:56,440
Yeah I saw that Friday.

1840
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:57,120
You saw that Friday.

1841
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:57,600
Yeah it was great.

1842
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:58,080
I loved it.

1843
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:58,320
Yeah.

1844
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:03,560
And whoopie is the voice of the giant and it's so you didn't know that I didn't

1845
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:04,400
pick up on that.

1846
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:08,320
Gosh that giant effect was cool but I had read the kid.

1847
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,000
Is she credited in the official can.

1848
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:10,400
Yeah.

1849
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,920
I think on the billboards it's like and it's like on the force of whoopie.

1850
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,240
You can't like tell that you're not going to be there.

1851
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:16,840
Yeah.

1852
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:17,480
Oh right.

1853
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,560
Wait to buy a ticket and like overlook that she's just recorded.

1854
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:22,000
Yeah.

1855
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:26,440
I want to see whoopie Goldberg with my own eyes 3000 feet away.

1856
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:30,880
Yeah that is that I had eye strain by the end of the night from like looking so far

1857
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:31,320
down.

1858
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:31,880
Oh I know.

1859
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,800
Going between the stage and the videos.

1860
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:35,280
It's hard.

1861
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:36,800
And I didn't have my glasses either.

1862
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:37,760
Everything was black.

1863
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:39,160
The sound was amazing.

1864
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,000
I mean it sounded great.

1865
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,240
The acoustics are great.

1866
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:42,360
That's such a great show.

1867
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:42,840
Yeah.

1868
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:44,360
Well is it over now.

1869
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:45,080
Yeah.

1870
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,440
I think tonight's last night was a concert of a yeah yeah.

1871
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:47,760
Yeah.

1872
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:48,200
Worth it.

1873
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,400
You got nothing to do.

1874
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,400
I have something to do.

1875
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:51,120
Oh my God.

1876
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:54,440
Maybe.

1877
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:54,920
Yeah maybe.

1878
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:55,200
I will.

1879
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:56,560
Bring them there.

1880
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:58,640
Have your general there.

1881
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:00,680
Have a Sunday night general.

1882
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:03,760
Are you guys watching Sunday night generals.

1883
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:05,560
Great show.

1884
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,440
That's a spectrum exclusive right.

1885
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,240
One of those weird shows where it's like I can only watch this if I have spectrum

1886
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:14,720
cable.

1887
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,680
It's like 15 minutes on the like the direct TV.

1888
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:18,480
It's like oh but there's only half a show time.

1889
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,040
Yeah yeah.

1890
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:21,280
This is what Johnny Lee Miller's been up to.

1891
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:22,360
Yeah.

1892
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:25,240
Christian Slater's in his prime again.

1893
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:25,960
Yeah.

1894
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:26,840
Killing it.

1895
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:28,880
Mark Harmon.

1896
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,240
Somehow boost mobile.

1897
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:31,840
Thank you.

1898
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,120
You got other characters also in.

1899
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:35,800
I watched the pre show.

1900
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:36,920
We weren't able to do it.

1901
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:37,880
We had no line.

1902
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:41,840
Unfortunately we just got on the thing so we can get to watch all the pre show

1903
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:46,560
videos which I watched a really blurry copy of and you get to see like a live

1904
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,880
Jurassic Park Jurassic World news show.

1905
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,480
Jurassic Network.

1906
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,880
Yeah you're watching Jurassic Network.

1907
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:57,440
Is that like the in room channel though like at Disney because we all love the

1908
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,080
in room a little bit.

1909
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:02,760
So I kind of like that gives me that vibe a little bit and I like that it says

1910
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,520
live from Jurassic Studios down in the park.

1911
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:06,440
I like that.

1912
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:10,760
I'm thinking like who am I who what friend do I have who's going to be in

1913
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:12,760
this like it was just like sure.

1914
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:16,440
And so I was like there are obviously groundlings that they're being like a

1915
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,080
little smaller.

1916
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:25,760
Like that day rate that single day rate buyout for 30 years when they got a one

1917
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:26,280
day buyout.

1918
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:30,640
Six million still emailing about their season pass discounts.

1919
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:34,280
They show my face in the park.

1920
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:39,800
But you get to meet the Jurassic News anchor Monica Bayer.

1921
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:41,600
We were saying it the whole day.

1922
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,600
And she also says it so many times.

1923
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:46,520
What is this world.

1924
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:46,920
I know.

1925
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:50,480
Like she plays it so straight as like what it is too.

1926
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:56,400
It's like I love like the the like fan fiction like it just lowers the rent of

1927
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:01,120
the universe of Jurassic World so much to see Monica Bayer interviewing Owen

1928
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:01,520
Grady.

1929
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:02,520
Yeah.

1930
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,840
And why it's also from a perspective of like the way she's talking about it.

1931
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:06,760
Like she's talking about it.

1932
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:07,440
Like she's talking about it.

1933
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:08,040
Like she's talking about it.

1934
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:09,280
She thinks it.

1935
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:10,000
Yeah.

1936
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,400
And why it's also from a perspective of well you the theme park visitor know

1937
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:16,320
assuredly who Owen Grady is.

1938
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,080
You know who I am.

1939
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:18,040
Monica Baird is.

1940
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:19,640
You'll see Claire Dearing later.

1941
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:20,680
Obviously you know her.

1942
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:24,880
There's no besides us dorks who know the people who work there.

1943
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,280
Who you would know it.

1944
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,200
In the world of Jurassic World is real.

1945
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,080
We'd be dying on a Disney ride like Jay Pack.

1946
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:37,040
And we yeah if Jurassic World were real we'd be doing like little bits in every

1947
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:40,800
episode to like we want to get Monica Baird on the show.

1948
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:44,480
So tweeted a hashtag BTR Monica Baird.

1949
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:50,800
But to the normies yeah why do we care about Monica Baird.

1950
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:56,960
And she'd like been banned Owen can't keep his own flirting a little bit.

1951
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:57,560
I know he is.

1952
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:59,560
Yeah he's a he's a cheater.

1953
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,200
Claire is right there Owen.

1954
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:10,960
Monica Baird's desk is like like huge studio space like in a tower with like

1955
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,760
views of the park like the best view of the park.

1956
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,200
It's like elevated above the park.

1957
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:19,720
It's like clearly from it's like a still of like like the shot when they show like

1958
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:20,400
the whole park.

1959
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,800
But then it's like these like it feels like something on a Mars attacks like it's

1960
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:28,960
like this beautiful like groovy white like all white 60s mod feeling room and

1961
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:33,160
like the light like window like groovy looking mod windows are not this way.

1962
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:37,000
It's like a huge facility and it's just Monica Baird like dead center.

1963
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:38,200
It feels very Dr.

1964
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:38,880
Strangelove.

1965
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:39,640
Yeah.

1966
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,040
Like what is this like.

1967
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:41,520
Sorry.

1968
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:42,000
Wait what.

1969
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:46,880
It's a little like black like if black mirror shows TV show or something.

1970
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,600
Yeah it's really it's odd.

1971
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:49,080
Yeah.

1972
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:49,160
Yeah.

1973
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:54,840
I also think it's funny for years they had standard deaf TVs and now they've

1974
01:27:54,840 --> 01:28:00,080
upgraded to the widest ultra HD TVs I have ever seen.

1975
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,760
The widest wide screen.

1976
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:02,120
Yeah.

1977
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:02,400
Yeah.

1978
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:02,840
It's true.

1979
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:06,880
And like not normal aspect ratio screen.

1980
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:09,080
Well I think it's those ones that curve a little.

1981
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:10,320
Oh OK.

1982
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:14,240
Maybe that's why it's why the tagline for the road is it just got wide.

1983
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,160
You can see in the billboards.

1984
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:17,680
Yeah sure.

1985
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:18,560
Wide billboards.

1986
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:22,800
They also interview BD Wong's character too.

1987
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:23,440
Yeah.

1988
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:26,200
He just like continues this Dr.

1989
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:29,960
Wu who is my favorite Jurassic Park universe character because he has the same

1990
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:31,400
name as a Steely Dance song.

1991
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:33,560
Number one in my book.

1992
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,640
And they turned him is he in the last one BD Wong.

1993
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:38,040
Thank you.

1994
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:38,360
Yes.

1995
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:40,760
They turned him evil in the Jurassic World.

1996
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:41,240
They did.

1997
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:44,280
And he was just like a nice like.

1998
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:44,520
Yeah.

1999
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:48,920
He's a scientist hiding his sexuality at Jurassic Park and now he's a full

2000
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,240
fruity evil mastermind.

2001
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:54,040
He's just a nice man.

2002
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:57,360
Which is nice to be able to have that permission because they've had to like.

2003
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:00,480
You feel like in Lion King they had to like tame Scar down.

2004
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:00,840
Yeah.

2005
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:03,880
Does the feel like well we can't have a villain who's kind of like that's the

2006
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,880
subtext but it's more fun.

2007
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:07,000
It's always more fun.

2008
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:07,320
Yeah.

2009
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:07,480
Yeah.

2010
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:09,640
It's like we think but they can't have that fun.

2011
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:10,880
I get they're too scared to have.

2012
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,720
So I guess with BD Wong.

2013
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:12,920
Yeah.

2014
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:14,200
You get your kind of like.

2015
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:15,480
Well did you guys see Aladdin.

2016
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:16,560
Yes we did.

2017
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:17,320
Fascinating.

2018
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:17,680
Yes.

2019
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:24,200
There's a real like right into someone's the duality around someone's sexuality

2020
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,120
is really interesting.

2021
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,720
Wait wait wait explain your your specific your thoughts.

2022
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:33,520
It was just really interesting to see Will Smith grapple with how to finally

2023
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:35,600
express his femininity.

2024
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:41,560
That field felt very like truthful to him but under the caveat of like I'm but I'm

2025
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:46,640
doing this as a joke and then but then also starting out like this like hyper

2026
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:49,560
straight boring stripped down genie.

2027
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:52,800
Genie as a human at the beginning was just like it was the worst acting will

2028
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:53,600
Smith's ever done.

2029
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:55,400
Like it was really like bad.

2030
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:58,160
And then when he got into the genie he got to finally be like the.

2031
01:29:58,480 --> 01:29:59,000
Oh sure.

2032
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,000
He is deep down.

2033
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:07,200
That was really still not as because Robin Williams in the songs gets like very

2034
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:10,560
like I he wouldn't will Smith would not dare go.

2035
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:14,800
Yeah yeah it was a weird it was like a weird it was just like I felt like

2036
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:18,080
struggle and release like the entire time.

2037
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:21,520
So you're saying when he was like human and when he was blue is sort of the

2038
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,240
switch.

2039
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:25,720
Yeah when he's well when he when he's on the kind of like at the cold open you

2040
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:27,480
have already got the whole open and you're right.

2041
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:27,640
Yeah.

2042
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:27,800
Yeah.

2043
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:29,880
I totally forgot about the book.

2044
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:30,200
Yeah.

2045
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:30,280
Yeah.

2046
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:30,840
I see.

2047
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:30,920
I see.

2048
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:33,320
He plays it really different so that you're like is he the right.

2049
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:33,480
Right.

2050
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:33,800
Right.

2051
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:34,040
Right.

2052
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:34,120
Right.

2053
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:35,840
Just like him being like I'm straight.

2054
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:40,200
It's really very pasted on beard.

2055
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:42,040
He's literally wearing a beard.

2056
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:42,200
Right.

2057
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:42,520
Yeah.

2058
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:43,880
That does not match.

2059
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:47,080
It is not a kind of beard that Smith would grow.

2060
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:51,800
Is that a nod to the Robin Williams character at the start of the cartoon

2061
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,600
which has a beard and he's technically the genie.

2062
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:57,560
Is that I don't know ambiguous.

2063
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:58,440
It's very ambiguous.

2064
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:04,120
The casting of Nassim Pedrad who I think is very funny but the casting of Nassim Pedrad

2065
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:08,360
and Will Smith as a couple is surreal and everyone just accepted it.

2066
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:08,600
Yeah.

2067
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,760
It's literally like I can't even think what it's like.

2068
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:21,000
It's like Casey Wilson and Brad Pitt or like Kyle Mooney and like Angelina Jolie as a couple.

2069
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,920
Like it's just like what's going on.

2070
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:25,560
One of these days.

2071
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:27,400
Yeah.

2072
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:30,200
And they don't there's no like sparks between them.

2073
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:33,480
They may have any kind like do they ever they don't kiss do they.

2074
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:38,360
It's just like I don't know separately they imply they like each other together.

2075
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:39,640
Yeah.

2076
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:41,800
It's definitely a tell don't show thing.

2077
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:42,760
Yeah.

2078
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:43,400
Right.

2079
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:43,640
Right.

2080
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:47,720
I know they did scenes together but it also feels like if somebody went you know they just

2081
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:49,720
sort of added that in post I'd be like oh yeah.

2082
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:51,160
The whole movie.

2083
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:51,960
They will you will.

2084
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:52,600
Yeah.

2085
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:52,920
Yeah.

2086
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:53,160
Yeah.

2087
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,040
80 percent of it wasn't there until a month.

2088
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:57,160
No one set foot on us.

2089
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:01,080
They just have a technology to move people's mouths differently and then a voice actor came

2090
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:03,880
in and they'll just face timed and then they got.

2091
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:05,080
Yeah I love you.

2092
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:05,320
Yeah.

2093
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:06,360
We're gonna have kids.

2094
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:08,680
There it's gonna be really interesting to watch.

2095
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:13,000
I mean some podcast will clean up with the like five year anniversary of all of the live action.

2096
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:14,840
Oh yeah.

2097
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:20,120
It is completely like no one will want to talk about them already.

2098
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:25,000
Beauty and the Beast live action feels like just don't know they're all being buried immediately

2099
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:25,720
in like Dumbo.

2100
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:28,440
I don't even know if that comes out in three years or came out a year ago.

2101
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:29,000
I don't even know.

2102
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:37,240
This is like kind of you were saying earlier like the movies can don't necessarily have a heart and

2103
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:42,680
you know I like some reboots and some franchises and stuff but you know when it's all said and

2104
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:47,720
done and everything just goes on Netflix or Hulu and it's like Citizen Kane is next to

2105
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:55,320
a sitcom that ran for a season is next to Planet Earth is next to Netflix original.

2106
01:32:55,320 --> 01:33:01,080
You're like only we saw billboards for because Netflix buys the same billboards in Los Angeles

2107
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:01,640
every week.

2108
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:09,480
It kind of there's a strange flattening of culture where everything is the same everything's

2109
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:15,240
equivalent everything's just or stuff is impossible to find it's like hey that show that got good

2110
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:18,200
reviews but only lasted like 10 episodes where do I find it.

2111
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:23,800
I know like true and there's like shows that are like 15 minutes long on Netflix and then

2112
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:28,440
there's like like oh like Scorsese is doing a nice movie.

2113
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:32,600
Yes it's crazy it's just like none of us are going to be remembered like that's the bottom line.

2114
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:39,320
Like well that's true there's no more there's no more archetypal genius brains to like root

2115
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:39,880
for.

2116
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:44,920
It's pretty scary I talk about how like when I worked at Funny or Die with a lot of people

2117
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:49,960
have been guests on the show and there was always a lot of jockeying for the front position

2118
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:54,040
like if we don't get main player then we're sunk we're not going to get our 20,000 views

2119
01:33:54,040 --> 01:34:00,520
or whatever and now that is Netflix and film entire you could like then now the funny or die

2120
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:07,160
main player is a film you worked on for 40 years like but they didn't it's on Netflix

2121
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:09,800
and they paid for it but they didn't show that it existed.

2122
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:14,280
Just put it in that big stripe that goes by I know my life is ruined.

2123
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:19,800
Yeah yeah it's it's not so it's a weird time yeah just lying down the toilet.

2124
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:22,040
This is what you're doing to us.

2125
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:27,560
Oh man as someone who is not created or co-created a television show it's great hearing to people

2126
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:29,080
who have be so optimistic.

2127
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:31,720
Get out there.

2128
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:35,480
Joey stay at it.

2129
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:43,800
Anyway the Disney plus is coming soon and Disney plus it's Netflix HBO Max like they're all these

2130
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:51,320
titans and I'm sure they're all going to want to do lots of new original stories that are not

2131
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:58,120
and not just you know the Rocketeer the show which is something we all know happening.

2132
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:13,800
I mean camp crustaceans I'm losing my mind.

2133
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:14,360
It's a restaurant.

2134
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:16,200
That sounds fun though honestly.

2135
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:19,720
I'm working on camp crustaceans that's all crabs and lobsters.

2136
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,280
I also watched a food tour.

2137
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:27,240
I also watched on Netflix actually a Lego Jurassic World and it's kind of fun.

2138
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:28,440
I kind of liked it.

2139
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:32,280
Oh yeah the Lego all sort of like slowly getting the inoculation.

2140
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:34,520
Yeah we're getting slowly desensitized.

2141
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:35,880
That's what I saw it wasn't so bad.

2142
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:37,960
This is the Lego the Lego movies are good.

2143
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:43,720
And this is part of it honestly that like that we don't think any of us love the Jurassic

2144
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:48,360
World films but now we've we kind of like this ride we're getting used to the vibe

2145
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:52,200
we're like apologizing for things about the movies because the ride is all right.

2146
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:52,680
It's true.

2147
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:55,320
I like J.A. Biona too.

2148
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:02,920
I liked that movie the orphanage he made and it was really good and then I like him like when

2149
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:07,800
he talks he's like yeah it's like gonna be amazing and you're like yeah he cares like it's like

2150
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:10,440
yeah sure yeah his passion is what we're saying.

2151
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:13,960
Now he should have been there yeah.

2152
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:17,160
We did get to see Chris Brett team blue live.

2153
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:19,240
I mean that's what you want to say.

2154
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:19,960
Power of Christ.

2155
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:23,400
All that is real.

2156
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:33,400
Blue's yeah that's really these movies like Jurassic Park is Jewish and Jurassic World's

2157
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:36,440
Christian like I don't it's weird like how did that happen.

2158
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:41,400
That's my theory.

2159
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,320
Explain explain about that.

2160
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:50,120
Jurassic Park Spielberg like I don't care about your 4000 years old earth there were dinosaurs

2161
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:55,720
like right yeah but it's like they say the word science a lot.

2162
01:36:55,720 --> 01:37:01,800
That's true yeah but it's mega church Christian it's like righteous gemstone it's Christian.

2163
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:06,600
That's true but that's kind of it's about the folly of that so I would argue that yeah

2164
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:11,960
but then Jurassic World feels like it's bright and shiny and like oh it's like no come on in

2165
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:15,080
take a seat we're all friends here and you're like I don't know if I believe that.

2166
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:21,640
I mean honestly I'll be honest I've never thought about that before.

2167
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:25,480
I know that your mom just into this show so I'm sorry if this is a cultural problem.

2168
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:27,720
We were apologizing for religious stuff in the other episode.

2169
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:31,240
Yeah we recorded an earlier one today and I was apologizing honestly I think though she'll

2170
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:33,480
she'll like that because she's half Jewish.

2171
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:34,200
Okay good all right.

2172
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:36,040
So she'll kind of like that it's been balanced out.

2173
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:38,280
Yeah yeah so she's somewhere she's a Jurassic Park three head.

2174
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:39,080
Yeah she was.

2175
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:42,920
She likes the end of three in the beginning of the world.

2176
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:47,800
He gets his hat back at the end of three that's a little nod to Steven and yeah.

2177
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:54,200
Laura Dern and Sam Neill are divorced and Laura Dern's married to another man and she calls the

2178
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,720
like the army or something.

2179
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:57,720
The SWAT team to like oh yeah.

2180
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:59,400
How did that happen?

2181
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:02,520
The end of the movie is like her showing up on the beach with the army.

2182
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:04,040
And he's like huh Ellie.

2183
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:07,400
How though?

2184
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:10,120
It is I've never made it this far in this film.

2185
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:11,320
Yeah the Navy Seals.

2186
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:13,560
It's only like 70 minutes so you can get there.

2187
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:21,240
I mean I do one in the third Jurassic where I want all of them back like the Malcolm

2188
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:24,760
that was a big disappointing thing in Fallen Kingdom was like yeah totally.

2189
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:28,840
They clearly had Goldblum for a day his entire scene is sitting at a table in a

2190
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:29,960
Senate subcommittee.

2191
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:30,840
So weird.

2192
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:34,680
I want him and Laura Dern and Sam Neill for the next one.

2193
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:35,800
They are they're all coming back.

2194
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:37,000
All right I'm on board.

2195
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:41,320
They weren't saying it and then Laura Dern and her passionate mania was like I'm doing

2196
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:44,280
it and then like tweeted it and they were like oh yeah we're doing it.

2197
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:46,680
I love the Dern Renaissance we're getting now.

2198
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:49,320
I am jazzed about how much Laura Dern is.

2199
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:52,520
To the point now that I don't know if you watch Big Little Lies too but it's just Laura

2200
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:53,880
Dern fan fiction at this point.

2201
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:59,160
Like it's just like jokes of what you want to see Laura Dern doing the show.

2202
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:04,920
I'm finishing up the second season of Deadwood so I got to I will swing to something.

2203
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:09,080
You'll get to it in about 25 years.

2204
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:09,960
Yeah I'm taking my time.

2205
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:11,960
You have to get through the whole HBO.

2206
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:16,120
Big Little Lies is pretty quick and then I'll finally do the full Twin Peaks run.

2207
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:16,280
Oh cool.

2208
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:17,240
Because I've only done half.

2209
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:23,240
Well if you get high and watch the original like I well I guess you could just watch it

2210
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:27,640
without being high but I was really high and I was watching Laura Dern and every scene

2211
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:33,400
and she is like it's an underwritten character and you don't feel that because she's delivering

2212
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:38,600
the most presence of anyone in the movie and she's just like buried like she's like

2213
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:42,920
holding a leaf and just like immersed in like what the leaf is like and she's got no lines

2214
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:47,400
in the scene and she and it's like you're stealing the show like you are really doing

2215
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,000
such an endearing character.

2216
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:49,320
Yeah.

2217
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:53,800
So maybe they could overlay this when the next one comes out and give us a little Dern

2218
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:54,840
on the screen.

2219
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:55,080
Yeah.

2220
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,400
Once in a while give us a.

2221
01:39:57,400 --> 01:39:58,280
Well they should trade it.

2222
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:01,960
She's gonna turn it into like a piece of.

2223
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:08,040
She's not gonna I feel like there's no way she's gonna be like serving a greater story

2224
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:13,320
like she's gonna be like doing a like now for some reason Ellie Sattler is like emotionally

2225
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:14,280
unstable.

2226
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:17,800
It's gonna be it's gonna it's like there's no way she's gonna chill out for this.

2227
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:19,000
I mean that's good though.

2228
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:19,640
Yeah it's good.

2229
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:23,960
Yeah I don't want to just sit on that lift hill and watch this Ellie Sattler break down

2230
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:25,240
on the monitors.

2231
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:29,800
Well you know there's gonna be a scene where Owen Grady and Claire Dearing are sizing up

2232
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:33,080
Alan Grant and Ellie stat like what's this.

2233
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:35,160
Yeah very much so yeah.

2234
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:38,520
Yeah that Seinfeld episode with the like new friends and the old friends.

2235
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:39,000
Yes.

2236
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:39,400
Oh yeah.

2237
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:39,880
Yeah yeah.

2238
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:45,880
Here's a question I guess is because we kind of wind it down.

2239
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:50,440
Do you do we think this is worth doing at the other parks or is this because it feels to

2240
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:54,760
me like all right well Star Wars is opening down the freeway.

2241
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:58,040
We got to do something for the summer that feels like what motivated all of this happening.

2242
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:04,920
But was this successful enough that they should go to Orlando Orlando and Osaka.

2243
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:08,680
And I well I'm obviously they love Claire Dearing in Osaka in Japan.

2244
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:10,040
They'll be out with the book.

2245
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:10,360
Right.

2246
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:12,200
Children have to read it in school.

2247
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:17,880
It's how they learn English in Japan now.

2248
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:23,640
I I'm always a fan of two versions of rides so.

2249
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:25,720
I like the guardians.

2250
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:27,720
That's what I think like I like guardians a lot.

2251
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:32,360
It's one of my favorites but please keep my beloved Florida Tower of Terror safe.

2252
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:33,640
I like two different versions.

2253
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:37,960
I like the idea that I can go do the classic in Orlando.

2254
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:38,840
That's nice.

2255
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:43,240
I'm not against them doing it or do this version in Orlando but I like that.

2256
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:45,240
Let's keep them if we can.

2257
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:51,560
I guess like if I wasn't thinking about what's realistic I would just want there to be like a

2258
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:57,560
new ride that has stuff I want to see like and just let there be like two different new rides.

2259
01:41:57,560 --> 01:41:59,000
But I know that's not going to happen.

2260
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:03,640
Years and the concept art of this is pretty easy to find online.

2261
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:05,560
There was like a Jeep ride.

2262
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:06,200
Oh right.

2263
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:09,080
Adventure ride that they always talked about building in Florida.

2264
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:11,400
I think there's still space available to build it.

2265
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:14,440
Well that's where people were like at Islands Adventure.

2266
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:14,680
Right.

2267
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:15,560
Yeah yeah yeah.

2268
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:20,280
And like because that's what I think then the new idea was for the gyrosphere thing which

2269
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:26,680
if they can make a big ball roll and have a Jimmy Fallon on the screen in there I'm all like let's do it.

2270
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:34,360
When that was in the movie I will say no the only other thing that I've ever went well that's made

2271
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:40,920
for a theme park is the drivers fear and then in the one Hobbit movie when they get in the barrels

2272
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,040
and they go through the rapid.

2273
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:44,200
I'm sure that's fun too.

2274
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:49,400
But that Jeep thing like you could make like the scariest ride of all time

2275
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:54,920
if you can have like the T-Rex chomping down like the scene in the first Jurassic Park

2276
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:59,560
which I don't even know if they could do it because of how freaked out any child that went on it

2277
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:02,360
because as a kid I was traumatized by that scene.

2278
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:06,920
I love Jurassic Park but I would watch that and I was just freaked out because of how good it is.

2279
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:12,920
But like yeah that that Jeep ride that would be awesome.

2280
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:13,160
Yeah.

2281
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:15,480
But I would be I'd be scarred if I.

2282
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:18,040
It'd be the gyros if they were going to do it it would be a gyrosphere.

2283
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:19,960
Yeah and you couldn't like break that open.

2284
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:24,600
I feel like you could get a Jeep and you could somehow like make it feel like it was squeezing

2285
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:25,080
in a little bit.

2286
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:28,520
Like a piece of glass comes down within.

2287
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:30,280
Oh no it would be so.

2288
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:30,520
Yeah.

2289
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:34,040
I would contend with the fact that gyrospheres don't exist finally.

2290
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:34,520
That's true.

2291
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:36,200
They have to finally admit that that's not real.

2292
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:37,080
But they don't want to do that.

2293
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:39,960
But there was a drawing on a patent I saw it.

2294
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:42,040
And it's real that means it's real.

2295
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:43,400
I should support imagination.

2296
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:49,080
The only reason I could see them doing this overlay in Florida for a couple of reasons

2297
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:53,320
whether they should or not is up up for discussion.

2298
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:58,120
But because Islands of Adventure is hitting the 20 year mark and stuff is like start they are

2299
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:00,040
starting to freshen up stuff.

2300
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:07,960
Also depending on how they're going to theme that Raptor roller coaster if they flip it all

2301
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:12,920
to Jurassic will that cause them to go like we should make it all Jurassic World.

2302
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:15,000
I think they're going to see how this one is received.

2303
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,800
They're going to listen to this podcast specifically and see.

2304
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:22,680
We do have to remember Jurassic World was insanely successful.

2305
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:22,840
Yeah.

2306
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:23,320
Oh yeah.

2307
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:24,040
Super.

2308
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:27,160
In the top 10 movies of all time in terms of box office crews.

2309
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:29,240
Every movie that comes out is in the top 10 movies of all time.

2310
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:29,880
I guess.

2311
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:30,760
That is true.

2312
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:32,840
10 movies are refreshed every single year now.

2313
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:33,080
Yeah.

2314
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:35,560
Everyone wants to see dinosaurs.

2315
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:36,200
And also it's like.

2316
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:36,680
No matter what.

2317
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:38,360
Yeah no matter what.

2318
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:39,000
Right.

2319
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,400
No matter how many assistants get strangled to death.

2320
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:43,320
How long the way.

2321
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:47,800
And also what bothers me is that none of these movies Gone with the Wind is the number one

2322
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:48,120
movie.

2323
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:48,840
Will always be.

2324
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:50,680
Where's that ride?

2325
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:51,080
Yeah.

2326
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:51,960
Yeah right.

2327
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:53,080
That's like if you.

2328
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:54,520
In the burning.

2329
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:54,760
Yeah.

2330
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:59,880
If the inflation if inflation were taken into account most of these movies are not in the top 10.

2331
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:00,200
Yeah.

2332
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:00,920
That's true.

2333
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:01,320
So like.

2334
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:02,040
Titanic.

2335
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:02,920
Yeah.

2336
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:03,560
That would be a good ride.

2337
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:07,000
But again only the theme park divisions are thinking about the long game.

2338
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,360
Everyone else is thinking about the next financial quarter or two.

2339
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:11,880
I just want to see pterodactyls.

2340
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:12,920
Like I think that's.

2341
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:13,160
Yes.

2342
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:14,120
Would just be so fun.

2343
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:19,080
As a kid I was reading the book I was like there were pterodactyls in that first book

2344
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:20,280
and they were not in the movie.

2345
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:20,760
I know it's.

2346
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,600
Because that was my favorite dinosaur.

2347
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:26,920
Because they go through an aviary where there's a there was supposed to be a hotel

2348
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:31,640
inside the aviary and then they were immediately like oh that was a terrible idea because it's

2349
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:33,880
all boarded up and apparently all the workmen died.

2350
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:35,560
It's like well obviously.

2351
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:35,720


2352
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:35,720


2353
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:35,720


2354
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:35,720


2355
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:35,720


2356
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:42,280
And then all the pterodactyls do is just like kamikaze dive bomb the kids and try to

2357
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:46,120
knock them unconscious and it's fun like that would be cool.

2358
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:46,680
Yeah.

2359
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:47,880
They should do that.

2360
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:48,840
I'm looking at it.

2361
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:51,640
It's Gone with the Wind Star Wars Sound of Music E.T.

2362
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:52,520
Titanic.

2363
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:52,840
Wow.

2364
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:53,880
That's the top five.

2365
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:57,400
Which feels like in terms of impact that feels correct.

2366
01:45:57,400 --> 01:45:57,800
Yeah.

2367
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:58,440
Right.

2368
01:45:58,440 --> 01:45:59,160
Although Dr.

2369
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:00,040
Zhivago is eight.

2370
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:03,320
That's interesting.

2371
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:03,640
Yeah.

2372
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:05,320
It's Ten Commandments Jaws Dr.

2373
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:07,720
Zhivago Exorcist Snow White.

2374
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:08,920
Oh.

2375
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:10,840
And then you start getting into the territory.

2376
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:12,360
Eleven is Force Awakens.

2377
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:13,560
Okay.

2378
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:14,120
So.

2379
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:20,120
Guys these are going to have the biggest corners of that academy museum that's coming

2380
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:21,400
to Wilshire Boulevard.

2381
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:22,760
I am so excited for that.

2382
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:23,720
Are you.

2383
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:24,600
The technodrome.

2384
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:27,240
No I'm interested.

2385
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:32,520
It seems like a misuse of money in the current state of Los Angeles.

2386
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:35,240
The current state of Los Angeles is it feels like a misuse of money.

2387
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:42,120
But the one piece of concept art with the one giant room is just columns.

2388
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:46,920
It's just an empty room with massive columns and Spielberg paid a million dollars for a

2389
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:47,320
column.

2390
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:50,040
Jason Blum paid a million dollars for a column.

2391
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:53,400
It's just people buying columns for a million dollars and I think it's called the Heim

2392
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:54,840
Saban Room that I've talked about.

2393
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:57,000
When you say column just like a blank column.

2394
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:57,800
Just columns.

2395
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:59,480
And it has their name on it or.

2396
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:00,120
Yeah.

2397
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:00,600
Oh okay.

2398
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:01,320
I think so.

2399
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:05,240
It's like they're the donors but it's just the concept art.

2400
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:08,600
It's like this just a room with a lot of lighting.

2401
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:10,280
It's just an empty room with columns.

2402
01:47:10,280 --> 01:47:11,480
This is so odd.

2403
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:12,200
Yeah.

2404
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:14,360
Are you saying we should buy a column.

2405
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:17,800
I mean it would be very funny to buy a column as a.

2406
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:18,360
Like if someone.

2407
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:19,480
Pull a million altogether.

2408
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:23,960
If we could pull money for a column and then made it say like Pee Pee Poo Poo.

2409
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:25,160
That would be very funny.

2410
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:26,280
That would be the choice.

2411
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:29,720
So and then people would be like I actually love Pee Pee Poo Poo's films.

2412
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:32,520
I've seen all of them actually.

2413
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:33,240
I know what it is.

2414
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:33,740
Yeah.

2415
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:38,440
I think it'll be it will be an interesting museum but it just seems like it's it's going

2416
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:42,360
to be the most expensive museum of all time and it feels a little decadent.

2417
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:46,280
It definitely looks decadent but in the way that the promise of L.A.

2418
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:50,840
Seems like it's supposed to be like there's like a room that's like close encounters in Star Wars.

2419
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:54,120
It's just like sci fi room and it looks really I just want to get high.

2420
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:56,520
I mean to look at like.

2421
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:59,560
Scarlett O'Hara and DT and like the exercise.

2422
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:00,920
Sure.

2423
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:01,560
It sounds fun.

2424
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:03,320
I just want to see the columns.

2425
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:08,920
Jason's really actually built the columns up in my mind.

2426
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:10,600
I'm excited for these columns now.

2427
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:12,680
Is that more of a rose?

2428
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:17,800
I just like the idea of someone buying a ceremonial column in an empty room for a million dollars.

2429
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:18,120
Sure.

2430
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:20,280
Well we'll get one.

2431
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:25,800
Oh and Iger Bob Iger was the big of course the big pitchman for like come on buy these columns.

2432
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:27,880
Someday we'll have column money.

2433
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:28,380
Yeah.

2434
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:30,940
I'm looking through OK.

2435
01:48:30,940 --> 01:48:32,780
One of the things we didn't talk about.

2436
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:37,260
This is not confirmed and somebody tell me if they came across this.

2437
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:40,460
The ride is slower than Jurassic Park.

2438
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:41,020
Don't know that.

2439
01:48:41,740 --> 01:48:44,620
If you look up this is I think another Jim Hill source thing.

2440
01:48:44,620 --> 01:48:48,860
If you look at the videos when they're both together it seems like the Jurassic World

2441
01:48:48,860 --> 01:48:49,660
moves slower.

2442
01:48:49,660 --> 01:48:51,100
It's just longer ride.

2443
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:51,500
I don't know.

2444
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:54,620
We have yet to see what the duration is on like Wikipedia or something.

2445
01:48:54,620 --> 01:48:57,020
Get your stopwatches out everybody.

2446
01:48:57,020 --> 01:48:57,820
Let's find out.

2447
01:48:57,820 --> 01:48:58,780
Let's figure that out.

2448
01:48:58,780 --> 01:49:00,860
And they turn the jets on a little slower.

2449
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:07,020
Opening is probably the Mosasaurus probably is where I would say I feel like being slower.

2450
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:07,260
Maybe.

2451
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:07,580
Yeah.

2452
01:49:07,580 --> 01:49:08,060
I don't know.

2453
01:49:08,060 --> 01:49:09,260
You're in there for a while.

2454
01:49:09,260 --> 01:49:09,500
Yeah.

2455
01:49:10,220 --> 01:49:11,740
So but the whole thing maybe overall.

2456
01:49:13,180 --> 01:49:13,660
I don't know.

2457
01:49:13,660 --> 01:49:14,140
That's about it.

2458
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:16,220
What a way to end the show.

2459
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:23,180
You know what I'd like to say is I forgot to acknowledge at the beginning that I went on

2460
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:23,660
the ride.

2461
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:24,700
I'm afraid of cat.

2462
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:27,100
I said the whole Jurassic Park ride episode.

2463
01:49:28,060 --> 01:49:29,820
Like I've only done it once.

2464
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:31,020
I don't want to do it again.

2465
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:33,740
But it's been a courageous year for me.

2466
01:49:33,740 --> 01:49:36,700
I've done a lot and just like SplashMath.

2467
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:37,020
Thank you.

2468
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:37,660
That's what I wanted.

2469
01:49:37,660 --> 01:49:38,220
It was a half hour.

2470
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:39,580
I was.

2471
01:49:39,580 --> 01:49:40,780
I stopped because you weren't done.

2472
01:49:40,780 --> 01:49:41,900
And I will applaud fully.

2473
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:42,620
I was all it.

2474
01:49:42,620 --> 01:49:43,660
I was all it.

2475
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:44,860
Here is the column room.

2476
01:49:45,820 --> 01:49:46,940
Oh I have seen that picture.

2477
01:49:46,940 --> 01:49:47,500
And I did.

2478
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:50,700
I had no idea what I was looking at.

2479
01:49:50,700 --> 01:49:51,260
Wow.

2480
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:51,580
All right.

2481
01:49:51,580 --> 01:49:52,060
Very good.

2482
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:57,340
But you know I just like as with everything in my

2483
01:49:57,340 --> 01:50:01,900
courageous writing your Splash Mountain and Criticoaster Tower of Terror and Guardians.

2484
01:50:03,020 --> 01:50:05,580
I had help from a little friend called Liquor.

2485
01:50:05,580 --> 01:50:09,260
And if I could just you know anybody listening out there I can't say enough.

2486
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:13,340
If there's something you're scared of doing drink a bunch and then do it.

2487
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:15,180
If I could give apart any message.

2488
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:15,420
Yeah.

2489
01:50:15,420 --> 01:50:15,980
And we could.

2490
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:16,300
Yeah.

2491
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:16,780
Yeah.

2492
01:50:16,780 --> 01:50:18,780
Drink a bunch then do it.

2493
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:21,420
Clap for points.

2494
01:50:22,780 --> 01:50:23,980
Island New Bar what do we think?

2495
01:50:24,540 --> 01:50:25,420
Oh that was great.

2496
01:50:25,420 --> 01:50:27,100
I mean I didn't get a drink.

2497
01:50:27,180 --> 01:50:28,380
It's hard.

2498
01:50:28,380 --> 01:50:30,940
Look it's hard to not like it when you're at a press event.

2499
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:32,140
Yeah.

2500
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:33,260
So I tried a lot of the.

2501
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:37,660
Blended ones and I thought they were pretty good for like machine blended drinks.

2502
01:50:37,660 --> 01:50:40,780
Do we have a picture of the menu?

2503
01:50:40,780 --> 01:50:41,420
I forget.

2504
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:43,020
It's my tie.

2505
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:43,580
Sorry.

2506
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:44,300
No no no.

2507
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:45,260
You say no Tiki.

2508
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:50,700
I don't think I think that if they're collectible why are they not dressing world.

2509
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:55,020
Like I don't get the like they're just like a bamboo stick that you don't want to take home.

2510
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:56,540
More of like a dinosaur shape.

2511
01:50:56,540 --> 01:50:58,860
Yeah or just something that's like Jurassic World.

2512
01:50:58,860 --> 01:51:01,900
I don't know I thought that was kind of like it looked cheap too.

2513
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:02,380
I don't know.

2514
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:07,100
I like yeah I like the idea of like a Tiki theme but it would make more sense if it was a dinosaur

2515
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:08,140
glass.

2516
01:51:08,780 --> 01:51:08,940
Yeah.

2517
01:51:08,940 --> 01:51:09,660
Yeah that makes sense.

2518
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:10,220
Collectible.

2519
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:14,460
Yeah and also I've seen the complaint now that it's like not like a you know it's not

2520
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:19,420
in the summer of Oga's Cantina the incredible bar in Star Wars land this is just a stand.

2521
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:20,140
Yeah.

2522
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:25,260
I was hoping for a little more because when we I believe we got that scoop live while

2523
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:28,860
we were recording that there was going to be a Tiki bar and I was imagining maybe on the top

2524
01:51:28,860 --> 01:51:31,100
of the restaurant there'd be this cool theme.

2525
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:32,060
I thought that too.

2526
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:36,460
But unfortunately yeah it's just a little stand not that it's not bad I think it gives it the

2527
01:51:36,460 --> 01:51:41,740
area a little like energy but it's not the fully emer we want even we know what we want.

2528
01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:44,620
We want a dinosaur in the robot on the restaurant.

2529
01:51:44,620 --> 01:51:47,180
I want to be able to sit and look at the splash down.

2530
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:49,180
We want to sit and look at the splash down.

2531
01:51:49,180 --> 01:51:50,860
Tropical margarita.

2532
01:51:50,860 --> 01:51:53,100
We want to feel Costa Rica like when you're there.

2533
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:58,380
Costa Rica we want like a dinosaur with a lay on or something like a hat like a sun hat.

2534
01:51:58,380 --> 01:52:02,860
The food is a real step up for the lower the chicken and the pork and rice and stuff was

2535
01:52:02,860 --> 01:52:04,540
a real step up for the lower lot.

2536
01:52:04,540 --> 01:52:11,660
I think the issue with now though is like oh cool new land we plus everything up in this area.

2537
01:52:11,660 --> 01:52:16,220
It's like you got to get a move on on the rest of the other parts of the park because it makes

2538
01:52:16,220 --> 01:52:18,140
them work worse by comparison.

2539
01:52:18,140 --> 01:52:18,860
Right.

2540
01:52:18,860 --> 01:52:21,820
I think the restaurant still could be like cooler though.

2541
01:52:21,820 --> 01:52:26,140
There's something so like it's still it's always felt like a hospital or something like.

2542
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:26,860
There's a clinical.

2543
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:33,340
I like the original mural like there were these like painted they were kind of janky and small

2544
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:39,100
but they were just like painted photo realist like murals of dinosaurs like it loving life

2545
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:44,700
and it was like out in the open and I liked that that was like a choice that felt weird

2546
01:52:44,700 --> 01:52:49,420
and like and also like that's how Jurassic Park is like in the like in the cafeteria and stuff.

2547
01:52:49,420 --> 01:52:51,500
Like they have these like murals like that.

2548
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:58,620
But then this felt the murals this aesthetic felt clean and nice but like a like a half

2549
01:52:58,620 --> 01:53:01,500
assed lunch children's lunch box of Jurassic Park.

2550
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:04,780
You know like it didn't have anything like really immersive like.

2551
01:53:04,780 --> 01:53:06,140
Yeah there's no personality really.

2552
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:10,060
Yeah but it's nicer than like a lot of stuff at a theme park so.

2553
01:53:10,060 --> 01:53:13,740
Yes and it's new it's newish now so that's great.

2554
01:53:13,740 --> 01:53:15,100
Yeah it's clean right now.

2555
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:18,540
But if there could be a drink where what about a drink where like this little like

2556
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:21,740
you get a little Mr. DNA with it and those are a little.

2557
01:53:21,740 --> 01:53:23,020
Yes that's a perfect.

2558
01:53:23,020 --> 01:53:23,900
Yeah I mean that's.

2559
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:27,020
You drop into the drink you like disconnect him.

2560
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:27,980
Eating DNA.

2561
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:28,460
Yeah yeah yeah.

2562
01:53:28,460 --> 01:53:33,100
This is where Disney is just kicking Universal's ass is in the Instagrammable

2563
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:34,780
food and drink departments.

2564
01:53:34,780 --> 01:53:35,020
Right on.

2565
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:41,340
With whether it's mugs whether it's the Hatbox Ghost Tiki mugs like they know what nerds want

2566
01:53:41,340 --> 01:53:46,780
to buy and they know like what's going to like be an Instagram like there's a big donut that's

2567
01:53:46,780 --> 01:53:50,300
in the shape of Donald Duck's ass like it's like his.

2568
01:53:50,860 --> 01:53:51,580
His little bottom.

2569
01:53:51,580 --> 01:53:53,900
His bottom I should have said bottom I'm so sorry mom.

2570
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:54,540
Ass.

2571
01:53:54,540 --> 01:53:55,740
I don't know why I said ass.

2572
01:53:56,700 --> 01:53:58,540
Donald Duck's thick ass.

2573
01:54:00,540 --> 01:54:01,980
Donald Duck's thick ass.

2574
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:07,020
This is Duck Butt and it's but it's like people take a picture of it.

2575
01:54:07,020 --> 01:54:12,140
There's a wizard hat like smoothie that looks like the sorcerer like why wouldn't they do that.

2576
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:16,220
Like Mr. D is you just literally that's a multi-million dollar idea.

2577
01:54:16,940 --> 01:54:20,620
That they will they won't do it they won't listen to us.

2578
01:54:20,620 --> 01:54:21,900
Yeah they're kind of boring I don't know.

2579
01:54:22,620 --> 01:54:25,900
I drink it's like a spitter you squeeze it and it squeezes.

2580
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:26,460
Oh yeah.

2581
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:27,740
Bits alcohol India.

2582
01:54:27,740 --> 01:54:28,220
Great.

2583
01:54:28,220 --> 01:54:29,340
Or like just rip off.

2584
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:30,700
New ways to be an alcoholic now.

2585
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:31,580
Yeah faster.

2586
01:54:32,380 --> 01:54:33,100
New discovery.

2587
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:38,700
The Joe's Crab Shack drink the Shark Bite where you pour in.

2588
01:54:38,700 --> 01:54:39,580
My favorite drink.

2589
01:54:39,580 --> 01:54:42,860
A little blood and then it makes the water it's like a little shark sheen.

2590
01:54:42,860 --> 01:54:44,460
We didn't do it this year at Comic Con though.

2591
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:45,820
We didn't do it at Comic Con it just never worked out.

2592
01:54:45,820 --> 01:54:50,220
It's a tradition usually of it's like a big like chalice glass chalice that's probably

2593
01:54:50,220 --> 01:54:54,780
not what the term is and it's blue and then you put red in it and it's a whole they do

2594
01:54:55,260 --> 01:54:56,060
the whole show for you.

2595
01:54:56,060 --> 01:54:58,860
Do a little show like that feels like a given.

2596
01:54:58,860 --> 01:54:59,660
Yeah they don't do that.

2597
01:54:59,660 --> 01:55:03,660
Joe's Crab Shack part of the appeal is also it's usually very cold inside and quiet.

2598
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:05,740
And it's relatively quiet.

2599
01:55:05,740 --> 01:55:07,660
And the food is acceptable.

2600
01:55:07,660 --> 01:55:08,220
It's fine.

2601
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:10,460
But it's on the water which is nice.

2602
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:11,260
It's on the water.

2603
01:55:11,260 --> 01:55:12,540
It's behind the convention center.

2604
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:13,500
Yeah.

2605
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:18,780
There is something about the restaurant that feels like designed by execs or something.

2606
01:55:18,780 --> 01:55:22,540
Like it's like for meetings or something like you're supposed to like take meetings

2607
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:25,820
at Jurassic Park Cafe like it's just like clean and inoffensive.

2608
01:55:25,820 --> 01:55:27,260
It's not like making any choices.

2609
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:29,420
It's like it's like you'll like it.

2610
01:55:30,140 --> 01:55:31,260
There's something for everyone.

2611
01:55:31,260 --> 01:55:36,940
I mean the food just used to be so dour looking so like getting some mojo pork and the the

2612
01:55:36,940 --> 01:55:38,140
crisp a repas.

2613
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:41,340
Is that what the crispy cornbread stuff looks like?

2614
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:43,740
And crispy plantain.

2615
01:55:43,740 --> 01:55:45,820
It's like well this is this is nice.

2616
01:55:45,820 --> 01:55:46,540
This feels nice.

2617
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:47,100
Yeah.

2618
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:48,140
It is night and day.

2619
01:55:48,140 --> 01:55:48,380
Yeah.

2620
01:55:48,380 --> 01:55:49,500
Fred theme.

2621
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:50,380
So that's good.

2622
01:55:50,380 --> 01:55:51,820
But also I want to have one more.

2623
01:55:51,820 --> 01:55:54,540
I get a drink that comes in a shaving cream can.

2624
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:54,780
Yeah.

2625
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:55,180
Oh.

2626
01:55:55,180 --> 01:55:55,820
It's so fun.

2627
01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:57,020
I mean how how.

2628
01:55:57,020 --> 01:55:58,060
It's so fun.

2629
01:55:58,060 --> 01:55:58,620
Yeah.

2630
01:55:58,620 --> 01:56:01,500
I mean truly that would like make them so much more money.

2631
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:04,940
And for like Harry Potter which they're doing it in another part of the park.

2632
01:56:04,940 --> 01:56:05,980
It's crazy they don't.

2633
01:56:06,620 --> 01:56:06,940
Yeah.

2634
01:56:06,940 --> 01:56:11,100
Like just make it make a dinosaur mug and make them limited edition.

2635
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:13,580
And idiots like me will buy them.

2636
01:56:13,580 --> 01:56:14,060
Absolutely.

2637
01:56:14,060 --> 01:56:14,380
Yeah.

2638
01:56:14,380 --> 01:56:15,020
Yeah.

2639
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:17,100
They're going to be gone soon and I need it now.

2640
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:20,380
Even Springfield even Springfield has kooky like some kooky food.

2641
01:56:20,380 --> 01:56:20,860
Yeah.

2642
01:56:20,860 --> 01:56:22,460
And the Duff and the big donuts.

2643
01:56:22,460 --> 01:56:23,660
The flaming mo at least.

2644
01:56:23,660 --> 01:56:24,380
Yeah.

2645
01:56:24,380 --> 01:56:25,580
Hard on your body.

2646
01:56:27,580 --> 01:56:29,740
They are delicious but you gotta share.

2647
01:56:29,740 --> 01:56:30,620
Yeah they are good.

2648
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:31,500
But you gotta share them.

2649
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:32,780
Well we ate the Grinch donut.

2650
01:56:32,780 --> 01:56:34,860
Yeah we ate the Grinch's face and donut for him.

2651
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:38,940
And then about a week later I ate another Grinch donut.

2652
01:56:38,940 --> 01:56:39,820
Oh my god.

2653
01:56:39,820 --> 01:56:40,460
Wow.

2654
01:56:40,940 --> 01:56:43,020
Now you gotta have your weekly Grinch donut.

2655
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:44,220
Yeah now I'm hooked.

2656
01:56:45,180 --> 01:56:46,300
Which is I'm really hungry now.

2657
01:56:46,300 --> 01:56:47,180
They're not too bready.

2658
01:56:47,180 --> 01:56:51,100
That was my I looked and I was like I bet this is like tricks you and it's actually really bready.

2659
01:56:51,100 --> 01:56:52,140
That was my theory.

2660
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:56,860
Well the Grinch since I haven't actually had a maybe the Springfield one is bready

2661
01:56:56,860 --> 01:56:59,340
but there's so much frosting on the Grinch's face.

2662
01:57:00,140 --> 01:57:00,300
Yeah.

2663
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:01,900
It's a perfect ratio.

2664
01:57:02,620 --> 01:57:03,980
Maybe too much frostings.

2665
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:06,300
So now frosting breakfast every day and.

2666
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:07,100
I have to do it.

2667
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:10,060
And a shark bite to go with it.

2668
01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:13,660
An 11 a.m. shark bite every morning.

2669
01:57:16,220 --> 01:57:17,740
Any closing thoughts anything I don't know.

2670
01:57:18,540 --> 01:57:19,340
It's just fun.

2671
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:19,820
I dug it.

2672
01:57:19,820 --> 01:57:20,860

01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:29,020
I think we've had.

2677
01:57:29,020 --> 01:57:30,140
That's what I intended yeah.

2678
01:57:31,340 --> 01:57:32,060
Break a record.

2679
01:57:32,060 --> 01:57:33,020

Thanks for doing it much appreciated.

2687
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:48,700
You all move a little differently in person than I had imagined.

2688
01:57:48,700 --> 01:57:50,220
Each one in your own way.

2689
01:57:50,220 --> 01:57:52,540
Could you say what you thought I moved like.

2690
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:56,060
You smile more with your eyes than I expected.

2691
01:57:56,060 --> 01:57:56,780
Interesting.

2692
01:57:56,780 --> 01:57:57,280
Wow.

2693
01:57:58,140 --> 01:57:59,580
Because I think my delivery.

2694
01:57:59,580 --> 01:58:00,860
My delivery might be flat.

2695
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:04,780
Pretty flat so I could imagine I'm trying to imagine what I would look like with just

2696
01:58:04,780 --> 01:58:06,220
my voice so I didn't make that make sense.

2697
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:06,620
Wow.

2698
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:07,180
And then.

2699
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:07,580
More heart.

2700
01:58:07,580 --> 01:58:12,220
Jason you're more like your body is more like loose and fluid than I imagined.

2701
01:58:12,220 --> 01:58:13,420
Hey I like that.

2702
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:13,920
And then.

2703
01:58:15,420 --> 01:58:16,380
And then you.

2704
01:58:17,260 --> 01:58:18,700
I'm sorry I just fucked up your name.

2705
01:58:18,700 --> 01:58:20,380
Oh no hey we're in a group of three.

2706
01:58:22,380 --> 01:58:23,260

2707
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:23,900

2708
01:58:23,900 --> 01:58:24,540
Jason you.

2709
01:58:24,540 --> 01:58:26,540
I was on this podcast I don't know who the fuck that was.

2710
01:58:26,540 --> 01:58:27,660
I can't believe anyone knows the names.

2711
01:58:27,660 --> 01:58:28,160
Horrible.

2712
01:58:29,660 --> 01:58:30,460
So no no no.

2713
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:31,500
I'm being on a podcast.

2714
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:32,000
Why?

2715
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,580
And then I was like am I gonna.

2716
01:58:33,580 --> 01:58:37,420
Am I gonna like somehow like trick my way back into fixing this and then I did it.

2717
01:58:37,820 --> 01:58:38,540
No Jason you.

2718
01:58:39,740 --> 01:58:43,900
You like or think you're always thinking and that's something you can't hear on on air.

2719
01:58:44,460 --> 01:58:44,960
You know.

2720
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:46,140
Oh thank you.

2721
01:58:46,140 --> 01:58:47,100
The gears are turning.

2722
01:58:47,100 --> 01:58:47,820
The gears are turning.

2723
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:48,620
I'm looser.

2724
01:58:48,620 --> 01:58:49,820
I think you're looser.

2725
01:58:49,820 --> 01:58:50,940
Physicality.

2726
01:58:50,940 --> 01:58:52,220
I'm stiff as a board.

2727
01:58:52,220 --> 01:58:53,180
No no.

2728
01:58:56,620 --> 01:58:57,980
Thank you I appreciate it.

2729
01:58:59,100 --> 01:59:03,340
We did take some pictures and video at the the open we took a bunch and there's like one or

2730
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:07,100
two where I was like hey I look pretty good at that there's one where I was like oh no

2731
01:59:07,100 --> 01:59:07,820
what happened.

2732
01:59:09,020 --> 01:59:10,940
Isn't that what we all go through.

2733
01:59:10,940 --> 01:59:14,540
Yeah I didn't know I should have got my angle.

2734
01:59:14,540 --> 01:59:15,580
I didn't know my angle in them.

2735
01:59:15,580 --> 01:59:16,700
We gotta know your angles.

2736
01:59:16,700 --> 01:59:19,420
I didn't mean to somehow inspire that type of thinking in you.

2737
01:59:19,420 --> 01:59:20,220
Oh yeah that's.

2738
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:23,020
I was gonna show you and get a compliment and that's what we all do.

2739
01:59:23,020 --> 01:59:24,220
I appreciate your compliment.

2740
01:59:25,180 --> 01:59:26,620
Comedians are the worst.

2741
01:59:28,540 --> 01:59:32,780
Just like like this ride it's so this one really is that when you get off the ride they say

2742
01:59:32,780 --> 01:59:35,660
you survive Jurassic Park the ride and then you exit through the gift shop.

2743
01:59:36,220 --> 01:59:39,500
Charles would you like to plug anything by exiting through the gift shop.

2744
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:44,300
Oh I mean you got a couple more months listening to a podcast that I made that's on earwulf

2745
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:45,980
before it goes on to Stitcher premium.

2746
01:59:45,980 --> 01:59:47,100
Okay okay.

2747
01:59:47,100 --> 01:59:49,900
And then you have to pay for it which no one will.

2748
01:59:50,700 --> 01:59:52,380
Classic earwulf the clock is ticking.

2749
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:52,880
I know.

2750
01:59:56,620 --> 02:00:01,660
It's called the problem with Charles and Casey and I'm sitting on a lot of search party news that I

2751
02:00:01,660 --> 02:00:05,180
will soon be able to reveal when corporate powers allow.

2752
02:00:05,820 --> 02:00:06,780
Very exciting.

2753
02:00:06,780 --> 02:00:09,740
Oh they control all of the information.

2754
02:00:09,740 --> 02:00:13,420
Because you want to make a big splash then when it is revealable.

2755
02:00:13,420 --> 02:00:18,380
Did you tell them that you were going on a theme park podcast and it might be perfect timing.

2756
02:00:18,380 --> 02:00:19,020
Perfect timing.

2757
02:00:19,020 --> 02:00:20,140
And the perfect audience.

2758
02:00:21,180 --> 02:00:23,180
Yeah it's such a direct line.

2759
02:00:26,460 --> 02:00:28,780
Are you releasing a new ride anytime soon.

2760
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:31,660
Oh man I got a couple rides in me.

2761
02:00:31,660 --> 02:00:33,260
Okay all right.

2762
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:38,620
Is there like you have a good where would these announcements be.

2763
02:00:41,180 --> 02:00:43,420
I mean I'll put it on my Instagram.

2764
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:45,340
Instagram what's that name?

2765
02:00:45,340 --> 02:00:46,540
G Charles Rogers.

2766
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:47,260
Okay.

2767
02:00:47,260 --> 02:00:49,580
And it's the French spelling R-O-G-E-R-S.

2768
02:00:52,460 --> 02:00:55,500
Let me ask so you're not a victim of the flattening of culture.

2769
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:57,740
Where can people stream the first two seasons of search party.

2770
02:00:57,740 --> 02:01:01,260
You can stream I mean it's on iTunes it's on the TBS app.

2771
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:06,620
But iTunes you can watch the extended versions which are better and a little longer and funny.

2772
02:01:06,620 --> 02:01:07,420
And have some.

2773
02:01:07,420 --> 02:01:09,900
Oh you don't have to condense it to the airing stand.

2774
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:10,220
Oh wow.

2775
02:01:10,220 --> 02:01:12,300
We have two extra minutes on the extended one.

2776
02:01:12,300 --> 02:01:12,940
So that's great.

2777
02:01:12,940 --> 02:01:13,580
Interesting.

2778
02:01:13,580 --> 02:01:17,260
And then its second season is also on Hulu but not the first season.

2779
02:01:17,260 --> 02:01:22,700
And then soon everything is going to be easier to find and it's going to be great.

2780
02:01:23,740 --> 02:01:26,140
And we shot the third season and we're waiting to release that.

2781
02:01:26,140 --> 02:01:26,780
Oh great great.

2782
02:01:26,780 --> 02:01:27,580
Cool.

2783
02:01:27,580 --> 02:01:29,100
Congrats on everything that's good.

2784
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:29,580
That's great.

2785
02:01:30,460 --> 02:01:30,940
Cool.

2786
02:01:30,940 --> 02:01:37,180
And as for us we are always buying to pay well on Patreon.

2787
02:01:37,180 --> 02:01:39,420
Our second gauge.

2788
02:01:39,420 --> 02:01:42,060
Yeah check out our T public our Twitter our Facebook.

2789
02:01:42,940 --> 02:01:46,540
I guess write a Gmail if you want to send us an email.

2790
02:01:46,540 --> 02:01:49,900
We never tell people to write the reviews.

2791
02:01:49,900 --> 02:01:51,580
I know we got to do it anymore.

2792
02:01:51,580 --> 02:01:53,660
How about one with those Twitter claps.

2793
02:01:53,660 --> 02:01:57,900
Make a point make a real point a good point about the show.

2794
02:01:57,900 --> 02:02:00,940
And put those Twitter claps in there.

2795
02:02:01,820 --> 02:02:02,460
Yeah please.

2796
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:05,340
So yeah dude let's get like they've been stagnant.

2797
02:02:05,340 --> 02:02:07,980
People say that matters getting those reviews.

2798
02:02:07,980 --> 02:02:08,860
So we hear.

2799
02:02:08,860 --> 02:02:09,740
Let's hear.

2800
02:02:09,740 --> 02:02:11,740
I mean I don't know that that's actually real.

2801
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:14,460
I'd like to see the way that it benefits us.

2802
02:02:14,460 --> 02:02:18,860
I think the idea is that when we get a review on Twitter and it's like five stars that shoots

2803
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:20,380
us up in those charts.

2804
02:02:20,380 --> 02:02:23,420
But I don't know who looks at those charts of like the top 20.

2805
02:02:23,980 --> 02:02:25,420
Anyway that's what people say.

2806
02:02:25,420 --> 02:02:26,460
So we have to follow.

2807
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:27,500
We'd like to listen.

2808
02:02:27,500 --> 02:02:29,420
So we like to follow orders.

2809
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:33,660
So to please help us get out of the six hundreds.

2810
02:02:33,660 --> 02:02:35,340
I don't know maybe is that we're in.

2811
02:02:35,340 --> 02:02:35,980
That's pretty good.

2812
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:38,860
We're very lucky.

2813
02:02:38,860 --> 02:02:42,860
But for inflation we're more our podcast is more popular than Dr. Shabak.

2814
02:02:43,740 --> 02:02:44,460
Well that's a fact.

2815
02:02:44,460 --> 02:02:44,700
Yeah.

2816
02:02:46,380 --> 02:02:46,940
All right.

2817
02:02:46,940 --> 02:02:47,340
All right.

2818
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:48,300
Hey I'll do it.

2819
02:02:48,300 --> 02:02:49,100
Thanks for listening.

2820
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:50,300
Like we'll find a way.

2821
02:02:50,300 --> 02:02:51,820
And yeah yeah yeah.

2822
02:02:51,820 --> 02:02:52,540
Yeah goodbye.
