00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,440
Welcome to podcast the ride the second gate and happy holidays as today we're going to

2
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:34,720
be saying the names Tress McNeil Bill Farmer and Charles Fleischer a lot I'm Jason Sheridan

3
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,880
hi I'm Mike Carlson we're gonna be saying these names a lot I thought we would they're they're

4
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,360
notable in this special yeah I mean I think we will be saying those names but I just I

5
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,320
questioned the a lot I hate to I hate to start so combative here but I just think what do you

6
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,160
think a lot is well let's take a guess I'm not gonna not say their names now in a normal way I'm

7
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,280
just wondering let's guess what we would have done look it's probably just going to be a handful

8
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:08,480
of times but I think it's very funny to just list very specific people's names even though

9
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,960
you could argue these are like voice acting legends I think you would yes I don't think

10
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,560
there's an even an argument to be made I wouldn't argue with that they're legends well I think I'm

11
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,320
gonna let me see I'm gonna say the name Bill Farmer today I think maybe once I think I'll

12
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:29,200
say Bill Farmer once that's after this sort of preamble and I'll say Tress McNeil once and

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,120
maybe I'll say Jim Cummings 25 times that's maybe that's the one maybe I'll say Jim Cummings a few

14
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,000
times sure because who knows what the conversation about him where that could take us the freedom

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,400
fighter yeah I could see maybe that being the case but I just you know I'm calling I'm just

16
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:52,240
making my predictions ahead of today's episode you might have also latched on more to the original

17
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:01,040
human characters like their narrator the sad sack Conrad then the minis neighbor Tina sweet

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,080
hungry Tina yes yes so so yes today we're talking about it you've probably seen this in the title

19
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:15,400
we're talking about Mickey's Nutcracker which is a show that I kind of knew existed kind of it's

20
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,520
familiar we've talked about it there's a there's a musical number in it that is very familiar that

21
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,520
I think we have talked about before specifically one one that I feel like has maybe made the rounds

22
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:33,560
more the rest of it yeah but when I was going back through stuff to do for Christmas season I was

23
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,920
like oh Mickey's oh okay it was a special on TV and it was also something that was actually live

24
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,320
at Disneyland which was on the Videopolis stage yeah I think one in 1992 yeah it was on the

25
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:53,040
Videopolis stage and this special aired Christmas 92 I think a big thing that sticks out to me all

26
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:00,280
those voice actors these are like the real deal voice this is an off-brand Doc Brown this is an

27
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:08,120
off-brand that's true it's not off-brand mostly but Paul Winchell who was Tigger for many many

28
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,600
years was not Tigger in this it was Jim Cummings right so you would say maybe at the time people

29
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,440
would be like what is this bullshit where's my Paul Winchell Tigger this sucks fuck Jim Cummings

30
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:31,160
Paul Winchell forever they were okay with him doing the the offstage exterminator voice yes right

31
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:37,640
exactly because he does do other voice of other voice in the show yeah but yes so so mo from as

32
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,920
far as our childhood yes Jim Cummings Tigger is all we've really known as far as new poo in the

33
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:49,640
last I don't know so many years but for the time there probably were Tigger purists who were furious

34
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,520
where's Winchell yeah sucks where's Winchell Winchell lived I feel like he lived to like

35
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,960
2,000 or something crazy but I maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm getting my John Fiedler which I

36
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,520
mispronounced his name who was Piglet on an episode a few weeks ago this one I'm talking

37
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:12,040
about so many wonderful names Paul Winchell well yeah Paul Winchell 2005 okay because Paul

38
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,800
Winchell also I knew Paul Winchell because he was a ventriloquist he had a dummy you know what I'm

39
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:24,200
talking about kind of you weren't a Paul Winchell guy I don't know if I was a Paul Winchell guy I

40
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:30,040
don't know that I was ever much ventriloquist guy you never were a bit who's your favorite hey

41
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,840
wait let's go who's your favorite ventriloquist I don't know if I have one I think Slappy from

42
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,720
Goosebumps just scared me well he's a scary guy but do you think maybe I mean are you a Dunham

43
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,720
maybe you're a new ventriloquist guy maybe that's more of your style Terry Fader you love Vegas well

44
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:52,280
I I do love Vegas and you know I I just get a little started by those ones because I'm not

45
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,520
sure what's going to be coming out of those dummy's mouths well that's fair I mean Paul

46
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,080
Winchell had the like the Jerry Mahoney doll like that's what you know you hear that reference a

47
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,640
lot yeah um and it's a pretty like you here I have his pictures right here first of all Paul

48
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,400
Winchell kind of a hunk if you really look at him kind of a hunk and there he is with

49
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,360
with his dummy who looks like you know Slappy looks like Night of the Living yeah he look that's

50
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:24,440
like a classic ventriloquist and kind of has the same less handsome look but kind of looks like him

51
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,800
vaguely okay Paul Winchell with Jerry Mahoney and he had another character named Knucklehead

52
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,520
Smith oh I like that I want to see Knucklehead Smith well yeah there he is right there

53
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:43,880
M-S-M-I-F-F but this famous ventriloquist was Tigger's voice Knucklehead Smith is more put

54
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:51,160
together than I would have thought Smith it's M-I-F-F yeah he's got kind of like a track jacket on

55
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,680
and then Jerry Mahoney has kind of a James Bond like that white like suit jacket with the black

56
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:04,440
bow tie he looks very and they're both making eyes at Paul Winchell for a name uh a character

57
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:12,200
named Knucklehead he has an awfully like well put together turtleneck ensemble yeah I mean look we

58
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,640
can look into more into Knucklehead in the future because I don't I'll be honest I don't know a

59
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,160
ton about Knucklehead look at this top of the episode I was doubting you that we would say

60
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,560
names and you but if you had said Paul Winchell I would immediately have proven you right because

61
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,640
I've said Paul Winchell about 10 times by now I just for some reason I didn't think we were

62
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:33,320
gonna say Bill Farmer that much I don't know I just latched on that that one no I'm saying I'm more

63
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,200
for the audience I guess I'm totally wrong is what I'm saying I guess you would have been 100%

64
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,360
I'm apologizing I'm saying like 100 you would have been 100% right if you had said well say the

65
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,880
name Paul Winchell a million times or Knucklehead Smith which we've already said seven or eight

66
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:54,440
times oh man this episode of course is Scott Frey always oh is it I didn't notice he's not

67
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:00,440
not here he was just looking for a moment uh we're talking about the handsomeness of dummies oh I

68
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,120
guess Scott isn't here you're right I didn't notice that he wasn't oh I guess I forgot we're gonna

69
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:10,600
have to get him up to speed because the audience on club three voted they wanted to hear oh yes

70
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:18,760
they did yes check in they wanted to hear uh Papa Scott's feedback on the Scott Frey episode so now

71
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:25,480
we have we tell about uh Paul Winchell Jerry Mahoney Knucklehead Smith this is very exciting

72
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,920
well we tell them about the Paul Winchell and Jerry Mahoney show uh which was also sponsored by Tootsie

73
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,320
Roll you know or it had featured a clubhouse motif and a theme song co-written by Winchell

74
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:42,120
and his longtime bandleader and on-air sidekick Milton the Lug oh wow you say the best for last

75
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:49,080
Milton the Lug I'm gonna be spending the rest of the day looking up Milton the Lug yes uh so okay

76
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,760
let's pivot back to Mickey's Nutcracker yes which has a lot of the big voices that we recognize

77
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:01,000
Rucy Taylor Minnie Mouse up until a few years ago she did Minnie until she was like 90 or something

78
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,040
she's in this um but yeah they got it all there's no there's there's not many uh fake sounding

79
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:15,880
voices in this I'll say that yeah I mean it's crazy how much the company as a whole has memory

80
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:23,320
hold Roger Rabbit like Roger Rabbit used to be a heavy hitter oh yeah I know he used to be a main

81
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:30,280
eventer number they put him in the slot like the the main event slot up in up in like what a year

82
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,240
I guess when the movie came out it wasn't even a year late like he was just one of the big six seven

83
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,360
whatever we call it he was one of them yeah he probably was higher than Chippendale at the time

84
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,200
even though rescue rangers was happening but yeah he was everywhere uh and then yes they slowly got

85
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,960
rid of him I feel like he lasted into the 90s but he is yeah he has not been there and then there's

86
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,440
we've speculated on this before because there's been different like dialogue about why there's

87
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,920
not more Roger Rabbit going on I forget who somebody was pitching a show to Disney recently

88
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,600
and they tweeted this I think that they were like oh there's too many people that own the

89
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,760
rights to Roger Rabbit it's not something Disney outright owns yeah it's a legal quagmire between

90
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:18,760
right Disney and I guess Amblin or yeah something like yeah yeah right some sort of Katzenberg

91
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:25,240
Spielberg but then they were somebody was asking Robert Zemeckis about it and his answer was just

92
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,000
like yeah they're not going to use Jessica anymore did you see what they did to her at Disneyland

93
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,240
they put a coat on her yeah so he went more with that route and almost blamed it on that that like

94
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,440
Disney is afraid of Jessica Rabbit which is something I've heard uh lately or I guess in the

95
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,600
last few years and I guess it would it would back up what he's saying because they literally

96
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,960
threw a coat on her like they did throw a coat on her that's not making that up as if there's

97
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:57,000
not millions of styles of evening gowns but they are afraid of her ample bosom

98
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,320
like that's what Disney doesn't they're like worried about that I guess well wait but don't

99
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,840
you know she's not bad she's just drawn that way I know she said that so I guess maybe there's a

100
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,720
little bit of both still preventing Roger from having his big comeback yeah I think everybody

101
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,840
would like Roger to have a comeback but they kind of went separate paths almost because like Roger

102
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:22,520
Rapids in all these parades it's in all these state shows doesn't necessarily mean Jessica there

103
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:28,360
was there I mean Jessica so you want to get rid of your island you would get rid of Jessica in

104
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,720
a future Roger Rabbit project are you saying they could do it hypothetically uh no I don't

105
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,520
want to get rid of her at all oh you want to get rid of Roger and just have a sexy Jessica Rabbit

106
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:44,120
I'm just saying there was a point where like Jessica's was at Pleasure Island yes her kind

107
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,920
of own separate thing Roger Rap was doing stage shows baby Huey was hanging around

108
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:56,120
baby Huey was hanging around I feel like well remember there was going to be a baby Huey like

109
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,880
ride based on that one short that was oh you're talking about they were no no no not baby Huey

110
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:07,000
you're talking about the baby from oh baby oh god is it well I can't think of his name now

111
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,720
now all I can think of is baby Huey from Harvey comics is it baby Oscar what's his no that's baby

112
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,920
Oscar's from Ghostbusters 2 why can't I think of baby I all I can think of is what baby Huey

113
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,960
looks like in my head I have a complete block how how fast are you typing on an iPad I am looking

114
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:29,400
at baby why can't I think of his name I can see his baby face it's not boss baby it's not uh uh

115
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:37,320
Kenneth babyface Edmonds no that rmb legend singer producer that's not him who baby baby it's not

116
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,560
baby Sherman how is it taking you this long to google because I pulled up his wikipedia I'm

117
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:52,520
googling now and uh that's baby Herman baby Herman there we go I forgot there was like a bunch of I

118
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:58,280
couldn't pull it either I I forgot there was a bunch of books so then half the wikipedia you

119
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,960
started reading a book to try to find his name I was trying to scroll down to who framed Roger

120
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:09,320
Rabbit uh-huh oh god that's embarrassing I've embarrassed myself so many times on this episode

121
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,400
already I I squawked at the idea of saying names and then I couldn't find baby Herman's name in

122
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:21,240
my brain anyway yes you so you could split all three of them up and and do something with them

123
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:27,560
I mean they can get back together I mean that yeah the the uh Chippendale movie that went to

124
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:35,400
plus who we know friends of friends the writers of like that uh is like getting the gang back

125
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:41,240
together sure yeah which also another Tress McNeil project because she's gadget well she's in

126
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,000
everything she's in everything she's a legend always the voice of chip I don't think I ever

127
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:56,120
knew that oh uh what do you mean always uh good question uh maybe in the 80s or 90s she took over

128
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,680
yeah I I yeah it's interesting to see like when certain people took over then some people took

129
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,520
over like Jim Cummings some people would take over here and there they wouldn't take over

130
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,400
completely yeah there's always like a weird like it's it's there's starts and stops to some of the

131
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,960
people's voice so you are just dunking on my ass about how many times we're gonna say these names

132
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,560
I feel just humiliated now from I look I was just trying to have fun with it no no I'm your dunk I

133
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,440
mean you're low-key donkey you're not a cocky dunker like I would be if I had if I had proven

134
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,440
you wrong at the start I would just be like celebrating you're just low-keying it that you've

135
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:35,720
proven correct your assessment I I am trying oh you know and just a humble man I'm just a simple

136
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:44,360
man it's a man I much like the uh Nutcracker Mickey Nutcracker who comes to life he is not

137
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,920
you know uh let's talk about the Nutcracker real quick because I feel like I mean Nutcracker

138
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,560
people have had Nutcracker mania during Christmas season for many years but I feel like in our

139
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:01,400
childhood specifically I was just bombarded with Nutcracker we went to see uh like a local ballet

140
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,920
do Nutcracker we did too Philadelphia always did it every year I feel like just so much Nutcracker

141
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,920
and then obviously so much of the music especially Dance of the Sugarplum Fairies you know it's in a

142
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,320
Nestle commercial it's playing it's playing in a every Christmas commercial you were just

143
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:27,800
bombarded with it did you like the Nutcracker oh I loved it I did I think um catching bits and

144
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:34,840
bobs on tv of the actual story of the ballet element I would sometimes be very unnerved

145
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:44,280
or like I forgot there's a character called the Rat King and uh this one has a very happy ending

146
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,480
right I would say and I I couldn't really Mickey version yeah in the Mickey version

147
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:58,120
yeah yeah uh I I did not like the Nutcracker but I don't I did not appreciate it as a child

148
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,960
it didn't do so much for me as a child now obviously if I heard Rat King I wanted my

149
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,600
Ninja Turtles villain Rat King that's what I wanted yes so I was like who's this fucking

150
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,120
poser this isn't the Rat King sure the guy who lives under the sewer and terrorizes my friends

151
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:22,520
but obviously like in hindsight the music is is great is is great and I'm not really a good

152
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:29,240
assess I'm not good at assessing uh how good ballets are in general no ballets or opera

153
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:38,120
symphonies I can appreciate it as enjoyable but I I can't really track the like ah and that's

154
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:44,920
kind of a funny like that's uh you know that twinkling is a bit out of form like oh that

155
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:50,440
little look at that little comical twirl they did yeah I am chuckling to myself that's not the way

156
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:57,880
you'd normally twirl ha ha ha I mean this one uh jump to jump ahead a little this one is a little

157
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:05,800
funny because it's like oh the toy soldiers come out and they all start tap dancing well they they

158
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:12,280
popped I don't know what would I call it they modernized the Nutcracker and the music in a

159
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:18,680
lot of ways to certain levels of success I would say uh uh they did not just go with like traditional

160
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:25,080
arrangements of of the Nutcracker this was on the Videopolis stage it's about a half hour long it's

161
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:31,800
it's yeah 20 whatever it can air in a 30 minute block or whatever it's uh interesting it's an

162
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,120
interesting thing and it really feels like they went all out to promote it there's ads for it

163
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,920
there's I found merch I don't know if you found some merch there's oh I didn't see merch pins

164
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:46,200
there's an actual like little Mickey's Nutcracker thing here and some of it's hard to know because

165
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,080
because Mickey Nutcracker stuff is also just common I feel like around the holidays so it's

166
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,240
hard to tell if it's an actual tie-in to the Disneyland show or the special I believe there

167
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:03,000
was an animated short later on called Mickey's Nutcracker on one of the kind of the whole gang

168
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,800
seer Ludwig von Drake is as a short and then Mickey and then Goofy and Minnie and that's the

169
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:16,120
half hour yes um so I guess Mickey and Nutcracker have happened before and they will happen again

170
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,840
um but yeah so so your take before we even start talking about this did you like this

171
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:31,640
I did like this I was I felt a little silly early on because I was like who are all these original

172
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:40,200
human characters is the is the party going to be the full half hour and then they do Nutcracker

173
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:48,760
segments and then the humans get reused as like uh don't I know you it's like no I'm the mayor

174
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:56,120
of Candyland you know like right or Goofy and Pluto and Chip and Dale all show up in other roles

175
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:03,400
too right so because because the Nutcracker itself is like a child having a fantasy a dream

176
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:12,600
yes essentially where like a Nutcracker comes to life and then there's like a Rat King and bad guys

177
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:20,680
and this kind of transitions to dream like elements I mean I feel like Minnie never really

178
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:29,400
goes to sleep but a bunch of mystical creatures crash the after party basically yes yes um but

179
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,520
it basically yeah there's there's Minnie's having a party she has a bunch of strange human neighbors

180
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,400
and then she sees a Nutcracker that looks like Mickey and she's like this is a handsome

181
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:50,440
fucking Nutcracker yeah well it's gifted to her by the narrator yes um and she is she is sort of

182
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:56,280
blown away by his attractiveness um I guess yeah let's there is a narrator which I thought was

183
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,480
interesting because I feel like they wanted to fill in some gaps narratively especially for like

184
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,480
a theme park show where you'd have to be like all right and here's here's what's actually going on

185
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:13,640
and he's not totally in like an orb far away or whatever he pops into the show a few times

186
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:19,160
they're like hey mr narrator like yeah that's kind of fun as a kid I really liked when they

187
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:24,200
would break the fourth wall like that you know yes I also enjoyed fourth wall breaking um I

188
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,560
don't know I guess I play a clip of him just so you can get a vibe of the the narrator and

189
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:34,600
how this special works everyone and welcome to Mickey's Nutcracker our magical story begins here

190
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,920
once upon a time at Minnie's house on Christmas Eve Minnie was hosting an elegant ball and all

191
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:46,360
of her friends were there well that's Minnie in the beautiful blue gown hello she's with her dog

192
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,160
Pluto

193
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,480
and then there's more singing um so yeah you get the you get the gist of of how it goes um

194
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,120
the narrator yes he's very folksy and then here's what's interesting i also think they've sort of

195
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,960
retconned that pluto is minnie's dog that immediately had to pause it oh yeah wrote down

196
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,080
pluto is minnie's dog in this did you did that take you i kind of took me out of it as far as the

197
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,760
of the narrative well i figured it would be explained and then it dawned on me it was called

198
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:44,760
mickey's nutcracker and i'm like oh he doesn't live there he's the nutcracker right in this

199
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:51,640
well in this version mickey is doesn't exist no that's right mickey doesn't exist in this

200
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,240
universe minnie is the one who has pluto because pluto doesn't have an owner

201
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:01,320
yeah so really you're seeing a version this is in a sort of an else world story where

202
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:08,360
mickey is created with magic he's created from a wood is created with magic and i i thought of like

203
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:16,840
an old i was trying to think of it was more maywest or ethyl merman and will come into play

204
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:23,080
or uh like charles knows where i live like uh just like a woman she just wants to couple up

205
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:31,880
with their toys there is and then i that joke turned out to be very prescient uh yes yes there

206
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:38,040
this this guy has got is giving a big performance uh uh here and he's got a nice purple suit on

207
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:43,640
which i really like and it's interesting because i you don't see i don't know you don't see shows

208
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:51,320
like this again anymore as much like at the actual parks i feel like um no and especially

209
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:58,040
the human characters i was like oh are we gonna follow all these human characters and then of

210
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:05,240
course in its sense we do because they show up in sort of a wizard of odds setup yeah i mean you

211
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,240
see i mean okay i saw deadpool and wolverine's holiday show at disneyland a couple weeks ago

212
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,120
so they're doing little things like that but that's just a little backdrop and two performers

213
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:22,520
not a big wow stage show with a bunch of song and dance just some glib remarks and

214
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:31,160
yeah it's uh was it my favorite show i've ever seen it was not you know that was kind of a running

215
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:38,440
thread at this season as we're kind of uh re looking at christmas stuff yeah i was like will

216
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:44,840
you do that or we do jingle cruise or we do but then you've just been like knocking out of the

217
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,600
park finding these specials the thanksgiving special this special yes i've been knocking it

218
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:56,440
out of the park i agree um but yes so that was a yes there were other ideas there's always other

219
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,080
ideas for what we're episodes we're going to do there's plenty of other things i almost feel like

220
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:06,280
scott has sent me a file i think he kind of wanted to do this too um but we're still scott free so he

221
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,240
has sent me a file of something we will play a little bit later here oh that's nice i always

222
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:17,240
like when he does that he does yes he's he makes his presence felt he's here in spirit he's here

223
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,640
in spirits uh um but yes so so what i also like about this all the characters are dressed for a

224
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:30,600
party chip and dale have suits on with no pants chip and dale have like bow ties on and cummer

225
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:37,320
buns on but no pants and this just i don't know why this makes me happy i don't know why this was

226
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:44,520
the choice many years ago for cartoon characters i don't know yeah what cartoon character innovated

227
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:50,360
the formal wear but no pants i know there's so many examples of it so many i mean donald

228
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,720
yeah well when big bird dresses up he wears the little like dicky thing around his neck but he

229
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,680
doesn't want any pants he just wears the thing up on on the top and it really it looks to me it's

230
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,760
all it always just like looks kind of like if you were to put that on like a performer it would look

231
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,320
like a chip and dale's dancer or something did you see um there was an image going around the

232
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:16,760
internet of like i don't know if it's on streaming on 2b or if it's current crop of

233
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:25,800
looney toons collections on hbo max but they like they they doodled pants on porky pig

234
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:32,200
they doodled pants there's like photoshop pants oh right you're saying very odd looking you're

235
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:38,680
saying some uptight sensor drew pants on porky pig i guess so because they didn't want people

236
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:45,880
to be offended by seeing his like his smooth pig underside yeah he looked a little like the

237
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:53,720
la county fair mascot oh yeah that eva evan amy are we going to be able to think of the name of

238
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,880
the character no we're not are we not going to think of this character we're going to both

239
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:04,280
sit here and get frustrated not being able to think of the uh something bird the bird fulberg

240
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:10,920
what's his name thummer thummer oh i knew i had the th in there i had the th in there thummer yes

241
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:16,040
he does look like that so i don't know i think that is look you know what all these uh uh

242
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:21,240
conservatives complaining about cancel culture this i'll say this that's my line in the sand

243
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:29,400
you had porky pig with pants no way bullshit don't censor porky pig's butt or his smooth crotch

244
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:36,200
yeah i want to see it okay leave that alone if you're gonna put in like a flare let's see

245
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,800
that curly little tail so oh you're saying you're okay with the pants if you can see porky's curly

246
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:47,400
little tail poking out of a hole in the butt or like you had a like septum pier like i'm like

247
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:52,680
if porky pig had a septum piercing or a belly button ring i don't know if he was just trying

248
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:57,960
some stuff out an older age midlife crisis what can you get can you get a tail piercing if you're

249
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:03,960
a pig i mean i guess they probably tag pigs in real life but he could have like a tail piercing

250
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:12,040
or something have a tiny tail piercing of the red circles and it says that's all folks really small

251
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:16,280
okay like could he have like a big hoop earring on the back of his tail that would be kind of cool

252
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,760
sure or just on one of his ears so you're saying you would be comfortable with him wearing pants

253
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,520
as long as you could see his different piercings on his lower body no i'm not comfortable with the

254
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:30,840
pants at all i'm saying additive uh you want to see his naked lower half and you want to see where

255
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:37,640
he's pierced yeah okay i mean i can't argue with that i'm fine if they want to add piercings to

256
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:43,320
porky pig i'm comfortable with that but as far as the pants no that's where i draw the line i mean

257
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:49,720
nothing great not like a taint piercing or whatever or i wasn't gonna say taint piercing no you brought

258
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:55,320
it in well would you be offended if you got a tape taint piercing you know it's really not my

259
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,760
business i think i would be shocked initially but i'm like i guess live your life man you're

260
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:07,720
you're older now you know have some fun in your later years you're saying because he's an older

261
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:14,440
guy he's now experimenting with things maybe and that's okay you wouldn't judge him i mean he's not

262
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,720
like your kid or something where you're gonna say hey maybe you don't get your taint pierced

263
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:24,280
yeah yeah right but you're saying godspeed porky pierce that taint maybe start with a little stud

264
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:30,840
a little like harrison ford stud stud in his taint no it is here you said yes all right yeah is that

265
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,080
how you would get a taint piercing you would have a stud in your taint first and then you know we've

266
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,880
moved on from taint i was just saying no we have not moved on from taint i'm actually just asking

267
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,640
so i'm saying like but you you get a little tiny ear pierce that's how you when you pierce your ears

268
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,840
you start with a little thing you don't go with like that big hoop if you want to do that thing

269
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,000
where you get the big like kind of hole in your ear oh i don't work up to that i'm just saying

270
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,280
you gotta work up to that right so i would assume it would be the same with taint you would get a

271
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:59,560
little stud in your taint and then you would work up to a bigger item your bigger earring a taint

272
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:05,640
ring or whatever don't you think i guess so you wouldn't want to get some crazy taint ring no

273
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:11,080
that's that's advanced level yes because it would hurt you you would want to work up for sure yeah

274
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,240
yeah i think that's i know i'm staring at a picture of paul winchell in his dummy right now

275
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:22,760
that is not what i wanted to do uh oh are you staring at uh uh knucklehead or are you staring

276
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:30,360
at knucklehead smith yeah or jerry mahoney no i'm so well i was staring at jerry and paul

277
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,520
knucklehead is down you have to scroll down to get to knucklehead smith okay the other yeah uh no

278
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:43,560
okay i'm going back to mickey's nutcracker here i swear um yes so so let's go to let's like i

279
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:49,640
i when mickey shows up as a nutcracker they've they've made this little fun little mickey thing

280
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:56,280
and minnie brings him out and i guess i'll play well we've gotten all the character the humans

281
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:07,000
conrad is a lonely man he's a lonely uh man minnie's lonely friend conrad is what they say

282
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,720
yes and he's the one that goofy is consoling yeah basically and goofy's trying to get soul

283
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:19,800
and like tina just keeps taking any sweet she can yeah and etho seems like she's just like the party

284
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:26,440
yes and this dynamic i'm kind of like are they talking to tina like hey will you just

285
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:33,160
make out with conrad or just like just hold company like just hands he's gonna pass out

286
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:38,280
anyway you think they're gonna like etho did it last year you know it's do you think that they're

287
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:43,800
gonna try to talk one of the carrot of the female characters into just kissing yeah a pity kiss a

288
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:50,040
pity you mean just like a pack on the cheek you think a pack or like over the clothes stuff or

289
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:56,520
like you think goofy's gonna go oh gosh tina what'd you do over the clothes stuff with conrad

290
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:04,600
she's not gonna remember anyway you think bill farmer is gonna say that dialogue i don't know

291
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:11,160
the bill farmer well i don't think bill farmer is gonna say i'm not saying this this is dirty

292
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:17,400
stuff that's true goofy to say i'm just saying it would probably be like look this would be

293
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:24,840
less of a headache you know minnie is kind of focusing on herself right now we are we're a

294
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:32,440
little worried about conrad getting in cell vibes and it feels like a slippery slope so i don't know

295
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,080
i mean i think i mean goofy should just give him a hug or something goofy just give him a hug and

296
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:43,160
a kiss on the cheek and be like you're nice guy he could be just physically contact deprived

297
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:51,400
yeah right conrad here you go kiss if you focus on your interest and try stepping out of your

298
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:58,840
comfort zone volunteering or taking a cookie class you might meet someone conrad mentions that he's

299
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:04,760
very rich he talks about how much money he has but that says that does not apparently seem to help

300
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:11,240
him with his his romance yeah well then you got to worry it's like do they just like me for the

301
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:16,360
money are they just pretending goofy also seems like he's kind of like he feels bad for this guy

302
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:22,680
conrad now i don't know why they spend so much time flushing these human characters out because

303
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:30,200
no one gives a shit about them no offense no conrad and ethyl i their character gains come back

304
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:36,200
a little right but but we're all here we're here to hear the dance of the sugar plum fairies we're

305
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,480
here to see mickey come to life we're here to see mickey and minnie fall in love in this universe

306
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:48,360
yes and the humans are a lot more fun once they become like magical yes well sure i mean who isn't

307
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:54,120
going to become more fun when they're magical yeah honestly but you know they do so they do and

308
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,480
i mentioned this earlier they do like sort of number so i guess i don't know we could walk

309
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:03,400
through this more as it happens but yes they minnie is talking about mickey as the nutcracker and

310
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:09,160
he's just a little wooden doll and she's like oh this doll is so hot this doll is so attractive

311
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:17,560
thank you for coming merry christmas everyone according to the grandfather clock it was way

312
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,920
past minnie's bedtime but she was way too excited to sleep i'm much too excited to even think about

313
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:30,520
sleeping all i want to do is dance with my handsome nutcracker all night long so minnie has lost her

314
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:34,840
mind apparently at the end of this party all she wants to do is dance with the nutcracker

315
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:41,960
and again he's a wooden nutcracker he's not alive yet so what's going on with minnie

316
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:50,200
look he's he's handsome and he can't talk back it's an ideal situation are you doing are you

317
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:56,200
channeling the ghost of pauline tonight with with your retorts with your i think okay good he said

318
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:03,160
it changes i've forged in life so minnie is dancing with her little wooden boy

319
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:11,560
all night long as the clock strikes midnight and then struck 12 midnight something wonderfully

320
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:20,920
strange and magical happened

321
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,960
like stuff is like hatless the stage is kind of coming up it's like move

322
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,720
everything is moving up yeah uh and yeah minnie's like oh my god my house is coming apart

323
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:51,560
what the fuck is going on two bolts of purple lightning strike the nutcracker

324
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,680
scary kind of bolts like it almost like power rangers style boats bolts of electricity

325
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:04,280
shoot into this nutcracker and bring him to life minnie is not afraid at all she just goes

326
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:10,680
holy shit there's a hunk in my living room it's christmas time fucking as deadpool would say

327
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:16,920
let's let's fucking go yeah she's just totally on board right away um and mickey is wearing

328
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:23,640
uh a fun nutcracker outfit um blue red i don't know why i mean it's you know it's nutcracker

329
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,960
shit it looks like this and he kind of does a little nutcracker march as he walks into the

330
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:36,920
room um i i can't believe it why this is strange and magical you're alive you bet

331
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:43,720
why every christmas eve me and my friends come to life your friends you mean there's somebody with

332
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,760
uh-huh

333
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:54,520
mickey salutes uh as if his superior officer has just shown up and he explains that at midnight

334
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:00,440
he and his friends come to life every christmas and then a bunch of female toy soldiers come out

335
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:08,360
of a big present yeah and minnie is just happy she's happy to see these toy soldier ladies

336
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:14,680
i mean wouldn't fire minnie i feel like i'd want the nutcracker at all to myself bunch of show girls

337
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:19,000
just showed up this is what i'm getting at there's a bunch of show girls just entered the room and

338
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,480
you'd be like okay is mickey really that interested in me or does he want to have some sort of weird

339
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,440
party what is this all about yeah what is this guy but no she's she's sort of on board and she

340
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:35,640
she thinks it's fun and at this point like this is a point let me guess what scott would say scott

341
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:41,480
would say i don't necessarily like human beings being toy soldiers i just have a guess because

342
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:47,080
to me it feels adjacent to raggedy and raggedy andy it sort of feels in the same genre of like

343
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:53,320
painted face maybe big circles on the cheeks yeah there's obviously like it's just doll humans being

344
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:59,800
dolls or being toys and now they're big and i i don't totally disagree with him about that i

345
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:06,600
think he has more of a revulsion to that than i do but i'm i don't disagree what is your take on

346
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:14,600
when adults dress as like toys or dolls um i think i'm okay with it i grew up with some

347
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:22,040
toy soldier ornaments and some raggedy and andy but those are regular that's what they're supposed

348
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:30,280
to look like i'm saying a human being full-sized raggedy and raggedy i i often i don't know that

349
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:39,480
it lends itself to full-sized actor portraying so you're kind of agreeing on some level yeah i think

350
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:46,920
like fur quote unquote fur costume raggedy and andy a little more acceptable they look doll-like

351
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,080
so you're saying as long as not a human face you're more comfortable with it face

352
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,600
you know limber human body is that the term for what not you don't have a human face on

353
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:02,440
the costume a fur costume well i've always heard face character that's like walk around peter

354
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,640
peter panham fur character fur oh that's interesting i you know what i real quick real

355
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:12,040
quick tangent uh there's something called the doodah parade that happens in pasadena

356
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,000
yeah which you know you're familiar with this yeah it happens in ocean city new jersey too

357
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,320
oh it's a sister those are the two doodah so you do know about the do i do know and you gotta look

358
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:29,320
at the grand marshals of the ocean city one this year was just a guy from the fly who used to play

359
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:34,200
for the flyers i saw the doodah parade this year in pasadena for the first time ever and i was

360
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,880
very interested there were people there that were trying to make like serious political statements

361
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,760
there were there were furries marching it was a real interesting assortment of characters

362
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,560
but all the furry costumes were really nice they just like the furries had really good costumes

363
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:52,760
there are some very impressive fursuits out there for sure right and i just wonder yeah because like

364
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:59,400
fursona like i wonder i hear fur more now in in the in the furry like used with furries but when

365
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,280
you say face and fur characters i wonder when that started i wonder when that term started i don't

366
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,680
know i'm not sure but it sounds like you're sort of on the same page with us about like kind of

367
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:17,080
being it's off-putting to see like dull come-to-life people on stage for the nutcracker yeah i think if

368
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:22,120
they're standing far away in a parade float waving yeah i'm a little more okay with that

369
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:28,440
as long as you don't see the horror the facial horror i don't know if i want to see them doing

370
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,160
dialogue i don't know if i wouldn't see the one sitting at a kitchen table going

371
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,800
where were you you wait wait you weren't supposed to be up this late you wait you don't want to see

372
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,840
like raggedy ann being mad at you for staying out too late with the fellas i don't want to see cat on

373
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:50,600
the hot tin roof playing gary glenn ross raggedy so she's got like one arm in the air one arm down

374
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:57,000
and her eyes are like this and she's like jason where were you i waited up all night i'm worried

375
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:04,040
no one told you to do that who were you out with i was out with co-workers were you out with a sexy

376
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:09,960
nutcracker woman where do you get this stuff i just know that you work with that adult-sized

377
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:16,200
nutcracker at work and maybe you are out at the out having a drink with her there were other people

378
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:22,520
there jason you're drunk i would sing a song that raggedy ann and raggedy ann sang but i don't know

379
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:27,240
anything about them past uh what i've said on this show there were some i feel like there were

380
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:33,960
some cheapy world of deke grinded out cartoons oh there were plenty yeah yeah for sure so we'll get

381
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,040
into that too but i feel like i know more about paul winchell and jerry mahoney and knucklehead

382
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:43,320
smith than i do raggedy ann and raggedy ann let me play a clip from this song not that it's

383
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,640
anything that special but i'm just trying to give you a flavor of what this is what these songs are

384
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:58,760
like

385
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,960
so they've taken a classic song and they've desecrated it with some

386
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:18,680
bullshit they've jazzed up like they've jazzed it up they've added lyrics and i will say i think

387
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:25,560
it sucks i think i don't like i don't know i need the lyrics but i like a little jazzy i like a

388
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,560
little tap i was gonna say i don't think you can ever say you don't like something if there's a

389
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,760
little tap involved if there's some tap tap tapping with tap shoes i think you're gonna find something

390
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:41,320
to like about it i'm not anti-tap i just feel like i like the original versions of these songs a lot

391
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:48,440
and i feel like it wasn't necessarily a good idea to add lyrics and a tap routine in it but i don't

392
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,040
i understand they're trying to do something different with it i guess they do it in some

393
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:57,960
of the others but that's the most noticeable i feel like you mean other versions of nutcracker

394
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:06,360
in this show oh yes no they do they do yeah okay oh yeah there's other like modern quote-unquote

395
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:15,720
versions of tchaikovsky songs got what's his full name peter uh uh uh ilyich tchaikovsky i just

396
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,960
want to say his full name because it's fun to say i've got some background for you on the ocean

397
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,240
city dude oh go go for it please a build is a salute to humor and comedy thank you yeah

398
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:32,600
featuring impersonators of groucho marx charlie chaplin maryland mumrow of his presley abbott

399
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:40,760
and costello celebrity comedians and tv stars have served of grand marshals including uh jone

400
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:48,520
rivers yes joe franklin larry storch mickey rooney soupy sales were we talking about this

401
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:52,920
in relation to mickey rooney or was it a different parade that he was a grand marshal of that's when

402
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,640
we were talking about you being a grand marshal in a parade yeah yeah i don't know if it was a

403
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,560
doodop parade but it was another i mean mickey rooney being grand marshal maybe there was a

404
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:07,960
was it a super bowl halftime show i think so yeah i bet but how many times has mickey rooney been

405
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:13,000
a grand marshal in a parade i bet the answer is over 50 i think he's been the grand marshal

406
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,800
at the doodop parade multiple times i wouldn't be shocked um but yeah so there's as i said there

407
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,880
modern versions of things which i it's just a little too schmaltzy for me it's adding like

408
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:30,840
extra broadway crap on top of like uh great music great christmas music but i get that like some of

409
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,720
those songs are a little bit downbeat they're a little melancholy so you want to jazz them up

410
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:45,000
you want to do a little fun a fun thing um but let's get to uh uh the rats let's get to

411
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:54,600
the rats because there are many human zoobily zoo style rat characters in this yeah they're mouthy

412
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,920
they're got a bad attitude

413
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:09,560
oh yes this is my favorite part of the story these are the evil but not very bright hensch rats

414
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:21,560
what's happening look out here comes trouble

415
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:34,200
so you got the heavy metal version now of that song and up through the floor comes human

416
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,480
rat man and there with his rat henchmen also are coming up he looks like in some ways king

417
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:46,040
koopa from king koopa's cool cartoons which we talked about a year ago or something he's very

418
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:51,800
much in that like 80s 90s vibe of what it looks like when a human dresses up as an anthropomorphic

419
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,440
yeah animal uh but yeah i said zoobily zoo already which is what it makes me think of

420
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:02,040
which was a weird show i watched on pbs um but he comes up and he yes as you said he is mouthy

421
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:09,720
and he's a real wiseacre i would say he is a real uh wiseacre but they also in so many words warn

422
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:19,320
he is dumb as shit this is the evil rat king nice to meet you a long time ago a terrible

423
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:24,360
curse was placed on a handsome prince which turned him into the creature you see before you

424
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,600
now it says here that the only thing that can remove the curse is the very thing that

425
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:38,360
rat kings hate the most sugar hey what was that about sugar i was uh telling them how much you

426
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:46,520
don't like sugar that's right i don't like sugar he really does have like i guess he does have like

427
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:52,920
a rizzo the rat style voice which i find interesting rizzo the rat kind of buzz buzz

428
00:44:53,800 --> 00:45:00,360
but meanie a little uh-huh but what is the first rat like when you this is the kind of voice yeah

429
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:05,560
you're here but when it was just the first vote like who did the first rat that sounded like that

430
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:15,240
was he just i always think of it as like the bad guy greasers heavy who's wearing 3d glasses all

431
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,680
the time well yeah and that's the back to the future yeah there's been plenty of characters

432
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,920
that have the voice that weren't rats i just wonder was there a specific rat maybe that was

433
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,400
given yeah i'm giving this voice i got this voice yeah i don't know i don't know the answer to it

434
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:33,400
but this i don't either this rat has the same sort of rizzo style obviously rizzo is a nice character

435
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,960
or he's a little you know he's a little shady but he's not a terrible guy or anything now i

436
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:44,200
i think i was chasing the dog around trying to get in calm down as this was playing but i

437
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,800
totally forgot i got really into the musical numbers and the classic music as he explained

438
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:59,000
okay he was a prince turned into a rat he doesn't like sugar because sugar can undo the like that's

439
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,440
a lot of backstory yes it is a lot of backstory especially for a theme park show i mean i guess

440
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,600
it's just like ah stay away from sugar like i guess that's really you just want the kids in the front

441
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:13,240
row to know oh this this character doesn't like sugar this will defeat but rats will eat anything

442
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,480
if you're gonna dissect the logic i agree like why would sugar be sugar should be like something

443
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,560
that he feeds he loves sugar yeah so it is weird i mean i guess they're saying like

444
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:29,320
sugar plum fairies i suppose they're trying to make those characters like the antithesis

445
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:34,360
of this i think so i suppose so this is almost like a version of like a usually when you would

446
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:39,960
see something as a kid at least us you would see like oh yeah like vegetables would defeat

447
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:46,280
the rats because vegetables are good and sugar is bad yeah it would be some sort of psa style

448
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:51,720
thing but that's not what's going on that the corn syrup lobby will make sure that it's not

449
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:56,760
portrayed as a bad guy well that's right let's we'll see what happens with corn syrup going

450
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:02,280
forward and then a future administration i'm not sure i'm skeptical but i'm not sure either

451
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:09,000
i've also been reading the nutrition it's talking about like doesn't really make a different like

452
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,640
refined sugar is bad my doctors are big on fruit like if you're making fruit smoothie

453
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:21,080
real fruit or frozen fruit they're like it's better than refined how is the fruit because

454
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:25,240
you've talked about this a couple times recently on the show how is your fruit smoothies go how

455
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:29,320
are they going they're going great you know almond milk what do you got what do you give me the

456
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:34,360
ingredients almond milk uh scoop of peanut butter yeah sure what kind of peanut butter

457
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:41,240
are we doing natural peanut butter are we doing i usually like skipping natural okay okay so

458
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:49,800
um uh i don't really like when the oil separates uh blueberries go to antioxidants frozen blueberries

459
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:55,320
use frozen fruits and vegetables cuts down on how much ice you need to put in well that's right

460
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:02,440
frozen spinach fresh or frozen kale yeah and like i just finished one uh right here it sounds like

461
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:07,320
you're on the right track i think so yeah the almond milk's unsweetened maybe a hint of vanilla

462
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:13,560
but no sugar okay and then so you're not leaving out that you put a box of sprees in there are you

463
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:21,640
i'm not no all right good i'm debating doing a protein powder but i don't i gotta find the right

464
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:27,880
like organic one with not a lot of sugar not a lot of fakie stuff yeah are you gonna put any

465
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:33,720
andrina chrome or anything in there or well no i usually take that at night before bed okay

466
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:39,880
okay ketamine or anything i know that's administered by the professionals

467
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:46,680
by the junkyard all right fine fair enough uh okay let me play a little more of this uh rat

468
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:54,360
segment what was that about sugar i was uh telling them how much you don't like sugar that's right

469
00:48:54,360 --> 00:49:02,040
i don't like sugar i don't like children i don't like christmas and i don't like you

470
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:12,200
so you heard you heard maybe a beat almost kick in there yeah and this is where we get to probably

471
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:19,480
the highlight of the whole show rapping king rat rapping king rat yeah would you agree with that

472
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:24,360
this is this is the thing that you would want clipped and posted on whatever social media

473
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,240
instagram

474
00:49:54,360 --> 00:50:01,380
And spice and everything nice so what do you what do you think immediately when you hear that like what is what comes to mind?

475
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:08,480
For you. I have my answer, but you did something feel right like what are damn beastie boys

476
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:15,200
Yeah, okay. Yeah, the beastie, but I mean right like maybe the king rat is like add rock or something

477
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,920
He's got a little more voice like this. Yeah. Yes. They're doing

478
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:27,440
Beastie boys, I'm guessing 1991 or whatever that came out 92 and beastie boys have been out for a while, but this is all sputique

479
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:34,840
90s is it the 80s? Yeah, I used to be a big pulse boutique. I mean, it's still really like I say what happened

480
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:39,720
well in college, I just got a hold of it and I was like, well, this is really good and I

481
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,000
It really like that instrumental album. They did it

482
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:50,280
89 is Paul's boutique or boutique. Some people say boutique when they're talking about the word boutique

483
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,400
Recorded not too far away, right and that water. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

484
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:02,380
I forget what corner it is and what like drugstore or restaurant is there? I don't remember sure but it was yeah right there

485
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,420
So yeah, they have Beastie Boy rats

486
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:11,680
Basically in this show which I can't deny that. I don't like it. I don't know that it's the highest quality

487
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,680
I don't know that they can go toe-to-toe

488
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,360
with

489
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,000
MCA and rock and Mike D

490
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,280
I don't think so

491
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:25,060
But I appreciate the effort and I appreciate that they all are taking turns just like the Beastie Boys would

492
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:30,280
So so you gotta like yeah, I do like that that feels current and it feels we've talked about Disney

493
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:37,360
It is a little more current then usually Disney would go for it was pretty current and it is certainly not the worst

494
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:41,760
Like I'm rapping ready and I'm here to say, you know

495
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:47,840
Yeah, I mean the verse the last verse that he dropped it was the closest to being something good

496
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:53,520
But it is still pretty much like some old folks and the Disney company were like well, I can write a rap

497
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,720
I know that a rat's true. Yeah, so this gets me to the point where

498
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,840
Scott has sent something in and he told me to play this after

499
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,580
After the rap specifically, this is why I think he was like

500
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:08,880
Oh, I think he would have he would have liked to be here for the discussion of the rap

501
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:14,000
So I have it here and I'm gonna play it. Hey everybody just wanted to weigh in really quick

502
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,840
I was actually available to do this episode about Mickey's Nutcracker, but I

503
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:27,560
Elected not to come I elected not to participate and if you're wondering why well, it's because I

504
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,640
Don't like it

505
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,880
I

506
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,860
Wow, that's great so fiendish Wow, yeah, really do you think it took more time to record that let's

507
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,040
Do an episode with us?

508
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:18,680
No, because Scott can produce it something like that in I feel like he can do that while sleeping

509
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,120
Yeah, he's I mean, I know he could do it fatten and somewhat but could he do it in an hour?

510
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:28,680
Put that together in an hour easy. I think we could have done this. Maybe he did it at night though

511
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:34,680
Convenience schedule. I did it at a weird hour where the baby was awake. So he's like, I'm awake

512
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,920
I may as well distract myself, but that was great

513
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,960
That was very good. Yes, and he got I wonder where he got the did he sample this actually?

514
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,760
Did he did he already have a sample of Mickey's Nutcracker Rat King rap already on his computer?

515
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,180
Cuz I wouldn't put it past them to have that where he just had the sample from the music. Yes

516
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:58,600
But maybe not maybe he just he did a keyboard and they made I'd have to listen to the track again to figure out

517
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,800
If it was a sample of that one

518
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,120
instrumental from 99 problems

519
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,080
I don't think so. It sounded like the music from rap

520
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:14,240
Okay, yeah, but it is a kind of a comment does have that guitar

521
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:23,280
Which is similar does 99 problems sample from rat rap it could it's possible that that's where they got that

522
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:31,080
Jay-z got the best time for 99 problems right now. I'll tell you that it certainly is not he's got a hundred

523
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,560
I've seen you know what? I've seen a few people make that joke on social media. Oh

524
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:41,960
I'm so I thought you were making a joke because it was obvious. I well it was obvious

525
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:47,200
But I thought you thought your first one to mark it on it on that joke. I'm sorry to say

526
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,280
I'm so well, that's a whole nother. I don't know anything about that

527
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,880
So yeah, this is very shredder

528
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:01,080
Coming out of our shells very much turtles, of course around the same time

529
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:11,480
And shredder is I mean similar voice, let me see can I play a little bit more

530
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:32,360
This will become a horrible time of year from this visitation this mass migration this

531
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:37,720
Population this congregation this infestation of rats

532
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:42,880
So now the rats are terrorizing all the like Rockette Nutcracker ladies

533
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:49,560
Yeah, running around and then the metal like do you know me only you know is playing at that point now if I was a kid

534
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:55,120
In 1991 I'd be shitting in my pants in the audience. I would be so afraid of what's going on now

535
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,120
100% and it builds up to

536
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,920
Mickey whacking people with a mini whack people with like a

537
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,080
Ladle and I'm like, oh my god, please do it. Please take them all out

538
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:14,320
So you were terrifying me rooting for for muting for violence. Yeah. Yeah with her ladle

539
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:20,200
Which I guess is kind of a guess if it's a metal laid at ladle would be something that would be she would whack him

540
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:25,000
But she didn't go far enough. She didn't push in the bag that like George HW Bush

541
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,520
She didn't finish the job. I came back. So you're using the one that's ten years later

542
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:37,000
It was topical to the time. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's true. Yeah. Oh, you didn't mean to that

543
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,480
Just I didn't mean to you know making a

544
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:45,960
Commentary about the original George Bush and what he's yeah done. Just a little capital steps flavor

545
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,200
You know, yeah, one of your casual capital steps sort of references at the time

546
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:54,040
I I guess I was really giving you credit, but you just that's just the thing you say

547
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,360
Sure, the thing you say about George HW Bush

548
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:03,480
Yeah, I would this is a thing like with same with shredder where I would have been like, oh my god

549
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,480
We're all gonna get killed by these rats. These rat people will kill us

550
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,480
So

551
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:27,200
What happened there and you already said many many has her ladle as a weapon, but the rat king is about to impale Mickey

552
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:32,200
Yeah, he is a real big spike with a big railroad spike

553
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,440
he's about to

554
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:42,280
Should plunge a railroad spike through mickey's head the question does he carry that around or did many just have some conveniently close by

555
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,680
I don't know

556
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,160
I don't know if that's supposed to be something that like blew up big cuz it looks like it could be like a nail

557
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,440
or an icicle

558
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:57,280
Yeah, maybe a big icicle. Yeah, I don't know but this is a pretty violent thing to have in a Disneyland show

559
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,960
Sure where Mickey is about to get killed. I mean like you could pretend like all his hands

560
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:07,600
Shoot like his like little rays or something right? Yeah, but it hangs for a while

561
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,120
Yes, he hangs he's really threatening him with it

562
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:17,440
And again, I would be shitting in my pants cuz I'm like I'm about to watch Mickey his brains get shot all over the stage

563
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:23,560
After this railroad spike the super super big railroad spike goes through Mickey's little head

564
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:27,840
you know eventually I got precocious enough when I would look at the map and

565
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:33,200
Scheduled cuz you know, I was all over that map when I was I was Disneyland map. Yeah, Disney World

566
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:40,940
Any park I wanted to know the showtimes, right? I want to know everything. I mean like, okay, I guess this works out

567
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,940
There's five more shows today

568
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,600
Hmm. No, so you found where you talking about you actually looked at a map with this

569
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:53,960
No, no, I'm saying as a kid. I'd be like I'm scared right now, but this must be resolved

570
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:59,800
Because they have to do this again in an hour so you would put that logic to it like okay

571
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:04,280
Cuz you thought that would calm myself down from worry about Mickey

572
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:10,000
That's smart being murdered cuz I didn't put two and two together when I saw the Ninja Turtles on tour that like they got

573
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,280
Tour dates for another 30 days. I didn't know anything about that that it could have just come to a head

574
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,040
Well, I guess that's true

575
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:21,000
But the logic is but the but you were saying that made you feel like okay

576
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:28,280
This rat didn't go rogue in this one show and he's about to yeah, but to murder my hero and that's right for real

577
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,320
Okay, that's smart. I wish I had thought of something like that and been like they're not gonna shredders

578
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:39,200
Not gonna end this turtle world tour right now. They got other they got money to make. Yeah, this isn't real

579
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,640
So yeah at that point, I mean that's

580
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,760
Really the highlight but then there's a section where

581
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:51,680
Mickey and Minnie are on a like Santa's sleigh with Pluto

582
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,440
Yes pulling it as if it was the rain and there is an unnamed driver

583
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,480
There's a nameless driver with a steering wheel

584
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:08,720
Wearing nearly stage black like stage group blacks. So he right and they don't really acknowledge that he's there

585
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:15,760
No, they don't want yeah, they don't want you know, I mean, he's he's not wearing like a full suit like face covering or anything

586
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,600
He's got a top. No, it's kind of like a chauffeur's

587
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:23,580
Partial chauffeur's outfit. Do you think so? Do you think in the in the narrative of the show?

588
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,240
That he's not supposed to be there

589
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:30,400
No, I think he's supposed to be there. But I think like

590
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:36,360
It might be a subservient like that. Like he's not supposed to speak unless you're saying this

591
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,960
You're saying this like Minnie's butler

592
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:44,840
Yeah, and she treats I think it's Mickey's butler, but Mickey just came to life. Why would he have a butler?

593
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,920
He's got a magical sleigh

594
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,400
with a

595
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,600
Dog that looks suspiciously

596
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:58,960
Suspiciously like Pluto. So you think Mickey has a butler but he doesn't let the butler talk or make eye contact with him

597
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,520
I think he's just very strict as an employer

598
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,200
He's Mickey like a Steve Harvey like

599
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:10,280
Don't make eye contact with me. Is Steve Harvey like that? That's what there was a memo leaked

600
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,280
You got a wrap go yeah

601
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,680
Around the diet coke before he handed to them. They don't want their hands wet or cold

602
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,880
I mean, there's a lot of celebrities that that's happening, you know, don't look them in the eye

603
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,520
Here's what I'll say as long as family feud is that funny?

604
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,480
Don't look him in the eye respect Steve Harvey. That's what I say

605
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:33,640
Yeah, you know what I'm saying and Mickey I guess Mickey as well if he's like look you work for me

606
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:39,400
We don't have a personal relationship. I don't know your name. I don't know your kid's name

607
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:46,560
You know what? I don't give a fuck about it. I'm paying you you respect my wishes. Don't worry about it

608
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,400
You might think I'm intense

609
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:55,840
But there are hundreds of people counting on me and if I think about that pressure, I'll crack so I had to put up walls

610
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:02,560
I don't have time to write an autograph for you an autograph for your fucking nephew

611
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:06,400
I don't want to hear it. Okay to me. Your name is driver

612
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:12,520
Okay, I'm calling you driver and that's it you dress in black you wear a black top hat

613
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,040
I don't care if you're smiling and you're laughing

614
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:21,320
Stay straight ahead. I know I'm I turned to a New York guy all of a sudden and if I snap three times

615
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:26,760
Start killing rats and don't ask questions. I'm gonna give you a pistol

616
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:33,080
I want you to keep it in your holster by your ankle and I'm gonna keep talking New York like this for some reason

617
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:39,680
This is low caliber. It's a low caliber. You're not gonna kill me. So don't even think about it. I'm wearing a vest

618
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,080
Okay, I'm wearing a bulletproof vest

619
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:50,200
I got a vest take a shot of me right now. I'll prove it to you. You can't kill me. You're gonna carry a 22

620
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:54,880
I'm gonna carry a 45. So if you get any ideas, you're getting a whole

621
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:02,800
Okay, I can out draw you let's do a door right now you don't think you don't think I can out draw you

622
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:09,480
I've been shooting guns at cartoons for 60 years. I got a musket. I got a pistol. I hunted ghosts

623
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:16,120
What have you done with your life ever? What have you done? Nothing? He's old-fashioned. He's been around a long time

624
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:20,860
That's what the old fat. Yeah, he hasn't shaken some of those values the old-school guys

625
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:26,860
Yeah, I would do that with their assistance and Mickey has been around for a long time a hundred years. Okay, so let's get to this part

626
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:29,620
Are you ready?

627
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:37,460
And so with the reindeer leading the way many of the nutcracker began their long journey to Candyland

628
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:55,140
So this part's kind of just like that that's the real music that's the

629
01:03:56,860 --> 01:04:03,180
Moment the rat king and the rat king number. There's a little flourish. That's like one of the big other songs

630
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:10,380
Yes, so at this point, they're going to the Candyland. They're going to Candyland. They do a little nose kiss at some point

631
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,900
But to say they do a little nose candy

632
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,700
They do do a nose

633
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:22,420
Snowflakes, what do you think those snowflakes are made of? I used to do this with a card Walker in the 70s

634
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:26,380
You know what it was like it was go go. Well, I guess the 80s too

635
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:33,980
Walt left a notepad that said Kurt Russell didn't explain that was code that Kurt Russell

636
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:36,460
Has my coke

637
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:40,220
Okay, so he died and then Kurt Russell

638
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:46,020
Just everyone went to eat took over. He has the coke now. He's got the coke now

639
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:49,380
So so I forgot like Candyland

640
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:52,660
Obviously the concept of Candyland has been around for a long time

641
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:55,300
But to me Candyland just is the board game, of course

642
01:04:55,420 --> 01:05:01,380
Yeah, but Candyland is here and there's many candy lands in the history of entertainment

643
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:08,340
Oh boy might have to dive down the wormhole of the candyland of all the candy lands, you know

644
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:12,900
Yeah, cuz like I think as a kid it most kids are obsessed with candy lands

645
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:19,060
But they get to Candyland and I mean you what do you think in there goofy is?

646
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:21,660
Well, hold on

647
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:24,140
Snowflake see no, you're right. You're right, right

648
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:30,460
And this is where the the kind of I'm assuming that they named the character Ethel

649
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:37,020
You know not to like an Ethel Merman like a big personality showman. Hmm show woman tight

650
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:42,900
I guess so and she floats down on like a big candy bench a

651
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:44,980
big

652
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:47,140
Snowflake that's got a bench on it

653
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:52,140
Nowadays if you did that you'd be strapped into that thing six ways to Sunday

654
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:58,380
Let's go and fine. Okay. Yeah, so so so they may get to Candyland. They make it to Candyland and

655
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:01,980
Do you want to play anything like music wise or you want to go to goof?

656
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:06,580
I I you know, I get goofy excited. I get excited when I see goofy because goofy is my all-time favorite

657
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:09,100
Disney character. Yeah. Well, I

658
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:16,140
Can you do if goofy's intro mine? Yes. It is just very funny. Yes to hear

659
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:19,420
Nutcracker welcome home

660
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:24,980
Gores, who's the beautiful mouse maiden? She sure is birdie

661
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:29,160
This is Minnie why she saved me from the evil rap king

662
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:34,860
Well, don't see how I've been the mayor of Candyland my whole life

663
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:39,500
Gores, I'm at the citizens here would just love to meet many

664
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:42,760
Come on in join her Christmas

665
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,120
Celebration

666
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:48,920
So at this point they reveal on the set that they're in candy like it's a full Candyland sets

667
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:56,040
And people rush in with flags. It's a big reveal that they're in. It's great. There's a lot of candy buildings

668
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:03,320
Goofy has revealed himself as the mayor of Candyland is the mayor of Candyland. Yeah, which is fun

669
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,320
He's wearing like kind of a pink suit

670
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:10,760
And fun pants. He's got like kind of yellow and pink swirl pants

671
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:17,520
He's got a green hat and he's got a staff that looks like it could potentially be like one of those long suckers

672
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,080
like one of those kind of

673
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:24,800
Like I was gonna say phallic. I don't is there like they're a little phallic some of those long

674
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:31,680
Oh, I was gonna say is it like a peppermint stick a little it's probably a peppermint stick. It's probably not a phallic

675
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,200
sucker I

676
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:38,200
Mean, it was certainly like commenting on Minnie was very purdy

677
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:43,760
Are you saying he's a little horned up and maybe he's yeah, maybe well that sugar as I'm horned up

678
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:49,360
Is that something that happens to you sometimes when you get too much sugar not really yeah

679
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:55,680
But maybe the rat king doesn't like being that one. Maybe the sugar makes everyone too. Oh, yeah, too happy and horny

680
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,480
The rat king hates being happy and horny. That is yeah sure

681
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:06,520
So goofy is a mayor of Candyland. Do you would you rather be the mayor of Disneyland or the mayor of Candyland?

682
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:14,320
What do you think tough decision let's say it's the Candyland from the board game with Queen Frostine and grandma nut

683
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:19,020
You know all the all the loopy and gloopy. Is that his name? I thought that was

684
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,840
gloopy or gloppy I

685
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:27,520
Disneyland easy if it's oh, you're still saying Disneyland. There's too many personalities. There's too many

686
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,680
I kind of think I would rather be mayor of Candyland

687
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:34,440
Can you handle that? Can I handle it? I think I can I

688
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:38,220
Think it's just a lot that it's because there's quit. There's a queen

689
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:44,600
I mean obviously there's there's a monarchy going on in Candyland because there's Queen Frostine and and Lord licorice

690
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,640
so there's some sort of monarchy system happening in Candyland and mayor would would

691
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:53,120
Suggest that it's not like he's got some other position there

692
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:57,640
Well, his could be ceremonial or hers theirs could be ceremonial, right?

693
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,880
They could be more it's like an England thing where it's like

694
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:04,120
Prime minister has a real power but the Queen has to oversee a lot

695
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:08,160
Yeah, I like to think that Candyland has gotten more progressive over the years as far as its government

696
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:12,200
I would hope so, but that they still like the tradition of having a

697
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:17,560
Lord a lord and lady and a queen and I think it's just too many

698
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:24,360
Like cultures clash. I think it's like the 50 states. Yeah, it's like every state has its own identity

699
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:29,600
Its own politics its own graft and corruption, you know

700
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,640
Well, I could be I would also be okay being like Lord licorice

701
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:35,280
Like I could be a lord

702
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:41,680
We you would prefer the ceremonial. I think so. Yeah, I know. Okay mayor seems just like whatever

703
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:47,360
Were you a Downton Abbey guy? Have you watched much out? We did watch a lot of down. I haven't seen the last

704
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:51,080
Season or the there's two movies at this point. I'm a little bit

705
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:58,080
See like four seasons of Downton Abbey, that's about where I after the big death I kind of checked out

706
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:04,460
Well, there's a couple deaths or a couple like disappear. They're driving one. They're driving. We did we hung in for another season or two

707
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:11,400
Yeah, I went to spoiler alert when Dan Stevens dies. Yeah when Dan Stevens died, it wasn't anything specific

708
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:18,920
I just I think it took a little while to get the season after that on. Yeah, and I just kind of checked out

709
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,000
Hmm. Well, I want to be a lord

710
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,760
I want to be Lord licorice, but it sounds like you would still rather be mayor of Disneyland. I think so

711
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:31,240
Okay, this candy land looks pretty fun. Everything is made of candy

712
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:37,400
Everyone's seat seems harmonious. Everyone seems on the same page. There's kind of a candy utopia happening

713
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:41,940
Basically Chip and Dale introduce themselves. It's the candy masters

714
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:47,780
What does that mean to you when Chip and Dale who are wearing now again no pants

715
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:55,060
They're they have like a little like taffy striper kind of hats. What would you consider a more like Candyman style hats?

716
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:58,340
Yeah, like they make the candy

717
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:07,700
Yeah, or do they just know all the recipe like I watched I watched a video recently of a guy at an old candy store

718
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:11,620
He's like we've making these fresh candy canes same way

719
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:21,060
Hundred plus years hundred years. This is from the 30s. It's from the 50s same granite slab the whole time. I've watched

720
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:29,140
Probably the same video you're talking about watching a man make candy canes on the hundred-year-old slab of granite

721
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:34,180
And I grew up around a lot of the South Jersey a lot of those candy stores

722
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:40,660
Are well over a hundred years now, so would you go would you flock to see the candy the local candy caner?

723
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:42,660
We took some tours

724
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:46,260
We took some tours. How many how many tours you think in your life?

725
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:50,100
I think I got a little of Shriver's the big one in Ocean City

726
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:55,620
There was another one on Asbury Avenue kind of the main drag and Thursdays

727
01:11:56,180 --> 01:12:00,180
Were family nights of the war walk and activities for kids

728
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:06,180
During the day downtown, so there'd be entertainers jugglers clowns and gazebos

729
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:11,940
The kid the one candy stores did tours. Yeah, there'd be like decorative gazebos

730
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:16,340
Oh, but they would just be temporary or would they just decorate a gazebo that was already there

731
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:20,340
No, it's just kind of a little entertainment kids that on the ground and

732
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:22,740
It's just interesting

733
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:26,260
Gazebos was presented as a like interesting thing as a good thing

734
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:30,020
Gazebos was presented as a like interesting thing as a

735
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:33,140
Now there's some photo. I they have a lifeguard boat

736
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:37,620
Santa takes a photo in the lifeguard rowboat downtown every year

737
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:43,620
So you would go see people make we would go and you would get free samples and be like this side with this in line

738
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:48,740
We make it and then here's a little paint. We place them in the papers and put them in the box

739
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:52,900
It seems like hard work making candy canes seems like a big pain in the ass candy game seems very hard

740
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:58,420
I think chocolates might actually be easier unless you're lucy and ethyl

741
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:02,100
Of course that was out of control. They were packaging chocolates

742
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:06,980
Yeah, they were sure they were putting them in a little like paper thing and putting them in the box

743
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,300
I had to tell you I knew

744
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:12,900
The son of the guy who owned you company

745
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:20,180
Called o'brien's irish potatoes. Hold on you got so excited. I haven't seen your face light up on this whole time

746
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:24,580
I've been talking to you other than just telling this story just now repeat that again for me

747
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:30,660
Okay, uh, it's a company that I knew a lot growing up because come st. Paddy's day

748
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:38,820
Yeah, these were everywhere outside of build up irish potatoes. No, it's a candy. It's like a fondant kind of

749
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:43,380
You speak in my language is fondant. Well, it's kind of like, um

750
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:49,620
A gooey candy filled with coconut and then it's rolled in sugar. So it looks like a little potato

751
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:54,580
Irish coconut. It's no, it's called an irish potato potato. Sorry, and so

752
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:58,100
I had no idea for years. This guy knew he's

753
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:05,620
A family owned the factory they owned the place and my friend erin was like one of his best friends

754
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:11,860
And she would work there around christmas time or the irish potato factory. Yeah, and I

755
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:18,420
Every year try to get in there. I'm like work. Yeah, I want to work at the irish potato factory

756
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:21,940
From what ages were you trying to get into the irish potato factory like

757
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:25,060
16 to 19

758
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:27,780
Really? I was like we're home for a month from school

759
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:33,220
Let me in there. Let me get because you imagine like some of these like one for them one for me

760
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:38,260
Like you would take one and eat one. I am sure there were some misshapens that you were coming home with

761
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:43,060
Oh my god, so wait and but you didn't find out that you had a direct connection to the irish potato factory

762
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:45,940
Well, I didn't really know him until like high school chemistry

763
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:52,660
But I was eating these irish potatoes for years and years and years. I had no idea. It was local local

764
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:56,100
You were like starstruck when you realized that this kid was

765
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:03,860
Absolutely was irish potato royalty and uh, erin's review was like I don't really like this job

766
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:07,220
And I'm really do with the job packing

767
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:12,820
Because you would do the lucy job of packing she would do it and she's like andy there are so many

768
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:18,660
Magnets and tin signs of lucy and eff and that fuck because I immediately she said

769
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:23,940
Oh, I got a job working irish potato factor for the you know, new year

770
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:27,380
It starts to really amp up production and I was like

771
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:32,980
I told her at like 18 19 like lucy and ethyl and she's like, I don't

772
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:39,700
When every year about clever i'd always been clever. She's like i'm just so fucking sick of your about lucy and ethyl

773
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:43,620
Because obviously, of course the older folks who work there

774
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,720
immediately were like

775
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:50,180
That's got to be the case with any company that has by hand

776
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:55,540
Candy packaging that they have a picture of lucy nether from the i love lucy show like

777
01:15:56,340 --> 01:16:00,180
If we went to this there's a seize candy outlet in the burbank mall

778
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:06,600
Yes, so long time candy company. I really haven't had that it may have very many times

779
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:08,840
Um

780
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:12,040
But I bet if we went there and talked to the employees and I went

781
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:16,840
Do people talk about lucy and ethyl in the candy line a lot? They would be like

782
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:21,240
But is it yeah, you think there's a candy line in the back of the burbank seize candy

783
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:24,680
They're packing some stuff fresh. Oh, you do think I think there's some fresh

784
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:27,240
I don't think there's a lot but some of those calendars look pretty

785
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:33,880
In that small store. I don't I don't think it's a conveyor belt like there. I don't think it's a huge assembly line

786
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:39,160
But I think so. I don't think that's all driven in from a distributor. I feel like we've been recording for three hours. So

787
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:44,360
That so your friend you knew that worked in the irish potato factory

788
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:49,160
You would say I want a job and what does she say? I'm not are they hiring she's like

789
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:55,000
No, we have enough. I'm the seasonal hire like so she was keeping the job from you

790
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:57,320
basically

791
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:02,120
So they wouldn't hire more than one seasonal employee. That seems ridiculous. I don't think so, you know

792
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:09,260
We were probably too far out from the start of the rush season because I feel like college semesters

793
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:15,080
You start back up like mid-january 12 13th or something. So

794
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:18,680
Later, yeah time wasn't right

795
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,400
Wow, so so

796
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:24,360
This and you moved here shortly after

797
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:30,440
After college lived at home for a few months then moved out here, but did you ever try to get another candy factory job?

798
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,200
No

799
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,200
It's in my blood one

800
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:39,480
Grandpa Sheridan, I should have continued the family business and he had a candy factory

801
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,280
Well, no, he worked the um

802
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:46,440
He was like he ran the line

803
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:51,320
For which company we talked about this. I know we have I forgot a lot lately

804
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:57,240
I said, I don't know anything about you, but I have been forgetting whitman's was around phil and he worked the line

805
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:03,240
Uh, he ran the line. He tried to get poached. He almost got poached by hershey

806
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,040
and my

807
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:10,060
Uh graham graham was like i'm not moving to hershey pennsylvania

808
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,320
Wow, so she put a stop to it

809
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:19,640
Yeah, graham graham did graham graham did what was his name was his name grandpa grandpa grandpa

810
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:26,040
I feel like what was the other side's name? We just talked about mom mom and pop pop mom mom and pop mom and pop pop

811
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,840
Graham graham graham graham and graham pop

812
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:33,560
Pop or pa I feel like was interchangeable grandpa. I love grandpa

813
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,200
I had such a boring name grandma grandpa

814
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:40,600
I know you'd say maybe their first names if it was like the side of the family you didn't see as much

815
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:45,160
He would talk my dad. Oh, let's tell the story and I saw it once

816
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:48,600
They moved down to south jersey when they retired

817
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:53,960
And they moved in a little residential neighborhood that was next to a golf course

818
01:18:54,440 --> 01:19:01,000
So we would go visit them walk around the neighborhood pick up straight golf balls, but he would go out for a walk every day

819
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,640
and he had this

820
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,480
homemade sap

821
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:12,680
Basically, he had like a chunk of metal wrapped in electrical tape. Oh sap like a like a old school police weapon

822
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:17,560
Yeah, and he would carry this with him when he would go for his walk and we're like

823
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:22,120
You were living on a quiet street next to a golf course

824
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,600
You don't need protection

825
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,160
So he was paranoid. He's a paranoid guy

826
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:32,920
Yeah, I mean they grew up they lived in the northeast of philadelphia for a long time and

827
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:40,280
I could care less about mickey's nutcracker right now. I don't give a fuck about mickey's nutcracker. I don't want to hear more about

828
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:42,440
grandpop

829
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:46,920
And the whitman's factory and the different candy factories you grew up around

830
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:51,720
That's really that's where my interests lie. I like mickey and minnie. I love goofy

831
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,560
I love all of it

832
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:55,960
But I want to hear more about this

833
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Did he retire at the whitman's?

834
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:04,520
I think he retired from whitman's so he got like his pension or something from whitman's. I believe so

835
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,160
and they they always joke that like

836
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,160
they

837
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:13,720
They probably owed back like the money isn't in the walls and I never found that

838
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:18,840
Do you think they weren't using they weren't paying that was the urban legend around the family?

839
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:26,280
This is the side of the family his father ran a speakeasy for mayor nucky on the atlantic city borough

840
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:31,960
Mayor nucky played by steve buscemi and borough walk empire, right? Right, right

841
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:36,360
Um, so so so they never found a bunch of like cash in grandpop's walls

842
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:42,200
No, but that was always a joke, right? But so but you with some family member would have found it

843
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:45,080
Would have found it when they cleared out. Yeah

844
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,560
Yes, so so

845
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,920
You knew grandpop a little bit. I knew grandpop. Yeah growing up

846
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,640
So yeah, you're all both grandparents instead of grandparents were in life. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah

847
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,520
Everyone loved my pop-up

848
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,360
Yeah

849
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,360
And he was

850
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:05,560
I never knew him like as a mean drunk

851
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:11,480
I knew him when he ran the fan, uh, the city's a a print the town's a a program

852
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:17,000
Oh, so so a lot of people in the family knew him before that happened and he he had so many sponsors

853
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,240
He was sponsored for so many people

854
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:23,880
So many people came to his eat we had they had to have a night viewing

855
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:31,400
And the morning viewing before the funeral because there was just so many people he had touched their lives from a.a and stuff

856
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,480
Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's nice

857
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:39,400
Um, and so when you were a kid were you were you like was he like ah the whitman factory like was it candyman?

858
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:42,040
Like or willy wonka style when you were a kid you're like, oh my god

not really there was just always whitmans at christmas and stuff and

860
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,240
I think they're

861
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:53,480
one one of my aunts for uh christmas one year got like

862
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:58,280
Every household a giant whitman sampler box, right?

863
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:02,360
But you didn't imagine like grandpop driving like a big gumdrop to work or something

864
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:05,560
I didn't know because I didn't know he he did for a long time

865
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:10,280
I knew my pop-up for a while. It was like the security guard at a pencil factory

866
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,160
but I

867
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,240
There used to be a lot more factories

868
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:23,160
What pencil I don't know

869
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:27,960
I don't know if it was you gotta find out I gotta find out I gotta find out the name philadelphia

870
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:31,960
You just have a ton of factories. I mean tasty cakes. I think still is a big

871
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:37,960
Uh factory maybe down by the navy yard, but I don't know if like the battleships

872
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:44,600
It's been decommissioned. Was it like your grandfather's almost in the cia where you like find out later like he's a whitman's man

873
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:47,320
He didn't like to talk about it. He was in vietnam

874
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:54,760
I just didn't know I don't think I just thought like oh a child a kid won't be interested in all these and I'm like

875
01:22:55,080 --> 01:23:00,460
I am more than interested. I will say I don't know if i've said this before on the show. I'm my grandfather

876
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:04,460
Uh one of my grandfather's, uh owned a bookstore

877
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:08,860
Yes called bookman's alley, which was a pretty cool spot

878
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:11,420
Uh that was in chicago

879
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:16,140
Uh, and he my grandfather is in the movie finding vivian meyer

880
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:22,060
Which is a movie about a woman who was a nanny in the suburbs and she also was a photographer

881
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:25,900
But they didn't find out that she was like a cool like a cool a good photographer until

882
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:29,340
Uh, these guys bought a bunch of photos at an estate sale

883
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:34,220
Um, and my grandfather was a little like enigmatic and just one day

884
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:38,860
It was like, oh they interviewed me for this movie and it was because vivian would come into the bookstore

885
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:43,420
But if you were around, I mean the store was there for decades at this point

886
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:48,220
Um, but to show you how dumb of a little boy I was I was like, yeah grandpa's got a bookstore

887
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:48,700
Yeah

888
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:53,180
We go there for a couple holidays and the thing I was most excited about

889
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:57,920
Was that he would have a big or not even that big of a dish. He would have a dish of gumdrops

890
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,280
Yeah, oh, yeah brother and I would go in there and it was an old

891
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:04,640
It was like a really old building and it was kind of falling apart in a fun way

892
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:08,820
And I would get very excited because I would go and get some gumdrops

893
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,480
And I was not so excited

894
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,000
I'd be like looking at the books like oh, yeah

895
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,600
All these old books all these old editions and all these like nooks and crannies in the store

896
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,080
But these gumdrops

897
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:21,680
And then my mom would be like these gumdrops have been sitting here for months

898
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:26,000
That didn't stop me because my mama had a candy dish very similar

899
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:30,000
By the way finding vivian meyer just watch points you at

900
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:34,720
Amc plus is where you can currently see that. Thank you. Yes

901
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:38,400
um, and uh rent on your normal

902
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:40,800

apple tv

904
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:48,000
Um where else paramount google plus apple tv. My grandfather is in free on plex

905
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:54,480
Oh, yeah, my grandfather is in this movie. Is he gonna use bookstore documentary to or like a bookstore documentary?

906
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,560
That's a good question, but he is so

907
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:02,960
Honest to god, he might be and I don't remember or don't know because he wouldn't say he wouldn't talk about a lot of things

908
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,840
Uh, so so but that's how dumb a little kid is

909
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,480
I was but I think if I had a grandfather that worked in a candy factory in a gumdrop factory

910
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:14,320
I would be like holy shit. This is the coolest thing i've ever heard

911
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:20,240
They were a long retired by the time I ever knew them finding vivian meyer 2014

912
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:23,680
I remember this movie was very acclaimed. I feel like when it came out

913
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:28,240
Yes, I think it was nominated for an oscar and what what was your grandfather's name?

914
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:33,200
Because i'm gonna fire it up. I mean roger carlson is his name roger carlson great

915
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,520
You will see him in this movie. I never said that on the show

916
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:40,020
Uh, you maybe it's been a while. You've told me in conversation

917
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:45,600
Yeah, but I forgot it was about vivian meyer. I thought it was more about

918
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,160
So there's a lot of documentaries on the history of bookstores and stuff. Yes

919
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,720
um, oh what do

920
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:54,240
Okay

921
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:59,840
Is there any way we can get back to talking about the end of mickey's night? I mean, I think it wraps up pretty

922
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,640
Pretty nice. Oh, yeah. So so I mean I guess yeah, it wraps up pretty nicely

923
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:09,920
Obviously, they're gonna defeat the rat king roger rabbit sings a song about living

924
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:16,160
In the land of candy and the importance of dental care if you're eating that much sugar

925
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:20,720
Which I mean, I don't know how that how much that's you know stuck with kids

926
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:27,120
Um, they do like a country version of a song at this point too and at the end

927
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:31,280
Yes, which I mean look, I like there's some candy cowboys

928
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:35,200
There's candy cowboys, which I can't be mad at a candy cowboy

929
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,640
Because you know, I like in my later years. I like hillbilly nonsense

930
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:43,300
That's a big thing, but I don't know that I necessarily love like this version

931
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,720
Oh

932
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:00,640
All right, I take it back I do like that actually

933
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:07,680
That's a classic not nutcracker piece. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I mean that's yeah that's song fine

934
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:12,160
Yes, but i'm talking about this country version of it. Yes, but you're but I don't like all the newer versions

935
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:17,440
The the hipening versions of all the other songs, but this I do like I do like this

936
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:21,760
Uh, uh pretty good and tigger is dancing like line dancing

937
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,480
And you know pretty good

938
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,480
Pretty good pretty fun

939
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:27,360
um

940
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:32,400
My favorite line at the ending is when mickey turns to minnie and says

941
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:37,600
Minnie will you be my princess and stay with me here in candy land?

942
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,960
And i'm just imagining the bank

943
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:46,640
Going like did she abandon this house? She hasn't paid her mortgage a month like

944
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:51,280
Where is she you were just thinking of her old life that she left behind. Yeah, she

945
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:58,320
Conrad tina etho they've given yeah statements to the police, but they have no idea where she is

946
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,480
What if you fall asleep tonight?

947
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,400
And let's say like mrs. Taffy comes to you in a dream

948
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,320
And you and mrs. Taffy go off

949
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:13,920
Well, wait, is she with mr. Taffy or they separate it? No, she's having an affair

950
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,560
with you

951
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:22,720
But she says jason we're gonna live in in taffy land. Is it like a dead bedroom situation?

952
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:28,240
What is that? Oh, that's where like there's no physical intimate dead bedroom. They're not

953
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:32,080
Sleeping together anymore. They're more friends than anything

954
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:36,800
So well, how about this? I'm gonna make it as uncomfortable as possible. Mr

955
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:40,880
Taffy is in love with mrs. Taffy, but she's not interested in him anymore physically

956
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:45,200
I don't know if I want to get in the middle of this because I don't know if he's violent

957
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:49,120
I don't know. He is violent. Oh great. Yeah. No, i'm staying away from this

958
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:55,040
But mrs. Taffy says jason you and I can live in taffy land forever, but is he in taffy land?

959
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:59,600
Yeah, but you have to just carry a a candy sap on you at all times

960
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:06,740
But it's all the candy you can eat and because it's magic it's not caloric

961
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:11,680
It's a lot to consider

962
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:13,360
And

963
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:14,560
and

964
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:17,440
Mrs. Taffy also just looks like a big piece of taffy

965
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:25,680
I would hope yeah, I mean, she's not like a sexy lady taffy or anything. I we should say by the way that um

966
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:31,280
The end of this mickey hits the rat king with a big bag of sugar

967
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:36,000
And then it goes slow motion everyone danced around him and he's a handsome prince again

968
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:41,200
Which I totally forgot was set up early. I was like, okay

969
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:44,240
This kind of makes sense why he eats sugar, right?

970
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:47,600
But the narrator stuff that like it was a handsome prince

971
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:53,600
They got a curse turn to rat eat sugar because you break the cart and i'm like, doesn't everyone want to break the curse?

972
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Yeah, you'd think so. Sorry. I started that

973
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:01,680
uh, yeah, you would think so, but I I also forgot the the handsome prince part of it, um, but

974
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:07,280
Overall, it's a pretty good show. And again, it's eisner era nonsense

975
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:09,840
And I like hillbilly nonsense nonsense

976
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,840
I like eisner era nonsense

977
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:16,720
And I wish they would do something like this where like oh you got to see this one show

978
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,600
It's only going to be this season or maybe two seasons. Yeah

979
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:24,320
Um, and it's you it's got its own narrative. It's obviously got some unique music

980
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,040
um, but

981
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:32,080
I don't it's never gonna happen again. Well, I appreciate the increase in uh

982
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:40,160
Producing and production values and obviously the singers and dancers in the parks still very talented

983
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:45,520
Well, I feel like every question. Yeah, I I feel like the behind the scenes stuff

984
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:50,560
There's so much of it has to be picture. Perfect has to convey this it has to fall

985
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:52,480
these are the

986
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,480
parameters

987
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:55,680
of

988
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:57,680
Whatever this guy's got to look like

989
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:02,880
I also want to make clear i'm lamenting the fact that they don't do this in the park or anything right now

990
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,760
Um, but I don't I didn't like this

991
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,160
Okay

992
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:14,160
So that's a principle of the thing basically. All right, I didn't like this but I have principles

993
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:18,720
And I want things like this that I don't like to be in the park

994
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:23,920
A man's got to have a code and I yes, I have a very strict code and I want I want more

995
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,640
Stuff I didn't like like this in the park

996
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:29,680
And versus stuff. I didn't like like wolverine and deadpool

997
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:34,480
Holiday show specifically holiday show because I feel like that original show that I didn't see in person

998
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,720
I liked the clips better

999
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:40,880
Than I saw this but I will also say this my daughter was very upset

1000
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:46,480
During the show and I was trying to wrangle her in addition to watching and enjoying the laughs

1001
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:51,040
Did the show make her upset or well she was just sort of in a mood?

1002
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,480
She needed a nap

1003
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:55,200
And then on top of that as soon as the show was over

1004
01:31:55,520 --> 01:32:01,840
Deadpool and wolverine left sort of toward the hyperion theater part in california venture that show I thought you meant this show

1005
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,000
podcast the ride

1006
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,360
No, no mickey's nightcracker. Oh, yeah. No i'm talking about deadpool wolverine

1007
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:10,880
Sorry, and as soon as deadpool wolverine left and they were out of sight she goes

1008
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,440
Hey, I want to meet them

1009
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,400
I want to meet them and I go i'm sorry

1010
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:20,160
They're not doing like because you know obviously all the other characters we got in line and we met them

1011
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:24,080
Deadpool wolverine were not doing a meeting great. That's absurd

1012
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:28,880
So she yelled I want to meet them and I had to explain to her like we they're not meetable

1013
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,920
And she's like no I want to meet them and she like flipped out

1014
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:37,440
So i'm dragging a two-year-old away from the front of this of the area where they did the show

1015
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:45,200
And she's yelling that she wants to meet deadpool and wolverine. They should really be escorted by handlers to the side of the stage

1016
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,240
Line up the audience and everyone it's a good point

1017
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:50,320
Everyone wants to see deadpool and wolverine

1018
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:53,520
Are you kidding me? It's a good point and I don't know why they didn't have a meet and greet

1019
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:57,920
But they do have a show there and I again, I like the effort. I appreciate the effort. But anyway

1020
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:03,600
I oh by the way, I have uh, I read an article about you know storm

1021
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:10,240
Has her first solo comic in quite a while. Yes, and I read a big spoiler about the one that comes out

1022
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,240
Today do you want to say it on here?

1023
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:15,360
I don't want to say it on here because I don't want to ruin it people go and

1024
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,120
Pick up their shot, but i'll tell you what I am excited

1025
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:24,240
You seem as excited as when you said the irish potato story earlier in the episode. I well when

1026
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:28,560
I tell you what it is. Uh, I think you will see why okay

1027
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:32,240
Well, you'll tell me off mic because this is so I will tell you off mic

1028
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:35,600
I can't stop thinking about the pencil factory that you're graham

1029
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:40,240
I really don't know a lot about the pencil factory. You got to find out what brand of pencil

1030
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:44,720
I feel like I was a ticonderoga kid

1031
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:48,400
But I really like the ones that were yellow with silver

1032
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:52,400
I think that was was that a ryan and I could never find them

1033
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:58,080
I'm not sure what a ryan or a ticonderoga. I don't know the difference. I don't know. I was reading some

1034
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,560
gloomy stuff recently about like

1035
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:02,560
kids

1036
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:08,640
High schoolers college students like they get an assignment and they just plug shit in the chat gpd

1037
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:11,600
And they're turning in papers filled with

1038
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:14,080
uh

1039
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,400
What is it? Do they call it artifacts or they're?

1040
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:20,480
Anomalies like no that didn't happen. That's not real

1041
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:22,560
Shakespeare

1042
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:26,880
Shakespeare did not write the play julius caesar to perform for

1043
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:31,280
So you would say so they would be writing a paper about roger rabbit and they would say like, you know,

1044
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:37,440
Baby, huey was the baby in roger rabbit and it's just because that information was incorrect somewhere

1045
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:41,920
They heard it maybe on a podcast on the pocket with that. Yeah, and that's a folly of fact checking

1046
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:48,000
Right. I mean I have seen there are still kids who like just thesaurus everything

1047
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:51,360
And there was a really funny tweet going around about like yeah

1048
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:59,120
I knew he had done that in this paper because it was about 1984 and he called big brother enormous sibling

1049
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,000
And I was like, well, that's pretty funny. That is really funny. All right

1050
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:05,600
Well, did we do did we do it?

1051
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:09,040
I there's another episode where I feel like did we do the episode did it even happen?

1052
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,920
Did it did we do we do a good job just so?

1053
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:20,400
bamboozled by candy factories and I got I got so down yes, I was I just wanted to curl up sort of by the fire

1054
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:22,640
And kind of just listen to stories

1055
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,880
of candies and pencils

1056
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:31,360
Great just wanted to hear that. So anyway, you've survived podcasts the ride, uh, the second gate mickey's nutcracker

1057
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:32,960

Tell us what your favorite pencil company was growing up. What pencils did you use?

1061
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:45,280

1062
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:52,800

01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:10,720
Hood dog on no boys. Yeah, but I think I think pop hop or pup
