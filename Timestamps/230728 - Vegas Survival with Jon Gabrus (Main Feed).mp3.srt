1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Warning! The following podcast will irritate ATV instructors, offer a detailed explanation of how to play craps,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
contains spa locker hacks, and will mess you up more than two liters of a gross slushy alcohol drink.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Vegas aficionado John Gabras joins the good boys to offer Vegas survival tips on today's podcast, The Ride Sin City Nights.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Welcome to podcast The Ride Sin City Nights, a scintillating all-male review, which is hosted by, as far as the listeners know,

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
three absolute beefcakes.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm Beefcake1 Scott Gardiner, joined by Beefcake2 by Garza.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hey, hi, how are you?

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's a Harrison Ford voice, by the way.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Of course you have to have rippling abs. How could you not?

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Where else would that voice come from?

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Not an 80-year-old man.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hey, hi.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, that sounds like Harrison Ford, currently. Jason Sheridan.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hopefully we give you a listening experience that you'll never forget.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Is that a sexy phrase?

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I feel like those review shows are like, and you're never going to forget the time you have at Magic Mike or at the Luxor topless review.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That was meant to be sexy.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh wow, can we do it again?

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We say body around here.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We don't even say the word sexy?

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
In Sin City Nights we do.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Well, look, you've got to build up to it.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You've got to build up to it.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Look, one day we'll get to an episode where we all acknowledge each other as sexual creatures, you know, but I don't think we're there.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
No, we're not getting up to that episode.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I am out on that episode.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh shit, guys, I've got to run. I'm sorry.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I didn't realize there was that kind of show.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay, we're going to have to drop in from the episode.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay, let's do this. Shift-tags really fast.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We're asexual, okay?

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That sounds more like it.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah, okay.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm not hearing a lot of yes and from my collaborators today.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Not only yes and, if it's something I want to do.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Not acknowledging you as a sexual creature.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Let's bring it up.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Give me something I want to yes and, and only yes and.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
All right, before he leaves, let's throw him in.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We cannot do a Las Vegas month.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Las Vegas month, we knew we had to have the presence of a Vegas fan and one of the funniest people around from High and Mighty and Action Boys.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's John Gabris. Hello.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh, what's up? Jason, you're a sexual being.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Thanks, John. You're a sexual being too.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I mean, that's how we screen each other is just funny to do it on the pod.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Look, you're at the Grove as well, you sexual being.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Hinn, Barnes and Noble, my sexual being friends.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
A couple of magazines, Mr. Sexual Being.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Buying Settlers of Catan and all the many board games that they have at the bookstore that is practically a toy and board game store nowadays.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Practically a kid, like a teen tween hangout spot.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh yeah.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You go in there and it's just like a bunch of kids looking at comics and manga and shit like that.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You're like, oh, this is actually kind of cool.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Anytime my wife has something to do with the Grove, I shoot to Barnes and Noble.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's a fun little gimmick there.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, sure.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's like me with my parents anywhere.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let me loose in that bookstore for a while.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It never changes.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Or if I'm near the Apple store, I'll go in and subscribe to High and Mighty on every iOS.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I go to each of the podcasts, go subscribe, subscribe, subscribe.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't know if it stays or they wipe those every night.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Or if it converts somebody who works like an Apple store employee.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Maybe they see that and like, oh, interesting.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Does that just come with it?

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If this is an Apple recommend, I got to check it out.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll start drinking athletic greens.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
My one sponsor.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's better than better than most.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I think.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
OK, so it's Sin City nights over here.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's Sin City.

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah, you didn't know.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is the, you know, the ultra sultry.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This isn't the lame old daytime podcast.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The ride you thought you knew.

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Things are getting wild over here.

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And so we had to pull you in on it.

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And that's part of, I think, maybe a good reason to have you here and a good thing to talk to you about is like we're as we record this, we are going to Vegas.

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
All three of us soon.

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It will have happened in the past for the listener.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But for us, it's in our future.

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We've all been separately, but we've never all been together.

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And I think we've got a couple of slots.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We're not there for a long time, but we're like, we don't.

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We don't really know how to fill those other days.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And we're trying to think, is there a way that we can get out of our Vegas comfort zone to push it to the max a little more hit it a little harder?

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And there was three guys whose comfort zones I couldn't understand less.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You guys.

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, I do.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I want to be clear.

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I've been uncomfortable for 37 years now.

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So when I find my comfort zone, I wallow around like a pig and slop.

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's why I like being little spaces.

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's why you're in the matrix.

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Pink pod go.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Finally.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh, you could.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
My energy.

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Please.

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I love the major going back.

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Going back in the womb is exactly where he wants to be.

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Oh, yeah.

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah.

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I like sleep often in the fetal position.

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I.

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah.

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's just a shame that our mothers don't grow with us, that our mothers don't become what you'd have to be like nine feet tall for us to be able to fit back in there.

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Why don't moms grow to be nine feet tall so we can crawl back in?

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It would be nice.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It would be nice.

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm up to it.

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I got to go back east and rest up.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Swan dive into my mom's garage.

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's my sneakers are sticking out.

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,000
She pulls them off for me and I slide my bare feet in like Superman recharging in the sun.

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This is the ideal Mitch three month vacation.

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That's my go to text to him.

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm like, are you currently breastfeeding?

125
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Hey, I'm going to you're my only friend that I'm going to ask to do an improv show and I don't know where you live right now.

126
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't even own a home.

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You own a home and are never in it.

128
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Empty most of the time.

129
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I can't stick here.

130
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The boys.

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But yeah, we're we're hoping that you could like it by telling us some some tales of your Vegas lore.

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Maybe you could inspire us to do to push it hard to go past our again, unintelligible Vegas.

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What are you guys going to do there?

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Is it wrestling based or you guys?

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
No, we're doing we're doing a show.

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh, you're doing a live show.

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We're doing the pockets are a big Vegas groove blender.

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You could take some stock.

140
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You could ask us some questions to just try to gauge where we're at, what we've done.

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I mean, we can share some annex to Jason and I have been to a strip club for a bachelor party at one point.

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So there's that.

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Now, I want to say this right now, right?

144
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Right at the top.

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I forbid you from telling the story of Jason falling asleep at the bachelor party again.

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I was not in time.

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I was not.

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I was told on this show.

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's at least twice.

150
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Once every two months.

151
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We've had a handful of group conversations and I know that story.

152
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yes, the relatively limited window.

153
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You've I just wanted to get the rules out in case you got tempted.

154
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Well, I'm not a strip club guy.

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's just like one facet of this city that I'm not really into.

156
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And previously I was always just a gambler because I came from the East Coast.

157
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So I was going to Atlantic City as soon as I was 21, which is like if you think Vegas is gross, hit Atlantic City for a weekend and you'll be like, let's take the whole family to Los Angeles.

158
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But over the course, like the last 10 years living out here and I went to Vegas several times from living in New York.

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But after moving out here, I've gone way more frequently.

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And I found that like I'm super pumped about the city and I do think anyone who doesn't like Vegas, I can make them an item that they will like.

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, yeah.

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I just think Vegas literally has and you guys are theme park guys, but this is a theme park for like grownups.

163
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And if you're like a foodie, you can get you.

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's going to be the Vegas version of you know what I mean?

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So it's like if you love restaurants, well, all of your favorite chefs have their second or third best restaurant in Las Vegas.

166
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah, I like a restaurant that's like good opening weekend and then it kind of decays a little bit.

167
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But still it's close.

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's pretty good enough.

169
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Like it's fun to eat at Morimoto and you know, or you know, you can eat at the Momofuku and Cosmo and all these places that in New York and L.A. have insane lines and weights.

170
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You can make like a 10 p.m. dinner reservation.

171
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You know, you can make a you can eat at Wolfgang Puck restaurant like anyone, any celebrity chef.

172
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:58,000
They every hotel now has like four kind of name recognized restaurants so you can have that if you're just a drinker but not a gambler or just a party or not a gambler.

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That obviously is there.

174
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
If you're a gambler, that's obviously there.

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
If you're show people like you like to see shows, you can see a ton of great second tier shows.

176
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Everything is second tier.

177
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But in a way that it's all also there.

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You know what I mean?

179
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And if you like anything that's a chain or anything that's like, you know what?

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Like Bachelor Party or Bachelorette Party activities like they have all of those.

181
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And I'm including the ones like the Topgolfs or the Dune Buggy racing or ATVs or dirt like or anything of that like group activity.

182
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Like I feel like you can have a conference in Vegas and I know a lot of people do because there's just like a lot of activities you could do that are non casino related as well.

183
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

184
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
We know this is an interesting something for anyone.

185
00:10:49,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And truly you could be like a like a leftist or like an absolute like QAnon gun toting freak and still find some overlap and stuff, but also find a bunch of shit that you would be into.

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And dispensaries are there now too.

187
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And like so it's got weed, it's got booze, it's got everything else too.

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But you can get most of that stuff without having to text somebody named Johnny Vegas in your phone.

189
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That's the name I have saved in my phone.

190
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I bought drugs off of like 10 years ago and I'm always like if I ever want.

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But now like I only really need weed when I go.

192
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Only if he's growing something special.

193
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Also, he's a CPA now.

194
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So he's kind of out of the game.

195
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He probably owns five dispensaries and makes more money than I could ever dream of.

196
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Do you do you have a dispenser of choice in Vegas?

197
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
No, see, that's funny.

198
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I have only tried like three.

199
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Now I'm kind of braver and just bring LA weed with me on my carry on.

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah, I got a little cocky, but I usually what I do is, you know, find one that I haven't been to yet.

201
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Have my Uber driver from the airport drop me off there.

202
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Or wait for me if I can give them my I'll be like I'll give you $10 cash and you just leave the thing running while I run in there and shop.

203
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And then you go in there, buy all your weed, because for me, I don't necessarily want to if I'm there for two nights or three nights, leave like the strip.

204
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yeah, yeah.

205
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Sometimes I'll add an activity that's off strip or a restaurant that's off strip to try some shit.

206
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But like for me, I want to like be supplied up.

207
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I like the idea of like you put all your weed or your whatever you buy your drugs, your booze, whatever in it.

208
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Like I like having it like in my room.

209
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It feels very Vegas as to be like, which one of these and I like the Cosmo life hack for people because they have balconies on their rooms and they're not on their suites only or what you know.

210
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah, it's not the cheapest of the hotels, but having a balcony where you can comfortably smoke weed.

211
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I mean, if you guys are going in August, the balcony will be a full nightmare.

212
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Like, oh, yes, sunscreen on the plane.

213
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But the phrase 113 degrees was uttered in the forecast this week.

214
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And I think that's a good 99 down weekend, I think is one 18 higher.

215
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's like it's bonkers.

216
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Well, these are the last few years we can go to Las Vegas.

217
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I think so we better drop like it.

218
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I bet you Vegas will be the first place to drop like the dome full blown air conditioned to buy a dome on top.

219
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Well, that's the sphere is testing.

220
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's beta testing.

221
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Fucking Stephen Baldwin and Paulie Shore currently living in it.

222
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah.

223
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
We're in the eyeball.

224
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
He moved to Vegas.

225
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Oh, yeah, Paulie.

226
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah.

227
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Well, well, that's a sword into the city before I got Paulie.

228
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah, with a top Danny Gans.

229
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Rich little there.

230
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That's by the way, the number one thing maybe I want to do is go see Rich Little.

231
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I think that's a good cause that's the other thing too about Vegas that not a lot of people understand.

232
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You can set your irony meter wherever you want and enjoy yourself.

233
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You could slide it all the way to authentic like like and you can enjoy yourself that way and you can slide it all the way to like anthropological study of the disgusting human and like you could enjoy Vegas on a whole nother level.

234
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yeah.

235
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Guys, if you want to talk about a sliding scale of irony, you guys sent me to go see the David Copperfield.

236
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yeah, which was hands down one of the best recommend I'm leaving my house today.

237
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I dragged my wife Tiffany to that as well and leaving the house today.

238
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
She's like, Where are you going? I'm like, I'm going to Burbank to talk about Vegas.

239
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Okay.

240
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But I was like, Remember that I told you about the guys who recommend and she goes, I still don't know how tongue in cheek that show was.

241
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And I'm like, I'm not bad news for you, babe.

242
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's not like, yeah, I think it itself, I think is is heartbreakingly sincere.

243
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yeah, at least was in its inception, but is now like devolved due to his own lack of interest and care in every step because he performed because he does 20 shows a week.

244
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Right.

245
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So he's just like the numbers up. Yeah.

246
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:27,000
He had like his delivery throughout the you guys like even undersold how how like wrote he is like, and then we go over here and he literally would do shit like like doing magician.

247
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I guess I shouldn't do a silent magician and very like limp little to die.

248
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:52,000
He does just like as and like this parts were like the lights go out and you hear people like moving around and then like everything is it's like a Jurassic Park the ride like everything is kind of like ride based the thing drops from a UFO drops from the ceiling and uncaged dinosaur comes out an alien that farts root beer bubbles.

249
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You met him you met blue 30.

250
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm so thrilled that you did it. I mean, it's a it's a life chain now you know that you know now that you can be in Vegas in the future and see the little like the little bronze statue in the lobby of the little alien know like I'm in the club I know what that is.

251
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I know who blue 32 is and they can fog the room with root beer sent when he farts which is crazy. I still don't understand. Yeah, he because there's there's this gag in it about like that where it cuts to a lady with a bottle of root beer and then she like was that in it when you were there things just slide in and out of the dude all of the all of the tricks he does all are like contingent on like you trusting that like there's no like good magician.

252
00:16:39,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Good magician will do something where you're like I see like what you think might have how I did it and then I prove you like you're right. Actually, yeah, actually these rings aren't you know don't have a gap in them. But all of his stuff is like huge props and stuff and you're like that's got to be custom made like yeah, I'm not gonna you're not gonna surprise me by like and all these letters fall off and it's a message from my dad from the future. Yeah, it's all contingent on the letter being like I'm proud of you too, which is like.

253
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:22,000
A real heartbreaking moment for all of us performers who are maybe not from a family of performers who are like it felt super real when he was like and it said I'm I'm proud with your dumb magic choices David.

254
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Well, and some of them also it's like you've done this on multiple TV specials and then you had to explain how it worked in court and you're still doing it.

255
00:17:34,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yes, yeah, big trial. Yeah, like diagrams were like which the one that got revealed was essentially like OK, so I take eight people from the audience and then a bunch of people go run run run run through a secret hallway under the theater. We like push and prod them. We shock them with tasers until they get to the other side in time. Ta-da, there's the trick. Yeah, I saw an amazing Jonathan off Broadway special RIP back in the day and he was like, I'm so proud of you.

256
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And then I was like, all right, and now everyone just act like I teleported up here like and he's like, I'm in and post it'll look real.

257
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You can't get us. And then I'm like, if there's a person who let you do hack shit like this should be a comedy magician. But if you're David Copperfield, your shit can shoot should be contingent on like and you keep your fucking mouth shut about what you saw down here.

258
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So your friends don't tell your family, I will take other people that I go to. I will sit through it again to get other people to it because I and I don't think people trust me when I'm like, no, because I didn't trust you guys either. I'm like, oh, great. I'll sit. I know it sounds. Yes.

259
00:18:43,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Every reason to be skeptical and he puts so much effort in, but then doesn't match it with like his gusto. Like it's like, it's so funny how like deep and serious it is, but he doesn't match it with his energy at all. He's not acting it. No, because it's like supposed to be like meeting the moment of like, oh my God, this character is dying.

260
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The few times I've done like sketch shows where I've had to memorize a bunch of lines, his delivery is like me backstage of like, okay, tonic. All right. You know, like practice my fucking line. Like it's that exact pace.

261
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And energy speed. You're not blowing your energy. Yeah. Okay. And remember like he's just like that and he seems old and he's got like a weird posture. Now he's got like something that happened to his neck or his traps where he kind of like doesn't like fully move the right way.

262
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And you're like, this dude should be able to retire, like let him retire. Yeah, but it's like it's spite or something. It's like he's got something to prove and it's about crushing all the other magicians and performers. And I think it's like, yeah, like, I think you guys mentioned it.

263
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Like it's some sort of like Guinness record for tech tickets or shows per like whatever. And he's going to just try to hold on to that, like run that number up, I guess. But when the alien is revealed and it's all like a time travel story that is also aliens.

264
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And then there's a dinosaur and a motorcycle, like all this shit keeps happening where you're like, and it's always just like a big physical thing that he's like, how did I get this out here? And it's like, I, my dad was an IOTC stagehand.

265
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Like, I think I know where some of this stuff comes from. Like also, and I, at one point, my wife goes, we were like pretty stoned, but she's like, look at everybody else's faces. And we just looked around and it was a 50 50 split from people going like, what the fuck is this kind of like looking at each other? And the other 50% were just like, oh my God, a UFO.

266
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It was like, this is fucking crazy. If you get it like, that's a great split for a fuck. But that's the power of Vegas. There's so many mouth breathing freaks there that the city delivers for them. But then there's also real money there and the city delivers for them on that too. So you get to have like all of these worlds, which is fun.

267
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And you and like, you can put your, you're right. We can set our irony dial within within something like that. There's things that we're enjoying on a kitschy level, but then the UFO shows up and you just like, oh, you're like, it's like orgasmic. You can't do it. And like, you know, I can do any amount of like, I'm going to see this weird like wing of this hotel that failed. This is a weird failed endeavor. And I'm going to go see the decay and kind of be, you know, be snarky about it. But then you pass by just the Bellagio fountains and like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

268
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:45,800
Oh, it's one of man's great achievements. You can't have irony about the Bellagio fountains and a lot of stuff like that. Yeah. You, you specifically did not spoil anything when I went to see Copperfield a few years ago. And I, when the UFO appeared, I nearly fell out of my seat because I was right. I was right under it.

269
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:56,880
Yes. Yeah. How does something truly? How does something show up that close to you without right? You don't hear it. You don't see it. Like, it's just in the rafters. Right. And then like, right.

270
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:09,320
I guess so. Yeah. Because it is kept weirdly dark in there, too. Like where you're like, clearly, like, because everything is is hidden behind some huge fake wall or something like that. It feels like. Yeah.

271
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:39,240
Even if you know, it's just a just like when you get on like the Transformers ride and Universal Studios, you know, you're just watching a screen and getting bounced around. But if you let yourself have fun with it, like you'll have fun with it, just like a haunted house. You got to like, yeah, you got to kind of bring that energy to Las Vegas a little bit. Like you got to kind of let yourself like a when in Vega, like a when in Rome, you kind of got to bring that energy of like, and also where else can you go to like a five star restaurant in like flip flops and it's.

272
00:22:39,320 --> 00:23:00,760
Oh, yeah. You can just be whoever you want there, which is kind of fucked up for, you know, the average viewer. But like, it's fun to be there and just see like people. There's like, you know, fucking billionaires speaking Mandarin at one craft stable and at the other craft stable is like nine UFC wannabe guys.

273
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:26,480
Oh, yeah. With the biggest fat Tuesday, like plastic things you ever seen. Scott, you also took a photo. So there's these billboards for Copperfield kind of everywhere in L.A. There's also one in the Burbank airport. And I have seen this a million times, but you zoomed in on the photo. And again, I always fell out of my chair because there was a very tiny blue 32.

274
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:44,400
Even though I was like, oh, my God, it's been there a decade, probably longer, longer. Yeah. Yeah. So fucking rad. It's just it's this special thing that you have to. There's only one room in the world. Yeah. Go meet this friend.

275
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:55,600
And I'm so glad you met him. Only 10 people talk about it. Yeah. We're all like one of 10 people that have ever like mentioned it after seeing it is only due to the passion of Jason Waller.

276
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:08,720
Right. He specifically has spread this if he if it's not for his proselytizing, I don't think because I think most of the people who go see it forget they don't remember his name. They remember like the UFO and the dinosaur more than that.

277
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:20,080
There was this original alien character with a voice of an animaniac doing comedy and sex jokes, clearly trying to ride off like Grogu popularity.

278
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:28,560
Like, you know, it feels like it was before. Before. This is like 10 years in the making. It's been going for so long. Different name.

279
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:35,160
It was Attila the Hug before it was blue 32. Blue 32 is so funny, too, because it's like a football.

280
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:42,120
Right. 32 is like all you could think about. Yeah. He maybe all I could think about, you know, his company might be excluded.

281
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:51,640
Yeah, yeah, it's true. You know, we don't think about football much. I understood that in context, but I don't know other than that what it means or wouldn't know what to do with the phrase football.

282
00:24:51,640 --> 00:25:00,200
Yeah, I know there are huddles. Yes. Very weird theatrical experience to seeing like a theater show.

283
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:09,560
There's a tiny alien statue outside their slot machines 20 feet away and then emeralds fish house and really got these fish is steps away.

284
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:16,200
Which is good. That was good. It's at the MGM. It's kind of like not one of the fancier hotels now. Right.

285
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:24,240
Like, it's like the wind and the on Cosmo and on and are kind of the fancier hotels now.

286
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,400
I guess so. Yeah, it's very is. So it does seem to like like try to step it up in terms of elegance and five star.

287
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:44,280
Yeah, and when you see him a little more populist. Yeah. When you start looking at the fucking like the M life casinos and whoever like these parent company casinos are like whatever brand that they're all part of for like points or whatever.

288
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:51,880
You see like the built in tears of someone owns the Cosmo and the Excalibur and like two hotels in between.

289
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,920
You know what I mean? Like you got to cover the spread. They know to diversify their audiences.

290
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:06,640
And so here are a list of things I always try to do when I go to Vegas, but they fit. They are like slottable wherever.

291
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:18,840
And like so I always want to go to one baller meal, like whether that means fun steakhouse, you know, something that is like dumb Vegas meal.

292
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:25,360
I want to do one buffet trip and this all contingent on like if you're there for two nights, you don't really want to do too much food stuff.

293
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:33,680
But like one buffet trip, the wicked spoon at the Cosmo or the Caesar's Buffet, which I think is called Bacchanalia, which is a really fun one, too.

294
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,920
And you're like, you know, you're paying like sixty five dollars for lunch or whatever.

295
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:47,200
So just be ready to go in there and like, you know, aim to get like be hung over or be high or, you know, get your money's worth a spa day.

296
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,680
Now, oh, always a spa day. Usually I do is the spot every single day, but not like with a treatment.

297
00:26:53,680 --> 00:27:01,200
I just get a day pass and do a little sauna, steam room, hot tub, cold plunge, depending on what the hotel has.

298
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:09,840
Cosmo doesn't have a cold plunge, unfortunately. But the so for me, that is like one part recovery, one part.

299
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:17,040
When I look back at the 72 hours and I was in Vegas, I'm like I did like three health adjacent things for myself.

300
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,600
And then this is where you're going to learn a lot about my internal logic.

301
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,560
I could pay fifty five dollars for a day pass to the spa. Go down.

302
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:35,200
Also, life hack. If you get there well before check in or you have a flight well after check in the lockers in the spa can fit your suitcase.

303
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,520
So for fifty five dollars, you throw all your shit down there.

304
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:44,760
You can go to the casino for the day and then go take a shower and a spa and everything before you go home or before you even check in.

305
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,520
That's good. That's like a fun way to extend it without having to get another night at the hotel.

306
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:55,000
Also, every hotel has like for fifty dollars extra, like a way later check out.

307
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,920
Like if you're especially if you're not checking out on like a Friday or Saturday, you can get like a two p.m.

308
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,600
Check out for fifty bucks if you need like, you know, to shit in your hotel room.

309
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,360
It's usually mine. I'm like, I don't want to do this at the airport.

310
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,200
Any amount of money.

311
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:19,840
We we had a great experience last year where we we kept seeing the same guy at the check in desk every time we would need like, oh, hey, this key's not working or like, oh, can we get this or that?

312
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,560
And then the day before we were like, hey, could we get a late check out?

313
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,720
We have like our flights not until the late afternoon.

314
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:33,480
And he he kind of he waved the like the feet and he was like, sure.

315
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,360
How about a two p.m.? We're like, oh, my God, I didn't know you could check out that.

316
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,200
And then he's like, I'll just make sure I know you had that sink issue.

317
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,840
Like he's like winking at us.

318
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,880
And it was solely because we were like talk to him and we're friendly with him.

319
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:58,440
Yeah. And off what Jason's saying here, I think Vegas is maybe the last bastion of corporate wiggle room.

320
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,480
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Every other business is like everyone runs it so fucking tight.

321
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,440
Everyone so hard. They are a bot that you're dealing with online or whatever.

322
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,320
But they go by the rules so hard.

323
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,080
It used to be back in the day, someone who had job security would be like, look, I'm supposed to charge you.

324
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,000
But look, if you pay parts, you're not supposed to like you're a loyal customer.

325
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,800
Vegas is like the last remaining bastion of that, even outside of like the official like,

326
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,960
oh, you gambled enough to have a comped meal or free.

327
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,600
They have like Daniel Van Kirk, another podcaster.

328
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,720
He on my podcast on high mighty said, I take out twenty dollars when I check in.

329
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,200
I go, if there's any upgrades available, I'd love.

330
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,720
And he said it has worked for him 100 percent of the time.

331
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:50,160
He said one time the person was like, I'm sorry, we just have nothing.

332
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,920
And he like didn't take the 20.

333
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,240
And Daniel was like, no, you can you looked you can have the 20.

334
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,880
Like I put it out there.

335
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,680
And he said otherwise, he's gotten upgraded to a suite every single time.

336
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,360
The twenty dollar trick. Yeah.

337
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,840
The this is documented online.

338
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,960
You hand them your ID and a credit card and you sandwich a 20 between them.

339
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,800
And you ask like if there's any upgrades available, that'd be great.

340
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,360
I still find it hard to believe you're giving away 20 bucks.

341
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,480
I tried this for the first time last year.

342
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,720
And this very nice guy who is checking us in

343
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,120
was having issues with his computer, so never looked up.

344
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,600
Oh, so he never like missed the bill.

345
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,520
Missed the bill. Like he missed the bill.

346
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,200
For the barista to look back before you drop the dollar in.

347
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,040
She's messing with the machine.

348
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,640
I am tipping you. Wait, wait, wait. Look up. Look up. See. OK.

349
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,000
I'm not a piece of shit.

350
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,400
Yeah. Fly or a bird in the room.

351
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,760
It's like it's really stressed, like banging on it.

352
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,720
Like something is going horribly wrong.

353
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,400
Like this is the worst part of the day.

354
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,280
And it's like, please, I just want you to know I'm a good person.

355
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,760
Did he take the money, though? No.

356
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,000
OK, so you didn't take them.

357
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,440
I put it sandwiched. How did he not take it?

358
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,240
Yeah. Because you never have to look at your ID and stuff anyway.

359
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,200
He just grabbed the card and ran the card.

360
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,920
He just never took it.

361
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,000
I think he was pretending he didn't see it.

362
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,200
I mean, he could have been he was also training a guy who's like,

363
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,640
it's my first. Oh, there's no way he's going to take the 20.

364
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,440
Yeah. So that's the other thing.

365
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,760
He didn't see. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

366
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,640
So probably didn't see it.

367
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,720
But it's like the last place where if you call down and like, yeah,

368
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,200
they are hospitable there, especially at the nicer casinos.

369
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,720
And I should talk, I only mostly stay at the Cosmo for the balcony thing

370
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,800
or the Venetian, which I like, because it also it has like

371
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,960
the weird mall attached to it that has a bunch of restaurants,

372
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,480
but also has only sweets, which is kind of cool.

373
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,960
You know, they all have like the little living room attached.

374
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,600
And it's not like much more than another room.

375
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,960
It's like because that's that's their standard is like a king size bed

376
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,680
and like a little living room.

377
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,080
Those rooms kind of like I thought about staying there and I'm not.

378
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,040
But are those rooms kind of like silly, fake Italy?

379
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,720
There's it like, yes, little flourishes, little beds, a little gaudy at times.

380
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,120
And then the mall has the gondola that runs through it,

381
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,360
like a river that runs through and you could take a gondola.

382
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,400
I never done that goes all the way outside.

383
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,280
And then the ceiling is painted with like blue and with clouds in the mall,

384
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,960
which is also really funny.

385
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,800
We were saying in another episode, indoor skies.

386
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,520
I like all of those in Vegas.

387
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,360
Yeah. Caesar's shops.

388
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,280
I love is it planet Hollywood as that whatever that mall is,

389
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,520
I think, because indoor miracle mile. Yeah. OK.

390
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
This is only tangential.

391
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,440
No, is the sports store where Pete Rose is always signing?

392
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,480
Is that in Caesar's?

393
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,320
Do you know what I'm talking about?

394
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,400
I do not know, but this sounds awesome.

395
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,880
There's a sports store every time I'm in Vegas.

396
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,800
And I feel like it's by Caesar's that it's always there's a thing outside.

397
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,160
It says Pete Rose signing.

398
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,560
And I go, this is five, like the fifth time.

399
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,320
That's so right. I don't know about it, but I got to go.

400
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,080
Mike has pulled out recently some of the most fascinating

401
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,280
P. Rose today.

402
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,320
Rich little

403
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,200
I was in a sea.

404
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,240
Secure. Yeah, no, they're not obscure.

405
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,120
It's just an interesting more.

406
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:14,040
We're missing the Morris Day in the Times show by a few days.

407
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,960
It's just such an interesting.

408
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,280
That's the big thing about Vegas.

409
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,360
It's an interesting cast of character.

410
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,120
Yeah, I saw Purple Rain, our EIG.

411
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,920
I've also seen this show. Yeah.

412
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,400
And it was fine.

413
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,600
But the guy who is playing Prince up there got angry

414
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,280
that no one was like enjoying it as much.

415
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,720
Yeah. How could he tell?

416
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,600
There was just little not enough applause.

417
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,400
There was just not enough people in there either.

418
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,440
It was like, you know, and it was just like a weird vibe.

419
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,560
The person I went with just happened to have like like Prince and we're

420
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,880
for their birthday and we're like, all right, we'll go to this.

421
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,680
And that's always fun, too, is just like agreeing to someone else's itinerary

422
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,400
for a couple of things. You're like, I would never do this at a Vegas.

423
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,240
For so Spa Day, that that that

424
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,600
some sort of show of some sort, whether it is like a Copperfield

425
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,960
or even like one of the Cirques or something.

426
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,360
Oh, yeah. Do you like us?

427
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,720
I haven't done a Cirque in many years.

428
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,640
They're like fine.

429
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,000
It's like it's like it's really like just watching a screensaver

430
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,120
with your friends in like a weird way.

431
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,640
And I'm impressed by just like, wow, this theater is very impressive.

432
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,400
The sound. Wow. The production.

433
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,440
Oh, that's a bouncy part of the floor.

434
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,920
You know, like, yeah, stupid, like just been hard to build.

435
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,320
If only Kelsey Grammer had fallen on that one day.

436
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,000
It'll be OK. Pop right back up.

437
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,760
The P.

438
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,960
Rose's site autograph schedule, it's he's in Mandalay Bay

439
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,760
and MGM Grand at a place called Art of Music in both places.

440
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,840
I don't know why it's called Art of Music.

441
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,400
Wait, Mandalay Bay and what? And MGM Grand.

442
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:55,840
They might be MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and Luxor might all be connected

443
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,000
by the tram, so it might be like an in-between situation.

444
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,520
Oh, yeah, there's a straight line.

445
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,480
It's Mandalay Bay Luxor Excalibur Excalibur.

446
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,000
And then further up, it's Park MGM Aria

447
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,160
Bellagio.

448
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,680
Aria is another one of the like fan, like nicer hotels to.

449
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,640
Yeah. The theme of Aria is glass and metal. Yeah.

450
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,920
That is I've been there a few times and I have tried to like,

451
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,960
what is that?

452
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,000
Like, what is the and like some large installation art?

453
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,320
Yeah. The wind is very colorful, which is kind of rad to be in

454
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,480
because Steve Wynn, wonderful guy, great, great fan.

455
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,640
Always on the lookout for humanity.

456
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,240
He's like losing his eyesight.

457
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,120
So everything has to be like in super.

458
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,240
He makes them make everything intense color.

459
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,080
So it does have a fun by like byproduct of being a man.

460
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,120
It's like all neon and like bright colors and shit.

461
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,720
That's kind of a fun one to be in.

462
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,920
Yeah. Wow.

463
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,040
Mike and I walked through that once and they have a lot of the

464
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,480
what's the guy that's a balloon, the metal balloon.

465
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,680
Jeff Koons, they have so much Jeff Koons in the wind.

466
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,720
Yeah. Did they was Koons make an appearance in the Cross the Spiderverse, right?

467
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,840
Like, yeah. Or am I? Oh, I don't.

468
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,160
I haven't seen anyone yet. Whoa.

469
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,520
None of us. Yeah.

470
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,240
I have not been to the movies much.

471
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,560
I lost a huge bet.

472
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,080
Oh, yeah. You're you bet.

473
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,560
Mitch wouldn't have a would be would not be the first one to have a house

474
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,000
and that we had already seen Spiderverse.

475
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,280
Man, that parlay did not come in. Absolutely not.

476
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,360
No. If you're if I'm there for an extended period of time, I like to hit old Vegas,

477
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,280
especially if I'm there with people who never go.

478
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,480
I'm like, let's go to the old strip.

479
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,480
And because it's got a half domed there, like it's got like a domed

480
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,800
ceiling area to with less.

481
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,320
But it's like a LED screen.

482
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,280
So there's stuff going on on top.

483
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,560
And also that's the place to have like play five dollar craps

484
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,960
in a place where you think they're ripping you off or like a great spot

485
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,600
for like those giant jungle juice, necklace, drinks and shit like that.

486
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,440
I always try to have one, you know, Marty Gra adjacent consumption

487
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,480
like moment where I'm like, all right, guys, I'm buying.

488
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,720
And especially if it's a bachelor party, I'm like, I'm putting my card down

489
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,000
and I'm buying 10 huge frosies.

490
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,520
I'm going to force this upon people.

491
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,320
And yeah, that's a funny duality, too, that you can like drink the finest drinks.

492
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,320
You can drink at such a high level or just like a

493
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:32,920
packet of slum at a place or you can have like this is paint thinner and ice.

494
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:41,440
Do you like do you like that drunk as opposed to is there something from the

495
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,760
the trash drunk or is it just a ticket to to vomit?

496
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,040
It's gross.

497
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,240
And I and I even drink way less than I ever did before, especially in Las

498
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,000
Vegas, especially with like the proliferation of cannabis in Vegas.

499
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,960
But there's something about like I'm like I have camp counselor energy a little bit.

500
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,600
And it's like, wouldn't it be fun if all four of us had giant stupid drinks?

501
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,760
And then you regret that instantly.

502
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,800
Like just sits.

503
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,200
Usually what happens is you drink like a quarter of it,

504
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,640
go up to the room to barf shit or like, you know, change the vibe in some way.

505
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,840
Put it down on your dresser.

506
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,080
Go about your day.

507
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,040
Come back at night.

508
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,400
And it's just like condensation sweat and all the ingredients have like separated

509
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,360
in a weird way. And it's and you're like, I can't believe I almost drank.

510
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,320
And then you're like barfing while you pour it down your sink drain.

511
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,320
My my girlfriend and I have been to Vegas every year since 2020.

512
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,840
Like we squeezed in a trip in end of February 2020.

513
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:44,840
And that first trip I was like, well, I'm just going to try the slushy drinks

514
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,600
because it's so hot and it's so like even in February, it's hot.

515
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,440
And, you know, I want to cool down and stuff.

516
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,400
And I just spent most of the trip very bloated, like that much.

517
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,840
I'm like, I'm going to go to Vegas.

518
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,880
I'm going to go to Vegas.

519
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,920
The trip very bloated, like that much ice and slush and corn syrup.

520
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,200
I was just like, yeah, for days, I was like the hydration of the air.

521
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,160
You're like hands are like Mickey Mouse.

522
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,520
My hands are destroyed.

523
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,400
My hands are like totally dry.

524
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,480
When the ring explodes off at the.

525
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,800
What do you think of that?

526
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,560
Because this this seems this is the yard.

527
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,400
Your alcohol taste is a colorful slush.

528
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,360
Yeah, it's fun. I like the I like doing it, but it's

529
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,240
there's no way you're drinking all of it.

530
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,840
So I like they have a smaller one at the Taco Bell Cantina, I feel like.

531
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,280
That's that's one I have not hit yet.

532
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,520
Yeah, I want and I want to I've never been to any Taco Bell.

533
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,000
Oh, because it's one of Hollywood Boulevard.

534
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,760
I know. I know. I got to check that out.

535
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,080
That seems like a place we all want to be actively on Hollywood Boulevard.

536
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,400
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

537
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,120
What nice don't we spend on a whole

538
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,480
wandering Hollywood Boulevard.

539
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,080
Gene went to the one in Times Square

540
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,120
when we were there for the New York show and immediately saw a fight.

541
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,440
Like we had a fight going on when I was there, too.

542
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,520
There were like we was like scared.

543
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,880
It was a little scary. Yeah.

544
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,560
Well, it's nice to know there's a establishment out there

545
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,280
where there is always a fight to watch. Yeah. Guaranteed.

546
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,320
Yeah. No, you don't want to be in Vegas on a big UFC weekend.

547
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,240
It changes the tone a little bit.

548
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,400
You know, I mean, like it's just a little more masculine than you want it to be there.

549
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,240
It's kind of peak masculinity there to begin with.

550
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,120
But like it used to be like feel like old school masculinity, like brandy cigars,

551
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,880
like wealthy fat guy, wealthy fat tan guy masculinity.

552
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:39,800
Then like everyone now it gets like it's like, oh, shit, there's so many like

553
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,840
Ed Hardy shirt guys now.

554
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:46,880
And there's like and still even like trends that you thought died in 2005.

555
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,320
Oh, my God. Driving today.

556
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,680
I know, dude. It's crazy.

557
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,560
Tucked in tank tops to jean shorts and shit.

558
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,600
And the guys making like twenty five hundred dollar bets.

559
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,360
And you're like, I do not know your life, man.

560
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,440
How do I classify you?

561
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,240
Douchebag from the past.

562
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,360
We in OK, in terms of like

563
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,200
masculine energy in Vegas and something else you mentioned

564
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,160
you've done is the gun range.

565
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,920
I did that crazy automatic gun range.

566
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,280
You can fire almost anything.

567
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,320
I shot in a belt fed M60 into a target like like the Rambo gun.

568
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,440
Oh, my God. And I'm I am very anti guns.

569
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,840
I think only movies should have them.

570
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,560
Yeah, yeah. But I am a fan of action movies.

571
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,280
So and this is crazy.

572
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,240
The weekend I was there was a Friends bachelor party.

573
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,320
He's like, I want to go shoot guns at that crazy range.

574
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,720
And like we're like 10 guys, four guys were like, no, thank you.

575
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,560
Ten L.A. guys and six of us were like, yeah, I'll go.

576
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,280
And I went had a blast.

577
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,680
I shot an M16. I shot a 12 gauge.

578
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,720
I shot a big giant like Magnum revolver, which like I'm 300 pounds.

579
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,040
And that hurt my elbow.

580
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,440
I'm like in movies like women, like 80 pound women are shooting two of them

581
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,480
or whatever.

582
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,240
Yeah, I'm like almost blow my fucking head off.

583
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,480
Just like trying to hold it.

584
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,880
It was crazy. It wasn't until.

585
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,320
I was there a very specific weekend for this bachelor party.

586
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,920
We're flying home on Sunday and we all landed to a bunch of texts

587
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,880
and calls from our loved ones because it was the night of that crazy

588
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,040
guy in the hotel.

589
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,000
Yeah, the guy who shot like the country, right?

590
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,400
The country festival shot it up and we had all posted

591
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,920
Instagrams of us tagging like Las Vegas, holding machine guns and shit like that.

592
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,800
And we were like the bachelor party.

593
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,240
Texas, like everyone take down your shit, take that shit right now.

594
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,160
People are dying because everyone was texting us to be like, are you OK?

595
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,360
Is that where you guys were?

596
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,200
And we're like, no, we were not.

597
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,960
We were the L.A. bachelor party.

598
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,880
We were not there for that. We were there for we did shoot guns.

599
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,800
And it was just crazy.

600
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,160
And then, you know, if the proliferation of shootings,

601
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,440
public shootings and mass shootings and stuff, I had the moment.

602
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,360
I'm like, what would have stopped someone from just like turning to the right

603
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,760
in this gun range and spraying?

604
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,440
This is my problem with doing this.

605
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,080
And then all of a sudden I was like, oh, I never thought about that previously.

606
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,320
And now it's in my head and ours, too.

607
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,720
I guess we'll cross that off the list.

608
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,640
Yeah, that is anyone can turn. That's true.

609
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,600
It's it's kind of a scary situation.

610
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,640
I've done a lot of weird off strip stuff there because I've gone to so many bachelor

611
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,800
parties. I like to joke, you know, women like there's like the expression

612
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,800
always the bride's maid, never the bride.

613
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,440
But I'm always at the bachelor party, never in a tux.

614
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,920
Like I never get groomsman level.

615
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,000
No one wants me in photos like with their wife, but everyone wants me

616
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,320
in Vegas with them for four nights.

617
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,360
So I'm fine with that.

618
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:56,920
But like I did ATVs there, which was kind of rad, like riding around.

619
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:01,600
But the dude who took us on the tour was super angry that all of us kept like

620
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,440
our bikes kept stalling because we just didn't know what we were doing.

621
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,200
And can you start mine again?

622
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,640
He's like, you mother fuck, fuck, god damn mother.

623
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,160
Starting our shit up and we're all kind of like looking at each other.

624
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,440
And one of the guy, the bachelor party was I didn't even go to this guy's wedding,

625
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,680
but he invited me to his bachelor party.

626
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,200
They want you there for the sin, but not the matrimony.

627
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,720
Yeah. And I know for that, like, I don't need to fucking write a two hundred dollar

628
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,400
check and like dance with your fucking cousin or whatever.

629
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,040
So this guy is like the groom is a lawyer and on the drive home, he's like, hey,

630
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,160
didn't I hear one of you guys is a lawyer?

631
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,240
And he's like, oh, yeah, I am.

632
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,360
He's like, I got a quick law question for you.

633
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,320
I walked in on my wife, fucking another guy,

634
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,160
went and got my gun from the car, and when I came back to shoot him,

635
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,520
he shot me in the back.

636
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,240
Can I sue him? We were like, oh,

637
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,360
and that's just a small business owner in Las Vegas has a story like that.

638
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,880
Like, wow, did anyone have the answer?

639
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,960
What was the answer?

640
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,720
No, the answer was, uh, yeah, well,

641
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,480
like, well, this is our hotel right here.

642
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,680
Get out, get out, get out, get out, but tip them, tip them, tip them.

643
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,440
I was going to say I did not think that was some New York improvisers

644
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,720
asking that question.

645
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,320
You would ask like 200 follow ups. Yeah.

646
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:27,600
Another cool thing I did there was recently I did the Meow Wolf Omega Mart.

647
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,200
Let's talk about this.

648
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,160
I see we're deciding if that's something we should make time for or not.

649
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,960
Yeah, it's not a huge, not super far off strip.

650
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,720
It's like a 10 minute ride from most of the strip. And, um,

651
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,000
it was really fun.

652
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,080
And I think me and Tiff were in and out in like three hours on like a weekday.

653
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:49,440
And we had a, we had a blast. It's really fucking weird.

654
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,800
And I think like comedy heads would like it even more,

655
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,640
especially like if you're like world building at all, because it's like,

656
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,960
the entire Mart is like everything you can,

657
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:04,000
you can buy stuff there and everything is like a funny tongue in cheek,

658
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,600
like item in some way, or like the ad is weird or it's like, you know,

659
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,560
something that we were like, and then you're like, this is kind of cool.

660
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,160
And then you like go through the butcher shop and you're in like a, you know,

661
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,000
10,000 square foot fucking a huge loft space.

662
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,480
And it's like multi-floored all kinds of everything is fully interactive.

663
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,240
Any screen is playing something that is like, like,

664
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,120
like a video game where you're like,

665
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,280
can click on every single thing and read every single thing.

666
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,880
And it all kind of has connectivity. It's all that. And then you're in there,

667
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,320
you know, like if you're like me,

668
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,320
you're eat some edibles and you just wander around looking at shit.

669
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,560
But there are like kids having a blast. They're like,

670
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:47,120
it's like for everyone in a weird way, cause it is just spectacle.

671
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,920
Or you can like dive down and be like,

672
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,600
I think we're supposed to go to this room next to determine what happened with

673
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,680
the laboratory experiment. Like, or you can just,

674
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,440
there's a story to it though. Here's a plot you can follow,

675
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,160
but you can do it a little more. Just wander around.

676
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,600
And I don't know how much like, like there's a strict narrative direction,

677
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:09,160
but it is sort of like this room maybe think made us think we should keep our eye

678
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,520
out for this room when we find it and stuff like that. Okay. And it was,

679
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,840
and it was way cooler than I even thought it was going to be. I thought,

680
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,520
I was like, oh, this will be like, cause I was always intrigued by it.

681
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,920
I guess the originals in New Mexico and George R. R. Martin, well,

682
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:26,240
helped finance these guys for a while because he's a New Mexico guy. And,

683
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,040
I was like, oh yeah, let's, let's do it.

684
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,920
And then I was truly impressed. Like it is also like,

685
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,680
cause there's no like human interaction, you know what I mean? So it's like you,

686
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,200
and I know you guys are theme park guys. I'm not personally with like,

687
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,800
the person who's like, alas, welcome. You know, like there's none of that.

688
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,520
It's sort of like you're on your own pace.

689
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,840
I like psychos wandering around there. Like obviously just like people go and like,

690
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,440
like I'm tripping balls and you have to engage with me now. But otherwise it was,

691
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,880
I thought that was really rad and, and it's in like a,

692
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,680
the Meow Wolf's in like a kind of,

693
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,400
it's called like area 55 or some kind of weird complex.

694
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,000
Yeah. There's a couple of bars, there's acts throwing, there's drinks,

695
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
there's some like other shit to do there too.

696
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,480
Is that where that heart attack grill is? No, that's on the old strip.

697
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,000
That's the other one. That's Fremont.

698
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,960
Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. And I think you can eat there for free.

699
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,720
I think they raised the weight. It used to be like over 300 and now I think it's

700
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:28,720
like three 25, 300 not good enough because like too many people in America are

701
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,360
now over 300 or something. Especially Vegas. Yeah.

702
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,880
Most of them are in Las Vegas.

703
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,760
Vegas is where I feel like a fucking, like you talk about the joke,

704
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,760
like I'm in LA six, but I'm a Vegas fucking body.

705
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,840
I'm a Vegas Olympic fucking swimmer.

706
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,800
Yeah. There was the talk of we were,

707
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,560
we were figuring out venues for our live show and Mike,

708
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,960
you checked one out and I think did not really look at it very hard and no,

709
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,280
send it to me. It was in neon Opulence,

710
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,600
which I went to once and just past neon Opulence. It was,

711
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,520
it was like night of the living dead. Just like, I like,

712
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,040
you could just see silhouettes and it's just bodies like staggering through the

713
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,480
day and it felt like there was mist and like, I'm just,

714
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,240
I don't want to know whatever is happening there and why they are this way.

715
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,680
And that is where the heart attractor is. Yes. Yeah.

716
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,840
And then, but then I looked at where you sent and it was,

717
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,880
if it was a venue that had a giant writable penis,

718
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,320
I was part of this facility. Yeah.

719
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,520
I mean that's fine to do.

720
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,400
We could have done the whole show while writing, taking turns writing a big penis.

721
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,680
I feel comfortable getting on that. It's like a, it's a mechanical bowl,

722
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:42,680
but it's a big penis. Yes. Yeah. I wasn't arguing otherwise. Yeah.

723
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,320
I'm just saying I would do it. Oh, that's what it is. I'm in.

724
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,840
It actually comes.

725
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:57,480
Sounds like the confidence of a sexual being, a man in touch with the spirit of

726
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,680
Eros. Jason, thank you for seeing me as a sexual being.

727
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,080
I just see a couple of sexual beings recognizing each other here and it's kind

728
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,200
of beautiful, man. Yeah. Nice. Nice. Nice. All right.

729
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,840
I guess I'm on the outside of it. Maybe I need to come on in brother.

730
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:16,160
There's room on the cat. I was going to say the water's warm, but I don't want to,

731
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,600
I don't know. Yeah. Kind of makes it worse. Makes 10 times worse.

732
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,400
Let's get that back to a single entendre, please.

733
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,720
I speaking of Vegas shootings, I was there one time with friends,

734
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,200
just going out, just having dinner at this fancy like a steakhouse in the MGM.

735
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,440
I think it was, if the name comes to me, I'll throw it out there.

736
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,120
Cause it was, the food was fucking bomb.

737
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,520
But I, first time it's ever happened to me,

738
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,680
waiter came over and was like, please get up and leave the restaurant right now.

739
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,840
And every time we look around and someone like flicks the lights and it's like

740
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,600
everyone up and out of here. And we were like, what's going on? They're like,

741
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,560
and you hear whispers like there was a shooting on the strip. There's a shoot.

742
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,480
And it's all over the place. We have to evacuate a restaurant.

743
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,760
We're all like women in high heels and a man and all dressed up,

744
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,800
do she running through like the back tunnels behind the casino and a restaurant

745
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,000
out into a parking lot. And we're like running to the street.

746
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,280
And then when we like run to the street, we see people running the other way.

747
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,080
No one knows what's going on. It's all, and this may be like, you know,

748
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,480
a Psyop deep fake cover story.

749
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:27,720
But apparently what happened is someone broke a glass door with like a hammer

750
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,560
or slamming or throwing something at it.

751
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
And that went over security as a shooting at a fucking different hotel.

752
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,080
But so me and me and some friends, Dan,

753
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:45,080
Gregor and some Jack Dolgen and our partners all had to leave.

754
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,720
And then we didn't want to go back on the strip or take an Uber or anything.

755
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:54,720
So we went into the MGM and just like went up in an elevator to the first floor.

756
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,240
We can get off without a key.

757
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:02,080
I'm like the eighth floor and just went down by the stairwell and like hung out

758
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,120
there for like an hour and a half. And like,

759
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,120
and like it was a really intense like moment. Like,

760
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,880
and I don't want to tell other people's stories,

761
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:13,680
but Dan was in New York city on nine 11, like as a freshman in college,

762
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,000
or sophomore in college,

763
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,720
and he had just had his kid and was like without his wife. And he was like,

764
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:23,200
like that was like, you know, it was impossible to laugh about that.

765
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:28,200
And we eventually, as we reconnected with society and like went back to our hotel,

766
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,920
we went down first time I've ever seen a casino closed. We went downstairs.

767
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,160
It was just not, sorry. The casino is not open right now.

768
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:40,080
And people were telling us stories. They were in the restaurant, the Cosmo,

769
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:44,360
and someone people were flipping over the dining room tables and hiding behind

770
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,480
them for cover and shit.

771
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:51,240
And this was happening at like eight hotels simultaneously, but zero,

772
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,040
only one of them was where the door was broken and allegedly no shooter

773
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,720
whatsoever. Yeah.

774
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,120
And that's all anyone was talking about for the whole weekend.

775
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,920
You would just be at the craft stable and someone's like,

776
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,520
were you here last night? And you're like, yeah. And they were like,

777
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,520
what'd you do? We hit out on the eighth floor. You know,

778
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,160
we were at this restaurant. They told us to leave.

779
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,520
It was an enormous delicious steak dinner that we walked out on the bill.

780
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,200
Okay. Well, there's a bright side to everything.

781
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,800
When we went back for a friend's birthday,

782
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,680
we went back to that steak house the weekend of purple rain and we found our

783
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,920
waiter and tipped him cash. We were like, we're not going to pay for the guy.

784
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,760
Cause he was such a, he was like in the Vegas hospitality way.

785
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,840
He had like our Jack had had him as a waiter before and we requested his

786
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,720
section and he was so good to us.

787
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,240
And we were about to drop like a thousand dollars cause we were just like

788
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,280
ordering oysters and bourbon and all this shit. We were like,

789
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,880
totally over the top and then didn't pay for it. So we're like,

790
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,480
we got to give this guy a couple hundred bucks.

791
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,360
Oh great. Yeah.

792
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:59,280
A lot of weird news stories out of Vegas lately, multiple cashier

793
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,280
robberies, some various casinos, some on the strip of like,

794
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:08,160
you know, somewhere put the money in the bag. Others were like, hi,

795
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,080
I'm the brother of the owner. And if you could just give me a,

796
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:16,080
like $50,000 he's asking for and like got away with it.

797
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,200
Some try that.

798
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,400
Someone sandwiched in between two room keys, please.

799
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,320
I'm the brother of the guy who owns this place. Someone,

800
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,160
uh,

801
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,000
Jason Caesar.

802
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,320
So I, I, I don't know the conclusion of the story,

803
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,920
but someone barricaded themselves in a hotel room in Caesar's and they like

804
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,920
evacuated their massive pool deck and stuff.

805
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,160
I saw that he was throwing furniture out the window.

806
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:45,640
Yeah. Yeah.

807
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,280
30 something floor or some shit.

808
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,560
Yeah. So this is one. Wow. Wow.

809
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,400
Always something in that city.

810
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,640
Something positive that's happening when we're there.

811
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,240
And I didn't tell you guys this yet, but I'm going to reveal it now. Oh boy.

812
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,400
There are some,

813
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,120
a very important sporting event tapings happening when we're going to be there

814
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:06,120
next weekend. And of course I'm talking about the return of slam ball slam ball.

815
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:11,440
My car trampoline basketball league sponsored by ACL surgeons.

816
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,680
It's not good for your ankles. There's no way it is.

817
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,360
The only league sponsored by orthopedic surgeons. I'm like,

818
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,560
we're going to print money off this fucking job.

819
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,920
Slam ball is returning and is taping in Las Vegas the weekend.

820
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,720
We're going to be there. I think three days.

821
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,600
What do you think is the degree of hassle of attending the slam ball tape?

822
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:36,280
What is the time commitment? I mean, I, I, I've never seen slam ball in person.

823
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,680
I've been accidentally at universal studios to see slam ball. Uh,

824
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,480
and I did last about 15 minutes. Okay.

825
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,120
Kind of same standing outside that weird like bush area.

826
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,920
When you know the guy who created slam ball, maybe you could send an email.

827
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,760
Ooh, what are you talking about?

828
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,800
I know the man who created slam ball,

829
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,080
I'm his brother.

830
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:01,840
That's my middle name.

831
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,840
Slam Carlson would be a good fucking heal. Yeah, that'd be great.

832
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,720
You already have, you're already Mr. Mike fisto, which is a reference.

833
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,320
Yeah. Bono's evil character.

834
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,960
Oh, that's where he's a little devil,

835
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,680
but there's no reason you can't expand your lineup of heal persona.

836
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:29,920
Yeah. Full cactus, Jack. Uh, mankind. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

837
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:34,800
They could all show up in one episode, just like, uh, Mick Foley. Yeah.

838
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:39,320
All of his guys showed up in one Royal Rumble. He came out three times.

839
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,240
Yeah. So fun. That's like the appeal.

840
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,320
That's like what the definition of why wrestling rules. Yes.

841
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,000
This guy's back out, but now he's a hippie.

842
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,560
He changed his t-shirt.

843
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:57,000
He's clearly more tired than everybody else. Triple H selling.

844
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,160
When, when cactus Jack came back, Mick Foley is cutting a promo and he goes,

845
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,600
I'm not going to face you. Basically.

846
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,440
There's a different guy that's going to face you.

847
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,000
And he opens up his shirt to show cactus Jack shirt and triple H sells it as if

848
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,800
he's seen a ghost. It's the same man.

849
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,560
So it's just a tie dye t-shirt.

850
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:19,280
I was in the audience and lost my mind. Oh, cause cactus Jack is more violent.

851
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:23,200
He's scary. Very violent. Yes. Even though all of his matches were violent.

852
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,680
Yeah. You know, the other guy wears like a BDSM mask and puts a sock down your

853
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:31,480
throat. He's the less violent one than the guy in the tie dye t-shirt. Yeah.

854
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,320
Yeah. Uh, speaking of sporting events,

855
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,440
I've now gone to two different, uh,

856
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,920
professional sporting events in Vegas and enjoyed myself at both.

857
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,680
I saw a summer league and I'm not a basketball fan,

858
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,920
but I went for a friend's bachelor party that was to see summer league,

859
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,840
which I guess is like NBA potential people playing in like, uh,

860
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,640
and that was kind of fun, kind of come and go as you please.

861
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,800
Sort of two days of tickets kind of situation.

862
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:00,360
And another time I went to go see the Vegas golden Knights play the New York

863
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,240
Islanders, my old favorite hockey. Wow. Okay.

864
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,120
And I don't really follow hockey anymore,

865
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:09,000
but I happened to be going for with some Long Island guys who were there and

866
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,680
they were like, we're going to get tickets to the Islander game.

867
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,560
And then I was like, Oh, that'd be fun. I've never done something like that.

868
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:17,240
And then it's really cool. You can walk to like,

869
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,560
there's that area called like the park, the park. Yeah. Yeah.

870
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:24,000
Which is kind of like an open air bar strip area.

871
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,560
Places smoke weed. Yeah. Yeah. Go over and get in the park, baby. Yeah.

872
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,680
That's the Washington square park of Vegas.

873
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,880
Maybe we're man offers you a hit off a blunt and they start selling you.

874
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,840
It's like, yeah, we're growing the original strains.

875
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,480
The ones that were kind of grown out.

876
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:43,200
Do you want some of this? And it's like 2021 and you're like, no,

877
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,680
I don't want to share that. But thank you so much. Keep the lighter,

878
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,840
keep the lighter friend.

879
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,840
But that was really fun to just be like, walk to a sporting event. Uh,

880
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,480
this fall I intend to go see the giants. My,

881
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,760
the team I do actually follow and support the New York giants. Uh,

882
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,760
they're playing at, uh, Vegas. So I'm going to go to a golden night or whatever.

883
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:07,120
There the Raiders Raiders. Yeah. Right. Right. Um, isn't there some insane,

884
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:11,280
didn't the Vegas golden nights open with some ceremony that I know we were

885
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,840
alerted to this because we,

886
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,920
we did an episode where we talked about how the mighty ducks, uh,

887
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,240
started their entire existence.

888
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,480
They had like a really bizarre irritating opening ceremony where like a

889
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:27,000
big, a big duck with a mask flew in a while like,

890
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:32,160
and then there was a guy named ice man who pumped up there when it was just like,

891
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:36,200
just a guy in a silver suit and silver makeup pumped up the, did you,

892
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,880
do you have any memory of that? I feel like the Vegas,

893
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,440
I know about this. Well, no, it was,

894
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,600
I know about the nicer way because the golden nights were an original,

895
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,640
like they didn't come from anywhere. They started in Vegas.

896
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:53,320
Their first game was pretty soon after the Mandalay Bay shooting and the

897
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:58,040
captain of the team was a Las Vegas, uh, local. And, and they,

898
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:02,200
they put together like a very tasteful tribute and everything.

899
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:07,240
So like immediately got the town on board for the team. So, uh,

900
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:12,200
the locals are really big fans of the hockey team and they just like went wild

901
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,040
when they won the Stanley cup this year.

902
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,920
Oh, that's so fucking rad. Yeah.

903
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:20,000
It's fun to go because hockey is one of the fun live sports too. You know,

904
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I mean like it's just like very manageable to watch and like kind of like,

905
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,680
uh, a little smaller of a ring, you know what I mean?

906
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:31,720
So it's like the volume and it feels more intense in there. Uh,

907
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,480
so I want to go for a giants game.

908
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,160
And another thing I never did because I had this scheduled for March 13th,

909
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:40,840
2020, um, was the NCAA tournament.

910
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,480
And it's not played in Vegas, but it lets you bet, you know,

911
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,000
you can bet on 64 games on one day, you know, like you can really have fun.

912
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,200
There's always some sports bets. You can get some crazy parlays going,

913
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,600
and there's always games on TV to like, cause that's a big part of,

914
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,960
I should say part of my Vegas, uh, uh, strategy too,

915
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,360
is I lay sports bets right when I arrive too.

916
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,760
And that's sort of like my fake savings account where it's like,

917
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,480
so when I lose all my money, it's like, well,

918
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,560
I still have $400 up in the air for on the, on games this weekend.

919
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:14,920
So, and then like that gives you something to be like, Oh,

920
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:18,880
I'm losing at the craps table. It's like, Oh, well, the chargers game is on.

921
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,240
Let me go sit down and have a beer and breathe and hope that the chargers, uh,

922
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,160
get hit the over or whatever, you know? Um,

923
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:29,640
so that adds like a layer to my entire trip too. And, and, uh,

924
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:34,080
I go with a recurring group of guys, a lot of people, mutual friends of ours.

925
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,920
We go, we're all married men in our forties. So like,

926
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,920
our Vegas, but who are all gambling guys.

927
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,640
So our Vegas trips are very specific and it's like,

928
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,920
the texts are like who's landing first.

929
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:50,000
I won't land in time to make the 4pm bets. Can you,

930
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:54,280
so there's just like Venmo's shooting around like crazy and shit like that.

931
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,160
Yeah. I, so I have some gambling questions. Um, uh,

932
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:03,840
remind me what your game of choices is that roulette or crap? It's craps.

933
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,960
And how do I play that?

934
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:11,120
Craps and now give us something you could Google.

935
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:15,600
Is this something I should do on strip or I should go to like Ellis Island or

936
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:19,760
like Fremont or something. Uh, Ellis Island, you are Jason Schaer.

937
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:25,640
Your name shortened that Ellis Island is a casino with a microbrewery just behind

938
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:31,080
the strip. Just off the scene. That's fucking rad. I'll take a look at that.

939
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,800
Um, it's fun to go to a place that's cheap because if you're there on the

940
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:38,960
weekend, no table at like any hotel is going to be below 15, no less.

941
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:42,600
Potentially not even below 25. And you want a little bit more,

942
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:47,520
uh, craps is sort of like seems complicated at,

943
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:50,920
but you can play it in like the least complicated way.

944
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:54,560
You just bet that pass line and on the first role,

945
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:58,720
which is called the come out role. If the roller rolls a seven or 11,

946
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,640
you automatically win whatever you bet on the pass line. So the minimum,

947
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:07,440
usually, so it's 10 bucks, whatever. Uh, if they roll a two, three or 12,

948
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,960
that's called crapping out.

949
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,320
You lose whatever you bet on the pass line and all of the other numbers four,

950
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:17,640
five, six, eight, nine, 10 are called,

951
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:21,280
uh, then that point moves to that,

952
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:25,880
which means now the roller is rolling their dice until they hit that number

953
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,400
again and you win your pass line bet.

954
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:33,120
Now this is where seven becomes the bad number seven is.

955
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,440
And so there's some like lore around seven.

956
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,960
You don't say the number out loud at the table.

957
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:41,240
That's like one of the things you don't say seven, like they'll say, Ooh,

958
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,160
like the only the croupier or whatever stick man will go like seven craps,

959
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,680
but you never say like no seven or like, Oh, I hope he rolls a set.

960
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:53,680
Like just don't say it out loud because craps is one of the few games where if

961
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,680
everyone's betting the pass line,

962
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,760
you're all actually in it together and rooting from the same outcome. Oh, sure.

963
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:04,120
So like that's the appeal of the game that got me the first time is that when

964
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:08,480
someone rolls an 11 on the come out bet, which is called a yo, everybody wins.

965
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,920
And that's exciting to be at a table where everybody wins.

966
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,120
Even in blackjack, if the dealer busts,

967
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:16,960
you may have also busted or someone may have hit at the wrong time and fucked

968
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:20,120
your cards up. Craps just has that positive vibe.

969
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,360
And so the only basic skill I'll give you is once you're betting on the pass

970
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:28,640
line and once the point is set. So the point is at four, they put them,

971
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:32,040
they call it the button. The button is on four and you're waiting for the,

972
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:37,080
uh, the roller can roll anything but four or seven and it does not affect

973
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:37,920
your life.

974
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,120
Obviously there are people placing other bets, like maybe a heart and that,

975
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:46,320
you can just forget about that for your first time playing the best odds in the

976
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,960
casino are your backup bet,

977
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:53,360
which is the bet you put behind your pass line bet once the button is set.

978
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:58,160
So the, uh, pass line pays one to one. You put $10 out there.

979
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:02,480
They roll a seven or 11 on the come out bet. You get $10. You put $10 out there.

980
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,560
The buttons on the four, they roll a four again. Yay. Everyone wins.

981
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:09,280
They hit the button. You get $10 on that.

982
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:14,520
But if you can put $10 after the point is set behind your pass line bet,

983
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:19,560
that's called backing up your bet. That gets better than one to one odds.

984
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:24,800
Uh, and the odds vary between the four, five, six, eight, nine, and 10.

985
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:29,040
So like, uh, that's the, where you juice the odds. So then,

986
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:34,400
and you could put up to three, four or five X that bet that you have.

987
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,880
So you can have a $10 pass line bet. The button lands on a six.

988
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:42,720
You could put $50 in the backup and if they hit the six, you win your $10.

989
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:47,200
And then you win like 78 on the 50 or something rather than 50.

990
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,840
So that's like the bet you want to get to,

991
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:52,880
but that'll get you hanging out at the table.

992
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:56,560
And then that's how you really learn crabs. Okay.

993
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,760
It's just being at the table, being present,

994
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:02,840
slowly losing pass line bets and slowly and hopefully hitting some stuff.

995
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:07,720
And then you start to see, uh, on the hop bets, which are one time bets,

996
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:10,840
like I bet a yo on the hop, they're going to roll 11 on the hop, uh,

997
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:14,200
hard ways, which are doubles like 55, 33,

998
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:18,760
44 are eight the hard way, 10 the hard way, six the hard way combats,

999
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,040
which is like a secondary pass line. Once the button has been established,

1000
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,040
the field bets, which are,

1001
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,760
so that's an easy bet to make too because it just lists like these are the

1002
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,280
numbers. If they come up, you win. If two comes up, you win double.

1003
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:35,760
If 12 comes up, you win triple. But the famous craps expression is only farmers

1004
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,960
make money in the field. Like you don't bet on the field. Yeah.

1005
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,080
So there's so much shit going on and everyone plays differently.

1006
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:47,680
Usually there's like a six foot eight person of color who's betting on the

1007
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,480
don't pass line and is in a leather jacket no matter how.

1008
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:54,920
And it's just like straight up challenging the table to be like the don't pass

1009
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:58,560
line is I'm betting you all lose. And they're like,

1010
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:02,880
and they're usually just a person who's so intimidating in a way that no one says

1011
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,720
anything. And he's like, okay, whatever you say, tell me. Yeah.

1012
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:08,880
Yeah. Like it's always just a giant person. And it like, with like,

1013
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:12,240
like style that doesn't match the climate or something like that,

1014
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,480
where you're like, it's too hot to be dressed like that,

1015
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,080
but that makes you scarier or something like they're in like a leather duster or

1016
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:22,360
something and it's 110 degrees and you're like, fuck, so don't be that person.

1017
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,040
But that's the way you get at the crash table. And Jason,

1018
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,800
if you don't get to do it on this trip, the next time I go,

1019
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,520
I will line my trip up with you to,

1020
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,360
cause I've taught people craps before. It's like,

1021
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:38,360
I learned from a college roommates Jordanian father who like was like a crazy

1022
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,120
like all cash business guy.

1023
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:46,040
And like one of those dudes who I now recognize the type of like gotta lose some

1024
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:50,200
cash at the casino in order to not have the IRS in my house or whatever.

1025
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,440
So like it's fun. Like I learned from a dude like that. It was like, yeah,

1026
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:57,800
Gabris, I'm not going to do his voice. Whoops. Here, Gabris, here's like,

1027
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,720
here's a hundred dollars cash. And you're like a 21 year old college kid,

1028
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:04,080
you have a hundred dollars in AC and you're like, Oh my God. And he's like,

1029
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,880
bet this, bet this, bet this. And I like learned the game from him.

1030
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:11,360
And I brought, I brought that energy that that was 20 years ago that I learned

1031
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,400
that. And this was passed down. This was an oral history.

1032
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:20,160
And now I have my own like a combat strategy that I do that, uh,

1033
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,320
any one of my friends would say never works.

1034
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:28,520
Like, man, we were rolling good for awhile. How'd you do Gabris? I lost a lot.

1035
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,480
Why? I bet way too much.

1036
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,640
But you maintain you stick with it anyway. Yeah, I got it. Oh,

1037
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:40,040
you gotta win it back. Okay. That's what I see. This happened so bad.

1038
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:43,240
I wanna, well, I want to go to the sports book too,

1039
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:47,560
cause the Phillies are doing pretty good this season. Hell yeah. And so like,

1040
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:52,600
the other thing I learned this tip, um, because the ATMs in Vegas aren't safe,

1041
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,280
but if you go to the sports book and you put a few hundred dollars on your

1042
01:08:56,280 --> 01:09:00,920
account, you can slowly withdraw that money with no fees.

1043
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:04,560
So it's essentially a free ATM. Right.

1044
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,760
But you have to put your money in it.

1045
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:11,880
So you have to make sure you don't forget that you put like $300 in the sports

1046
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,920
book. You're in Barstow. Shit.

1047
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,200
That's always the case too.

1048
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:18,880
And you get home and you have like $150 in chips by accident or like,

1049
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:23,560
and you're like, I can't use these until I go back to one specific casino.

1050
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:27,640
The chips work, but the tickets, the paper tickets, you only have a few days.

1051
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,880
So you gotta make sure to cash those in. Oh, is that right? Yeah.

1052
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:36,720
There's insane numbers of like casinos make X amount of money every year just

1053
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,080
for unclaimed winning.

1054
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:41,160
Cause I always think about that with like the 40 cents tickets that people like

1055
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:44,520
who are losing $200 might just toss or might,

1056
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:48,840
I usually just walk by a lady like an old lady who's playing the penny slots and

1057
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:51,320
put my like dollar 63 in for her.

1058
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,360
It was like my go-to with that move.

1059
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,720
Cause I don't want to go to the fucking cashier and be like, and here,

1060
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,680
okay, $1 48 cents.

1061
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,760
And that's all you have left from your trip.

1062
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,080
This is sad is like pulling the empty pockets out and a little fly

1063
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:16,800
along other Vegas strategies I have to prevent myself from hitting that ATM.

1064
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:20,760
I do it once a night.

1065
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,040
I do it for a high amount if I have to,

1066
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:28,360
but my real plan is when I have a Vegas trip booked about two months

1067
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,200
out,

1068
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:34,640
I stopped using my credit card on groceries and start using my debit card on

1069
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:40,160
groceries and get cash back every time, every time I get like 60 bucks out of

1070
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:43,520
cash back. And then eventually by the time I'm ready to go to Vegas,

1071
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:48,520
I have like $480 cash that I don't fully miss because it just was from like,

1072
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:54,360
according to my brain, a lot of expensive trips to Gelson's or whatever.

1073
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,840
But I pay no fee on those in another city.

1074
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,400
So you're not thinking about that anymore.

1075
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,000
You don't pay fees on those withdrawals as well. And rather than take like one,

1076
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,960
when you look at your thing, you don't just see like minus 800.

1077
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,360
You just see like minus two 20 minus two 20 minus two 20,

1078
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,440
like 10 times or whatever.

1079
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,200
Because you can't do this on this trip.

1080
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:15,520
There's a million CVS and Walgreens and they all have cash back like $20,

1081
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,240
$30 limits for cash back.

1082
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,120
Right. Cause they know people will just go out there,

1083
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,160
buy a soda and be like, I have $700.

1084
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,760
It's a Walgreens and a bank vault in order to do what we want.

1085
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:32,200
Now do you just bet for teams? Do you just bet them winning or you bet like,

1086
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:36,200
I'll bet the win and Kyle Schwaber hits a home run. Yes.

1087
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:38,120
I'll do stupid parlays like that.

1088
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:41,120
Normally when it's sports, I don't really know about if other people,

1089
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:44,400
I'll be like, let me know what you're doing. And with my friend group,

1090
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,440
it's not like tacky. I'll be like, let me know what you're doing.

1091
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,480
And I'll just match whatever you're betting. You're putting $50 on this.

1092
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,760
Cause the fun thing to do, especially if you're there with a group is take,

1093
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,320
and you happen to be there. If it's football season,

1094
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:00,520
you don't want to fly home till Sunday night. Cause it is fun to be there.

1095
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:05,360
The games start at 10 AM, the games are over at 8 PM and you get to just bet on

1096
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,520
three different sets of games.

1097
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:11,440
And what we'll always do is some like 10 team parlay. That's like,

1098
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:16,640
everyone puts in $5 if we win, we all take 1400 or whatever, you know,

1099
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:20,560
but it's never happens, but that's like a jackpot sizzler. Yeah.

1100
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,560
You got to leave with that. That's cool. Yeah. The other,

1101
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,720
another game me and my friends play for bachelor parties was taught to us by

1102
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:30,560
Greg to Kolesk, who it's called Denny,

1103
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:35,600
Wilensky and the way Denny Wilensky works. And I recommend you guys play this,

1104
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,880
maybe even is if it's, you know,

1105
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:41,480
whoever's bachelor party it is or birthday party, whatever we,

1106
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:46,320
everyone wears suits. Everyone gives Denny Wilensky, whoever,

1107
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:49,120
or like for some time, if it's no occasion,

1108
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:54,080
put your names in a hat and whoever pulls like the Denny Wilensky card is Denny

1109
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,680
Wilensky. And that means everyone gives him a hundred dollars.

1110
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,320
They go up to the craft stable and bet on the pass line,

1111
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,280
whatever that amount is.

1112
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:07,760
So the last time we went with Greg to Glasgow was like $1,800.

1113
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,920
18 people gave him a hundred dollars.

1114
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:13,280
And the plan is the where the name Denny Wilensky comes.

1115
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:17,520
If you crap out and lose, everyone goes to Denny's in suits.

1116
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:18,840
If you win,

1117
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:23,240
you double that money and that goes towards the bill at Smith and Wilensky's.

1118
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:26,840
So like, so it's like you either,

1119
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:31,360
and you adjust those two restaurants as taste as needed for us.

1120
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:36,120
It's now in and out and like whatever the steak house is at our hotel.

1121
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:40,040
So we'll have like a standing rez for like 18 people at John George.

1122
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:44,960
And then like, it's actually really funny on to the one I did recently with

1123
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:48,320
Tuca Lesko was an $1,800, a $1,400 roll.

1124
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:52,680
He walked up crapped out on the first roll and we were like, all right,

1125
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:56,280
every we like, we're all partying in the room. We all went downstairs.

1126
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,440
He rolled it. We lost.

1127
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,680
We all just turn around and went to in and out together.

1128
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:06,160
Everyone's all dressed up and we just, and then that way you eat in and out.

1129
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:09,960
And then it's like $130 for your meal that night where, you know,

1130
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,920
and then if you end up going to John George, everyone,

1131
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:17,560
you get $2,800 knocked off the bill. So like, yes, your $100 is gone,

1132
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:20,800
but you got like a free hundred also towards you in a direction.

1133
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,760
Are you doing trash Vegas or are you down?

1134
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:28,600
And it's kind of fun to like, just like let, let chance pick that for you.

1135
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:32,000
Yeah. Yeah. So we, we have to give Jason a hundred bucks. Is that what we're,

1136
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,080
is that what we're saying? Yeah, but he has to chip it in too.

1137
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:34,960
So it ain't happening.

1138
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,000
This on my sports book card.

1139
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,760
We call ours, I hops subways.

1140
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:48,840
Yeah. And I, I see one. Yeah, it's international.

1141
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:53,440
I'm assuring you, I'm going to bet on the MLB all star game and it's going to be

1142
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,840
great. Let them know the game happened last night. Oh,

1143
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:01,120
I like to, if I go there in the off season,

1144
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:05,040
I bet on the giants to win the super bowl, which is like a varying sliding,

1145
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,560
you know, you put $10 and it's like, this ain't happening.

1146
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,520
$1,800 if this happens, you're like, great, I'll take that. Yeah.

1147
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,960
I'm definitely, I wonder if you're thinking the same thing, Mike.

1148
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:17,120
I think that we're trying to find like a Vegas activity we haven't done and

1149
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,280
that's a group activity. I,

1150
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:23,040
what I'd like to do now is watch Jason lose several thousand dollars and then

1151
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,520
see what happens to him.

1152
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:31,600
Does he melt into a dollar? Alex Mac.

1153
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:33,240
I watched the a hundred dollars.

1154
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:36,680
I watched the Apple employee tell him he needed to pay for a new iPhone and he

1155
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:37,680
almost fell over.

1156
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:41,280
It's funny that you say that because I was at the Apple store last night and I

1157
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:46,280
learned the current costs for replacing glass on an iPad is $249.

1158
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,520
So you may as well just buy a new iPad.

1159
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,760
And then I was looking at Apple watches and they're like,

1160
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,960
the one you were looking at the, the,

1161
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:59,280
that configuration is out of stock. So I busted it.

1162
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:03,000
I busted at the Apple store, two for two,

1163
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:07,960
put like 12 more of the iPads onto podcast, the ride, which is more important.

1164
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:09,360
Subscribe, subscribe, subscribe.

1165
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,400
For itself in the long run.

1166
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,360
The podcasters life hack. Yes.

1167
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:20,960
You joke, but I really like gambling and I could see developing a very serious

1168
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:21,800
gambling problem.

1169
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,800
What do I play? I play the little shop of horrors penny slant.

1170
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,360
What's the name of the plant? What's the,

1171
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:39,440
uh, Audrey?

1172
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:46,800
You need to make her bigger and bigger. I try.

1173
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,760
I almost got all Seymours.

1174
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:53,800
I was playing at Atlantic city once and I cashed out when I was like $20 up

1175
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:57,960
and walked away and then passed it like 20 minutes later and someone had won

1176
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:00,840
$1,200 on it. And I was like, oh,

1177
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,600
that's the shit that gets you not to leave.

1178
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:07,600
We other things I always do in Vegas is on my Sunday morning or my last morning.

1179
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,960
Uh, last, usually I just build it around a weekend church,

1180
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,880
but sometimes I'm there to say, I go to church, I go to Bieber's church.

1181
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:19,520
It's fucking great. Uh, no, I do, uh, like, uh,

1182
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:25,280
smoke a fat, something on my balcony, go buy a smoothie or a big iced coffee,

1183
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,480
something that's non party drink,

1184
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:32,040
and then sit at a video poker machine and play it like video games. Like,

1185
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:34,960
just super stone zoned out nice and slow,

1186
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,680
sip my whole coffee or green juice or smoothie apples. Uh,

1187
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:41,000
the Cosmo has like a fun little, uh,

1188
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:44,040
smoothie store that makes a, uh,

1189
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:47,280
coffee smoothie that has like espresso and peanut butter.

1190
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,960
And so you can feel kind of like healthy and coming back to life a little bit.

1191
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,000
So I'll hit the spa in the morning,

1192
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,160
then sit down super high and do that for like,

1193
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,560
and that's like the time where I'm trying to even get away from TIF. My wife,

1194
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,000
I'll be like, I'm going to go do it.

1195
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,160
Cause like I don't want someone sitting over my shoulder while I slowly play

1196
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:06,840
video poker high, like perhaps like TIF likes to be around craps.

1197
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:09,840
Cause there's free drinks and people and weirdos and stuff.

1198
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,480
But like when you're in the video poker section,

1199
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:15,520
it's just like cigarette smoke and fucking rascal scooters.

1200
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,200
I'm terrible at video poker.

1201
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:20,560
I want to learn how to play the video Kino on those machines.

1202
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:24,680
Oh, I never played video Kino, but that's, it's kind of like bingo. Yeah.

1203
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:28,200
I play a lot of quick draw at New York bars, you know,

1204
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:31,800
any New York bar that has like the lotto machine I'm always fucking with. Uh,

1205
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,400
another meta game I play,

1206
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:38,400
which I think you guys will enjoy is slot machine IPs like finding the wildest

1207
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:45,680
IPs is really like the like existing IPs in the world or their weird generic

1208
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:49,080
like golden lion. Yes. The, the, my favorite one is,

1209
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:52,280
there's one that's just like stoic Buffalo or something.

1210
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:56,400
And it's like just a big Buffalo. And I'm like, who's like, my game is that,

1211
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,520
you know? Yeah, I find that really funny.

1212
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,720
And then the actual IPs are really like real shit where you're like,

1213
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,760
there's a monopoly of star Wars. And then it just like,

1214
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,280
there's some weird vestigial ones where it's like,

1215
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:11,400
there's a petty co junctions slot machine. Yeah.

1216
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:16,240
I have my Las Vegas geo tag on my, my apple photos open. And I was like,

1217
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:19,920
I must've taken a photo of a weird one and I just found judge Judy. Yes.

1218
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,920
And it's like the funny, you would just imagine who,

1219
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:26,000
like how the IP licensing works for stuff like that.

1220
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,640
How much money is judge Judy making off the slot machine?

1221
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,160
How much is that part of judge Judy's vast stamp? I know judge Judy's like,

1222
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,680
it must have like $3 billion.

1223
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:38,560
How much of the 3 billion is from slots. Right. And then you also are like,

1224
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:43,000
you are also curious about like when an IP is on like a penny slot,

1225
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,720
like versus like a dollar, you're like, ah, and here's another, uh,

1226
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:49,800
Gaber's family tradition that my fam,

1227
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:52,080
my parents and me and my brothers always do.

1228
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:56,960
And then I pass that on to the people I go on vacate to Vegas with everyone

1229
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,920
puts $20 together and puts $20 each into a wheel of fortune machine.

1230
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,760
Cause we really like to wheel of fortune slot.

1231
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:07,640
Cause you get the spin that wheel that is only for $20, whatever.

1232
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,920
Anything that has like a mini game inside of it,

1233
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:14,000
where it takes you up to the top. Yeah. We got a new game up here.

1234
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:18,200
Exactly. Change of scenery. I'm looking at a wheel over there as well.

1235
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,640
Oh yeah. So for our show.

1236
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:23,520
Over there.

1237
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,160
I'm looking at a giant spaceship covered in a tarp that if you guys keep saying,

1238
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:33,160
he's going to maybe, don't worry about it. It's going to put us on the map.

1239
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:38,360
Uh, the, the slot machine IPs have gotten so fast. Like when the dude,

1240
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:43,360
the first part of the dune movie came out in theaters and on HBO max,

1241
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:49,040
uh, at the time I was in a casino and there were already doing slot machines

1242
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:52,000
like simultaneously released with the movie.

1243
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,520
Well it's just part of the release.

1244
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:58,200
Right now can be changed so you don't have to actually have a practical physical.

1245
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:03,640
Yeah. You're just like, upload the new IP. Like here's your IP USB stick.

1246
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:08,000
You can have the full new NBC fall lineup just represented immediately when they

1247
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:08,520
premiere.

1248
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:11,520
I've always heard the odds are worse on the IP machine.

1249
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,240
Like you want to find the shittiest looking slot machine.

1250
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:17,280
I think that's what they say. Like they don't need to pay out as well.

1251
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:22,440
Cause people will play it for the IP. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so when we play,

1252
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,400
when we pool our money for a slot,

1253
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:28,160
we come up with an arbitrary system of like we're going in height order,

1254
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:31,560
age order, weight order. And it's like always like a gimmick in the family.

1255
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:36,360
And if you hit for any amount, even if it's like, it's a 75 cents spin,

1256
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:40,800
but you won 50 cent, you get to spin again and whoever gets the, you know,

1257
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,520
and then the game becomes, if you're winning,

1258
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:48,640
you start to negotiate what the cutoff number is on the way down where you're

1259
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:52,400
like, Oh, we each put $20 in. So we have $80 in this machine. Shit.

1260
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,920
Now we're winning. We have $120. When do we cash out? It's like, well,

1261
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,160
not at 120 because then we're only going to take home $30 each. It's like,

1262
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:01,720
but then if you like don't hit and all you lose all your money,

1263
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:06,720
you really only lose $20 and adding four people taking their time and figuring

1264
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:10,440
out like different ways to spin the reels or three people or whoever else might

1265
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:13,720
be there. It like you're sharing in this moment,

1266
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:18,720
but it also slows the casino down to one fourth speed of money losing in a way

1267
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:24,360
that is like all split up. You're not all split up together losing at one fourth,

1268
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,800
the pace you could potentially lose by yourself. You'll hear,

1269
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:32,120
I guess maybe listeners can put this together at this point. So much,

1270
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:36,760
I consider any moment I'm not gambling to be money, money I'm earning.

1271
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,600
Like if I'm in the slot, like if I'm out to dinner, I'm like, yes,

1272
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,120
this dinner costs $300, but I could lose a thousand.

1273
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,640
700 bucks on this dinner.

1274
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:50,680
And once you're in that head space, you're fucking yourself.

1275
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,600
We need to shift into that's interesting. You know,

1276
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:57,760
and if you're doing a group poll, you know, everyone's chipping in a, you know,

1277
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,080
worst case scenario, Oh,

1278
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:02,840
you got to watch all those fun little snippets from Jurassic park. Exactly.

1279
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:06,520
Yeah. It cost me $20 and I got to watch like five of their little play outs,

1280
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:10,720
their little scenes and shit. Yeah. I'm looking at it. I'm also,

1281
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:16,360
in 2015 early vestige of the avatar fascination that there was an avatar

1282
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:21,520
machine and that's like the time, the way of winning the way of winning,

1283
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:26,240
the top thing in this, like a Papyrus laden machine, the,

1284
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:29,160
the top win is mighty win. Wow.

1285
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:34,320
Mike thinks he invented a phrase in, in avatar and thing. No, you're right.

1286
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,480
You do. You're right. You're right. I started calling the Akron,

1287
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:40,720
the mighty Akron years ago. It's not in the movie.

1288
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:44,120
That's not a phrase. Any of the avatar people say, if you Google mighty Akron,

1289
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:46,960
I come up there like the podcast, the ride.

1290
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:51,480
I've heard you scream this in someone's face at a bar before. Yes.

1291
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:55,760
Google mighty Akron. My name comes up. Yeah. That's what my,

1292
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,840
when I'm in a retirement home and I've lost my mind,

1293
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,720
the nurses will be hearing.

1294
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:04,560
You all know the phrase. Hey, look at me. Look at me. Where are you going?

1295
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:06,880
Look at the eye contact pal.

1296
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:10,800
I have like a laminated sheet of the Google results that I just like pull,

1297
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:11,880
like put on a table.

1298
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:16,760
Remember when there was Google SEO before everything was abolished.

1299
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:17,600
Yeah. Yeah.

1300
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,200
Avatar five is about to come out.

1301
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:22,000
Yes. Yeah.

1302
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:24,920
Is this a tip or do you want this back?

1303
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,600
He's got a backpack full of them. No, keep it.

1304
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:30,440
I need an autograph.

1305
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:34,320
There's something about, sorry, one real quick going to Vegas.

1306
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:39,360
There is something I do that I recommend other people do is just kind of shift

1307
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:44,320
your perspective on a lot of things up to and including the value of currency.

1308
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,720
It's almost like, and that's,

1309
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:51,480
it's difficult and arguably not financially smart, but arguably,

1310
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:56,680
but I'm talking about enjoyment. I'm not talking about retirement.

1311
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:57,760
Yeah. You got you.

1312
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:02,160
Everything costs a little more than you think it does. You guys are the,

1313
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:05,600
I keep saying you guys are theme park guys on your podcast.

1314
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,640
The ride that that's all I want to be recognized as is a theme park guy,

1315
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,760
the sexual being thing. I don't want any recognition that I'm glad you're right.

1316
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,040
You're recognizing me for what we should be celebrating.

1317
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,200
When you accept it yourself,

1318
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:20,080
our guy in sexual being is just Jason.

1319
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:25,640
Hey, well, we are the ones who made kids. So there's,

1320
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:30,160
true. We must have done it at some point.

1321
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:35,600
And must have done it just precludes you from being a sexual. Yeah.

1322
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,360
I don't know that you have when you say it like that.

1323
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:41,360
Congratulations. Of course.

1324
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:47,120
To the young PTR, the next PTR generation. Next generation of dorks. Yeah.

1325
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,400
PTR TNG.

1326
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:52,640
Okay. Question here.

1327
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:56,760
I like going to one big douchey pool party.

1328
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:58,200
How do you feel about this?

1329
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:02,040
They're not for me, but I,

1330
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:05,320
I've done them and I enjoyed myself there.

1331
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,320
It is one of those, like if you can get yourself a cabana,

1332
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:11,120
it feels like a little bit better.

1333
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:15,600
And every one of them now kind of has like, yes,

1334
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:19,680
pool party, like official pool parties or pool party energy,

1335
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:22,240
just at the pool, which is kind of fun.

1336
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:26,000
So like you don't have to go fully to go to rehab at hard rock.

1337
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,600
There's levels of douche. Right.

1338
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:32,360
You just go to this adults only pool and you know what that means. And it's like,

1339
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,720
there's going to be some wild people getting fucked up there,

1340
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:38,560
but there also might be like five people reading, laying out, you know,

1341
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,600
I forget which hotel I went to recently,

1342
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:43,560
but had a wave pool with a giant TV in the back.

1343
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:48,280
And then it was at someone else's bachelor party and they had

1344
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:52,040
outdoor craps table. And when I went to the hard rock, I played,

1345
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:55,280
uh, blackjack in the pool, which was awesome.

1346
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:58,160
Oh, that sounds good. And then you have the pool for like 12 hours.

1347
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,480
Everyone, no one's getting out to go to the bathroom when you've had like a

1348
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,880
hundred. Hey, what's happening at this table here?

1349
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:06,000
It just all pissing in the circle. All right.

1350
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:10,320
There's the encore beach club that has the giant sports screens.

1351
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:14,320
I'm thinking that's what you've got. Yeah. And Circa downtown. Yeah.

1352
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:18,320
That's the newer one. That's like the nice hotel next to Fremont street.

1353
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,600
And it's like, well, what's the point?

1354
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,880
There's a night and you guys can talk them on yourselves.

1355
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:24,720
I found an app where I put myself with five other guests.

1356
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,920
You have so many pages of apps.

1357
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,120
I have never seen. What's this one?

1358
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:34,240
Disco tech is the app and you can put yourself on the list for a many,

1359
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:38,400
many different Vegas, like parties or nightclubs or pool parties.

1360
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:42,280
And I have signed up for many already for this weekend.

1361
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,560
Where are you going? What's on your?

1362
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:44,600
I don't know what I'm doing.

1363
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:49,000
You guys are all going together. See you guys. I gotta go to the pool party.

1364
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,680
I only put myself on the list.

1365
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:55,120
I'm assuming I've never made it seem like I want to go to one of these pool.

1366
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:58,400
I'm not saying you have to go. I'm just saying I definitely put myself plus five

1367
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:01,160
guests with me. So if we want to go, we can't.

1368
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,920
This might be the thing is to join you at one of your.

1369
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:12,160
Pool Saturday, a Zillow Ultra Pool Sunday, Nico X way at wet republic,

1370
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:17,040
DJ dynamic at the Drays Beach Club. Any of these are possible.

1371
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:19,720
The thing I'm kind of excited about is Sunday night,

1372
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:24,280
DJ Spider drenched after dark, starting at 1030,

1373
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,720
a nighttime douchey pool party.

1374
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,920
Oh, this is what I'm interested in. That one.

1375
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:31,120
This is at Marquis Nightclub.

1376
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:34,560
I don't know. Like survive a night pool party like a day pool party.

1377
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,880
You will be. Yes, that's true, too.

1378
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,320
It'll be a nice 95 degrees at night.

1379
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:41,080
It'll be a balmy.

1380
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:45,240
The pool day parties have changed the vibe of Vegas in a really fun way.

1381
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:48,640
If you go to the casinos at like three or four p.m.,

1382
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:53,640
there are tons of women cross eyed in bikinis

1383
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:57,520
staggering in from out like that.

1384
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:02,320
And like and guys absolutely piss wasted with no shirts on.

1385
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:05,480
And it's like they are, you know, one a.m.

1386
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:08,200
drunk, right? You've had dinner. Yes.

1387
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,040
And they're dressed for the pool.

1388
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:14,400
So it's like if you are a standard horny American, it's it's quite

1389
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:18,040
if you are sexual, which Jason and I are a standard horny American.

1390
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:20,600
That's got welcome to the S.H.A. boys.

1391
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:24,960
Oh, man, I guess I'm getting FOMO now.

1392
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:30,200
I think you guys are stumbled upon, which is also another fun thing about Vegas,

1393
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,080
because it does have something for everyone.

1394
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:36,800
Yeah, it sounds like you guys need to go to a pool party for Mike.

1395
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:41,240
You guys need to gamble or go in on a sports bet with Jason

1396
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:43,880
and then scris you need your own.

1397
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:45,560
Like and I got to pick one.

1398
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:48,360
Yeah. Yeah. And off strip activities always fun.

1399
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:52,120
Like, yes, I know the bangerang people did this.

1400
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:53,600
I never did it, but it was a lot of fun.

1401
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:57,640
There's like the huge sandbox where you get to like play with excavators

1402
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:58,760
and bulldozers and stuff.

1403
01:29:58,760 --> 01:29:59,920
Oh, right. Right.

1404
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:01,760
Construction pit. And that's all I've heard about.

1405
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:04,040
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, what do I?

1406
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:04,800
Oh, my God.

1407
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,560
And I believe they're building like a Formula One racetrack.

1408
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,120
Oh, yeah. That's happening in the fall.

1409
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,560
Yeah. Oh, it's total sense.

1410
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,040
Like as the fifth city to get one or whatever.

1411
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:17,800
They're building a headquarters and then there is a race on the strip.

1412
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,560
Like they're building bleachers in front of the Bellagio.

1413
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:26,000
That's I used to have in like I think Caesar's had a racetrack.

1414
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,720
So this is going back to decades ago. Yeah.

1415
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:32,000
I did the Vegas half marathon where you run the street.

1416
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,240
Wow. Oh, wow.

1417
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:35,360
With friend of the show, Nick Weigert.

1418
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:38,040
We and it was amazing.

1419
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:42,880
Like the one way to get me to run 13 miles is like they close the strip down.

1420
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,360
You run down the street at night.

1421
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:46,480
And I was like, fuck, it was brutal.

1422
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,480
And it got really cold by the end.

1423
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:52,480
And there's one leg where you go off strip just because like you can't do 13 miles

1424
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:53,320
just on the strip.

1425
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:57,080
And when you go off the strip, the entire tone of the city changes.

1426
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,560
You're like, this is creepy. Let's get back on the strip.

1427
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:00,920
Let's get back on the strip.

1428
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:06,720
But I like eight edibles at mile 10 and like the last the last three miles,

1429
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:10,480
I'm just like running under neon lights, like super slow.

1430
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,720
It was such a fucking rad experience.

1431
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:13,800
Wow. Yeah.

1432
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,200
Well, I don't know what mine is.

1433
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:18,960
I mean, I was wondering if it'd be fun to go to Palace Station

1434
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:24,680
and walk in the footsteps of O.J. and his band of memorabilia robbers.

1435
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:29,120
Sure. We could take the the O.J. robbery.

1436
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:32,320
There's an aquarium at Mandalay Bay, I believe.

1437
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,680
Yeah. Yeah.

1438
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:37,120
Like, I mean, the orb or like the big ferris wheel.

1439
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:38,480
Those are like potential.

1440
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,520
High roller. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1441
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:42,160
Station casinos are interesting.

1442
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:44,800
Run by Tillman for Tita's cousins.

1443
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:47,760
Wow. Wow. From the Texas.

1444
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:49,680
You're one of the Texas gang.

1445
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:53,440
And if you tell them you're there's a panel coming for their ass.

1446
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:59,520
This is the owner of the Rainforest Cafe and Landry's restaurants.

1447
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:00,880
I recognize the name.

1448
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:03,080
You read Tillman for Tita's book.

1449
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:04,560
What is this book called again?

1450
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,440
Is it like like shut the fuck up and do it?

1451
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:10,520
It's something really severe and not friendly.

1452
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,840
His uncles were all Texas gangsters.

1453
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:16,320
So when he bought the Raptors, everyone was like, the NBA is letting this guy

1454
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:17,600
buy a jean.

1455
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,840
Mine could be pepper mill, too.

1456
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:22,720
I like that peppermint.

1457
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,600
Oh, yeah. You've done it before.

1458
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:25,520
Right. Pepper mill.

1459
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:29,080
Pepper mill is this diner that has a bar also.

1460
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:30,280
Oh, I have done. Yeah.

1461
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:35,360
It's the very it is like early 80s neon pink and purple aesthetic.

1462
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:38,880
I did do that on a travel show for Esquire with Adam Pally.

1463
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:41,360
Not the one recent one we did, one we did way back in the day.

1464
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:45,440
Me, him, Gemberling and Doug Mand and a few other people ate at it for.

1465
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:49,600
Oh, sure. Remember the getaway when they were doing like a celebrity

1466
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,280
one off travel show episodes was on the Esquire network.

1467
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:58,200
Like Jack McBrayer went to Hawaii and like Eve went to Jamaica and stuff like that.

1468
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:01,480
And Pally took five of his dumb friends to Vegas.

1469
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:02,720
Oh, that's cool.

1470
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:04,320
What was the highlight of that?

1471
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:07,520
What was the highlight of that?

1472
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:11,000
We had. Oh, we stayed at the

1473
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:15,440
Rain Man Suite with the in Caesars with the two stairs.

1474
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:18,600
Wow. I don't know about this in the movie Rain Man.

1475
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:21,440
They come down the sweet stairs in like suits.

1476
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:25,840
It's got it's this huge two floor suite where they're like the living.

1477
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:31,160
Like the living room is like 18 feet of windows and like and we stayed in that

1478
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:33,360
and had and this is the dumbest highlight.

1479
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:36,600
We had like a top shelf brunch room service,

1480
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:40,800
like lobster tail cocktail, Bloody Mary bar like and they filmed it at all.

1481
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:45,240
But for us, it was just like got super baked and just ate like this insane

1482
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:48,160
morning feast. And I was like, this is the best part of Vegas.

1483
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,520
It's like the moment we didn't leave the hotel.

1484
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,480
Oh, we we tried to do that

1485
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:58,360
indoor skydiving thing where you're like, and oh, yeah,

1486
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,520
they were like, how much do you weigh?

1487
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:01,800
I was like this much.

1488
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:03,560
And I was like 40 pounds lighter than I am now.

1489
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,360
They were like, you will.

1490
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:08,120
You can try, but you probably just be laying on the ground with the fan

1491
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:09,720
blowing on you.

1492
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:11,800
I was like, I'll pass.

1493
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:13,880
You want to know what it's like to have a lot of wind in your face?

1494
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:14,480
Great.

1495
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:17,160
Interesting. Well, this is a good idea.

1496
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:19,080
A little like curated experience.

1497
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:21,160
Yeah. I mean, I think harder on mine.

1498
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:24,440
I had an awesome Chinese food restaurant that Weiger recommended

1499
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:26,240
that was off strip, like in a strip mall.

1500
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:28,360
And the food was bananas good.

1501
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:30,360
And it was bring your own beer, which was kind of fun, too.

1502
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:31,600
Oh, that's funny. Yeah.

1503
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:32,360
Oh, really?

1504
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,000
But yeah, pepper mills, a good time to.

1505
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,400
Yeah, I do like it there.

1506
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:40,560
That's a drink like a fucking kitchen sink full of like alcohol and sherbert.

1507
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:41,720
They're like some huge.

1508
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:42,480
Yeah.

1509
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:44,680
Those big old flaming goblets.

1510
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:48,200
Yeah, because the thing they're known for is the cocktail menu is like

1511
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:50,840
the bartender's handbook, like they have every cocktail.

1512
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:52,200
Right. Yes. That's what it was.

1513
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:53,120
You can get almost any.

1514
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:57,040
And we got some big, dumb, like, you know, lobster, thermidor, the cocktail.

1515
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:58,800
Yeah. Yeah.

1516
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,360
To Brandi Alexander's for the table.

1517
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:02,840
You know. Yeah.

1518
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:05,960
Well, I think we got, you know, they that might be the way to do it.

1519
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:10,280
Everybody we hope we pool our interests and then pull and also pull our money

1520
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:14,360
in a little shop of horrors slot machine we put we each put one hundred dollars.

1521
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:16,080
I got one hundred dollars in free play.

1522
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,360
So I'm starting off like winning.

1523
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:19,560
So, oh, shit.

1524
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:20,480
There we go.

1525
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:23,680
Thanks to Vegas games, we play on our phones.

1526
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:28,680
All you had to do was play a game at all times obsessively.

1527
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:30,920
And it is the worst pop ups.

1528
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:34,640
Like it tries to get you to spend money on it so much.

1529
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:39,000
And I wish Diablo for our Dave the diver gave me fucking cause

1530
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,600
of points because I just spent like the last 80 hours of my life

1531
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:44,560
on those between those two games.

1532
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:46,080
You need to use a lot of points.

1533
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,360
This is the app he's talking about. My Vegas slots.

1534
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:51,120
You need to use a lot of points to get a hundred dollars of free play.

1535
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:54,440
Yeah, I got like two hundred and thousands of points.

1536
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:56,400
Well, I have like two million points.

1537
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,560
Oh, my God. This guy's beating me by like a million and a half.

1538
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:04,200
We all are wild away the hours during lockdown in our own ways.

1539
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:07,480
OK, sure. Some of us mastered slots.

1540
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:09,280
Yes, some of us are in craps.

1541
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:11,880
So I spent 10,000 hours playing the slots.

1542
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:16,560
Some of us figured out how to X through fastest, like spend money, spend money.

1543
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:18,240
No, no, I'm doing it for free.

1544
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:22,680
In the pandemic, I downloaded a craps app that I was not that much fun to play.

1545
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:25,800
But the highlight was when you wanted to roll the dice, you shook the whole phone

1546
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:27,160
like that. Oh, that is fine.

1547
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:29,720
And then you like did that and stopped it and the dice would roll.

1548
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,320
That is that mechanic was fun.

1549
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:34,720
I like the the thing that stuck around since early

1550
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:38,640
iPhones where like you shake to undo like that still works.

1551
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:40,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1552
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:45,200
Well, maybe we all got to get on this app master Jason's ability to X pop up ads

1553
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,360
and build up enough capital.

1554
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,360
There's like five of them. OK, OK.

1555
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:50,880
Black. There's a few slots.

1556
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:53,480
There's blackjack. There's bingo.

1557
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:56,120
Yeah. But the true game is getting rid of the pop ups.

1558
01:36:56,120 --> 01:37:00,080
You can keep the pop up and you've got to be shit again.

1559
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:00,880
Another one. Another one.

1560
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:05,200
And the dangers you have to be very careful because it will try to use Apple

1561
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:07,480
Pay to buy chips. Oh, fuck.

1562
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:09,000
Yeah. So I can get into this, right?

1563
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,760
I can jump into your Apple Pay.

1564
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:13,080
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

1565
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:15,640
It's like that freemium shit like, I hope you're enjoying yourself.

1566
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:17,760
Whoops, you actually paid eight dollars, but don't worry.

1567
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,320
Now your machine glows.

1568
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:22,880
And yeah, we don't like that freemium stuff anyway.

1569
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:24,520
Please support our Patreon.

1570
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:26,760
Please support Action Boys Patreon.

1571
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:30,840
And on that note, I guess, let's say, hey, let's head to the plot of the

1572
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:32,560
the the plugging point.

1573
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:35,160
John Gaber, you survived podcast, the right Sin City Nights.

1574
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:39,880
Oh, man. So much for joining for the guidance and for a big pile of ideas.

1575
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,280
Thank you so much for having me.

1576
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:45,520
Any chance I can to talk about Vegas when it's sanctioned, especially like

1577
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:47,840
I'll just ruin parties with this conversation.

1578
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:50,360
So it's nice to just come here and ruin a podcast, you know,

1579
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:54,560
simulated party with thousands of disparate people out there.

1580
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:58,280
I appreciate you, Kevin McAllister, and all these dancing cardboard

1581
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,920
cutouts all time to make it feel like I'm at a party.

1582
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,760
And everyone's so enthused regaling us with the day.

1583
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:08,480
Tell us more about the Islanders game, Gabris.

1584
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:12,440
Thanks for bringing the crystal head vodka.

1585
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:15,560
Do you have any stories about what it is?

1586
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,720
I my my plugs are check out High and Mighty.

1587
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:21,440
These guys have been on.

1588
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:26,760
So if if you're a diehard PTR fan, maybe start there or listen to Action Boys.

1589
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:30,280
We are a Patreon only podcast, but we do have some free episodes

1590
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:32,120
that you could find in the iOS app.

1591
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:35,320
But otherwise, it's Action Boys dot biz with Z's

1592
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:38,040
and one hundred one places to party before you die.

1593
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:41,240
Eight episodes on HBO Max Max rather.

1594
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:44,720
And maybe who knows by the time this comes out, maybe the app doesn't exist.

1595
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,520
So for tax refunds or whatever.

1596
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:48,960
Yeah, yeah.

1597
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:53,200
This is like every every day now is awaiting the death sentence.

1598
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:54,640
So if you're of the show, you may.

1599
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:56,840
I think you survived by putting it out.

1600
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:59,640
What that was like. That's a twenty twenty two that came out.

1601
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:02,440
And has zero residuals because it's all non union.

1602
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:04,000
Unscripted.

1603
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,640
So you're not complaining about loss of residuals because there weren't any to begin with.

1604
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:11,120
Yeah, I'm not complaining by the I did lose health insurance

1605
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:14,160
during my most successful career career.

1606
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,920
I love it because it's a TV show.

1607
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:19,960
It's sure far away to lose health insurance because I had to spend

1608
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:21,720
so much time traveling, making money.

1609
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:23,920
I was unable to make SAG money.

1610
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:26,240
Oh, my God. It's so complicated.

1611
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:28,920
And that's the most interesting part of the SAG health insurance.

1612
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:32,320
When it starts, you're immediately watching the clock of like, OK,

1613
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:34,960
so this is out in one year.

1614
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:38,080
I'm out of now. I'm like, I'm seeing doctors.

1615
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:41,640
I'm back on after spending, you know, two G's a month on Cobra.

1616
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,560
And now I'm back on SAG health insurance.

1617
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:48,920
But for a year and I'm hoping maybe with this strike that's currently happening,

1618
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:50,560
we get a little grace period.

1619
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,440
Oh, that would be great.

1620
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:55,120
So, right. Oh, my God.

1621
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:59,720
So everyone in all the industries don't work for many, many months.

1622
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:01,320
Did you make your minimums?

1623
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:04,560
I hope you made them in the couple of weeks before they took away

1624
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,160
the cheap entry level plan.

1625
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:07,560
So I had to make more.

1626
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:10,080
And also, there's no residuals anymore either.

1627
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:13,440
Like that used to be a way to like, yeah, if you got two good jobs

1628
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:16,480
and enough residuals from last year's two good jobs,

1629
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:19,240
you could maybe make health insurance again.

1630
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:20,240
But now that's gone.

1631
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:23,480
This is you'll hear us if the strike is still going in three months

1632
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:25,720
and we went to Vegas and like, let's have some fun.

1633
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:26,880
Let's do some crap since then.

1634
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,640
Oh, shit, we all lost twelve thousand dollars.

1635
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:34,000
Hey, we are starting a we're starting a twelve thousand dollar tier.

1636
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,360
There's a twenty dollar here.

1637
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:38,920
We show up at your house to one episode in your living room with you.

1638
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:42,640
You you're not allowed to talk away from your face.

1639
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:46,440
You'll have an unplugged microphone to pretend you're playing like a cousin

1640
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:49,600
playing video games with the boys.

1641
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:51,120
Don't make eye contact with Mike.

1642
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:53,200
He really gets wild if you do that.

1643
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:54,720
Really starts to act out.

1644
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:57,600
You'll turn into Slam Carlson and you do not want that.

1645
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,040
Yeah, he's slam.

1646
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:01,640
He's more violent than the regular Mike.

1647
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:03,720
He's more dangerous

1648
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:07,600
because of the sure he's more likely to start playing slam ball in your living room.

1649
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:08,640
That's right.

1650
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:12,480
Hey, for us, keep up with the PTR Sin City Nights
