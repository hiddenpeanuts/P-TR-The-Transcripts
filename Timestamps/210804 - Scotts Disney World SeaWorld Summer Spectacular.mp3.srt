1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,580
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate,

3
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,920
a show we haven't recorded in a while

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,140
because one of the hosts lost their voice

5
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,540
from partying too hard in Orlando, Florida.

6
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,340
I'm Scott Gardner, I'm That Guy,

7
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,580
and I'm joined by Mike Carlson, hi.

8
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,340
Wow, that's another nickname for you on the show, That Guy.

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,100
Yeah, I guess you could say I'm That Guy.

10
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,260
I guess you could say, yeah, so you, man,

11
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,780
you have the most, you might have more nicknames

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,700
and alias than even Jason or I.

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,600
I mean, if you count me turning into Chukko the Clown

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,440
as in those times where I can't tell you much about them

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,640
but where I sort of zone out and am inhabited by a clown,

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,800
seems like that happens.

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,600
You're an edge lord, you're that guy.

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,760
And I'm That Guy.

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,920
Yeah, yeah, he's willing to party so hard

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,640
he loses his voice even though he's a podcaster.

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,560
I guess he's That Guy.

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,560
That's how brazen That Guy is.

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,100
Hi, Jason Sheridan, hi.

24
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,720
Yeah, Scott, you're kind of like,

25
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,160
he's either gonna be referenced on an upcoming episode

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,600
or is about to be, or was just referenced on an episode.

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,960
You're kind of like wrestling legend Mick Foley

28
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,400
who had like multiple different personas,

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,240
multiple different alias.

30
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,880
Yeah, the three faces, they call him the three faces of Foley.

31
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,960
It was Mankind, Dood, Love and Cactus Jack.

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,960
And they were all different.

33
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,120
So yeah, you have a similar thing going here now.

34
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,240
Mine is Edgelord, That Guy and Chukko.

35
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,080
Yeah.

36
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,360
That guy, I mean, That Guy,

37
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,280
you really should start doing YouTube.

38
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,720
You've talked about YouTube face,

39
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,000
like whatever, YouTube thumbnail face before.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,380
And That Guy definitely has the best YouTube thumbnail face.

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,320
For sure. I mean, I'm good at that.

42
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,480
I'm good at stretching out the whites of the eyes

43
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,040
to where they take up, to where you can barely

44
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,240
see the pupils.

45
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,080
Yeah, so I love it.

46
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,600
I'll keep stretching and then that's, yeah, yeah.

47
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,440
Yeah, That Guy on theme parks, I guess,

48
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,080
or really whatever I want.

49
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,080
Vape pens.

50
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,400
Vape, yeah.

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,040
Not doing masks anymore.

52
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,560
Carl Wilson's coat, is it Carl Wilson's coat?

53
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,480
Oh yeah, that's right.

54
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,720
Oh no, I could do multiple videos

55
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,440
about Carl Wilson's cool green jacket, yeah.

56
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,320
I was just thinking about that and I was thinking,

57
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,640
I wonder if he's gonna actually get the jacket

58
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,520
because I really want you to.

59
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,760
I mean, if I knew a place that had a jacket like that,

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,360
I guess if I could find the source

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,960
or if I went into a vintage store

62
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,720
that had something of that nature,

63
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,160
I wouldn't say no.

64
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,320
I just don't know where to begin.

65
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,160
I think I'll look for it.

66
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,360
There's no store that specifically markets itself

67
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,400
as beach boy fashion.

68
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,120
I mean, in terms of, I guess if I wanted to dress

69
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,000
like Mike Love and wear like bright orange caps,

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,640
I would have to shop at, I don't know, truck stops.

71
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,720
I guess that mystery.

72
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,680
Yeah, that's easier to find than the mythical jacket,

73
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,720
but we'll find the jacket.

74
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,160
I think a listener will find the jacket

75
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,120
or I will find the jacket, we'll Google, we'll figure it out.

76
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,840
Let me know, you gotta find the video.

77
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,880
He was wearing it in like the early eighties.

78
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,720
Okay.

79
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,560
No one's looking this up, who would do this?

80
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,560
There's a few people.

81
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,880
In the meantime, you can focus on doing videos

82
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,360
about streaming remakes, ruining childhoods.

83
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,080
That seems to be an evergreen goldmine.

84
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,640
That seems to be.

85
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,760
Well, that, I mean, I don't want,

86
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,400
look, we got a lot to cover on this episode,

87
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
but yes, I think I have been following

88
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,160
since we did He-Man episode.

89
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,000
I have been following the discourse

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,120
and some people are unhinged.

91
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,120
Some people really.

92
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,960
Yeah.

93
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,440
Wait a minute, we talked about all that

94
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,560
and then you chose to pursue more of it?

95
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,160
You dove into the pool?

96
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,240
It was a trending topic and I was like,

97
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,280
oh, let's see what people are saying about He-Man.

98
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,200
And I was like, oh, okay, oh, cool.

99
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,000
January 6th rhetoric, awesome, very cool.

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,600
What is funny about this is I hope,

101
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,840
there's a person I follow,

102
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,320
I followed on Twitter for a long time

103
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
and it's just a very casual acquaintance

104
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,600
that was very riled up about it.

105
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,000
So he was the primary source.

106
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,400
It was just popping up into my feed

107
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,520
because he was posting so much

108
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,640
about being mad about He-Man.

109
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,280
And I was like, oh, this guy I haven't talked to

110
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,600
in a decade, he's really upset that like

111
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,640
the character Tila isn't making him as horny anymore.

112
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,000
That's what I could just like figure out from his tweets

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,440
that he's mad about like Tila has shorter hair now

114
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,640
and he likes Tila with longer hair.

115
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,720
So he was tweeting up a storm

116
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,920
and yeah, I didn't even choose to do it.

117
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,240
But then once I saw it, I was following it very closely.

118
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,520
I guess if your childhood is so like thinly on the cusp

119
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,280
of being ruined at all times,

120
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,760
then maybe it wasn't that good of a childhood.

121
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,600
Nope, shut up.

122
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,560
No, no, don't say that.

123
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,080
Shut the hell up.

124
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,760
That's one haircut away.

125
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,600
If there's a new turtles

126
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,280
and they don't write the leatherhead character correctly,

127
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,720
I will be very upset and it will wreck my year.

128
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,720
If April is not the right measurements,

129
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,640
if April does not have the same hip size

130
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,880
that she did when I was young, I am very upset.

131
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,360
That's not how you feel about the show.

132
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,960
It's how you feel about the toys.

133
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,880
Well, that's true.

134
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,800
The toys actually do have to be cartoon accurate.

135
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,560
They just have to be, it's more about accuracy.

136
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,520
It's not about like putting her in any kind of box

137
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,520
or putting any of the characters in that kind of box.

138
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,720
The toys I'll throw a fucking fit.

139
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,800
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

140
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,880
If they don't look right,

141
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,400
they don't look like I, when I-

142
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,840
It would be justified.

143
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,320
Look, I'm very, I missed a lot of discourse

144
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,800
and I'm very happy that I did because I got out of here.

145
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,920
I busted out of this joint.

146
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,200
I went on not just one, but two great vacations.

147
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Some of the best trips that I've had in recent memory.

148
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,680
And I'm gonna do a little trip report here

149
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,120
about both of them because both of them

150
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,600
are theme park oriented,

151
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,600
which means that both of them are tax write-offs.

152
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,560
And I have to fulfill that end of the bargain

153
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,640
by doing my report here.

154
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,920
And all I can point in any audit case to this episode.

155
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,760
So thank you audience and Michael Jason

156
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,480
for letting me provide this evidence.

157
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,320
Of course, yes.

158
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,160
Everything, and now that we just talked a little bit

159
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,040
about toys, I'm writing those off too.

160
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,080
You're fine.

161
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,440
Jason, I don't, I mean, you know,

162
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,360
we did talk about that actor's cup that you got.

163
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,320
So that's the main way.

164
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,880
This has been tax advantageous to you.

165
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,200
And we talk about ham all.

166
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,160
What was that, what was he again?

167
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,040
Oh, we talk, yeah, what's the actor, Jason?

168
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,880
We talk about ham. What's that?

169
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,760
I was gonna say, we talk about ham all the time too,

170
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,840
so you can write off all your ham purchases,

171
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,720
which is nice.

172
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,960
Oh, sure.

173
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,840
Yeah. Joseph Cotton, the great Joseph Cotton

174
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,800
from the third man in Citizen Kane, Shadow of a Doubt.

175
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,720
Yes. Right, right.

176
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,960
I bought an old ashtray of his at an estate sale.

177
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,800
Yeah.

178
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,360
So when he future Joseph Cotton related purchases

179
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,800
are justified and maybe in this Carl Wilson jacket.

180
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,360
Anyway, point is two great trips.

181
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,240
I'm riding high.

182
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,040
I'm feeling so great from these things

183
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,240
after so many months of pandemic and work and parenthood.

184
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,920
It was great.

185
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,480
One of them, the first one of which was a family trip.

186
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,400
And in fact, the first family trip

187
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,000
since we have had our son, this is his very first vacation

188
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,880
and therefore his very first theme park.

189
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,200
That's kind of big actually.

190
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,640
I may be burying the lead.

191
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,000
And all the times since I had this kid,

192
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,920
I can now say he's been on a theme park, been on a ride.

193
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,720
What did I do? Where did I take it?

194
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,160
This is a momentous thing.

195
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,120
This is a big stat for me.

196
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,840
That guy, that theme park guy.

197
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,280
Where did I take my son for the first time?

198
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,600
Was it Disney? Was it Universal?

199
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,440
It ended up being Sea World San Diego, a dark horse,

200
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,880
a black fish coming out of nowhere.

201
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,240
Wow. I thought I was going to make the first black fish reference,

202
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,040
but I guess it's fitting the one who went should make it.

203
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,080
We were both like shaking, just like, who's going to get there?

204
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,280
Where is he going to get me?

205
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,560
No, well, you got to get it out of the way.

206
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,680
And, you know, is that why I was there to watch captive animals?

207
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,440
Of course, I wanted to teach my son that animals are to be trapped.

208
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,280
And we are superior to them.

209
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,760
And he needed to know that.

210
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,560
Yes. Yeah.

211
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,760
So I turned him throughout the day and say, son, we are superior to the beasts.

212
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,880
And I think I think the lesson made it through.

213
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,400
He died. I sensed a nod.

214
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,840
I sensed he knew what I was saying.

215
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,000
He was he like started killing a lot of more like bugs when you got home.

216
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,040
He was like stomping on ants.

217
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,720
And God, you're right. You know what?

218
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,160
Yes. And I've sent you all those videos of it.

219
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,040
And I'm only now putting it together that it's because my lesson got through.

220
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,480
You sent us 12 videos of him killing insects, pulling the wings off of flies.

221
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,040
Figure out the magnifying glass thing.

222
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,400
If you could stop sending those, that'd be awesome.

223
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,880
I like to stop when he stops, when he's done, he'll tell me.

224
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,320
OK, you can keep sending me. I'll see a few more.

225
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,040
OK, Michael, stay on. OK, I'll remove Jason from the chain.

226
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,400
Anyway, no. Why?

227
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,600
Why San Diego? Why? Why SeaWorld?

228
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,640
The answer is one word. The word is Elmo.

229
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,720
I don't know if I've really said this on the show,

230
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,760
and I think a lot of other parents would reciprocate this.

231
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,960
Elmo has a really magical hold over small children.

232
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,720
I think maybe we're all tempted.

233
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,400
We might all be of the generation where we would say like, Elmo, I mean,

234
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,280
that's isn't that a little a little broad, a little lowest common denominator?

235
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,200
I mean, Grover was much more clever with his waiter sketches.

236
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,000
And I guess it's still how I feel with my own taste.

237
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,160
But like watching the way Elmo leaps off the screen

238
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,320
and just plants himself in a child's brain, it's eerie.

239
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,080
It's like setting off a signal that turns someone into an assassin.

240
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,480
It's the other world.

241
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,600
Yeah, yes. Elmo Manchurian candidates, children so far.

242
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Not like not for anything bad, I don't think, but he could.

243
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,120
If they like they could like switch the mission at some point

244
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,560
and then all toddlers would rise up.

245
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,480
And it was immediate like you were when you showed him like Sesame Street

246
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,120
for the first time, was it truly like all the other characters?

247
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,000
Like he could have taken her left like he didn't care.

248
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,840
And then Elmo showed up and he was like, holy crap.

249
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,240
Like, do you remember that kind of moment or was it just sort of slowly?

250
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,920
All of a sudden you were like the character he's responding to is Elmo.

251
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,760
I think that it may have all come out of Elmo's world

252
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,680
and Elmo's world compilations on YouTube, where Elmo is mostly.

253
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,920
Well, there was a toy.

254
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,560
He really liked a toy and then Elmo's world.

255
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,800
We were watching a lot of where he's pretty much solo,

256
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,840
except for his smartphone friend Smarty.

257
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,920
And then is it he does have.

258
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,040
Yes, I can break that news to you.

259
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,440
I don't I'm not aware of Smarty.

260
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,760
No, Smarty's around and Smarty will like kind of bop around in the air

261
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,840
and change aspect ratio much like Quibi.

262
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,920
Smarty invented the Quibi technology.

263
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,600
It's all fine, except for Mr. Noodle.

264
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Anybody know Mr. Noodle offhand?

265
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,560
No, Mr. Noodle.

266
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
I got to look this up.

267
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Mr. Noodle is like a sort of a like a performative mime type character

268
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,080
who will say hi to Elmo through the window, which it's like unwatchable.

269
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
Oh, my gosh.

270
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
It should not be.

271
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,720
Maybe this falls into the clown category for me.

272
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,240
I'm no fan of Mr. Noodle.

273
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,200
He has a lot of like relatives that show up and are also called Mr. Noodle.

274
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
Wow.

275
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
It's just like.

276
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
He looks like Riff Taylor.

277
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Yeah, yeah.

278
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Kind of like big like rouge makeup.

279
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
I find him profoundly irritating.

280
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,200
I wonder if there's other parents who have the same thing like Elmo eat it up.

281
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,200
Mr. Noodle just slice them all out.

282
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Can we just invent a button that extracts all Mr. Noodle from all the Elmos?

283
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,200
Wow, he's he's Bill or Broadway actor Bill Irwin.

284
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
Yes, who seems fine.

285
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
He seems good.

286
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,160
He's in Popeye.

287
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,160
He's Harold Hamgravy and Robert Allman's Popeye.

288
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Wow, Jason, this guy's your hero.

289
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,160
Wow.

290
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
That's one of your favorite characters in fiction.

291
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
Harold Hamgravy.

292
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
Harold Hamgravy.

293
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,160
His sisters are played by Kristin Chenoweth and Alana Glazer.

294
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,160
So like.

295
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,160
I haven't seen Chenoweth.

296
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
I've seen Alana.

297
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Hamgravy really the the headline of this though.

298
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,120
Really, we do all of us about that Popeye movie and village and not talk about Harold Hamgravy.

299
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
How do we miss Harold Hamgravy?

300
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,120
Jason, are you familiar with the Popeye character Harold Hamgravy?

301
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,120
You are a big Popeye guy and I've never heard that name before.

302
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,120
I think I just keep becoming a bigger Popeye guy.

303
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,120
The longer and longer we do this show and like the more and more people start posting

304
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,120
like vintage clips of it.

305
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,080
And I think it started as like many things started as kind of a joke.

306
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,080
And now I'm slowly going all in.

307
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,080
I don't know Harold Hamgravy.

308
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
Wow.

309
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:57,080
It sends me a lot of links to elaborate Popeye toys that are slowly being rolled out.

310
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,080
And I'm just waiting for Wimpy.

311
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,080
Like there's a lot.

312
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,080
They're doing a lot of deep cut characters.

313
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,080
A very lean man for someone with the name of Hamgravy.

314
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
Yeah, and he looks like he's a sad guy.

315
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,040
He's crying in this photo.

316
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,040
Extremely sad.

317
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
Yeah.

318
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
Kind of whooping over.

319
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
Wow.

320
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
Poor Hamgravy.

321
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,040
Anyway, the legendary Bill Irwin.

322
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,040
Well, if Hamgravy showed up in Elmo, maybe it'd be fine.

323
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
Yeah.

324
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
That's a whole other thing.

325
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,040
Anyway, look, the point of all this is Elmo is a real hold on many children.

326
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,040
And I realized this is like, SeaWorld San Diego is the closest place that I could go

327
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
with an Elmo presence.

328
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And maybe this can be where I like, there are physical manifestations of characters

329
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
that he watches on TV.

330
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
This sounds great.

331
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So we go down there.

332
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
We're staying at this like wonderful, like fake Hawaiian Polynesian type hotel.

333
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Love that.

334
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The whole vacation was great.

335
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
The whole thing was done for SeaWorld and yet we made the mistake of like sluiding it

336
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
all after his nap.

337
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,960
And then we had two like massive, well, not Erin, she's a vegetarian, but I had a

338
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,960
massive brick of a carnitas burrito.

339
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,960
So now we're napping essentially.

340
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,960
The weather is getting hotter and hotter.

341
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
How much do we really want to go to SeaWorld?

342
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,960
I think we had to wake our son up from his nap in order to do this.

343
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,960
Come on, we're going, we gotta go have fun.

344
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,960
So we're a little, we're maybe not the most primed for SeaWorld, a theme park that

345
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,960
we don't have a lot of specific interest in.

346
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,920
Pull in $30 parking, outrageous parking.

347
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
What?

348
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,920
Yeah, yeah, come on.

349
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
Oh my God.

350
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,920
How are they more than the other, for SeaWorld.

351
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
Get the fuck out of here.

352
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Come on.

353
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

354
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,920
And we're, and like, and you're parking super far away.

355
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,920
It's not like, it's one of the only theme parks I've seen where it is just the giant

356
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
lot.

357
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,920
They never built like a nicer garage or anything.

358
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,920
It's just the endless lot that goes and goes.

359
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,880
Is there at least a manta ray on one of the signs that indicate where you parked?

360
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,880
Like, is there something fun at least for your $30?

361
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,440
They measure it out by the different animals' eggs, but how can I tell the different shapes

362
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,920
if I haven't been in there yet?

363
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,920
I don't know what a smelt egg is versus a goldfish egg.

364
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,680
Twelve rows of cars is like one egg.

365
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,920
Just put the word on there.

366
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
It's not like a kasha extra by the letter.

367
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,880
Don't just show me the egg shape.

368
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,840
We're not parked by the smelt egg.

369
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,840
We're parked by the mollusk.

370
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,840
The shell lot is different than the egg lot.

371
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:46,840
I know they look the same in silhouette, but anyways, so like, you know, I don't know if

372
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,840
we're like falling in love with SeaWorld.

373
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,840
This is going exactly.

374
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,840
We can hit SeaWorld at a later date.

375
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,840
We'll see.

376
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,840
Maybe you guys will go and fall in love with the place.

377
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,800
But we basically make our way in, hand the ticket to the San Diego teens who are talking

378
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,800
about tripping as we are checking in.

379
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Wow, that day out six flags you immediately.

380
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,800
Watch out Valencia teens.

381
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,800
Mission Bay teens are the new teens to beat.

382
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,800
But again, it's all fine because we are just making a beeline.

383
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,800
And because of the late nap, we are maybe running out of Sesame Street material, which

384
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
they have slaughtered.

385
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,760
I don't know what the Sesame Street things were in the morning.

386
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,760
They are all from two to four p.m.

387
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,760
in this particular window where it is hot as balls.

388
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
Oh, my God, it's insane.

389
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,760
All at Mission Bay is like all by this big like by a big lake.

390
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
I said, you're in the bay.

391
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,760
It's really cool, really breezy.

392
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,760
Weather's great.

393
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,760
Actually, much better than L.A. SeaWorld itself only.

394
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,760
It's just blazing hot.

395
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,760
But not not a breeze in sight.

396
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,760
It's just lacking in shit.

397
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,760
Like I don't feel the best about SeaWorld.

398
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,760
If anyone has fond feelings about SeaWorld San Diego, please tell me so that I can like

399
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,760
the next time I go, I'll go in with a different mindset.

400
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,760
But again, none of this matters because we're just making a bit like how much of the Sesame

401
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,760
Street stuff can we fit in and we're worried that we're running late and we're not going

402
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,760
to be able to get to all of it.

403
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
But we are just in time.

404
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,760
We are essentially the last people before Big Bird says goodbye.

405
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:24,760
And I get to have this moment of my son knows a character from television and meets the

406
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,760
character and it is very real.

407
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,760
It's pretty crazy.

408
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,760
It's they aren't like he's not like super joy.

409
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,760
He's not super scared or anything.

410
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,760
It's just he just looks like he got hit in the head with a brick.

411
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,760
It's just so confusing.

412
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
They like what do you mean?

413
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,760
You're here.

414
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,760
But then he walks up and just points right in Big Bird's face and goes, what?

415
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,760
Which I take in his language to mean I know you.

416
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
And he was correct.

417
00:18:51,760 --> 00:19:00,760
And then and with that nonverbal initiation, Big Bird responds with a weird, solemn bow.

418
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,760
He just silently bows forward.

419
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,760
Yes.

420
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,760
Very strange.

421
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,760
I assume because if the suit is the same way that it is on the show and there's just like

422
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,760
and there's a big, you know, like your arm is up holding the head.

423
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,760
And then what else can you do really?

424
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,760
And I sense that maybe these are also tripping teens and not people with the physical dexterity

425
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,760
of a carol spinny.

426
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,760
But I could be wrong.

427
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,760
It was an excellent bow.

428
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,760
It was like a beautiful up and down.

429
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,760
Very textbook.

430
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760
And Big Bird doesn't talk or anything.

431
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,760
Not in this setting.

432
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,760
No, these are these are meet and greets.

433
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,760
There is a little meet and greet area in an area that, by the way, I haven't said is called

434
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,760
the Sesame Street Bay of Play.

435
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,760
And there may be this land and different sea worlds.

436
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,760
It's all kind of built around a big boat and that'll come into play and kind of the climax

437
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,760
of all of this.

438
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,760
But for now, we're pretty much we're in this like we're in this meet and greet zone.

439
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,760
And in this area, I will declare my son's pick of the park.

440
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:12,760
According to my 15 month old, if you go to SeaWorld San Diego and you can only do one

441
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,760
thing, it should be this.

442
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,760
The five tin signs with pictures of Elmo and Cookie Monster on them.

443
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,760
That's the best thing there is to do there.

444
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,760
He's super engrossed in this.

445
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,760
This is something I could have bought him at home and not taken him all the way down

446
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
there to do.

447
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,760
He's seeing like, you know, penguins and belugas and stuff elsewhere in the park.

448
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
Who cares?

449
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
There are tin signs and they have Elmo on them.

450
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,760
So that was that was worth the trip.

451
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,760
Just that.

452
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,760
They are signs, of course, tied to a social distancing chain.

453
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,760
This being the lens that all children have to greet the world in for the next little

454
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
bit.

455
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,760
Wow. Is there no there is not an Elmo meet and greet?

456
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,760
I believe that we missed the Elmo.

457
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,760
I believe that he napped through the specific Elmo meet and greet.

458
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,760
So he didn't really get an Elmo moment.

459
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,760
But that doesn't mean there was no Elmo.

460
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,760
He did get a moment with with the count with Count Von Count.

461
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,760
That was pretty exciting.

462
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,760
He really loved me in the count.

463
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,760
The count held up two fingers, you know, like I consider it like counting, but it was

464
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,760
also sort of Ringo esque.

465
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
So that's funny.

466
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,760
He said, oh, we'd say it one more time and then say, ha ha ha.

467
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,760
Two piece and loves.

468
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,760
So that was cool.

469
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Then we like again, it is blazing hot.

470
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,760
So we immediately go to an area where there is a lot of shade, something that seems like

471
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:44,760
it was at one point a ball pit, but is now just like a an empty pit that has six pieces

472
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,760
of foam, just like willy nilly.

473
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
And I'm not talking about big.

474
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,760
I'm talking about like the size of a cinder block.

475
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
And they're just kind of rolling around.

476
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,760
There were two very mean brothers just aggressively fighting with the blocks of foam.

477
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
There's no characters on the phone.

478
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,760
I'm confused by those as a mystery characters.

479
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,760
Yeah, yeah.

480
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,760
The two mean brothers, the two mean brothers, the two dirty boys.

481
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,760
Wow.

482
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,760
I just haven't been watching enough lately.

483
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,760
Well, yeah, he got to meet the two dirty boys.

484
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,760
I do like this.

485
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,760
We just like we ducked into shade just like for us and give him a little snack like because

486
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
this is awful out there.

487
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,760
And he just immediately walks away and goes back to the count.

488
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,760
Like there's a protocol.

489
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,760
There's a line, but he just gets away from us and he's just right back in the counts

490
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:40,760
face, which I really enjoyed because if I were him, why would I stay back with my parents

491
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,760
who I see all the time?

492
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,760
I know that the count from the Sesame Street, the count is around the corner.

493
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,760
Why would I not go be with him?

494
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
He should take me home.

495
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,760
I should be his kid now.

496
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,760
The count is famous.

497
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,760
The count is very famous.

498
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,760
He doesn't like just a niche podcast.

499
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,760
My dad's like a famous YouTuber.

500
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,760
Yeah, he's like, yeah, he's that guy on YouTube.

501
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,760
He talks about Carl Wilson jackets, but that's not count famous.

502
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,760
But this count guy has had a 50 year career on TV.

503
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
Unbroken.

504
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
Immortal.

505
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,760
He's likely immortal.

506
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,760
He probably, yeah, beyond that, yeah, you're right.

507
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,760
He'll live for thousands of years at least.

508
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
I don't believe that well.

509
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,760
I rule these wastelands, but if I am the only one left alive, what am I ruling?

510
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
A kingdom of dust?

511
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
I'll see the blood and die.

512
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,760
I'll be here when it dies.

513
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
One.

514
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,760
One.

515
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,760
Do you space for me, I guess?

516
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,760
Were you concerned the count would bite him and turn him immortal as well?

517
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:46,760
I was going to say, well, I was going to say, unfortunately, he did stay back with the count.

518
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,760
He now is, he lives with the count and he's dressed in a little count costume.

519
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,760
And I guess I got to go back there and fight the count.

520
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
And that's the only way.

521
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,760
But I'm cowardly and I only care about my work and my big cell phone.

522
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:06,760
So I don't know if I have it in me to go off to that magical world and fight for my son.

523
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,760
I just realized now, like, yeah, you should actually dress him in a little count.

524
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,760
And at the very least, like Eddie Munster when he's old enough.

525
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,760
Oh, that's true.

526
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,760
That's really, I was just watching Munster go home on 2B two nights ago.

527
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,760
And I was like, that's a Munster's film.

528
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
Yeah, that's a film.

529
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:32,760
That's where Herman's English relatives bring the family out because they're going to get a big inheritance and they go on a boat to England.

530
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,760
But they but it's in color.

531
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,760
So you really get to see like the it's like a bright purple Eddie Munster of.

532
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,760
And I was like, this is he's got little short pants.

533
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,760
I feel like you have a little son.

534
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,760
You got to at least a couple of times dress him like Eddie Munster.

535
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,760
I was going to say the only problem is when you have to constantly invite him into his own home

536
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,760
so that he can cross the threshold on the front door.

537
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:05,760
OK, well, after briefly getting my son out of the clutches of the count, at least for the afternoon, we well, then we got to go on.

538
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,760
This is this is pretty exciting.

539
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:13,760
Like, I feel like it's all buried within within this episode that this is my this is my baby since first ride.

540
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
This is my first time on a real ride.

541
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,760
I mean, if you count the I was talking about the train and travel town, there was that.

542
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:29,760
But this is a you know, this is a themed a character attraction, which I think, you know, it has its own, you know, that that's a big stat.

543
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:38,760
I feel. And that ride is my first real ride with my son is a ride called Elmo's Flying Fish.

544
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,760
So it is an Elmo ride. That's cool. Really lit up when we walked up to it.

545
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:49,760
I might encourage you guys to look at photos of Elmo's flying fish if you if you care to.

546
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,760
Just so you get a sense of it.

547
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,760
And there's no real like premise listed for Elmo's flying fish.

548
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:05,760
But as you'll see, I believe that the idea of the ride is that Elmo has genetically fused himself with a number of animal species.

549
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,760
Oh, my God, I'm looking at this now.

550
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,760
Isn't that isn't it strange?

551
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,760
It's like a perverse, like straight.

552
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,760
Yeah, like a nightmare scenario where you're like having Elmo dreams, but he's turning into animals.

553
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,760
There's like a dog Elmo. There's a cat Elmo.

554
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,760
There's like this one. There's like a medieval night.

555
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,760
Yes, I'm seeing that there's a night. Not an animal.

556
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,760
But then it's all it's called them as flying fish.

557
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,760
So I guess in some way they're fish, too, like maybe they have fins.

558
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,760
I'm not sure or tails.

559
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,760
But then, yes, clearly they're dogs or tigers.

560
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,760
There's a lot going on here.

561
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:49,760
What's interesting is like some of them, like, for instance, the cat, the cat one looks like you could say, OK, Elmo is dressed up like a cat.

562
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,760
He's drawn whiskers on his face.

563
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,760
He's drawn a little sort of cat nose on his Elmo nose.

564
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,760
But then you look at the pig one.

565
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:03,760
Elmo has a pig nose in that one and is just maybe a pig, maybe half Elmo, half pig.

566
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,760
The amount of Elmo within the animals is inconsistent.

567
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,760
It varies from fish to fish.

568
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,760
Like, how also is it fish?

569
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,760
I think it's really it's it's all like the island of Dr.

570
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,760
El Muro.

571
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,760
That's what it really should be called.

572
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:30,760
Yeah, there's definitely one that's a car with Elmo with a slightly smaller Elmo sitting on top of the car.

573
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,760
I don't think I knew that one.

574
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
Oh, my God.

575
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,760
No, that's a joke.

576
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,760
That's a Marlon Brando.

577
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
It's I see.

578
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,760
Playing a piano.

579
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,760
Yes, playing a piano.

580
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,760
If you guys are wearing cheese cloth.

581
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,760
Oh, yeah.

582
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
Drapes.

583
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,760
Yeah.

584
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,760
If you guys could look at the dog Elmo, I don't know if you're seeing what I'm seeing.

585
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,760
Like a little, little right.

586
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,760
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

587
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
Yeah.

588
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Dog Elmo looks like Hitler mustache.

589
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
Yeah, for sure.

590
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,760
Oh, my gosh.

591
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
That too.

592
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
It's an odd place.

593
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,760
It's all it's all very strange.

594
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,760
How has Hitler's mustache as well?

595
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:16,760
There's a couple of almost who just have like the bottom of his nose like this painted black, which makes it look like he has a little mustache.

596
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:22,760
So, yeah, he yeah, he didn't mean that to be like clown lips on some of them, too.

597
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,760
It's all it's all kind of freakish.

598
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
This is I don't know.

599
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,760
I don't know.

600
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,760
I have a feel.

601
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,760
I don't you don't know what your baby is dreaming about, but I would assume that it's all been dreams about this ever since.

602
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
Maybe just maybe like hybrids.

603
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,760
Everything he sees on the street and then TV now from Alan, he's going to fuse with Elmo and his dreams.

604
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,760
And a fish.

605
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,760
Elmo and a fish.

606
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,760
They're two steps of fusion.

607
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
Right, right.

608
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,760
In this attraction.

609
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,760
This ride, just to say what the kind of ride it is, it's like a spinner ride.

610
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,760
It's kind of like it's kind of like Dumbo, but with a twist.

611
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,760
It's broken.

612
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:02,760
So you've got your lever that you're trying to go up and down with it.

613
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,760
I'm trying to get photos, Aaron's in the front trying to get the two of us and then OK, all right, I'll coordinate it.

614
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,760
I'll come up a little higher.

615
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:14,760
And you go all the way up or you try to go low and then nothing happens or like there's no such thing as level.

616
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,760
You're either all the way down or all the way up.

617
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,760
Keeps getting stuck.

618
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,760
There's no way to time like a kind of chaos.

619
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,760
I don't know.

620
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,760
Weird.

621
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:31,760
I think I think he had a good time, but perhaps not the most well maintained attraction or the and it's a terrifying one a little bit too.

622
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:42,760
And yeah, so when you're on that, like is his reaction basically the same as it is if he's watching like reading a book he likes or is there an elevated reaction where you're like, oh, wow, he is.

623
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,760
He's like his you can feel his little brain like, oh, wow, this is a different thing.

624
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
Well, probably worry.

625
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,760
If any stress.

626
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,760
Yes, I am up very high.

627
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,760
There is a lot of why is my stroller so tall right now?

628
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:04,760
OK, if he's if he's being a little bit scaredy cat, then I guess he's got some of his dad in him.

629
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:16,760
Yeah, it sounds like he's going to be a creative is going to be making movies with like Eliza Spielberg and Jonathan Schrader or whoever these new crop wonder kids are.

630
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
Oh, God, you're right.

631
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,760
Yeah, I got to get a lot more famous and fast or else he's not going to get to work in 30 years.

632
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
Yeah, that's true.

633
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,760
It's fine.

634
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
Can we again?

635
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,760
We got to switch over this podcast.

636
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,760
Only positive, only positive reviews of things.

637
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
No jokes.

638
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
No book.

639
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,760
Well, just then edit out everything.

640
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,760
Not good that I said about almost flying fish.

641
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,760
OK, great.

642
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,760
Just just leave the compliments that I had about almost flying fish.

643
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:48,760
I'm going to go back to the whole catalog and edit out anything negative we ever said about anything and all the jokes are gone.

644
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,760
And then it'll just be 20 minutes of when we like this.

645
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,760
Yes.

646
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,760
And then cut to 30 minutes later.

647
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,760
And yeah, and I like this as well.

648
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,760
This was good.

649
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,760
Yeah, it's suddenly that well, I guess the podcast isn't always over two hours.

650
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,760
I remember it being longer, but I get this feels better, actually.

651
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,760
You know, this feels good.

652
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
And then we overtake Joe Bowden.

653
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,760
Yeah, yeah, that could be it.

654
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,760
That's all it would take.

655
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:28,760
OK, well, now I do have some nice things to say about what this all culminated in, because finally some music hits and we do get the first physical appearance of Elmo because he is leading the way to the big boat at the center of the Bay of Play.

656
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:33,760
And he is leading everyone in the furry friends dance party.

657
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,760
A big confusing affair.

658
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,760
Elmo comes out, then Ernie comes out, then that's all who comes out.

659
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,760
It is two of them.

660
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,760
And that is all.

661
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:56,760
And there are clearly parts of the VO component of the furry friends dance party that are meant to be for other characters like Cookie Monster and Bert.

662
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:05,760
So it kind of leaves a confusing hole when they play a Bert centric song, which in this case is the song moves like Bert.

663
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,760
Which is what you think it is.

664
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,760
Oh, wow.

665
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,760
It is a moves like Jagger sung by Bert about being Bert.

666
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,760
Wow. Is this on YouTube?

667
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:20,760
I think it is because I think the source of this is like a Sesame Street live tour.

668
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,760
This seems to be in other media.

669
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,760
This is not a SeaWorld exclusive, I don't believe.

670
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,760
OK, wow, that's great.

671
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,760
I love that.

672
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,760
I love that.

673
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,760
Because we were a big Sesame Street Live family when I was little.

674
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,760
Yes.

675
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,760
It's great to see that they're still doing Sesame Street Live and all that stuff.

676
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,760
We should all go.

677
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,760
They're doing it and updating it with cool, with modern songs.

678
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,760
It's great.

679
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,760
Songs that they play like at a modern concert like the Manti Party.

680
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,760
Yes.

681
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
Yeah.

682
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,760
The best modern concert music.

683
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,760
Anyway, this was a blast.

684
00:32:52,760 --> 00:33:01,760
He was, you know, hey, we partied with our furry friends with Elmo and Ernie, who I don't know if I'd qualify as a furry friend, but he was there and putting in his all.

685
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,760
You got YMCA in there.

686
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:16,760
Everybody's doing YMCA, which, you know, it's funny that that's a favorite song of the Elmo, the red monster, because it's also a favorite song of the big orange monster.

687
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,760
Right.

688
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,760
Remember the president is the former president.

689
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,760
Yeah.

690
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,760
The buffoonish.

691
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,760
The buffoonish.

692
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,760
Yeah.

693
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,760
I thought anytime anyone called somebody orange man the last four years, they were talking about Ernie.

694
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,760
So I'm going to thank you for clarifying that because I didn't actually know.

695
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,760
I thought people were insulting my favorite Sesame Street character of all time.

696
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,760
Ernie is already so mean to Ernie.

697
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,760
Out of nowhere for four years.

698
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,760
They hate the orange man?

699
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,760
That's Ernie.

700
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
I love him.

701
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,760
Of course his hair looks fake.

702
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,760
He's a puppet.

703
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,760
Why aren't people that hard on dabby cadabby?

704
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,760
Yeah, he does say silly things all the time.

705
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,760
That's Ernie.

706
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,760
I like that he's kind of dumb and he doesn't know what things are.

707
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
Yeah.

708
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
It's fun.

709
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,760
It's entertainment.

710
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,760
Gosh, now I look like a fool.

711
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,760
Anyway, so look, this was all great.

712
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,760
I got to introduce my son to some characters that he loves.

713
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,760
Then I really wanted to go on a ride and all of the lines were 80 minutes or more.

714
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,760
I was contemplating going on something called Atlantis that I've been eyeing for a long time.

715
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,760
I really wanted to go on it and then I'm like 80 minutes and then a kid walked by and coughed on me.

716
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,760
I said, no, let's go.

717
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,760
Let's get back to that hotel ASAP.

718
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,760
We did some total three hours.

719
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,760
Thank you SeaWorld San Diego.

720
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,760
No rides.

721
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,760
It was a blast.

722
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,760
I didn't go on.

723
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,760
Well, I mean.

724
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,760
Other than.

725
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,760
Elmo's flying fish.

726
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,760
Right, right.

727
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,760
Yeah, the lab of Elmo.

728
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Wow.

729
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,760
Am I going to go on a ride?

730
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,760
Am I going to spend 80 minutes to wait for a ride that's like Jurassic Park but with no robots?

731
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,760
Is this worth my time?

732
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,760
Is there a front of the line pass or something at SeaWorld?

733
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,760
There might be.

734
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,760
I don't know.

735
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,760
There is some just preview.

736
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,760
There's some front of the line hijinks in the later things that I'm going to talk about.

737
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
Oh, interesting.

738
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,760
I got twisted up in some bad stuff.

739
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,760
I'll just say that.

740
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,760
I'm nervous already thinking about it.

741
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,760
Well, let's hop coasts.

742
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,760
Let's get over there then.

743
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,760
So this all happens in one week after so many weird mundane boring weeks.

744
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:43,760
I go down to this Paradise Resort of Mission Bay and then I'm back for a day and then I head to Orlando, Florida.

745
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,760
And people, if you follow us on social media, you might know that I was there.

746
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,760
I posted a little bit about it.

747
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:57,760
But you might not know why I was there or why there was no evidence of my wife or child or my co-hosts in these photos.

748
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:05,760
And that is because I was in Orlando for a bachelor party, for a big, very ambitious bachelor party weekend,

749
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,760
which is something I haven't done for a long time.

750
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,760
One of these like rent a big house.

751
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,760
Seventeen people all told.

752
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,760
So much fun.

753
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:32,760
By the detail number one, it's we're probably like half an hour south of the Disney World Resort in a like big weird house that is only rented for these kinds of things with themed rooms.

754
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,760
It's themed bedrooms.

755
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,760
Wow.

756
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,760
There is an Avengers bedroom lights up all blue and there's a little Spider-Man table.

757
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,760
It's clearly meant for a child.

758
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,760
Well, I don't know.

759
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:54,760
I think that this is a house that is probably meant for like multiple parts of a family to meet and have a reunion or that kind of thing.

760
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,760
Many families are traveling together.

761
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,760
I don't think this was meant for tons of beer consumption.

762
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:07,760
Elements of it felt a little creepy once you were really staring at what was on the wall in these rooms.

763
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,760
That was my thing is my opinion of those houses seems very good for multi-generational family trips.

764
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,760
When I look at them on listing websites like rental websites, they give me the creeps.

765
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:27,760
They seem like at best the queen of Versailles house at worst crime scenes like.

766
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,760
Yeah.

767
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,760
Yes.

768
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
Oh, you. Yeah.

769
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,760
No, you certainly suspect the crimes haven't occurred.

770
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:39,760
There's a real senior student even though you're like you're seeing cartoon pals there for sure.

771
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,760
It's a weird vibe to it and very strangely hard to get lifts down there.

772
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:53,760
It's still like I wondered if lifts were going to be any better because it's hard to call these things and no, it was like it was pretty difficult.

773
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,760
And then like in a housing developments and on the cars, you watch every car on the app pause at the gate.

774
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,760
What do I do here?

775
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,760
I made it all sort of odd and confusing, but the house is so fun and funny.

776
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,760
There was like a his and her Mickey and Minnie bedroom where you're looking at from your beds.

777
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:19,760
You're look at themed beds to them and then you'd be looking up at them like with many like putting a leg up on the wall.

778
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,760
You're staring at them while you sleep.

779
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,760
Many as a leg up, you know, the kind of like I'm getting a smooch and then the girl kicks her leg.

780
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,760
Oh, I see.

781
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,760
I was picturing a very different.

782
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,760
You're like Jason and I picking up backwards the sort of like like.

783
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,760
Yeah, yeah, I said I get what you're saying.

784
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,760
No, no, she's not.

785
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,760
She's not.

786
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,760
So I'm not sure.

787
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,760
Yeah, that didn't sound right.

788
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,760
And now I don't know.

789
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,760
OK, that's much more.

790
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
This was tame art.

791
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:56,760
I swear there was a Disney princess room with a pixelated painting of all the princesses holding dogs that resemble them.

792
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:04,760
I don't know these dogs in Canada like here's the red haired aerial dog and the long blonde haired Rapunzel.

793
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,760
I don't know, but it looked like official art other than that.

794
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
It was very pixelated.

795
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:15,760
Yeah, it's it was already funny that you of the three of us were the first one back to Orlando.

796
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:22,760
It's never would have thought it's only gotten funnier that this is where you're this house of horrors is where you're staying.

797
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:29,760
Yeah, yeah, we're in we're in Davenport and lots of like clearly meant for children bedrooms.

798
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,760
This is like a horror.

799
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
And you don't want to go to horror nights.

800
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,760
This is like you lived it.

801
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
It was like being in a coffin challenge.

802
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,760
Yes.

803
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:46,760
Can you make it through the night without needing to like take a shower because you're disgusted with yourself and where you are?

804
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,760
Oh, and a minion room.

805
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
I got to say the minion room specifically.

806
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,760
Here's a big line of all the minions and they're all holding sub sandwiches.

807
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,760
What?

808
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,760
I don't know.

809
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,760
Is that a thing that they do?

810
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,760
Is that in a movie, Jason?

811
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,760
I mean, they got to eat.

812
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,760
I mean, I understand they could eat.

813
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,760
I'm just saying is that like do they I know they banana is what they say.

814
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,760
I know that.

815
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,760
Do they say like sub sandwiches or did like Subway sponsoring one of the rooms in this rental?

816
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,760
I think that's a funny evergreen cartoon prop.

817
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:24,760
If you go back in the history of pop, like the history of how many King Feature syndicate characters have eaten like a hoagie in a comic strip?

818
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
Well, that's true.

819
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:33,760
And some but some of those characters, that would be a big feast for them if they came up in the depression, you know, they would mostly be eating like beans and dust.

820
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,760
See, you have your big sub.

821
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,760
Yeah.

822
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,760
And you're going to cherish that.

823
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,760
Like, that's your food for three days.

824
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,760
Yes.

825
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
The minions live in a time of plenty.

826
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,760
Was there a debate about who got what room?

827
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:56,760
Yeah, well, there was like on emails before all this, everybody was really dying for that minion room until people realized that it was bunks.

828
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:05,760
And some of the rooms, like it seems like, oh, of course, I want to be in the Mickey Mini room until you're there and you look at the rooms.

829
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,760
Then you go, hmm, what made me the room where I don't have to share it with four other people?

830
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,760
Maybe that's where I would want to be.

831
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:21,760
So the first night after we returned from the Lake Point of Vista Hooters, which we took a party bus to, this is a great trip.

832
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,760
Oh, my God.

833
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,760
After that, we came back for a special drawing.

834
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,760
There were and there were two drawings.

835
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,760
Everybody had to put their name in a hat.

836
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,760
And the first drawing was for the rooms.

837
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:42,760
And the first people up, you know, like adults, I guess, picked the bedrooms where they could sleep by themselves towards the back, which is where I was.

838
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,760
I drew the Avengers room.

839
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,760
I was bottom bunk.

840
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:53,760
So I'm staring at Thor and Tony Stark and a little boy's table.

841
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
That's where I spent the night.

842
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,760
Really terrifying.

843
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,760
What was it like the generic looking?

844
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,760
Did they try to make him look like the movie or is it like like was there like an off brand Robert Downey Jr.?

845
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,760
Do you remember?

846
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,760
No, this is just like this is just weird plastered on wallpaper of Scarlett Johansson.

847
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,760
Oh, really?

848
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,760
So many faces in it.

849
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,760
It's every face.

850
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,760
Yeah.

851
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,760
Yeah. Yeah.

852
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,760
Oh, for sure.

853
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,760
And like 13 of them.

854
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,760
So we're all honestly, they're all staring right at us.

855
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,760
Well, that makes it like five times weirder, I think, because they're human faces.

856
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,760
Oh, extremely.

857
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,760
Yes.

858
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,760
Yeah.

859
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,760
And and then and then a little in the bathroom, like a little more of this stuff.

860
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,760
Here's a little Spider-Man display.

861
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,760
And then here's one of like Superman and Batman and Wonder Woman.

862
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
Wait a second.

863
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,760
Hang on.

864
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,760
This is not a fully fleshed out Marvel room.

865
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,760
And this is all right up your alley.

866
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,760
Like Avengers accommodations, Hooters food.

867
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,760
Like you love that.

868
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,760
You love this shit, man.

869
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,760
Oh, in this case.

870
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
Yeah.

871
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,760
I guess it has never been my dream to be in an Avengers hotel or anything.

872
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,760
Hooters maybe never been in a Hooters.

873
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,760
Maybe my first time in a Hooters.

874
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,760
And I hey, I loved it.

875
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,760
It was just what the doctor ordered.

876
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,760
Maybe I've never been in a party bus either.

877
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,760
Like really before.

878
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,760
Yeah, I don't know.

879
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,760
Not a not a common thing.

880
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,760
If you can imagine.

881
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,760
And how many times have you been on a party bus?

882
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,760
Sorry, I was going to say, Jason, how many times you've been in a party bus?

883
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,760
How many times you've been in a Hooters?

884
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:24,760
I think like two or three Hooters.

885
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,760
I always got sick after eating there.

886
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:33,760
And the party bus, I guess similar, like maybe five times.

887
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,760
And something was always broken.

888
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,760
Like something was always wrong.

889
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,760
Something was always a little messed up.

890
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,760
And it was it.

891
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,760
It just it felt very utilitarian as opposed to like decadent.

892
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,760
You know.

893
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,760
Yeah, yeah.

894
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,760
That's about the same time.

895
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,760
You've been on that many party buses, though?

896
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,760
Yeah.

897
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,760
Weddings, weddings and like.

898
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,760
Yeah.

899
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,760
Improv festivals.

900
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,760
Like, you know.

901
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,760
Bachelor party.

902
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,760
There's a bachelor party.

903
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,760
We took a party bus out into the desert once.

904
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,760
It's cool.

905
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,760
It was too crowded and I got sick because I wasn't looking straight ahead.

906
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,760
I was looking like sideways.

907
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,760
I was sitting like sideways on it and I was like really feeling ill.

908
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,760
So this has not worked out for anybody.

909
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,760
It doesn't sound like.

910
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,760
Yeah.

911
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,760
So yeah.

912
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,760
So anyway, not party bus fans overall.

913
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,760
But hey, I loved it.

914
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,760
Just like, yeah.

915
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:30,760
Also notable that there was like a bunch of very like silhouette of a stripper

916
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:34,760
type videos playing by default on the party bus.

917
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,760
But then somebody asked like what other options are there?

918
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,760
And well, the guy with the driver went and found like the little like book of DVDs

919
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,760
and pulled out the Halloween one.

920
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:50,760
So then for the rest of the way, we're looking at like two pose GIFs basically

921
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,760
of like a skeleton turning back and forth or a scary eye.

922
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,760
Or like an 8-bit Frankenstein.

923
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,760
That's just wholesome fun.

924
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,760
Yes.

925
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,760
That rocks.

926
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,760
Yeah.

927
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,760
And paired with Hooters.

928
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,760
Great.

929
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,760
So anyways, yeah.

930
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,760
After all that.

931
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,760
So drawing number one is for the rooms.

932
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,760
I got Avengers room.

933
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,760
Drawing number two is for our shirts.

934
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,760
And the organizers of this party wonderfully, well, I think maybe realized that there is

935
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:21,760
that people do wear the unified shirts, especially at Epcot Center.

936
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,760
If you're going to drink around the world, we've talked about the Epcot drinking shirts.

937
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,760
And I wondered if there would be some some element like that.

938
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,760
But instead of what they did is they went on eBay and they purchased a bunch of retro,

939
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:40,760
all white, married by them being all white, white retro 80s and 90s Disney World shirts.

940
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,760
This was so great.

941
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,760
They were like just like a pile of all the coolest shirts I've ever seen.

942
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:53,760
I was late in the drawing, but I still managed to pull this awesome sparkly spaceship Earth,

943
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,760
like a kind of material that I'm sure is banned today.

944
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,760
This must be the most cancer causing.

945
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,760
It's a best of shirt.

946
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,760
I should really not have it in my house.

947
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,760
Yeah.

948
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,760
I was going to say go outside and burn it, but that's why I'll release all the asbestos.

949
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,760
People were coveting that shirt.

950
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,760
Listeners were like, where did you get that shirt man?

951
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,760
So I did.

952
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,760
It was a wonderful gift from the from the bachelor and best man.

953
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,760
Yeah.

954
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,760
Totally completely custom eBay shirt, which I will cherish.

955
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,760
So a big party night.

956
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,760
But then we're up at 11 a.m.

957
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,760
We're on it.

958
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,760
We're on another bus.

959
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,760
And we take it to Epcot Center to drink around the world.

960
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,760
We are all clad in our white, red, white, white, white, white.

961
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,760
We are all clad in our white retro shirts.

962
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,760
There's so much turquoise and sparkle, so much tribute, so many tributes to the 20th anniversary.

963
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,760
I love what I'm seeing.

964
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,760
Amazing lineup of shirts.

965
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,760
And so all right.

966
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,760
So we're we're at Epcot.

967
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,760
We are at my my stated favorite park, maybe my favorite place to be.

968
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,760
The group knows that I am a theme park aficionado.

969
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:11,760
This is a mildly embarrassing thing in a way to be, of course, presenting as in a big in a group of drunken people.

970
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,760
But yeah, and you were, of course, the only comedy professional there.

971
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,760
So everything was otherwise very efficient and normal.

972
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,760
Correct.

973
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,760
You were not giving grief about this fact at all.

974
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,760
No, everyone was very respectful and, in fact, impressed.

975
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,760
Wait a minute.

976
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,760
A podcast about it.

977
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,760
Tell me more.

978
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,760
Yes, very respectful.

979
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,760
So a whole episode about Popeye Village in Malta.

980
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,760
I've always wanted to learn more.

981
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:47,760
My opinion of you is going up.

982
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:57,760
Anyways, just but you know, the plus side of being in this role, being like the guy who knows all of the stuff, besides that, I know every direction where to go.

983
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,760
I did keep getting applause is when it was like, do we go left or right?

984
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,760
Scott left.

985
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:09,760
Yes, I did get some applause breaks for my unhealthy knowledge of the geography.

986
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:16,760
You know, that's where it helps to be like where I've been working at home for many months, month after month.

987
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:25,760
And that sometimes you will drift and just start looking at an overhead map of Epcot Center and there it comes in handy in moments like this.

988
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,760
So it's also put in my in my car a little bit like, well, what do we do?

989
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,760
What is the what is the right to do?

990
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:42,760
We went we first we there was the sense of like, well, we should maybe like pump everybody up and go on something, not a thrilling thing, but, you know, kind of a, you know, what?

991
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,760
Maybe a not weird pseudo ironic Epcot experience.

992
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,760
So we go we hit Soren right away, which I don't think I've done down there.

993
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,760
I really enjoyed it.

994
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,760
Big hit with everybody.

995
00:48:53,760 --> 00:49:00,760
But then it's like, all right, how do we we got to start drinking around the world and like, are there rides in World Showcase?

996
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:07,760
And I say, yes, of course, there are rides in World Showcase and there is nowhere that we possibly could start.

997
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,760
But Mexico boat ride, my favorite, I think.

998
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:17,760
I think it is climbing the charts of like my favorite experience in Orlando in general.

999
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:30,760
I feel like it really is if you pair the line with a drink with it with a beer or a margarita that you are trying to finish right as you hit that final trash can before they make you throw it out.

1000
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,760
It's like being in a giant Mexican restaurant.

1001
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:40,760
Like it's the the the place in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Casa Vega.

1002
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:45,760
Yeah, it's like it's like if that was 20 times bigger and it had a ride.

1003
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,760
I think that's becoming my you're in the dark.

1004
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,760
You're in the dark and Mexican restaurant and you get to go on a little ride.

1005
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,760
The whole thing is wonderful.

1006
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:58,760
Did you go in the little tequila that the place to get the margarita in that little like kind of tequila spots?

1007
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,760
I forget that was that was so slammed as you can imagine.

1008
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,760
So, by the way, food and wine is happening.

1009
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:10,760
So there are all the booths and everything, but a lot of them super long lines, especially in Mexico, like it's the first one.

1010
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,760
I think a lot of people start there.

1011
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,760
I don't know if that's the agreed upon where you start, but it certainly makes sense as a place to start.

1012
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,760
Yeah, yeah, that it's my agree upon.

1013
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,760
We were it's crowded.

1014
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,760
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

1015
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,760
So we're like, yeah, I don't think we're getting into that tequila place.

1016
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:35,760
We made the move of, oh, you know, it doesn't have a long line is like the sit down restaurant, not in the building, but outside the building.

1017
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:44,760
So maybe if we only do drinks because it's just open and people maybe don't realize that there are drinks there, there is a limited menu.

1018
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:53,760
You know, but if you're willing to pick from one of those margaritas and there was a margarita that almost everybody got because it was like one of the two.

1019
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,760
I don't remember the specifics of it, but I know that it is lined with black ant salt.

1020
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,760
And I noted that black ant salt.

1021
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,760
What an unusual phrase.

1022
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,760
And it was kind of black salt.

1023
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,760
And I would say that it had kind of like an earthy taste to it.

1024
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,760
It was definitely weird.

1025
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,760
A lot of people just left the salt on there.

1026
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,760
Everybody got some of it, but I think you saw the rims.

1027
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,760
It's not the salts not really moving.

1028
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:21,760
I didn't look up till yesterday that it is called black ant salt because it has ants in it.

1029
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,760
Yeah, there are.

1030
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,760
Yes.

1031
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,760
Have you heard of this before?

1032
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,760
And I have.

1033
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,760
There's OK.

1034
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,760
There's in that even just Epcot.

1035
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,760
There's a guy I watch on YouTube and Scott, I made you watch one one time.

1036
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,760
His name is Mr. Morrow.

1037
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,760
He's the most positive man.

1038
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,760
He goes to Epcot like every other day.

1039
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,760
Does videos.

1040
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,760
I was hoping I'd see him.

1041
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,760
I was wondering if I could get a picture of Mr. Morrow.

1042
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,760
I would have been so excited.

1043
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:50,760
But yeah, he went in and I've seen now that there's more like bug protein stuff even just in Epcot and especially in the Mexico pavilion.

1044
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,760
Like as far as like snacks and stuff like there.

1045
00:51:54,760 --> 00:52:00,760
I think grasshoppers and I think there's multiple places with salt or bugs ground up into things.

1046
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,760
Oh, yeah.

1047
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,760
Yeah.

1048
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,760
It's sort of like Buzz Buzz.

1049
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,760
It seems like kind of a like that's sort of a big swing for Florida.

1050
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,760
I would think that's like a bit of a like unusual food move to make.

1051
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:20,760
But, you know, then you taste it and you go, it's a bad.

1052
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,760
Yeah, it's not very good.

1053
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,760
I was not really a fan of it.

1054
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:32,760
But nonetheless, and from looking it up, I saw that there are like, yeah, it's like if you look close, you can see ant legs and antenna in the salt.

1055
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,760
So that ground up.

1056
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:43,760
I think if you just if you like if you knew what you were looking for, I think just like the tiniest little I mean, for sure, it's black.

1057
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,760
It definitely is black.

1058
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:52,760
You can see the ants like little hands praying as it's like murdered for in the name of salt for that's weird.

1059
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,760
It seems like you would husband and wife ants clutching each other.

1060
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,760
Yeah.

1061
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,760
Saying a final goodbye.

1062
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,760
Holding each other totally becoming salt.

1063
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,760
That's very odd.

1064
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,760
So, yeah, look, we're cranking these margaritas through that line.

1065
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,760
We're getting hopped up on ants.

1066
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,760
We got so many ants in our system.

1067
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,760
This is a photo that I have.

1068
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:20,760
I took a picture in the line in front of the caballeros and then I was looking at it later and like, why does it look like I have a third eyebrow?

1069
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,760
Oh, because there is a line of ants.

1070
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,760
It was a line of ants salts that I didn't realize was pressing up against the rim of my nose.

1071
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,760
Ants salt.

1072
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,760
I mean, I know it's not that weird, but it is fun.

1073
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,760
It's funny to say.

1074
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,760
Yeah.

1075
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,760
Like, it's I don't know.

1076
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,760
This is not exactly a fear factor thing.

1077
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:46,760
I'm not weirded out by it, but a funny detail that colors everything that I had ants in my body and ants on my face.

1078
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:54,760
This is the part of the podcast I would say where Jason goes, oh, we've never had ants salt before.

1079
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,760
Yeah.

1080
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,760
We're like, what?

1081
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,760
And he goes, yeah, I had it all the time on the shore.

1082
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,760
Pennsylvania.

1083
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,760
Yeah.

1084
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,760
We're all going to be eating bugs for protein by the time we're 40.

1085
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,760
So best to get used to it in fun little ways.

1086
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,760
Well, that's true.

1087
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,760
Anyway.

1088
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,760
Yeah.

1089
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,760
So anyway, so excited.

1090
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,760
I like again and again, like this is going to be on the list now.

1091
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,760
I'm going to like treat the line like a restaurant.

1092
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,760
See if you could time it out to where you can finish that old thing.

1093
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,760
You got to go a little fast.

1094
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,760
Have good chat with a friend.

1095
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,760
I did that with a friend of the show, Doug Jones, two years ago at a great.

1096
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:32,760
It's like you're sitting at a Mexican restaurant just without food, but it's all the ambiance.

1097
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,760
And then you get to go on the best damn ride.

1098
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,760
I love that ride so much.

1099
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,760
And I'm hyping everybody up like I don't want to oversell this, but I really love this ride.

1100
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,760
And they're asking me more details.

1101
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:54,760
And I'm like, well, you know, that part of Pirates of the Caribbean where you're passing by the restaurant and there's so much ambiance and then there's so much adventure to come.

1102
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,760
You know, you go down the drop and you see all the pirates.

1103
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,760
Well, imagine that.

1104
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:03,760
But with none of the adventure or things happening, it's just a nice.

1105
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:11,760
And I that sounds like an insult or something, but truly I love the nature that is such a just party ride.

1106
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,760
There's no stakes.

1107
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,760
There's no point where it's sad or bad.

1108
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,760
It's not interrupted by an evil spirit or something.

1109
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,760
It really is like for a big party.

1110
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:28,760
It kind of is the it's like being at a Mexican restaurant and then there's a birthday boy and then they get the sombrero and everybody celebrates.

1111
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,760
It kind of is like that for for the seven minute ride.

1112
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,760
And does everyone fit on the boat in the party or their two boats?

1113
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,760
We got. Yeah, we got 16, 17 people.

1114
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,760
So everybody we all fill the boat.

1115
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,760
That's the full boat.

1116
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,760
And it's a perfect amount of people where that keeps happening.

1117
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,760
Like we all fit into two logs on Splash Mountain or was the other one.

1118
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,760
Oh, rock and roller coaster.

1119
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:59,760
We fill up the entire car like the whole thing being your party is the best feeling because then you can be a little bit more of a jackass.

1120
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,760
And Jackass as we were.

1121
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,760
Oh, my God, because this really is like it is it is kicking in.

1122
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,760
Maybe you'll have had other I think people had drinks on the way.

1123
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,760
I think I had a beer in the bus.

1124
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,760
Now we just cranked this and Margarita.

1125
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,760
There's a bottle.

1126
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,760
There's a we're being sneaky.

1127
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,760
We're being bad boys.

1128
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:22,760
There's a there's a water bottle with tequila being passed around in the ride.

1129
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:28,760
People are getting nuts and the loopiness of what that ride ends up being, I think, was really kicking in.

1130
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,760
Where there's so much excitement for ultimately so little happening.

1131
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,760
But every single component of it is getting cheered so hard.

1132
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,760
I love watching it hit with all these people who have never been on this ride.

1133
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:44,760
Every caballero you see, every movie that plays every every doll.

1134
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,760
I swear I love this ride and I still forget that there's like small world dolls.

1135
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,760
I completely forget that component of it every time.

1136
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,760
But we're cheering for dolls.

1137
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,760
We're so we're so amped on this thing.

1138
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,760
I'm loving the tequila bottles going around.

1139
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,760
This was the happiest boat that ever sailed.

1140
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,760
This is just true.

1141
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,760
Like what a dream of a bachelor party experience.

1142
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,760
I think the bachelor, the bachelor himself was really psyched as well.

1143
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:15,760
So energy building and building like boy are the vibes great.

1144
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,760
And we're getting towards the end of the ride.

1145
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,760
I think we're in this maybe the second or third to last scene.

1146
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,760
And you're going through kind of a little narrow corridor.

1147
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,760
I think what's on the screens behind you is a mariachi band.

1148
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:34,760
I don't know if you're looking at a restaurant or a party or what it is, but it's almost like, I don't know, there's like a little sidewalk essentially right there.

1149
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,760
And I know there's a mariachi band.

1150
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,760
I forget what else is going on.

1151
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,760
But we're all we're all clapping.

1152
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,760
We're all having a great time.

1153
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,760
And then all of a sudden someone in the party is off the boat.

1154
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:55,760
We look over to the left and somebody in the group is not on the ride anymore.

1155
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:02,760
He has the biggest shitty grin, just like doing a little hot cha cha.

1156
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,760
Just like it look like it's like the happiest moment of his life.

1157
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:12,760
He takes three steps and then with ballet like precision jumps back in the boat.

1158
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,760
It doesn't even rock the boat.

1159
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:15,760
It's like he slipped in.

1160
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,760
It's like if you were joining your significant other in the bed and you don't want to wake them.

1161
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,760
It was so graceful and so quick.

1162
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,760
Ultimately, it was like it never happened.

1163
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:36,760
And yet his face, the joy of him being off the ride was so indelible that it felt like it went for five full minutes, even though it was probably three seconds all told.

1164
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,760
So how about that?

1165
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:38,760
Why?

1166
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,760
Somebody got off the ride.

1167
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,760
Thinking about this.

1168
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,760
Yeah, I didn't.

1169
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,760
I was wondering what the reaction with the good boys would be.

1170
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:52,760
I thought someone would nail him with a sap or a billy club in that like amount of time from like a back door or something.

1171
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,760
They're slow, though, getting to people.

1172
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,760
It's like they were the repercussions.

1173
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,760
Somebody notice.

1174
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,760
Well, so that's the thing.

1175
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:04,760
So I have I'm laughing and the bad boy in me that's coming out in this trip.

1176
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:07,760
I'm clapping and laughing and loving it.

1177
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,760
And then immediately I go, wait, but what's going to happen, though?

1178
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:21,760
Something is going to happen because I know that, you know, like when we got off the ride, somebody said to this guy, you know, I know somebody who that happened to on pirates and they were grabbed instantly.

1179
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,760
And I've heard that before that somebody tries that and then just like a hand that you don't like.

1180
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:31,760
Legends of the Hidden Temple, someone you don't know is there is just suddenly there and you're being escorted away.

1181
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,760
So the fact that it didn't happen was very confusing.

1182
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,760
I could only chalk it up to that.

1183
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,760
This isn't Pirates of the Caribbean.

1184
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,760
This is the Mexico boat ride and nobody cares.

1185
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,760
There is nobody.

1186
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,760
There's probably three people on staff of this whole thing.

1187
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:49,760
This is the ride where a character broke down and then they replaced it with a cactus.

1188
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,760
This is that is the degree of care that is put into this ride in general.

1189
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,760
It's all the way back there.

1190
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:55,760
Nobody's thinking about it.

1191
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:01,760
So that's I would have to think that's why, yeah, the guy was not didn't end up with a dart in his neck instantly.

1192
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:07,760
Yeah, I have long suspected that there are large holes in security around these places.

1193
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,760
That certainly could all that horizon stuff could happen.

1194
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,760
That big crazy video.

1195
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:22,760
Yeah, or if people were Epcot in general, if people were able to just be in the closed wonders of life and walk all the way back to body wars and nobody's stopping them.

1196
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:28,760
That's the weird feeling of Epcot where it's so sprawling that they don't even have the staff to really keep an eye on everything.

1197
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:40,760
So OK, to make me comfortable, I'd like to reframe this as you guys were trying to test holes because in the future, other people that had like bad intentions could be doing that.

1198
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,760
So you guys were testing something.

1199
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,760
You were doing a little bit of a stress test for Epcot and they failed.

1200
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1201
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,760
But that's where we do our job.

1202
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:52,760
Like we aren't, you know, we aren't doing that to show that it's successful.

1203
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:56,760
We're trying to we're trying to find the holes so they can make a better Epcot for the future.

1204
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,760
Yeah, that's good.

1205
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:58,760
Let me ask you this.

1206
01:00:58,760 --> 01:00:59,760
Were you riled enough?

1207
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,760
Because look, we've all we all can get into bad boy moods.

1208
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:08,760
Jason has talked about when I'm at Comic Con and I have a I like to sneak into parties if I can.

1209
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:13,760
It's a fun challenge to see if I can like sneak into a party or say, oh, I'm on the list or whatever.

1210
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,760
So we all have that happen.

1211
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:20,760
Is there any scenario where like three people would have jumped out of the boat and they were like, Scott, come join us?

1212
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,760
Or do you think still you're like, good boyness would have kept you in that boat?

1213
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,760
I think there was even a chance.

1214
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:31,760
It depends on depends on that's a very good question.

1215
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,760
Maybe depends on difficulty.

1216
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:39,760
And maybe the maybe my true bad boy, like as far as I would go, is that I wouldn't specifically tattle on them.

1217
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,760
I wouldn't get back and say I was with them.

1218
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,760
Those are my friends.

1219
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,760
And but I not anymore.

1220
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:54,760
I think I think my biggest thing with that would be like, I don't want to get kicked out for the rest of the day.

1221
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,760
Like, yeah, you don't want to blow the.

1222
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,760
Yeah, absolutely.

1223
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,760
And that'd be a very good excuse.

1224
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,760
Yeah.

1225
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:04,760
So I don't think there's a scenario where I get riled up enough to do it.

1226
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,760
But yeah, it was Comic Con.

1227
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,760
Comic Con party and there was a boat there.

1228
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,760
I do it.

1229
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,760
And that's why you'd want to sneak into that party for sure.

1230
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,760
Party with a boat.

1231
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:14,760
Yeah.

1232
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:21,760
Well, so but again, so it passes and we keep going and we make it all the way to the cab by arrows and the fireworks.

1233
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,760
And so it's like, so that was it, I guess.

1234
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,760
I guess we did it.

1235
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,760
And then we're in the final little tunnel.

1236
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:32,760
There's kind of a map and maybe some I forget what's what's on the map or why.

1237
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:38,760
But you're like, you're it's kind of a darkened tunnel and then you're almost to where you unload.

1238
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,760
So we get in there and then everything stops.

1239
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,760
The music disappears.

1240
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:49,760
The guy here, the cab arrows not working behind us anymore.

1241
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,760
And there is a big lineup of boats and they are all sitting there.

1242
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,760
They are all stuck there.

1243
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:58,760
We start hearing announcements about technical difficulties.

1244
01:02:58,760 --> 01:02:59,760
And now it is clear.

1245
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,760
OK, so I thought it was weird that nothing happened.

1246
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,760
Now is the point where something is happening.

1247
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:09,760
And then you just start wondering what that is going to be.

1248
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,760
I there's enough downtime.

1249
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,760
We're sitting in there for a long enough time.

1250
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:22,760
And I had already been texting my wife and other friends buzz buzz about how excited I am to be on this particular ride.

1251
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,760
And so then I'm like, well, I have to update them.

1252
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:29,760
So I'm texting like, hey, somebody got off the ride and I think we're in trouble now.

1253
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:30,760
I'm going to jail.

1254
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:31,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1255
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,760
Well, I mean, Aaron, Aaron said, like, is this where you end up in Disney jail?

1256
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,760
And I said, well, I think this is the closest that I'm probably going to come.

1257
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:52,760
And then I check my phone a few minutes later and she has taken the magnetic letters on the fridge and taking a photo next to our son that says Disney jail, jail in all caps, which is a photo I will cherish.

1258
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,760
So truly I am wondering.

1259
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:58,760
And I guess I think in a normal state, I might be a little edgier.

1260
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,760
And like, does the group get kicked out or something?

1261
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:06,760
But I'm just like, I'm so high on the margarita and so high on those ants and so chilled out and happy.

1262
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,760
I'm like, I think I know what's going to happen.

1263
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,760
There's going to be like, this guy's going to have to go to a room for 40 minutes.

1264
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:18,760
Maybe one other guy is going to have to go back in there and explain why this isn't a problem and why it should get let out.

1265
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,760
And then we're going to go. It's just going to slow us down is all it's going to be.

1266
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:26,760
I'm surprisingly chill about the whole thing, but we're waiting for a long time.

1267
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,760
It is so clear what's going on.

1268
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,760
There's a baby crying in another boat.

1269
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:37,760
So we've like now this child has to sit here for longer because of us, essentially.

1270
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:45,760
I think people on the boat start yelling it wasn't us, which is a great to deflect attention.

1271
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,760
Minutes pass, minutes pass.

1272
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:55,760
Then finally, a very odd announcement in the announcement is everyone, we are going back home immediately.

1273
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,760
What? Back home?

1274
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,760
I guess that means back to the start of the ride.

1275
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,760
I guess that means we're not like getting off of the boats, but back home.

1276
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:09,760
But you do still go like, do they know? Are they going to send us back home?

1277
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,760
Do they know that we're mostly from L.A.?

1278
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:16,760
I don't know. Just a weird tone to that phrase.

1279
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:20,760
We pull back up and I see a couple of employees and I'm like, OK, so here we go.

1280
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:24,760
The last coup was they have them on camera. That'll be it.

1281
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,760
Then the crowd parts.

1282
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:34,760
And one of the employees I was looking at has a little like trash collection pole and he finishes his trash and then he leaves.

1283
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:39,760
And then the other person we pull up and they say, please exit to your right.

1284
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,760
And it's just eerie.

1285
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:46,760
Like, well, what do you and somebody somebody says, what happened?

1286
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:50,760
And that person smiles and says nothing happened.

1287
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,760
And I say, that's right.

1288
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,760
And then we all walk away.

1289
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,760
And nothing, nothing occurred.

1290
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,760
The smile made me think they knew.

1291
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:04,760
And there just wasn't enough of like an actual thing to do.

1292
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:08,760
Like, right? Like, why would what what would the smile be?

1293
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,760
Or maybe they didn't have have it well enough.

1294
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:13,760
Like, well, which person it was? Maybe the camera wasn't clear enough.

1295
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,760
I don't know. It just really made me think like you're off the hook this day.

1296
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,760
It was like a wink. It felt like a wink to me.

1297
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,760
Well, wait, someone had a grabber, you said, like a trash grabber thing.

1298
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,760
Somebody who left him.

1299
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:27,760
I thought the person who I thought was going to like take us out of there.

1300
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,760
Then I realized was just picking up trash.

1301
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:38,760
It could have also been a boat in front of you or something like someone dumped like some shit in the water and they had to like get it out or like.

1302
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,760
That's true. Why am I putting the blame on us?

1303
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:46,760
It could have been that baby they put could have tried to dispose of a diaper in the Rio del Tiempo.

1304
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,760
Don't pollute the Rio del Tiempo.

1305
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:49,760
Happens all the time.

1306
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,760
It's a sacred place.

1307
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,760
People dumping diapers in that water.

1308
01:06:52,760 --> 01:07:04,760
As we all know, the ideal place to change diapers at a Disney amusement park is the couch in a lobby of a deluxe hotel that costs an obscene amount of money.

1309
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:07,760
So remember, folks, that's where you change diapers.

1310
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,760
Happen once to Jason and he'll never forget it.

1311
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,760
You're still. Yeah, you're not.

1312
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,760
It's fucking gross. Yeah, sure.

1313
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,760
Wow, I am shocked.

1314
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,760
I know. Yeah, how about that?

1315
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:21,760
They must have had like a little little conference.

1316
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,760
They must have had like a little conference to get that.

1317
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,760
This is my guess.

1318
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:26,760
A little conference.

1319
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,760
They knew what happened.

1320
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,760
They just sat there going, we got to.

1321
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,760
God, we got these.

1322
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,760
Do we really want to get these like guys in there?

1323
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,760
It's like doesn't seem like they're like that.

1324
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:43,760
They're like drunk, but like then we have to do all this work and then like we have to fill out a report.

1325
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,760
They might. If it turns out they're not a good kind of drunk, then they fight us.

1326
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:51,760
But probably they're just look, they're do it like if you're all these bits, it's been nothing but bits.

1327
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,760
They're probably a bunch of comedy people.

1328
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,760
They're so annoying.

1329
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:55,760
We like their jokes.

1330
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:56,760
They're so funny.

1331
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,760
So we don't want to punish them because they're funny.

1332
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,760
So did make us laugh.

1333
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:01,760
Whatever.

1334
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,760
Yeah, we should also.

1335
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,760
The ride.

1336
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:12,760
I mean, we should say I saw this period of time when you were down there referred to as the busiest period of the summer, if not the year.

1337
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,760
Was it?

1338
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:14,760
Yeah.

1339
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:15,760
Oh my God.

1340
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:22,760
So yeah, they had they had people jumping off on every ride and there was like a task force that's designed to like be called in for that.

1341
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,760
And they were already busy on spaceship Earth.

1342
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:33,760
Somebody jumped out in the middle of the tundra, the early part of the ride where the like wooly mammoths are walking across.

1343
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:34,760
Oh, yeah.

1344
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,760
Somebody somebody was painting with DaVinci.

1345
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:38,760
Somebody's painting.

1346
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,760
Somebody got on the thing, the painter, whatever you call it.

1347
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:43,760
His little apparatus there that he paints on to get to the ceiling.

1348
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:47,760
So we put the words MAGA on the Sistine Chapel.

1349
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:48,760
That's right.

1350
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:49,760
Yeah.

1351
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:55,760
So then you drug 17 drunk maniacs to go see the American Adventure Ride.

1352
01:08:55,760 --> 01:09:04,760
This was discussed because of the you know, like the we wouldn't be there if the Bachelor wasn't a fan of all this stuff.

1353
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:05,760
There was like, do we?

1354
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:13,760
And I described it out loud to some people like, well, do you want to see Benjamin Franklin and Mark Twain shake hands?

1355
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:20,760
And I think I think if you put it if there was a little more time, I think if there was one more Disney Day on the books, I think we could have gotten people in there.

1356
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:21,760
That wouldn't have been so often.

1357
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,760
And not to mention the air conditioning that does that.

1358
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:25,760
That does count for something.

1359
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:26,760
It was crazy down there.

1360
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,760
I've never minded the heat less.

1361
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:33,760
Also, like barely ate through this entire thing.

1362
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:38,760
Like I at this point, I'm still going off of like Hooters from the night before.

1363
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:41,760
It's too many people to like really sit down and do a real dinner.

1364
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:45,760
When I got the margarita, I was like, I bet I'm not going to eat for hours.

1365
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:47,760
Side of rice and beans, please.

1366
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:51,760
And then I just combined those, just made a little like hobo soup.

1367
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,760
And took that down really fast.

1368
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:54,760
Yeah.

1369
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,760
You got to do it.

1370
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:56,760
Just fuel.

1371
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:57,760
You got to do a little.

1372
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,760
Yeah.

1373
01:09:58,760 --> 01:09:59,760
It was that kind of thing.

1374
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,760
And just pretzels and grabbing it where you can.

1375
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:04,760
Because you don't want to slow the group down.

1376
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,760
Except that we are stopping for drinks every once in an hour.

1377
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,760
Like the absolute majority of the day was spent in drink lines.

1378
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:12,760
But again, that's what you're doing.

1379
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:13,760
It's kind of a drink around the world.

1380
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,760
Although then we didn't like soup or stop anywhere.

1381
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:17,760
We did the whole pass.

1382
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,760
We had a great time walking around all of it.

1383
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,760
The desire for another ride.

1384
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,760
I'm like, I think it's got to be Spaceship Earth.

1385
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:28,760
And that's your, you know, you just have to explain that to a lay person.

1386
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:32,760
Like it's a ride where you see the history of communication.

1387
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:36,760
And then you're shown a vision of your own future via jib jab animation.

1388
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,760
Jib jab from 2008.

1389
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:39,760
Yeah.

1390
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,760
However, that said, such a hit.

1391
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:43,760
Everybody loved it so much.

1392
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,760
You forget the like trippiness of that ride.

1393
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:50,760
I mean, especially like the backtrack through just like that.

1394
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:55,760
This kind of endless mirror tunnel of lights and I don't know.

1395
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:56,760
Like huge hit.

1396
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:57,760
Very validating for me.

1397
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,760
Like everything I presented, I think there was nothing that was a bomb.

1398
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,760
Not even remotely and probably the things nobody had really seen before.

1399
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:10,760
I also, of course, know the way over to the people want to go to the studios now.

1400
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:11,760
And like, sounds great.

1401
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,760
We got, you know, we have to take is the beautiful Skyliner.

1402
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,760
Nobody knew about the Skyliner.

1403
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:18,760
This was the most relaxing little cruise.

1404
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:19,760
Boy, I mean, we was like,

1405
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,760
we talked about it so much when we all went that Skyliner.

1406
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:26,760
I mean, it's hard to imagine the property without it at this point.

1407
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:27,760
Yeah.

1408
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:28,760
So yeah.

1409
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:29,760
How many did you load?

1410
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,760
Did you load all 18 in one Skyliner?

1411
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:35,760
Yes.

1412
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,760
Against the wishes of the employees.

1413
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:38,760
Hurry up.

1414
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,760
There was somebody's leg was dangling out the whole time.

1415
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:43,760
Somebody was sitting on top of one the whole time.

1416
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,760
As long as it don't crash, we're fine.

1417
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,760
And we hotboxed it.

1418
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,760
Yeah.

1419
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:51,760
Yeah.

1420
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:52,760
Wow.

1421
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:56,760
So yeah, then we make it over to the studios.

1422
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:00,760
You know, Mike, you've said this before and it's really true to me now.

1423
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,760
Now that I go on these attractions,

1424
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:06,760
the corner of the park with Tower of Terror and Rock and Roller Coaster,

1425
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:11,760
is there a better attraction zone in all of theme parkdom?

1426
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:12,760
I don't know.

1427
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,760
It feels so good.

1428
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,760
It just feels so good even to be outside of those two.

1429
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,760
And it's partly because when I was a kid,

1430
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:23,760
I was like, these are two awesome rides right next to each other.

1431
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,760
Yeah. Are there two better rides that close?

1432
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:27,760
I've never actually thought about that.

1433
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,760
Yeah.

1434
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:30,760
Like two with, yeah, they literally feel like they're,

1435
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:34,760
I know they're like more than a hundred feet, but they feel so close.

1436
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,760
Oh, that's a good question.

1437
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,760
What's the other, is there a better two rides next to each other?

1438
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:40,760
And I don't think so.

1439
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,760
I mean, there's space between most good rides.

1440
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:43,760
It's not according to me.

1441
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,760
Maybe at some point in time, Men in Black and Back to the Future.

1442
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,760
That's true.

1443
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,760
Could be. I don't know if it tops it though,

1444
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,760
because like, you know, like both are, you know,

1445
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:58,760
Back to the Future is a little on the decay probably by the time that thing shows up.

1446
01:12:58,760 --> 01:12:59,760
Yeah.

1447
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,760
Forbidden Journey and Hagrid's, how close are those together?

1448
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:04,760
They're both great rides.

1449
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,760
Enough. There's a little distance though.

1450
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:07,760
I mean, they're all on the same neighbor.

1451
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,760
That's certainly one of the great lands, I would say.

1452
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,760
Spider-Man and Hulk.

1453
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:12,760
Yeah.

1454
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,760
When Hulk was in the first generation.

1455
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,760
But that still feels farther. It feels farther to me.

1456
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:17,760
It is farther.

1457
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,760
They aren't the attractions next to each other.

1458
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,760
It's like next door neighbors. That's the challenge.

1459
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:22,760
Maybe that's to the audience.

1460
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:25,760
What are the best attraction next door neighbors?

1461
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:26,760
Yeah, good question.

1462
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:31,760
And it's funny because they're thematically makes no sense to be there together.

1463
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,760
Yeah. Right, right.

1464
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,760
Because it's how you're on, what is it? I always forget that.

1465
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,760
What is it? On Sunset Boulevard? Hollywood Tower of Terror?

1466
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:40,760
Yeah.

1467
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:45,760
But then Rock and Roller Coaster is like you're taking the freeway is maybe to Sunset Boulevard,

1468
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,760
but maybe modern Sunset Boulevard.

1469
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,760
That's the Sunset Strip version of Sunset Boulevard versus the, you know,

1470
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,760
Norma Desmond version of Sunset Boulevard and the Hollywood Tower of Terror is on.

1471
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:59,760
The light side of Hollywood and the dark side of Hollywood.

1472
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,760
And the way they say like Gotham is New York City at night,

1473
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,760
Metropolis is New York City in the daytime.

1474
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:07,760
Which do you consider the dark side?

1475
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,760
Hollywood Tower of Terror.

1476
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:11,760
Oh, I got, okay.

1477
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:16,760
Because I mean, there's like a lot of darkness with 70s Rock and Roll on the Sunset Strip.

1478
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,760
But I see what you're saying. I see what you're saying.

1479
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22,760
Yeah, but you're seeing this snippet of like get them backstage passes from the side.

1480
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:23,760
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

1481
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:28,760
It's the fun. It's not like the, you know, summer 69.

1482
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:33,760
We got to get in the limo because Steven Tyler has had an overdose again.

1483
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:38,760
His heart has stopped beating and we have to get to the hospital.

1484
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:41,760
Check out Steven Tyler's new heart.

1485
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:46,760
Dennis Wilson wants to introduce us to his friend Charles.

1486
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:49,760
Four of the five members have to go to rehab.

1487
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,760
Time to have an intervention.

1488
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,760
Yeah, that would be the dark side. You're right.

1489
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:00,760
Is someone in Aerosmith, and I don't want to just default to Steven, but it could be Steven.

1490
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:11,760
But do you think that one of the five members of Aerosmith has done the worst things of a person depicted in a theme park attraction?

1491
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:12,760
Like currently.

1492
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:15,760
You mean like, okay, so I think what here to clarify.

1493
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,760
You're going to, the answer is going to be like bad.

1494
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,760
I know that we're going to think of somebody worse and then I'll go, oh, that's right.

1495
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:28,760
But so you're, wait, are you saying like, is the atrocities committed by Steven Tyler worse than Captain Hook?

1496
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:33,760
Or are you saying like worse than the actor who portrayed Chairman Clinch?

1497
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,760
Yeah.

1498
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:36,760
Oh, there is. Okay.

1499
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,760
Yeah, I guess you got to take him.

1500
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:43,760
Do I need like a person playing themselves, which that that takes it down a lot of notches.

1501
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:44,760
Right.

1502
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,760
Because there's people, yeah, obviously that have done voices.

1503
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:49,760
It would be Chairman Clinch, wouldn't it? Yeah, I guess it would.

1504
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,760
Well, what, and then then then Spacey doesn't do the voice for his character.

1505
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:56,760
It doesn't know. So it's not Spacey. Spacey's out.

1506
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,760
Yeah, I mean, look, if you're a rock star.

1507
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,760
You don't know. I don't know what I'm even referring to.

1508
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:04,760
I can only guess what Aerosmith was up to at the peak.

1509
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:11,760
Well, look, just do a quick Google search and it's usually just as horrible as any other very famous 70s rock star.

1510
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,760
I mean, they all should probably be in prison.

1511
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:20,760
So, I mean, he's certainly up there. Is he, is there's atrocities at least on par with Captain Hook's? Maybe.

1512
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,760
Yeah.

1513
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,760
I don't know.

1514
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,760
You also got to factor in a lot of the people.

1515
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,760
I'm not a kidnapper.

1516
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:33,760
Yeah. Well, there is a specific story I'm thinking of that is close to that, but I don't want to bum everyone out.

1517
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:38,760
There's a lot of famous people who have gotten away with vehicular manslaughter somehow.

1518
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,760
Well, that's true, too.

1519
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:44,760
So I don't know if you can start factoring those, adding those up.

1520
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:50,760
A couple, like literally like a couple decades ago, it was like, none of my business when something like that would happen to a famous person.

1521
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,760
Like, and you'd go.

1522
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:56,760
Sorry, Mrs. Bush. Sorry, Senator Kennedy.

1523
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,760
Senator Kennedy, yeah.

1524
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:02,760
Hey, sorry, Ferris, you know, you know, what are you going to do?

1525
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:10,760
Oh, wait a minute. If you're counting the, you know, the presidential atrocities are not like their personal deeds.

1526
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,760
But if you, if you do attribute. All right.

1527
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:21,760
I will say that probably one of the presidents has done at least one has done worse things than Joey Kramer from Marist.

1528
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:25,760
I think all the presidents in some way have done a worse thing than Joey Kramer.

1529
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,760
Joey, Joey Kramer. Look, all he's done is make a delicious coffee.

1530
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:34,760
Joey Kramer's coffee that you can buy, I think, on the Aerosmith website.

1531
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,760
So as far as we know, as far as we know, as far as we know.

1532
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:38,760
Yeah.

1533
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:43,760
OK, so anyway, you know, there's there's not much in the way of debauchery going on.

1534
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:46,760
There's not, you know, too many more rules being broken.

1535
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,760
It was just a great, you know, rest of the day.

1536
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,760
I'd never done Splash Mountain down there.

1537
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,760
Glad I got to do it. Braver, braver to do all of these things.

1538
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,760
It's nice that some of that stuff's in the past.

1539
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,760
I'm launching, I'm dropping, and I'm so glad that I am.

1540
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,760
Splash gets you more wet, I want to say.

1541
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:09,760
I feel like the taste in Florida is more just just soak everybody.

1542
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,760
Yeah, that's yeah, that's a coastal.

1543
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,760
Yeah, that's an East Coast thing.

1544
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:14,760
Obviously, we know Jason likes it.

1545
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:20,760
And obviously most people visit the East Coast Park, whether it's Popeye or Splash Mountain.

1546
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:23,760
Yeah, they crave head to toe soaking.

1547
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,760
Yeah, that that nasty little Florida water.

1548
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:34,760
I could I could. Yeah, there's some of the there's some smells in some of these rides, I guess.

1549
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,760
But I but I'm overlooking it.

1550
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:39,760
I'm having I'm having the best time truly.

1551
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:47,760
We you know, we close out Magic Kingdom, just like magical, like swampy blue glow as we arrive.

1552
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,760
I don't know that the castles ever looked better.

1553
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:53,760
It looks so great for the 50th, whatever all the doodads they put on there.

1554
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,760
We're seeing fireworks in the splash line.

1555
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,760
It's it's so fantastic.

1556
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:00,760
Just just a magical great day.

1557
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:06,760
Then we get back and it's just like lots of rounds of flip cup and nobody's going to sleep.

1558
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:10,760
It was it was like a two hour fiasco to get out of there, by the way.

1559
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:11,760
I got to knowing all of the crap.

1560
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:15,760
I got to break it to everybody that like, OK, so the bus is meeting us at Space Eleven.

1561
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:22,760
Where is that? And I'm like, I think you mean something called the ticket and transportation center.

1562
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:29,760
Hell, yeah. And in order to get to that, we have to get on some of the worst buses you've ever seen.

1563
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:38,760
A monorail that is inaccessible to humans at this point or a or a boat line that will take us approximately five hours.

1564
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:42,760
How is it so bad? I don't think we've really talked about this.

1565
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:44,760
It is like such a nightmare.

1566
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:49,760
Even at least even at Disneyland, you have the opportunity to walk potentially like, all right, is it going to take forever?

1567
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:50,760
I'm so tired.

1568
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:53,760
But I'll just walk back to the parking garage because I don't want to deal with these trams.

1569
01:19:53,760 --> 01:20:02,760
Disney World, it's just you wait an hour and a half for a boat that takes you like a quarter of a mile.

1570
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,760
And that's all that's the only option for you to get to your car.

1571
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,760
Actually, you you can complete the loop. You can walk.

1572
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:12,760
You could say you couldn't walk. It's a puzzle. It's a puzzle.

1573
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:14,760
Is it is it not open yet?

1574
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:21,760
So they it took nearly 50 years, but you can now walk from the Grand Floridian to the Magic Kingdom,

1575
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,760
which means you can walk from the Grand Floridian to the Polynesian.

1576
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:30,760
And then in theory, you can walk to the ticket and transportation center from the Polynesian.

1577
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:33,760
There's a lot of construction going on in Florida right now.

1578
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,760
I don't know how to do this.

1579
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,760
And I love this shit.

1580
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,760
I'm I'm probably going down later in the year.

1581
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:46,760
So I will see if I can do it, which is really drive my family insane.

1582
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:50,760
But yeah, you're going to take to you're in a mental state.

1583
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:54,760
You're going to take to you're going to make them figure out a walk path.

1584
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:58,760
No, I would probably make them go back like you guys go back to the hotel.

1585
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:01,760
I'm going to try something.

1586
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,760
You're just going to take a solo walk.

1587
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,760
Yeah. Well, well, well, that's how you do it.

1588
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:14,760
I mean, I have, you know, I had some time to myself and what I did is no less mundane.

1589
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:17,760
So I feel you.

1590
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,760
Anyway, we yeah, it takes forever to get out of there.

1591
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:22,760
Fiasco, we're partying all night.

1592
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,760
It is the next morning.

1593
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,760
It takes everybody forever to get up.

1594
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,760
And then we're watching YouTube videos and crap.

1595
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,760
And it is about five p.m.

1596
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,760
before we have anywhere with all to discuss.

1597
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:37,760
Do we want to make it over to Universal?

1598
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,760
I, of course, am voting yes.

1599
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:40,760
I'm trying to play it cool.

1600
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,760
We could have to want I don't know.

1601
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:44,760
But of course, I want to go see.

1602
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,760
And of course, I want to go see my friend Botanicus.

1603
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:52,760
There was even a version of this where like maybe I just stop there on the way to the airport and only go on that ride and then leave.

1604
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:57,760
How do I go down to this property and not go on the adventure?

1605
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,760
So I'm dying for this.

1606
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:03,760
And eventually the group does get moving and like, all right, we'll do it.

1607
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:04,760
We'll start. We'll start calling lifts.

1608
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:12,760
The lifts all take forever while we're waiting for the lifts where somebody presents a pretty good idea, which is we have limited amount of hours.

1609
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:13,760
It's about five o'clock right now.

1610
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,760
We're not going to be in the park before six.

1611
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,760
Universal proper closes at nine.

1612
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:23,760
If we want to go on as many rides as possible, do we just want to get that express pass?

1613
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:26,760
It's going to be, you know, we're going to throw down for it.

1614
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:27,760
But, hey, we're being lavish.

1615
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,760
Let's just like maybe we just there's less people at this point.

1616
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:31,760
There's 12 people.

1617
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:32,760
Some people had to go.

1618
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,760
So do we want to spring for express passes?

1619
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,760
I could see that making sense, actually.

1620
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:39,760
Most bang for our buck.

1621
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:43,760
So we're looking on the app and we're saying, OK, so here's an option.

1622
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:44,760
This is like one hundred ten dollars.

1623
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,760
That's just a regular ticket.

1624
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:50,760
But then down here is the express ticket and that's about two hundred.

1625
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,760
And we're like, that's pretty pricey.

1626
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:53,760
But you know, we'll just get on everything.

1627
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,760
And that's not so much more money, I guess.

1628
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,760
So I don't know why not.

1629
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,760
Then it's like 225 after tax.

1630
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,760
I got it's climbing up there.

1631
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,760
All right, whatever.

1632
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:03,760
But we'll just get to go on as many rides as possible.

1633
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:04,760
That's great.

1634
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:05,760
Lifts take forever.

1635
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:09,760
There's a lot of traffic and people get there and people want to have a little food and a little drink.

1636
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:16,760
Where it is about six fifteen by the time we're actually walking up to the turnstiles of Universal.

1637
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:17,760
So clock's ticking.

1638
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,760
As long as I can get my E.T., I'm going to be OK.

1639
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:26,760
Walk up to the walk up to the ticket attendant, scan my QR code.

1640
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:28,760
And she says that's the express pass.

1641
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:30,760
I'm like, yes.

1642
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:33,760
And she says, no, no, no, that's just for the express.

1643
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,760
And I say, what?

1644
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,760
And she says, what?

1645
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:37,760
What?

1646
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:38,760
All of it.

1647
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:43,760
What all 12 people in this group have purchased is only the express pass.

1648
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:49,760
That's just the component that gets you to the front of all of the lines.

1649
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:54,760
We none of us have park admission, even though we all preordered.

1650
01:23:54,760 --> 01:24:01,760
We have all spent two hundred and twenty five dollars on something that does not get us admission to a park.

1651
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:03,760
How they close the money?

1652
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:07,760
Yes. Two hundred and twenty five dollars.

1653
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,760
What for? That is just to get you.

1654
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,760
Now, this is a whole thing.

1655
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,760
Everybody complains about any move that Disney makes and Max Pass costs this.

1656
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:16,760
And what are they doing in Paris?

1657
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:19,760
And they're charging for you to get to the front of the line.

1658
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,760
Meanwhile, no one is mad at Universal.

1659
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:29,760
Two hundred and twenty five dollars on top of a hundred and ten dollar admission.

1660
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:36,760
We are now what we're looking at now is like, you know, if we were to go now, we have to go get in ticket lines.

1661
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:49,760
Right. And by the time we're out of those and we get into the park, we have now spent three hundred and forty dollars for two hours in Universal Studios, which is like that's like the rate of a high priced attorney.

1662
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,760
This is an unbelievable waste of money.

1663
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:55,760
We're all starting to freak. I mean, yeah. How crazy is that?

1664
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:56,760
I'm looking at the website.

1665
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:01,760
So so it was basically for like a park hopper front of the line.

1666
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:05,760
No, no, no. This was only for Universal Studios.

1667
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,760
Doesn't apply to Islands of Adventure.

1668
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:13,760
So they have an express for one park and it doesn't even work on every ride.

1669
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,760
That's how much it costs and it does not get you admission.

1670
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:18,760
I can like these are we're a bunch of adults.

1671
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,760
Not everybody is a theme park mega fan.

1672
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,760
I was confused as hell by the app.

1673
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,760
Everybody else is pretty confused, too.

1674
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:29,760
And we as evidenced by that, we all ended up with a kind of ticket that is not a ticket.

1675
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:32,760
This was so maddening. This was such a crazy new.

1676
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:35,760
It's such highway robbery. Now, granted, this was a Sunday in the summer.

1677
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,760
And I think the prices fluctuate on these things.

1678
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:43,760
I think there are days where maybe this for eighty dollars or something.

1679
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:49,760
But we all were just like, OK, if one is one hundred ten and one is two hundred, that extra money probably is the express.

1680
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:50,760
Right. No, no, no.

1681
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:54,760
It is not. This is so infuriating.

1682
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,760
So like we've we're all realizing how much money we've wasted.

1683
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,760
And we're starting to talk to the ticket person like, well, is there any way around this?

1684
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:03,760
And how do we and like we're all looking at each other and oh, my God.

1685
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:07,760
And then we turn and one of the people in our group is in the park.

1686
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:17,760
He just walked in while we all were arguing and freaking out about the amount of money and distracting our own ticket person.

1687
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,760
This motherfucker just walked into the park.

1688
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:27,760
So he's just in. And we have meanwhile, we all might be down hundreds of dollars and not have any access.

1689
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:32,760
He for free because of lack security is just in Universal Studios.

1690
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:36,760
He we we finally figure out what happened and we're staring at him like you motherfucker.

1691
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:43,760
God damn it. And he runs off and and we all go off to figure out what the hell we're going to do.

1692
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,760
Somebody has a solid idea, which is, oh, my God.

1693
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:49,760
Well, look, Islands of Adventure closes one hour later.

1694
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:52,760
So what if we convert all of this?

1695
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:56,760
We go talk to guest services and we get in the Islands of Adventure because at least we get more time.

1696
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:00,760
OK, that makes sense. So we'll actually get a decent amount of time out of all this.

1697
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:09,760
So we're all walking over to go to a lightly themed like Arabian Nights guest services stand and stand in there for God knows how long.

1698
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:13,760
Meanwhile, the guy who snuck in is calling me like what is the closest ride I could do?

1699
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,760
What's the closest thing I could do right now?

1700
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,760
I was like, I think you got to do race through New York. Right.

1701
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:21,760
So there's no argument there. You hear there's a Jimmy Fallon ride.

1702
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:25,760
You got to do the Jimmy Fallon ride. We go into the guest services line.

1703
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:29,760
There are so many people in the guest services line. We are losing hours.

1704
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,760
We were so late on this thing.

1705
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,760
There's so much money burning all in our pocket.

1706
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,760
And how long are we going to wait in this stupid thing?

1707
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:41,760
Half of people break off to go do shots in the toothless, the toothless, the toothless of Emporium.

1708
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,760
Toothless would not be a good, not a good name for a candy store.

1709
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:48,760
That implies overly sweet services.

1710
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:52,760
Anyway, so I'm standing in an annoying line while other people are doing shots.

1711
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:56,760
And then this guy's calling. This guy's texting just like, hey, this ride sucks.

1712
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:59,760
Yeah, I know. I've been through it. It's a whole thing. Yes, I know.

1713
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,760
I send you there for that reason.

1714
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:06,760
So like precious minutes are ticking away. Are we going to get any time in this park?

1715
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:09,760
Why did we come here? Why did we do any of this?

1716
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:17,760
Finally, we get up to the front of this thing in order to get and keep in mind at this point between 12 people that but that amount of money we've all spent.

1717
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:24,760
But this group collectively owes $2,700 to Universal that we are hoping to get back.

1718
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:29,760
But we've all checked our tickets at this point and they say non-transferable, non-refundable.

1719
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,760
Oh my God, what have we done? What a huge mess.

1720
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:38,760
And we walk up to the guy sort of a little hot because we've all had with the arguments have been going in our head.

1721
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,760
And you know, it's confusing. That's like, and we spent so much money.

1722
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:43,760
And it's a bachelor party. This is a special weekend for him.

1723
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:48,760
We're just like too hot. And the guy is so calm. The nicest guy.

1724
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:53,760
He says this will not be a problem. Do not worry about this. We will get you the refund.

1725
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,760
OK, fantastic. Great.

1726
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:00,760
Now, did you all purchase together? No, of course not. We all purchased separately.

1727
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:06,760
OK, well, in order to refund all of you individually, that will take, let's see, two hours.

1728
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:12,760
No, we don't have two hours. We want to go into the park. Is there anything else we can do?

1729
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:21,760
And finally, he says, all right, you can buy tickets from me and I will give you a phone number that you can call and you can resolve all of this later.

1730
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,760
And you can go into the park right now.

1731
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:33,760
Thank God, because boy, did we time and you guys know like you have you've been in scenarios where like something is keeping you from being in the theme park and it's right there.

1732
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:38,760
This is the stress of Wally World. This is the stress of the tiny tunes.

1733
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:44,760
How I spent my vacation here next to a theme park and you can't get into the thing. This was a true nightmare.

1734
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:46,760
Oh, the worst. Yeah, I would have.

1735
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:51,760
I would have long abandoned this group without a trace. I would have disappeared.

1736
01:29:51,760 --> 01:30:00,760
I would have disappeared. And also, let me say beforehand, I don't think you told me, but you told us you were going.

1737
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:06,760
I don't think you'd said how many people were going. And I sent you like three possible scenarios.

1738
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:12,760
I was like, OK, well, if you have this many, you could likely do a group rate. I don't know how many you have.

1739
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:18,760
Now, if you do that, if you want to do this, if you want to hit both parks, you could buy this kind of ticket and add the express on.

1740
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:23,760
Or if you want to just do the one now, the island has the most rides, but you might be waiting in the most line.

1741
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:29,760
Like I I was fully like presenting options, not thinking like, oh, right.

1742
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:41,760
Bachelor parties are insane. And like it's it's hard to get an eight person improv group to make decisions like, yeah, no one's going to, you know, you know,

1743
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:45,760
I was not thinking what I promoted all these options to you.

1744
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:50,760
So well, you were think I wasn't thinking by not looking at them.

1745
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:55,760
You know what? Here's the here's the thing. You sent me all that because I asked you guys.

1746
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:59,760
We only have one day. Should I go to Universal or Islands of Adventure?

1747
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:05,760
And Jason, you presented the arguments and I was thinking about the areas and I was just blinded by my love of botanicals.

1748
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,760
I had to go see him. And then so much so that I messed up the entire group.

1749
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:11,760
I never looked up how many hours the park was open.

1750
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,760
Of course, it made more sense to go to Islands of Adventure.

1751
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:16,760
It's also where the roller coasters are. That's where people want to go.

1752
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:20,760
People don't want to see teakley and moop moop and whatever their names are.

1753
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:24,760
And I had to say goodbye to my dream. I was punished. I didn't get to see my friends.

1754
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:30,760
I'll be there soon. I woke. I will come pay homage to the botanicals, the great and powerful.

1755
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:34,760
Yeah, you were trying to help me. I should have.

1756
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:37,760
If we had listened to you to begin with, none of this would have happened.

1757
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:44,760
No, but it's true. You're clearly now you like gave me the path and if I just follow the path.

1758
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:53,760
I'm still reeling from the fact that if today if you bought an express pass today for Universal, it's two hundred and eighty nine ninety nine.

1759
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,760
That's the day that we're recording this, which is a Saturday.

1760
01:31:56,760 --> 01:32:00,760
Yes, exactly. It's more than what we spent on it.

1761
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:03,760
Yeah. And I think that's the highest rate I've seen.

1762
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:09,760
And maybe like same day they really jack it up to like the end of the month or I guess the end of next whenever.

1763
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:13,760
Yeah, like the end of August. You can get some for one hundred and thirty or one hundred and forty.

1764
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:23,760
But to nine like, yeah, what's funny is you are getting so close to just paying for a universal hotel room

1765
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:29,760
where in your room key is the express pit where they go like, yeah, just show your room key.

1766
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:35,760
Whatever, go down like, you know, it limited selection of universal hotel rooms.

1767
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:42,760
But I guess that's how they push people to like, yeah, just stay here and, you know, you get this for free.

1768
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:48,760
But like this is probably also how they limit the number of people who buy the a la carte express pass every day.

1769
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:51,760
I'm shocked. That's an incredible perk. I'm not going to make this mistake.

1770
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:56,760
I will stay. I've been wanting to. I've been thinking I think next time I will stay at Universal.

1771
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:58,760
It makes sense to me. Those hotels. Yeah.

1772
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:03,760
Good. Royal Pacific and Hard Rock. I mean, you just walk right into City Walk, essentially.

1773
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:08,760
It's so close. A little more money. But yeah, the perks are nice.

1774
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:17,760
Well, it might be a good option if I don't know, the three of us had any cause to spend a lot of time at City Walk Orlando.

1775
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:24,760
I don't know if that was the kind of thing that it sounded good to anyone to us or to the audience.

1776
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:27,760
Well, I don't know. I don't even know you're getting it.

1777
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:34,760
Yeah, but maybe you're either. So it's all it's also I like to go to the toothless chocolate factory, I guess. Yeah.

1778
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:42,760
We can recreate some of the bachelor party to. Well, I would look I think maybe I think shots are part of the equation for me now.

1779
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:48,760
I would like to see I would like to see Jason jump out of the boat in Mexico, Mexico Pavilion.

1780
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:53,760
I'll show you the spot. Go, go, go. Now's your opening. Go.

1781
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:56,760
Just like breaks his leg trying to get back in the boat.

1782
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:10,760
Well, and that's a great segue. You didn't even know about this. But Scott, while you're doing all this, I want to pay off a story hanging thread from earlier episodes that was referenced a number of times.

1783
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:18,760
Well, you're in Florida getting into your high jinx. I'm back in Los Angeles County getting an MRI on my knee.

1784
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:25,760
And Mike, it turns out you were right to say, get that looked at because it's not a big thing.

1785
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:32,760
But the doctor did say, we're seeing minor tendonitis and arthritis. So no, no, it's fine.

1786
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:37,760
They honestly did not care very much. They had already given me a physical therapy referral.

1787
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:46,760
And I but I did have to listen to a doctor's assistant on the phone. I went, well, I know you treat tendonitis with stretching and physical therapy. How do you treat arthritis?

1788
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:53,760
Pretty sure they said Tylenol. And I was like, oh, cool, man. Very casual diagnosis.

1789
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:56,760
Tylenol forever. Great. You have an arthritic knee?

1790
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:07,760
Minor arthritis. And there is Tylenol arthritis. And it is some sort of miracle drug because within one dose, I was like, oh, yes, feels a lot better. Wow.

1791
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:14,760
Which is good because the American medical system then greeted me with our wait time for physical therapy appointments is six weeks.

1792
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:22,760
And I was like, OK, cool. I'm glad I already know some stretches. So I'm sorry to hear that.

1793
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:27,760
I was hoping you were just going to be like, you need to take a multivitamin sometimes. No, it's fine.

1794
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:37,760
Honestly, I was kind of relieved that they're like the diagnosis is not you're a slovenly idiot who didn't move for 16 months. You moron.

1795
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:43,760
It was it. They literally said like, yeah, you're just aging there. You know, you just treat the pain.

1796
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:51,760
And I was like, OK, cool. Well, thanks. Realistic doctor. So but no one was any adult.

1797
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:58,760
I've told this to have been like, oh, yeah, it's not a big deal. It's fine. It's nothing. So it's like it might be.

1798
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:06,760
It is remarkably on brand, though, that like a return from this party weekend and then I get to hear about Jason's new arthritis diagnosis.

1799
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:11,760
Yeah. As soon as they told me, I'm like, well, this is kind of a minor pain in the ass for me.

1800
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:17,760
But a cave like podcast storyline wise, this is perfect. You talked about on the podcast.

1801
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:21,760
It's a business expense. This is what you get to pay for your medical bills.

1802
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:25,760
Charge them to the Patriot. I was happy to find my physical therapy.

1803
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:28,760
Go pay is pretty reasonable. So I was like, oh, OK, well, that's good.

1804
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:33,760
And I had done it before, so I had a little experience with it. So anyway, fantastic.

1805
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:38,760
So been more affordable than a universal express pass slightly more.

1806
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:43,760
Yeah, I think I get a lot of sessions of physical therapy for an all-incorporate universal express.

1807
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,760
Universal Express, man.

1808
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:51,760
Let me OK, we've got a while. I'll plow through this.

1809
01:36:51,760 --> 01:37:01,760
The once we were after all of this horseshit, once we got in, this was I think the best time I've ever had in Islands of Adventure specifically.

1810
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:09,760
We just ripped through stuff. I think the rush of it just made it like and this and this and this group that had never done Spider-Man blown away.

1811
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:15,760
I think everyone agreed the best ride of the entire trip. Just cheering and elation. So, so great.

1812
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:19,760
The Hulk. I still do not do the Hulk. I thought about doing the Hulk. I was eyeing it.

1813
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:21,760
I was walking up to it and then I'm like, I think that's the line.

1814
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:27,760
I think Rock and Roller makes it just into my over the sideline.

1815
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:31,760
I think Hulk's a little bit over and the people who went on it, a couple of them seemed like a little rattled.

1816
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:34,760
I was like, I think I might have made the right call.

1817
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:39,760
I was hoping you were so jacked up that maybe you were going to do it.

1818
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:45,760
I wondered that could have been. I would have liked to have come back with an entirely new thing.

1819
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:50,760
But again, the thing that I come back with is that I didn't tattle on the person who got off the boat. That's as extreme as I went.

1820
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:56,760
Instead, I broke off and I did Skull Island, which we don't have time to talk about.

1821
01:37:56,760 --> 01:38:01,760
But you know what? I liked that a lot more than I thought I would. That was kind of I think Skull Island's kind of a banger.

1822
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:05,760
I think it's a little quietly. Jason, you've done it. Mike, you haven't done it.

1823
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,760
I've done it. Yeah, you have done it. Everybody's done it.

1824
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:14,760
Okay. Yeah, I did Express Pass on and I think I missed some of the cooler parts of the line doing that.

1825
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:18,760
The line's cool. I thought the line was really that was kind of what made me like it a lot.

1826
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:24,760
Yeah. So and I like I liked it fine. I mean, obviously, yeah, like it's it's a lot of the similar stuff to the tram tour out here.

1827
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:29,760
But I did. I liked it. I liked it. I just thought I think I was like a little let down maybe in general.

1828
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:40,760
I mean, then you get a big Kong head. So I also had this island new blar IPA hitting me that I think would have made me like anything that I got in line for.

1829
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:44,760
I was I was I was feeling it. I felt great. But there's like the line.

1830
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:49,760
The line is like jump scares is like weird little hidden things are cool. And I heard and I missed that.

1831
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:57,760
Yeah, I think that may I think it primed me. Maybe there that is one where you want to you know, look again, don't pay for the don't pay for as

1832
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:02,760
tempting as it might be to pay two hundred eighty nine dollars to Universal and then not get into the theme park.

1833
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:08,760
Yeah. Go in some of these lines. Yeah. If it's eighty dollars, maybe in that case, knock yourself out.

1834
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:12,760
That's what I always knew it as. But I guess they switched to seasonal pricing, too.

1835
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:17,760
And a lot of people have a there's a lot of negative numbers in the twenty twenty column on the accounting sheet.

1836
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:21,760
So they're trying to make up for some stuff. You know, I bet it's same day, too.

1837
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:29,760
I bet you got you same day pricing like as if you were flying the same way on an airline like punished.

1838
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:33,760
Yeah, I think you're right. Oh, yeah, because they want to make sure that people aren't like

1839
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:38,760
if everybody did that, then everybody's just getting that and just jumping at the front of the line. Wow. Wow.

1840
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:43,760
They're trying to keep riff raff like us out. Exactly. They heard about us from Disney World. We're getting off the boats.

1841
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:46,760
For sure. They heard. Yeah. Yeah.

1842
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:52,760
I Velocicoaster. I don't think I can pretend that I did. I think you know that I didn't do it.

1843
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:55,760
I know. If you didn't do it, you didn't do this one. I wasn't going to do it.

1844
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:59,760
And again, a couple of people in our group did. And when as soon as that when I asked them out was

1845
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,760
and they said, yeah, it's kind of crazy. You're not in the harness. You're just in the seat.

1846
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:06,760
And I was like, that's right. There is no harness. There is no harness, mommy, for me to hug.

1847
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:11,760
Of course, I'm not going on the Velocicoaster. It's definitely like twisted colossus, I think, in that regard.

1848
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:16,760
Where you will feel like you're flying out of it. Oh, can't wait. Can't wait. I'm going to do it.

1849
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:21,760
I will do it. But it is definitely going to be similar to twisted colossus.

1850
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:29,760
I just hope it does not crush my genitalia. I think it being made by better by people who know what they're doing a little more.

1851
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:34,760
Hopefully it's not a genitalia crusher. Twisted Colossus was built by the Molensie teens.

1852
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:38,760
They themselves built it. The teenagers there.

1853
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:44,760
What if you like broke the ride and like the new ride was like twisting through it?

1854
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:50,760
What if like everyone's dick got crushed? Would it be funny? Yeah, I think it would be funny.

1855
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:56,760
Twisted. Hey, let's trip. Let's trip bad.

1856
01:40:56,760 --> 01:41:03,760
I so I didn't go on Velocicoaster and I had 15 minutes to kill and I was I so how did I feel this time?

1857
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:08,760
I have a little bit of time left in Island's Adventure. My podcast, the Ride Boys, would be so proud of me.

1858
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:13,760
I filled the time with a double header. Maybe this is the best ride neighbors.

1859
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:19,760
Popeye and Bluedo's, Bill Dry Barges and Dudley Do-Rites, Rip Saw Falls.

1860
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:25,760
I was having the most I think the most Jason-y run of time and it was a blast.

1861
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:30,760
I just like running from one to the other. Like I only have two minutes to get from one to the other. Can I do it?

1862
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:35,760
I got on one of the last to see Dudley and Nell for the day.

1863
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:40,760
Those are great. Oh my God. I had so much fun. I'm so glad I did them.

1864
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:46,760
Yeah, that's great. I mean, that's yeah, we can't be mad. You're surrounded by the Kingfisher Syndicate characters once you get off the ride.

1865
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:50,760
Yeah, I gotta go see my KFS pals.

1866
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:56,760
I did like both of those rides. Popeye had the raft to myself.

1867
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:00,760
That was fantastic. Just being out there on the. Yeah, yeah, pretty nice.

1868
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:05,760
Kicking feet up. I had a poncho, like an emergency poncho for in case it started raining a lot and like, oh, wait, it's still in the pocket.

1869
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:09,760
And I haven't used it. It didn't really rain through that thing on. It did nothing.

1870
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:14,760
To paraphrase the Radioactive Man movie, the poncho did nothing.

1871
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:18,760
Truly just kind of they told me to like, you know, that's not going to help you.

1872
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:25,760
Well, we'll see. And then it truly did not. Popeye is getting snagged on pieces of the line.

1873
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:28,760
Like it would rip behind me and almost like yank my neck back.

1874
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:33,760
I almost got decapitated by the poncho. That's all. Popeye is ridiculous.

1875
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:39,760
It's ridiculous. You just can't even believe you're getting that much water.

1876
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,760
It's really wild. And you don't really see it.

1877
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:46,760
Like for a while, there's not a lot happening. And then just towards the end, they find their they find their zones.

1878
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:51,760
There's those like punishment zones where you can't. Oh, yeah. You just have to go through here.

1879
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:57,760
And then a really like going up the lift hill of Dudley, there's like just a when you round the corner and then see like, hang on.

1880
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:02,760
Why is there just a drip here? This is for not it's not even themed anything.

1881
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:08,760
There's not like an octopus barfing it up or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. It's just a leaky pipe. What is the point?

1882
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:15,760
I sit similarly. The drying tent did nothing. I hopped in there.

1883
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:21,760
I'm like, I'm going to be an adult. I'm going to get into this into this J Ward themed drying tent.

1884
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:27,760
And it does light up very red. And I put like my socks and everything as close as they could be to the end.

1885
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:32,760
Like, truly, it maybe it got me 10 percent dryer. It was so rough. You paid for it, right?

1886
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:36,760
I did. Yeah. Yeah. Ten dollars. Five. Not ten.

1887
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:44,760
Five. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm glad I needed something, but oh, my God, I wasn't dry till I got home. It was horrible.

1888
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:52,760
I guess I still don't understand that. I don't understand the appeal of all that. But maybe some maybe maybe a couple more trips and I'll get it.

1889
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:57,760
Yeah, I don't know. I've never done the drying tents. Yeah. Yeah. Not.

1890
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:03,760
But you know what I did? I did film some content in there. So keep an eye on the Twitter. I was in there.

1891
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:07,760
It took so long. I got bored and I was like, well, maybe I got time for a little content.

1892
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:14,760
So there's that. Then I get to the last day. Everybody else goes home and I'm like, I'm in Florida.

1893
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:17,760
I'm going to go to another park. I'm going to do it.

1894
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:21,760
You guys remind when I was like, what do I do with this last day?

1895
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:26,760
And now I sort of wish that I had gone to see Botanicus, except not because I had a lovely last day.

1896
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:30,760
My little day solo. When I asked you guys, what is there that I haven't done or that you haven't done?

1897
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:37,760
You reminded me Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway. So I went to Disney Studios and got that one done.

1898
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:42,760
Don't have time for it here. We'll do an episode once you guys have done it.

1899
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:47,760
It rules. It's great. And it says something that I'm saying that because I think I texted you guys.

1900
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:51,760
I think it was the worst line I've ever been in. Yeah, you just say that.

1901
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:57,760
It's just outside. It's just pure outside. And the heat was miserable.

1902
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:01,760
Occasionally you catch an umbrella, but then families keep stopping under the umbrella.

1903
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:05,760
And those are in demand.

1904
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:09,760
And I forgot to get a water before I got in there.

1905
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:13,760
So I'm dying. Like really wretched line experience.

1906
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:17,760
But the ride shut me up. It's like Rise of the Resistance, but for children.

1907
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:21,760
It's like a fun, friendly Rise of the Resistance. I loved it. Great.

1908
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:25,760
Wow. OK, that's good. I was wondering, because you said the line was so you were so unhappy with it.

1909
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:29,760
I was like, oh, is that going to color the rest of the experience?

1910
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:35,760
But no. Yeah, you might think so. But no, I yeah, I really enjoyed it.

1911
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:39,760
There's a lot of there's so many surprises in it. I think I had watched a ride through of like half, but I left some of it.

1912
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:42,760
Have you guys watched it? Do you sort of know what happens?

1913
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:47,760
I've seen like a little clip here and there, but I've tried to avoid it. Yeah, same here.

1914
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:51,760
It's it's it's so fun. It's so visually engaging.

1915
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:59,760
As with all of the trackless ride, all the trackless vehicle rides, there's things you don't expect that it can do.

1916
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:03,760
Just like fun. This thing does this. That's that's so funny.

1917
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:11,760
And I oh, and it's got those little Rise of the Resistance tricks where like, wait, wasn't this room just this?

1918
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:14,760
Like you and like we went in here and then it seamlessly transitioned here.

1919
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:18,760
But weren't we here before? Like it's got all those little like, I don't know.

1920
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:25,760
I love this like whatever this trackless thing enables Imagineers to do in terms of trickery.

1921
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:31,760
It was so much fun. So good reviews on that. Can't wait for that to come here.

1922
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:35,760
I knew a person in a lot that there was a listener checking me in to the ride.

1923
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:39,760
Apparently the person who asked me how many in your party and I was proud to say one.

1924
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:42,760
Always great to say one. Apparently that person was tweeting at me later.

1925
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:46,760
Anna Lynn, their listener to the show. Shout out to Anna Lynn.

1926
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:54,760
And then I went to see another listener. I went to see Malia, who's a good friend of the show, a good big supporter of the show,

1927
01:46:54,760 --> 01:47:01,760
who is the person who was willing to participate in the influencer program at the Island H2O Live.

1928
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:08,760
So I knew her name. And she also she's hopped around the park in a lot of different capacities.

1929
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:12,760
And I think like is waiting for a thing or two to open up.

1930
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:15,760
And it's like, well, what is open? Because I just want to be back at Disney World.

1931
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:20,760
And I think she asked, like, you know, if there was something at Pizza Rizzo, I wouldn't say no.

1932
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:25,760
And they said, why, in fact, so she works at Pizza Rizzo.

1933
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:29,760
When I tweeted, I was there. One of the first comments was, come visit me at Pizza Rizzo.

1934
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:31,760
And I'm like, yeah, why not? Yeah, that sounds good to me.

1935
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:39,760
And and I got a personal tour of Pizza Rizzo. I got to see the banquet room.

1936
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:43,760
I don't know what else I I learned exactly.

1937
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:48,760
She herself is confused about like, is the idea that Rizzo works back there?

1938
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:51,760
And is he our boss or is he a franchisee?

1939
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:56,760
And are there others of these like Malia had some questions, but she's like tried to make up mythology in case anyone asks.

1940
01:47:56,760 --> 01:47:59,760
I'm not sure anyone has asked, but she's ready.

1941
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:03,760
If you see Malia there and you want to hear some back story, she's got some ideas.

1942
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:08,760
OK, so are you I mean, are you willing to yet say Pizza Rizzo is good?

1943
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:13,760
You know what? I didn't eat there because I went straight into the park and got a Ronto wrap.

1944
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:17,760
That was one of my priorities. So I was I was full. I did not have the pizza.

1945
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:28,760
But in terms of the experience, getting to meet Malia and take a photo and have a fun chat from that, I think I can say that Pizza Rizzo is good.

1946
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:31,760
I had a good experience with rat pizza.

1947
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:38,760
So, you know, if you take the food out of the equation or maybe don't, maybe I'm missing out.

1948
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:43,760
I'm not sure. But but in my food list equation, I will say Pizza Rizzo is good.

1949
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:51,760
Well, good. OK, next time. I mean, next time we're there, we will do a thorough report, I think, because the Pizza Rizzo episode is a long time coming.

1950
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:55,760
Yeah, yeah. And I think we all got to we got to do more research and really, really vet this thing.

1951
01:48:55,760 --> 01:49:00,760
And of course, I'm sorry I didn't eat there. Obviously, I should have been a little more prepared.

1952
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:05,760
Sure. Of course. I also took a little time to do some souvenir shopping.

1953
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:17,760
And, gentlemen, I will present to you some desk signs from which you can tout your newly hired position as producers for G-Force Records.

1954
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,760
G-Force Records.

1955
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:22,760
Wow, thank you very much.

1956
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:34,760
The G-Force Records is the record label in Rock and Roller Coaster for whom Steven Tyler for whom Aerosmith is just recording Walk This Way again.

1957
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:36,760
They're still recording Walk This Way.

1958
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:41,760
Well, yeah, Scooter Braun's got a death grip on the original master, so they're re-recording.

1959
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,760
Oh, he got them too, bastard.

1960
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:46,760
That's too bad.

1961
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:49,760
Those are yours. Congrats, producers.

1962
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:55,760
And then I had some time to kill and I didn't have enough time to go on a ride really and I didn't want to wait.

1963
01:49:55,760 --> 01:50:00,760
I love Slinky Dog, but I'm not doing two hours for Slinky Dog. That doesn't make any sense to me.

1964
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:03,760
And I wanted to do something mellow. I just wanted to take it out mellow.

1965
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:12,760
So I took a boat ride over to I think I'm about to drop maybe the most obscure place in Disney World, maybe the most obscure place in a theme park.

1966
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:15,760
Mention on the show, unless I'm wrong.

1967
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:21,760
But I went and I took a boat and took a nice reflective walk at the Michael Graves Causeway.

1968
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:24,760
You know the Michael Graves Causeway?

1969
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:26,760
Do you have any idea what I'm talking about?

1970
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:30,760
I honestly don't. I wish I did and I'd love to pretend.

1971
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:34,760
I know what I can hazard a guess what that is.

1972
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:38,760
He was the one who ended up with the Swan and Dolphin contract.

1973
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:41,760
The architect of the Swan and Dolphin that is correct.

1974
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:45,760
The beautiful Swan and Dolphin. The beautiful locked in late 80s.

1975
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,760
So peach, so turquoise.

1976
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:52,760
It's the same architect as the Dwarfs building and the Disney lot.

1977
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:58,760
His work just takes me back to that Disney decade Eisner era.

1978
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:03,760
I love being in the shadow of the Swan and Dolphin and I just took a little stroll.

1979
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:10,760
They dedicated the pathway between the two hotels to the hotel daddy Michael Graves.

1980
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:12,760
That's right.

1981
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:16,760
And I took a nice relaxing walk.

1982
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:19,760
I got a beer at the boardwalk.

1983
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:26,760
I was texting you guys a little bit and I walked it over to the beach club resort.

1984
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:34,760
Truly after all this hecticness and party buses and sneaking off for rides and barely eating the whole time.

1985
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:37,760
Just getting to have a little moment of calm.

1986
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:39,760
Look at the beautiful Epcot Bay.

1987
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:43,760
Look at Michael Graves fantastic work and his beautiful causeway.

1988
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:46,760
I thought about all the experiences I made.

1989
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:48,760
I thought about my child.

1990
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:51,760
I thought about my parents and my childhood trips there.

1991
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:58,760
Truly I had this beautiful little calm moment of reflection before having to rush to the airport.

1992
01:51:58,760 --> 01:52:00,760
I left too much time instead of too little.

1993
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:03,760
This is maybe the most relaxed I've ever been at Disney World.

1994
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:05,760
It was really beautiful. I got a lot of thinking.

1995
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:08,760
I called my parents. I said thank you for all those trips.

1996
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:12,760
I've been chasing this feeling of being here my whole life.

1997
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:14,760
I was very sincere to my parents.

1998
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:19,760
I can't tell you how great I felt there after all this time and missing it so much.

1999
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:21,760
Yeah, those moments will get you.

2000
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:25,760
I've done this exact same thing alone.

2001
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:36,760
I think maybe on both of my last two trips alone, maybe had a piece of pizza on the boardwalk, walked into Swan and Dolphin, sat looking at the water.

2002
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:44,760
That's one of the top attractions at Disney World, I think, is contemplating your life at the boardwalk.

2003
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:49,760
Looking out onto Crescent Lake. Is that right?

2004
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:53,760
I guess I should know if I'm going to call this one of my favorite places.

2005
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:56,760
I guess I should know that. You pass by that International Gateway.

2006
01:52:56,760 --> 01:52:58,760
We got a dinner episode about all this.

2007
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:01,760
The most mellow, reflective episode.

2008
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:04,760
We'll all tear up a little bit. We'll all be so relaxed.

2009
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:07,760
I'm so glad you agree on this, Mike. It's a beautiful spot.

2010
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:10,760
Whenever I'm there, I'm just like, wow, I can't believe I'm here again.

2011
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:12,760
I'm having a little moment of calm.

2012
01:53:12,760 --> 01:53:21,760
I saw somebody I know from high school that posted from Disney World today and somebody I haven't talked to in a long time post from that.

2013
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:24,760
Like, man, love this spot at Disney World.

2014
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:27,760
Just today. Wow. Wow.

2015
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:29,760
You know what? This is one of those things.

2016
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:32,760
Listeners, send us your photos. Send us your photos from that area.

2017
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:39,760
If you're ever in the Michael Graves Causeway, at me, tribute the great work of the great Graves.

2018
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:42,760
Represent that Graves life.

2019
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:47,760
Yeah, what can I say? I just like this was so fantastic.

2020
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:57,760
There's those episodes that are complaining and that was, you know, was at the time I have my complaints about the Express Pass and, you know, look, almost flying fish didn't go up and down like I wanted to.

2021
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:03,760
But I had a beautiful time there. I had a beautiful time down here, down in Orlando.

2022
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:06,760
To the Bachelor, if you're listening, thank you for having me.

2023
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:15,760
Thank you for having me. Thank you for everything. My best of luck is your best of luck to you as you continue the next part of your journey with your wonderful wife.

2024
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:19,760
This is so sincere.

2025
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:22,760
And I value your friendship and I want you to know that.

2026
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:24,760
And you too, Mike and Jason.

2027
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:27,760
And as we march through this life.

2028
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:30,760
Oh, boy.

2029
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:34,760
Okay, I got to get a hold of myself. I'm becoming a mess here.

2030
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:37,760
Yeah, I get it. No, you guys know that feeling.

2031
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:42,760
It's been a while. It was all pandemic and I didn't think I'd be back there so soon.

2032
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:44,760
It was emotional. It was a lot.

2033
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:45,760
It was such a blast.

2034
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:55,760
No, I understand. I long to sit alone and sip or gnaw on food.

2035
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:57,760
A solitary sit and sip.

2036
01:54:57,760 --> 01:54:59,760
We should all be so lucky to get it.

2037
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:02,760
I'm jealous. I would like, hopefully soon.

2038
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:04,760
Hopefully soon I'll get to be back there.

2039
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:10,760
I think so. Yeah, everybody's got to try and all I can try to do is pass that sit and sip magic on to you guys.

2040
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:17,760
If you can just get a little bit of the, imagine it like flaking off of me like black ant salt.

2041
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:19,760
Delicious.

2042
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:27,760
And the black ants are crawling off of me onto you, but they're magical ants and they'll make you so excited and so relaxed.

2043
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:28,760
What a dream.

2044
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:30,760
Yeah, yeah.

2045
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:31,760
Chompo's ants, everyone.

2046
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:35,760
You survived podcast the ride. Very excited, sincere.

2047
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:37,760
Scott, trip report edition.

2048
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:42,760
I was very excited to share this with all of you and hey, to meet a couple of listeners as well.

2049
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:45,760
Boy, I'm feeling fine.

2050
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:48,760
And what else? I don't know.

2051
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:52,760
I guess I should, should I just like give the bachelor's wedding?

2052
01:55:52,760 --> 01:55:55,760
I should encourage every listener to give him a wedding present, correct?

2053
01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:57,760
Yeah, go to the registry. We'll post it.

2054
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:00,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. We'll send it. I think they're doing Williams Sonoma.

2055
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:02,760
It might be Target for some basics.

2056
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:05,760
Gift cards work, but like it's not that person. I don't know.

2057
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:06,760
I think Dawn went into it, yeah.

2058
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:08,760
Whatever you can afford.

2059
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:18,760
Well, yeah, there's the Philadelphia special is a check hastily filled out in between the ceremony and the reception and like wedged in a card.

2060
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:23,760
And if you're really running behind, you are buying the card in between two events too.

2061
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:27,760
All the text on it is shaky because it's being filled out in a cab.

2062
01:56:27,760 --> 01:56:31,760
Oh, very shaky, but it'll clear, you know, as long as it clears, you know.

2063
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:35,760
The bride's name is misspelled. You were never sure what it was to begin with.

2064
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:40,760
Yeah, yeah. Don't ruminate too much on whether you make it out to the bride or the groom.

2065
01:56:40,760 --> 01:56:45,760
They do not care. They will deposit it one way or the other.

2066
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:49,760
They're a family now. It doesn't matter. They're one and the same. They're the same thing.

2067
01:56:49,760 --> 01:57:00,760
Hey, yes. Thanks, everybody, so much for listening. Thanks for following my tales and a little bit more Orlando content coming at you on the socials and keep it tuned here.

2068
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:04,760
I loved it. I love you. I love everyone. Goodbye.
