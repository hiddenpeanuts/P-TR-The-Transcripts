00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,740
Welcome to Podcast The Ride The Second Gate where today we're getting into the spirit

2
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,480
of the season.

3
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,000
Merry Christmas, that is.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,240
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by my Carlson and Grimace when I made that joke.

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,240
No, I was grimacing at the folksiness.

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,240
Oh, okay.

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,840
It was just like an overdose of folksy.

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,320
Yes, it is an overdose of folksy.

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,520
I'm also adjusting levels too, so sorry I'm a little distracted, but yes, an overdose

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,040
of folksy at the top of this Second Gate episode.

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,040
Yeah.

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,040
Yeah.

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:02,520
New experiment by Spencer's Gifts, the parent company of Spirit Halloween in the new chain

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,000
of 10 locations, Spirit Christmas.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Right.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,320
Is that how you would have intro'd if you had hosted like a Prairie Home companion?

17
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,320
Sure.

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,320
You would have started with something like that?

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,560
Yeah, with the Lawrence Welk Show or something like that.

20
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,880
That really would have gotten them rolling in the aisles.

21
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,320
Don't you think you would have been a little too, the Lawrence Welk Show's a little too

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,120
edgy for you, maybe?

23
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,280
You're looking for more Prairie Home.

24
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,280
It seems gentler.

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,560
Lawrence Welk, high energy.

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,560
Oh, the bubbles?

27
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,400
Yeah, the bubbles, there's so much going on.

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,280
Prairie Home is such a warm bath of a show.

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,280
That's true.

30
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,600
That I would think, yeah, maybe you would get too worn out from the energy, the high

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,000
paced action of the Lawrence Welk Show.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yeah, yeah.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Uh-huh.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So, I don't know.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Maybe I'm wrong.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Tell me, you're the expert.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not the expert.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,800
I was just trying to find something in the same ballpark, you know.

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,560
Yeah, it was in the ballpark.

40
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
Okay.

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,120
I'm curious what this is today, because this is something you pitched to me.

42
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,120
I didn't know what it was.

43
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
I didn't know what you were talking about.

44
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,040
You could have said literally anything.

45
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,720
I want to do a second gate on Garbage Man Christmas.

46
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,720
And I go, yeah, great.

47
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
Whatever that is, let's do it.

48
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,720
Oh, we love Garbage Man.

49
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,720
Garbage Man Christmas.

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,400
We both grew up watching Garbage Man.

51
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:14,480
You know, the spirit of improv still lies dormant in you and I, like a virus about to

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,480
unleash on your immune system.

53
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
Like chicken pox or something.

54
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,680
Like chicken pox and shingles, you know.

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,680
Right.

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Secondary.

57
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,400
Sometimes it's just fun to leap before you look.

58
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
Yeah.

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
So you could have said anything.

60
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,760
Like, let's do a second gate on medicine and I go with the concept of medicine and you'd

61
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
be like, don't worry about it.

62
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,760
And I'm like, you know what?

63
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,760
I won't worry about it.

64
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,760
You know what?

65
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,200
You've pulled a don't worry about it plenty of times in the past.

66
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,760
So, you know, just trying to follow your vibe.

67
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
Don't worry about it.

68
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,760
Please follow my vibe.

69
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
Okay.

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:50,560
So Spirit Christmas, there are 10 locations of this that have opened recently.

71
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,360
And it's basically Spirit Halloween for Christmas.

72
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,840
So it's, you know, a pop-up store that looks like it could be packed up overnight, disappeared.

73
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,840
Empty retail space.

74
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,840
Empty retail space.

75
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,600
This, of course, has become memed in the last so many years, I guess, where, yes, anytime

76
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,760
something closes, there's a Spirit Halloween, like kind of banner type sign, temporary sign

77
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,320
that goes up in front of it.

78
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
Yes.

79
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,920
And like, say Sphere was closing in Las Vegas.

80
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
It's not.

81
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
Thank God.

82
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,040
And I will shudder at the even thought.

83
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,760
But if it did, you'll immediately see pictures of Sphere Las Vegas with a Spirit Halloween

84
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,760
banner.

85
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,760
That's just that's a joke.

86
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,880
Everybody does now because they look for cheap real estate to throw a bunch of Halloween

87
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,440
crap in and then they pull it all out and do it again the next year.

88
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:46,560
So now I happen to be visiting family in mid October, late October.

89
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:55,520
My dad was like, hey, the first Spirit Christmas in the country is opening in Maze Landing,

90
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
New Jersey.

91
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,880
So all the others were opening later in November.

92
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,640
This one opened up October 18th.

93
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,960
So a few days later, me and my dad and Jane went to go check out the Spirit Christmas.

94
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:16,400
And this really shows how, you know, you are your father's son because the excitement

95
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,400
about the first whatever retail location.

96
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,120
This is something that a lot of people would go, well, who gives a shit?

97
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,640
This is some temporary Christmas store, but and I'm not I'm I'm in your boat.

98
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,960
I'm not insulting you or your father.

99
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:36,120
I'm saying this is the this is the same brain that goes, oh, I'm excited about trying Cosmix,

100
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,680
the McDonald's place that you and I lust for, which is just like a little different

101
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,160
drinks, different color sugar drinks than a normal McDonald's.

102
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,240
They'll have boba in it.

103
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,000
They'll put like a little like flavor shot.

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,440
So I'm saying it's interesting to see that your father is the exact same way that we

105
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
are.

106
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
Yeah.

107
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,280
Well, he knew I would be interested in it.

108
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,760
And I, first off, did not buy anything because everyone in the family already has tons of

109
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
stuff.

110
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Yeah.

111
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,240
But I took we between me and Jane took a few dozen pictures.

112
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,600
So I've made a PowerPoint presentation for you to Jason has we're sitting.

113
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,040
OK, this is another episode we're recording inside the apartment inside Jason's apartment.

114
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,320
This is the second ever episode.

115
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,040
The first one being points, which has come out by now.

116
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
Yeah.

117
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,240
And we're sitting at the kitchen table and I'm looking at an iPad that says we'll post

118
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,400
of course, but it's a very spirit Christmas by Jason Sheridan.

119
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,560
It is presentation style and it is it is on an angle a little bit so I can see it.

120
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,720
And then behind it, the there is a Mayor McCheese.

121
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,360
There is a Funko pop of Hershey Kiss that you got that I got you.

122
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
There's Wesley Dodd, the Sandman.

123
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
Oh, yeah.

124
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,640
G Force Records producers sign Islands of Adventure opening in 1999.

125
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
Yes.

126
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,640
Giant mug.

127
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,120
Holiday in sign that Scott got you, right?

128
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,120
Yeah.

129
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,600
Scott got me that for that my birthday.

130
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Oh, yeah.

131
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
You got a lot of stuff going on.

132
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
So I'm really getting the full picture.

133
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Yeah.

134
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:17,680
It really looks like I'm about to do a YouTube show complaining about like D.I. and Wicked

135
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
or something.

136
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,920
It's saying yes.

137
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,440
And if and I will say if I get bored during this presentation, I'm just going to go through

138
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,440
your shit.

139
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
Yeah.

140
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,440
Kitchen or other way.

141
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,440
Yes.

142
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:34,440
What I've been dealing with a week is multiple contractors here because our heat is now working

143
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,880
correctly.

144
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,240
And also there was a leak in the pipes in the walls.

145
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,960
So I had to clear out a lot of stuff from my office, which we had just cleaned up a

146
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,680
lot the other day.

147
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
Right.

148
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,440
We removed all the like precious items and then these are the the little things.

149
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,440
These are the treasures.

150
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,800
The treasures that ended up out here.

151
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,360
The little treasures.

152
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:06,320
So but let's let's move on to the slideshow and I will narrate this and we'll figure out

153
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,080
I'll figure out a way to get this online.

154
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:17,480
I don't know if it's worth just uploading a keynote file to the Patriot or this is in

155
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
keynote.

156
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
I know.

157
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,680
I suppose the photos, though, you could post some photos.

158
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,960
Yeah, we might not need to download seven gigabytes of a keynote presentation to get.

159
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,920
And then if you have to get an apple to actually enjoy this episode, you have to get an apple

160
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
product.

161
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:37,880
I don't know if you I mean, let me tell you this, you can export it, export it probably

162
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
as a PDF.

163
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,880
Oh, a PDF.

164
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
Probably.

165
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
Yeah.

166
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,000
And it just gives you every slide as if it's a photo.

167
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:51,360
But I would like to see a very large file be uploaded to our Patreon that makes everybody's

168
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
computer.

169
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
Of 30 pictures?

170
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
Yeah.

171
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,360
Yes.

172
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,360
Yes.

173
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
Yes.

174
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
Well, this is broken up into chapters.

175
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Oh, OK.

176
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
So you're weaving a tail.

177
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
I'm weaving a tail.

178
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
OK, great.

179
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,680
Because as I was looking at all the pictures, I combined Jane and my pictures and made an

180
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,600
album of them and I'm looking at all these and themes started to develop.

181
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,000
Let me stop you right here.

182
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah.

183
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,840
Like, I'm just going to set my expectations for what I think this is.

184
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,840
OK.

185
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,400
Again, I don't know what this is.

186
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Sure.

187
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
What would it be?

188
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,680
It would be a Christmas store.

189
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
It would be a Santa.

190
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,680
It would be Mickey and Minnie dressed as Santa.

191
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,280
It would be a Frosty the Snowman.

192
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,280
I don't know, Stan D. It would be some animatronics is like, you know, you have those big Halloween

193
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,120
animatronics and they do that with Christmas now.

194
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,120
Right.

195
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
Yeah.

196
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
I'm just trying to work out what I think is going to be.

197
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,080
So there's got to be something here that I'm not imagining.

198
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,640
I'm guessing big candy canes.

199
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,000
There's going to be a big candy cane.

200
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah.

201
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,880
Different Christmas lights, different types of lights.

202
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
Sometimes they have icicle lights.

203
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,200
Again, you're you're you're not incorrect, but there's so much more.

204
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
That's great.

205
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,840
I'm just I'm just trying to set my expectations for what is going to happen.

206
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Well, let's start with part one.

207
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
OK.

208
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
Photo ops.

209
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,920
So this is about what you'd expect.

210
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,840
You know, there's picture of me in front of one of the signs outside.

211
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
And there's like.

212
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
Me and Jane.

213
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,840
Hold on.

214
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
Go back.

215
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,160
I'm going to set the scene for the for the listener.

216
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,800
There's a picture of like I would say like it's not a poorly drawn Santa, but it doesn't

217
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,600
look like a very specific Santa to me.

218
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,680
It's a very generic kind of winking Santa.

219
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,040
He's a cartoon.

220
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,560
And you are kind of resting in his palm, by the way, that this photo looks like.

221
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,160
It's almost like he's giving you a shove, like a playful shove.

222
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
Like he's either either him.

223
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,960
He could be hitting you like sort of with the heel of his hand on the butt.

224
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,920
And he's kind of giving you a good one from behind.

225
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
It's very exciting.

226
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,000
I knew you would see things that I didn't even notice in these photos.

227
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yeah, it just looks.

228
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah.

229
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,680
It looks like Santa's giving you a playful shove and he's winking because he knows he's

230
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,520
being a little scamp.

231
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
Yeah.

232
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,560
So now it's here's me and Jane at like the folding sign.

233
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,560
Right.

234
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Smaller sign.

235
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,560
Smaller sign.

236
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Santa.

237
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,560
It looks very similar.

238
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,840
He's not touching you in that one.

239
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,560
Now, here's where it gets to be fun.

240
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
There's photo.

241
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
There's like.

242
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,560
OK.

243
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
Stepping repeats and photo.

244
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:19,360
So I am standing in a big pair of boots, Santa boots with candy giant, what would you say?

245
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
Peppermint lollipops around.

246
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,360
Yeah.

247
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,240
They're like kind of peppermint style and then they have sticks on them.

248
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,800
So yeah, it almost looks like a peppermint with a stick and a big backdrop that it doesn't

249
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,440
look like they ever finished stretching out.

250
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,280
No, it's just a big like sheet with a couple like Christmas type houses.

251
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,880
Like if you're at Santa's workshop and these this foot, this foot, I don't want to call

252
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
it an illusion.

253
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
It's not an illusion, but this foot.

254
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,120
I guess it kind of is where it looks like you're wearing Santa's boots.

255
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,840
It's the same thing they do at a bubblegum shrimp where you sit by that bench and you

256
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
have a shoe.

257
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
You put your feet in the shoes.

258
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Feet in the shoes.

259
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Yeah.

260
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
There's a big suitcase there as if you're forest.

261
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Is that what it was?

262
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
I think so.

263
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
Well, it's the chocolate box.

264
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,840
Yeah.

265
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
And his sneakers.

266
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
So yes, it's forest.

267
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:08,560
Now, this these shoes or boots from Santa make Santa look like he's seven foot eight.

268
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,560
Like he's massive.

269
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:18,400
He's like Andre, the giant size here, because these like the boots come up to your mid thigh

270
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,240
and like you're a shorter gentleman, but you're not two and a half feet tall.

271
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,280
There's like a step behind it.

272
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,880
There's essentially apple boxes behind it.

273
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,420
And I'm trying to stand in there and like manage a cane.

274
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,680
So it is the optical illusion is not perfect.

275
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,640
This is like the Santa in red one.

276
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,480
The Santa is fucking jacked.

277
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,480
Oh, yeah.

278
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,760
I would know more details if I had seen it or if anyone else had seen it.

279
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,160
Well, look, you can go see it right now and you can be next to a theater playing Wicked

280
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,480
and everyone doing the Tarzan.

281
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,480
People are excited about Wicked.

282
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,560
People are excited about Wicked.

283
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,520
This looks also like this photo op was set up in like, like in the like, I don't know,

284
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,360
like foyer of a rest home.

285
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,280
It is set up in between two sets of sliding glass doors.

286
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,760
This looks like an old folks home.

287
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,760
Yes.

288
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,760
OK.

289
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,760
So go ahead.

290
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
Go ahead.

291
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,400
We'll see if Jane's is a little better on the other side of the room.

292
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,880
She's a gingerbread person.

293
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,880
OK, great.

294
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,680
And this is sort of just she's not inside.

295
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,680
She's behind this thing.

296
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,680
Just behind it.

297
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,420
So this is basically a photo op with a headless gingerbread, what made out of plastic or some

298
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,000
kind of material.

299
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And that's fun.

300
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I will say that's fun.

301
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yeah.

302
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,800
It's very colorful and it's a little scary, but it's scary.

303
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Yeah.

304
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,840
Because, yeah, it looks like, you know, your human body is all gingerbread and then you

305
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,200
have a human's head on the top.

306
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,400
I mean, imagine that in real life.

307
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
Yeah.

308
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,680
Imagine you pull a tray of gingerbread cookies out of the oven and it's just cute little

309
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,120
gingerbread bodies and then there's human heads.

310
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
Human heads.

311
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,120
And they're realistic.

312
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,920
Well, hold that thought.

313
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,640
We'll circle back around to unusual gingerbread creatures.

314
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,360
What if it was like, hold on, I'm really just brainstorming here.

315
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,840
It's gingerbread cookie.

316
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:14,760
But then you've also cooked little pieces of chicken that look more skin colored for

317
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,760
the heads.

318
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
OK.

319
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:24,720
And then you can really like detail, like red and stimpy detail the eyes and the mouth.

320
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,760
So you're you're just creating a body horror like gruesome creature.

321
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,760
Yeah, exactly.

322
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,760
Because I'm inspired by this photo of a hybrid is a hybrid.

323
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
It is hybrid.

324
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
Yeah.

325
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,200
So because the boots like, oh, isn't it fun to wear Santa's boots?

326
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Yeah, fun.

327
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,320
But isn't it fun to be transformed into half person, half gingerbread to like a five foot

328
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,400
tall gingerbread person?

329
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,720
So you'll get you working on this half chicken, half gingerbread cookie soon.

330
00:13:52,720 --> 00:14:00,000
So right inside the store, there is a big sign and a little, you know, simulation of

331
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,880
a village called Gingerbread Lane.

332
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:07,960
I don't know if the simulation, I think it's more just, you know, a little, a little, a

333
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,560
little town, a little version of a town.

334
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,280
But this is, I think, what you were getting at earlier.

335
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,840
Lots of Christmas stuff.

336
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,640
Here's a fake inflatable Rudolph.

337
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,200
Exactly what I thought.

338
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Where we go.

339
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
It's bigger.

340
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,240
Oh, he would be afraid of this because this is big, oh, big, big, big, big, big, who is

341
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,920
Brown?

342
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,000
For some reason.

343
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,260
No, I don't know.

344
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,260
Hmm.

345
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,460
I always think of him as green.

346
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,700
I don't know if he's green in the original movie.

347
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,020
I guess he's kind of cream, white-ish.

348
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,860
Okay, but this is what I thought.

349
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,660
Yeah, these are big inflatable, fun things.

350
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,820
They look a little cheap, but okay, they're fine.

351
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,860
Yeah, this is just kind of one corner.

352
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,260
Okay, they're big, but they're big things in a small room,

353
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,660
so it's good thing Scott's not here.

354
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,500
It's a good thing we're Scott-free today.

355
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,940
Good thing Scott's, this is Scott-free for sure.

356
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,600
Because he would be peeing in his pants.

357
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,260
Okay, we have arrived at part two.

358
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,980
Sorry, I'm taking over your hosting duties.

359
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,020
Part two, all your friends are here.

360
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,860
Okay, how many parts are in this again?

361
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,220
I believe four.

362
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,300
Okay, so we're almost, this is almost halfway.

363
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,140
We're almost at the intermission.

364
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,580
Well, part three.

365
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,420
Oh, that's the big one.

366
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,260
Part three is the big one.

367
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,140
Sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself.

368
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,780
So it's like Wicked in a way,

369
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,500
except there's four parts, not two parts.

370
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,980
Because Wicked is a very long first part movie, they say,

371
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,420
and then there's a second part

372
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,020
that's also gonna be very long.

373
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,060
So this is your version almost of Wicked.

374
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,100
Yeah, okay, so we got some fun socks.

375
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:26,940
Okay, yes.

376
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,700
We got Christmas Pickle Rick.

377
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,840
We have Buddy the Elf.

378
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,680
Yes, from Elf.

379
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,420
One just says Nutcracker.

380
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,860
We've got Garfield the Cat.

381
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,300
Yeah, and he's wearing a Santa's outfit.

382
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,060
He's wearing a Santa's outfit, SpongeBob.

383
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,740
Okay, he's got a Christmas sweater on, right.

384
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,420
I've seen, yes, socks, okay.

385
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,740
Scooby.

386
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,580
Okay.

387
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,700
Scooby-Doo down at the bottom Christmassy.

388
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,840
Got it.

389
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,220
Okay, now your favorite Christmas friends.

390
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,220
You know those weird CG Sour Patch Kids?

391
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,740
Well, they're trying to make them a thing.

392
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,180
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

393
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,020
Yeah, yeah.

394
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,940
Weird CGI Sour Patch Kids, what do you mean?

395
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,560
Like from the commercials,

396
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,820
the current commercials for Sour Patch Kids

397
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,540
is little freakish Sour Patch Kids.

398
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,180
What programming are you watching

399
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,500
that is advertising Sour Patch Kids to you?

400
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,900
I feel like, you know, just cable.

401
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,740
Cable TV, or like-

402
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,740
I feel like I haven't seen-

403
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,180
Before the movies?

404
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,740
Maybe I've seen a chocolate commercial

405
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,660
or something recently,

406
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,900
but I feel like I have not been advertised

407
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,420
Sour Patch Kids lately.

408
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,860
I feel like they were kind of trying a little something.

409
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,700
They were trying-

410
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,860
To class up Sour Patch Kids

411
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,860
for the adult, the sophisticated adult.

412
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,740
I guess so, or I guess just like,

413
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,620
hey, don't forget about Sour Patch Kids.

414
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,020
Sour Patch Adults is how they should market it.

415
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,620
They shouldn't be kids.

416
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,460
Oh.

417
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,020
If you want me as an adult to,

418
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,340
not me, not me, but like one, an adult, normal.

419
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,780
Like a tasteful minimalist packaging.

420
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,140
Like how Ralph Brennan's Jazz Kitchen

421
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,860
became like the coastal jazz lounge or something.

422
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,620
So yeah, Sour Patch Adults would appeal more

423
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,260
to the working person.

424
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,420
I guess these are supposed to be stocking stuff.

425
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,740
There's a lot today.

426
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,120
I mean, I still hear, these are characters,

427
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,660
I've seen them on the boxes of Sour Patch Kids,

428
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,900
because I do look at the boxes of Sour Patch Kids

429
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,580
from time to time.

430
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,860
So yeah, I mean, I don't care for these characters.

431
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,940
Well, you've got some big like candy.

432
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,660
You will see these at It's Sugar.

433
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,940
Like It's Sugar at City Walk will have a lot of merch

434
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,860
of these characters no one cares about.

435
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,780
Yeah, yeah.

436
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,420
I mean, prove me wrong, audience.

437
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,740
If you give a shit about the Sour Patch Kids kids,

438
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,340
let us know, but I don't know,

439
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,780
is there one person on the planet

440
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,260
that has any affection for those characters?

441
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,940
You remember those gerbils who used to drive the Scions?

442
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,780
What?

443
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,460
Like 20 years ago.

444
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,260
The gerbils who used to drive the Scions?

445
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,700
They were creatures, or like the Quiznos,

446
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,300
like little creepies, little ghoulies.

447
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,860
Who's the Quiznos creepy?

448
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,940
They talk like this,

449
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,180
and they kind of look like a raccoon or something.

450
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,020
What?

451
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,180
The Quiznos creepies.

452
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,420
This is probably going back 20 years ago.

453
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:15,420
The Scion gerbils and the Quiznos creepies.

454
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,700
The Quiznos ghoulies.

455
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,380
Quiznos ghoulies.

456
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,380
Was it Fuzzbucket style?

457
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,780
They did kind of resemble Fuzzbucket a little.

458
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,620
Oh, okay.

459
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,100
So those was like almost like a little,

460
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,940
the Quiznos spung monkeys?

461
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,780
No.

462
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,940
Is that what they're called?

463
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,780
I didn't know that was there.

464
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,620
What were the Quiznos creatures?

465
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,180
Mr. Potato Rats?

466
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,140
They were called Hell Lemurs

467
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,140
and the weirdest corporate mascot of all time.

468
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,140
I kind of remember this.

469
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:44,980
Yeah.

470
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,580
You're looking at almost like a stretched out,

471
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,500
printed out copy of a picture of a gerbil

472
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,740
with the mouth and eyes cut out and human eyes.

473
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,140
Of like thumb wars,

474
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,460
like a thumb war kind of face.

475
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,900
Yeah, but more scary than that.

476
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,820
Oh my God.

477
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,740
This is kind of the era of funny because it's weird,

478
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,900
funny because it's random,

479
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,500
like the berries and cream.

480
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,820
I'm a little lad who loves berries and cream.

481
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,380
Quiznos spung monkeys.

482
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,620
S-P-O-N-G-M-O-N-K-E-Y-S,

483
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,180
spung monkeys.

484
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,060
And this is a thing that I did not write

485
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,380
Quiznos spung monkeys down.

486
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,540
I was truly just trying to think like,

487
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,020
oh, maybe he'll remember this ad campaign.

488
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,860
Spung monkeys.

489
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,780
Oh my God.

490
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,180
Well, I was worried that we weren't going to have

491
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,900
anything good for Scott when he came back,

492
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,460
but Quiznos spung monkeys.

493
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,300
Yeah.

494
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,140
Wow.

495
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,980
Okay.

496
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,300
So you're saying that,

497
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,420
do you think that the Sour Patch Kids are worse

498
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,020
or better than the spung monkeys?

499
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,700
I mean, I think they're equivalent.

500
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,620
They're just kind of like little creepies.

501
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,500
Yeah, they're creepy,

502
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,980
but they're not on the level of these spung monkeys.

503
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,820
They're not.

504
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,640
They're not.

505
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,480
But like.

506
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,300
Yeah.

507
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,140
No, thank you.

508
00:19:59,140 --> 00:19:59,980
I say to these.

509
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,460
Folks, if you know what the Sour Patch Kid,

510
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,580
like little Sour Patch,

511
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,660
CG Sour Patch Kids are.

512
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,900
Why aren't they just Sour Patch Kids?

513
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,740
Yeah, they are,

514
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,020
they are the Sour Patch Kids.

515
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,700
Like the voice we were doing, I feel like.

516
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,540
Did they do that?

517
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,620
Or they're dead silent.

518
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,060
You're the one watching these commercials

519
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,900
for Sour Patch Kids.

520
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,940
You're the one watching programming their advertising candy.

521
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,340
I don't know, I feel like they've seen it before movies

522
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,940
or I've seen it like when A.W.'s on.

523
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,780
I guess you would have seen it when A.W.'s on.

524
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,500
I guess, I mean, maybe I'm not paying attention,

525
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,820
but I'm wondering what you're watching that,

526
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,260
unless it's just completely targeted advertising.

527
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,380
Cause I love Sour Patch Kids.

528
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,980
And the algorithm just knows

529
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,260
that you need to see Sour Patch Kids ads.

530
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,020
But they have to be called Sour Patch Kids.

531
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,660
Why would they be called something else?

532
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,580
They are the Sour Patch Kids.

533
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,700
Exactly.

534
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,420
Well, let's get back, let's get back.

535
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,420
Here's just a rack of gingerbread houses, kits.

536
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,380
You know, you have the peanuts,

537
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,820
which is just kind of like a standard gingerbread.

538
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,580
Wouldn't you think it would be Snoopy's house?

539
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,420
Well, is that-

540
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,260
Like his little dog house?

541
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,740
Is it, it's not his dog house?

542
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,580
I don't think so.

543
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,820
I can see his windows and there's a chimney

544
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,900
and Snoopy does not have a chimney on his dog house.

545
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,580
No, maybe he has at one point in time.

546
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,940
Yeah, but then there's not as much fun.

547
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,220
I mean, I guess, yeah, it should just be his dog house.

548
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,380
But there's a chance that that's just some generic thing

549
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,860
that they slapped the peanuts logo on.

550
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,980
Yeah, exactly.

551
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,140
So it's a bunch of bullshit.

552
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,780
Here's some other treats.

553
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,660
These are like just like larger candy and cookies.

554
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,300
Jason is just showing me a photo of like Twizzlers

555
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,420
at the checkout line.

556
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,380
I'm just, I'm just painting a picture.

557
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,340
Wait, did you say heightening?

558
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,180
I'm heightening.

559
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,380
We're starting low.

560
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,460
But this is D heightening,

561
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,140
showing me that you can buy a little like a personal bag

562
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,700
of chips ahoy by the-

563
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,540
Yeah.

564
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,380
Okay, all right.

565
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,380
Okay, here's kind of knickknack gifts.

566
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,340
It's a coffee mug that looks like a full pot of coffee.

567
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,740
Okay, is there a fire hydrant right there?

568
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,700
I, this, I believe you fill it with beer

569
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,580
and then you can dispense your own beer.

570
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,340
I don't know why you- Out of a fire hydrant?

571
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,180
Do that.

572
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,980
I think it's just a dispenser.

573
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,620
It looks like a fire hydrant to me.

574
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,460
What does that look like?

575
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,460
It says tap room.

576
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,300
Can you see it?

577
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,140
Well, that looks like a crystal skull to me.

578
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,500
It is a crystal skull whiskey tumbler.

579
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,100
Okay, if you didn't buy any of this.

580
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,940
That looks like a fire hydrant full of beer.

581
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,980
There's the beverage blaster.

582
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,540
You can put beer or liquor in this gun.

583
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,540
It's a gun.

584
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,380
It's a gun.

585
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,220
It shoots beverages.

586
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,300
That's right.

587
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,380
Okay.

588
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,220
Okay.

589
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,940
These are tall like,

590
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,580
tall nightmare before Christmas cocktail glasses.

591
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,380
Okay, let me take stock of what we got here.

592
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,220
Yeah.

593
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,060
Okay.

594
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,060
This all seems pretty normal to me.

595
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,980
Except for maybe,

596
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,260
I mean, the weirdest thing that we've talked about

597
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,700
so far is spung monkeys.

598
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,220
And that's not involved in this spirit.

599
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,060
Right.

600
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,900
A spirit Christmas.

601
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,900
It's all about to change.

602
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,380
Okay. Right here.

603
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,220
Okay.

604
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,060
But we're not even in part three.

605
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:55,740
So these are kind of a ghoulish Christmas ornaments.

606
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,860
Okay, okay.

607
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,380
So spirit is taking the spirit of what they do,

608
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,460
which is Halloween.

609
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,300
Exactly.

610
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,180
And they're infusing it into Christmas.

611
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,180
So you're showing me holiday ornaments,

612
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,420
gingerbread man.

613
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,660
He looks like he's been tortured.

614
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,500
A piece of his brain is coming out.

615
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,860
Yeah, kind of a zombie.

616
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,900
There's a skull and crossbones,

617
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,180
but the bones are candy canes.

618
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,020
Right.

619
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,820
So, I mean, it reminds me a little bit of like Shrek

620
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,660
when the gingerbread man is being tortured.

621
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,780
Like there's precedent for torturing a gingerbread man.

622
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,620
There's a Santa.

623
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,860
And what is he saying there?

624
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,060
I believe he is saying-

625
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,700
Hold on, I gotta look closer.

626
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,180
It says, fuck around and find out.

627
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,020
That's right.

628
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,340
And that's how we get into part three.

629
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,100
Christmas laughs.

630
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,940
Christmas laughs?

631
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,340
This is the meat of the game.

632
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,180
Okay, okay, okay.

633
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,340
This is the meat of the thing.

634
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,380
So now we get into bawdy Christmas sweaters.

635
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,060
Oh, because, oh, you said this.

636
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,340
You said Spencer's Gifts is the owner of spirit.

637
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,180
Yes, Spencer's Gifts is the parent company.

638
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,100
And if you don't know, folks,

639
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,620
if you're not a human being that's around our age,

640
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,700
Spencer's Gifts is still in malls across America.

641
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,900
Yeah, absolutely.

642
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,060
I've seen a number of people post online,

643
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,020
like the mall I went to as a kid is dying,

644
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,020
except the Spencer's has not moved in 20, 30 years.

645
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,860
And Spencer's, I mean,

646
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,620
I was in a Spencer's fairly recently

647
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,220
and you can buy wild stuff in a Spencer's.

648
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,500
You can buy regular Rick and Morty t-shirts,

649
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,500
but you can buy like lingerie and dildos in a Spencer's.

650
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,140
Like they really, it's still sort of lawless in there

651
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,020
and it's tucked, there's one in the Galleria

652
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,100
over in Glendale.

653
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,100
Right.

654
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,060
But they are an outrageous store

655
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,620
and they are getting away with it still in 2024.

656
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,460
That's right.

657
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,780
And they're even more outrageous at spirit Christmas.

658
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,060
Okay, so you're showing me these sweaters

659
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,260
and it's Santa on a like traditional looking

660
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,540
Christmas sweater.

661
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,900
And it just says, ho, ho, holy shit, I need a beer.

662
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,460
And next to that is another sweater.

663
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,860
And now these are kind of takes

664
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,260
on the ugly Christmas sweater trend.

665
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,420
And it's a bunch of red solo cops set up for beer pong.

666
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,100
And it says, just here to get my balls wet.

667
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:11,100
So it's, you're playing, it's not a beer pong.

668
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,060
You're playing beer pong.

669
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,540
That's how it looks.

670
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,700
And then this is just here to get my balls wet.

671
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,140
Now, who is buying these?

672
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,100
I don't know, but it gets worse.

673
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,260
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

674
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,100
You're going too fast.

675
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,780
Slow down, partner, you ain't racing yet.

676
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,980
Yeah.

677
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,700
Let's see, do you know how,

678
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,980
well, first of all, I think they light up.

679
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,820
Oh yes.

680
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,900
A number of these have tags in the corner

681
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,020
that say light up.

682
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,300
So you've got an electrical current running

683
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,860
through your shitty Christmas sweater.

684
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,700
And how, do you know how much these are?

685
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,860
Did you check this price?

686
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,140
I think they're anywhere from like $30 and up.

687
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,180
Okay, $30 is not so bad.

688
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,380
I mean, I would say $50 for an unwearable sweater

689
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,860
is too much.

690
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,980
$30, okay.

691
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,700
But even just analyzing, where do you wear this?

692
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,620
I think you wear it to one party a season.

693
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,740
What party?

694
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,700
Like a boozy body party.

695
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,020
I guess if you're with the boys,

696
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,820
if you're with the fellas, then you can wear this.

697
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,980
Well, you gotta have something for the ladies,

698
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,620
like too pretty for coal.

699
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,220
Too pretty for coal, is it in coal?

700
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,700
It's a little vest.

701
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,540
Okay.

702
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,420
It's a little brown and pink vest.

703
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,420
What the fuck does that mean?

704
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,260
What does that mean?

705
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,340
Like, I'm too pretty, you can't give me coal,

706
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,820
even if I've been naughty.

707
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,060
So the adult woman has been naughty,

708
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:43,660
but she's like kind of maybe making goo goo eyes at Santa.

709
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,500
Yeah.

710
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,020
And saying, Santa, you don't give me coal

711
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,540
because I'm too pretty for coal.

712
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,500
I'm too pretty for coal and I'm black out drunk

713
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,100
like everyone else at this party.

714
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,940
Uh-huh.

715
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,500
Okay, well again, what part, like what party,

716
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,780
I guess this is-

717
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,980
This is an official office party.

718
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,420
I was gonna say, this is at least,

719
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,260
this isn't, this is no obscenity in it.

720
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,540
This is pretty clean.

721
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,140
Yeah, so I guess that's okay.

722
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,660
I just mean like, listeners,

723
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,820
do you have a Christmas party or a holiday party

724
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,660
you go to where like your uncle is wearing

725
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,980
an obscene sweater?

726
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,780
Yeah, this is, you know what,

727
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,540
I think that's a big market,

728
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:23,540
is the uncles wearing bawdy Christmas sweaters.

729
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,940
Kind of like, or these I guess would be the aunts,

730
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:31,940
the tiny vest sweaters that say Santa's little hoe.

731
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,940
You didn't buy anything from this place?

732
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,700
Come on, you didn't buy a Santa's little hoe?

733
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,820
I'm sorry, it's Santa's favorite hoe.

734
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,900
Santa's favorite hoe.

735
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,980
And the other sweater, which has mittens on it-

736
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,820
Oh my gosh.

737
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,180
On the chest that says tits the season.

738
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,020
Okay, let me take a look.

739
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,780
Tits the season, okay.

740
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:57,580
Who is buying this?

741
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,820
I just like, again, first of all,

742
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,180
cause I have like one,

743
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,100
I have a Ninja Turtle sweatshirt.

744
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,300
Pretty fun.

745
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,620
It's Christmas, they're like decorating a tree.

746
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,660
I wear it once a year.

747
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,500
Yeah.

748
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,100
Okay, but I could wear that to most functions.

749
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,700
This is such a limited amount of places you could wear.

750
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,380
I mean, if there was a bachelorette party

751
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,420
maybe happening during Christmas time,

752
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,260
this would be perfect for it.

753
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,100
A seasonal bachelorette party.

754
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,820
A seasonal, which I don't know if that exists,

755
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,260
but that seems like that might be some fun.

756
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,340
If you're maybe getting married in February

757
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,460
and you want to go to Vegas in December

758
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,140
and you just want to proclaim that,

759
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,180
hey, guess what?

760
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,020
Hey.

761
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,900
I'm Santa's favorite hoe.

762
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:42,580
The F1 Vegas Grand Prix is going on as we record this.

763
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,940
You could wear this.

764
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,780
You could wear these.

765
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,020
It's going to be a little brisk

766
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,100
and it's stuff that's already decorated for Christmas.

767
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

768
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,020
And maybe you want to wear this one that says,

769
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,940
stop staring at my package

770
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,500
and it has a little present above the crotch

771
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,060
on the very bottom of the sweater.

772
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,340
So it's like a three, it is not a picture of a package.

773
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:08,900
It is like a little like plush package over your wiener.

774
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,700
Yeah, and similarly next to it

775
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,380
is a sweater that says certified freak

776
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,420
and Santa's got his jacket open

777
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,740
and there's mistletoe on his crotch.

778
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:23,060
Which would just be on someone's belly.

779
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,740
So the illusion doesn't work as well for that.

780
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,780
Why didn't you buy the certified freak one?

781
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,740
I don't know, I didn't.

782
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,100
I took a small suitcase.

783
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,180
Where would I wear this stuff?

784
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,180
I'm engaged.

785
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:38,420
I don't need to be signaling this sort of thing anymore.

786
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,140
Do you think I was saying that you needed to do this

787
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,140
so you could signal to other women that you were a freak?

788
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:43,980
That's not why I want you to wear it.

789
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,060
That would be my only assumption

790
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,700
that you would wear these things.

791
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,620
This seems like it would be worn at the one college party

792
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:56,260
before or after finals and then it would get destroyed.

793
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,980
Like this all seems like body.

794
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,660
Destroyed because the women would be coming on

795
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,660
so strong to you, they would tear the clothing off.

796
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,460
Well, because I feel like Keystone Light

797
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,500
just burns through fabric.

798
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,340
Certified freak, hold on, hold on, hold on.

799
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:13,020
So I'm guessing these are all around 30, $40.

800
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,540
Stop staring at my package.

801
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,060
Oh, okay, set the scene.

802
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,460
How many people are in the spirit Christmas with you?

803
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:25,460
I would say 10, including three of me and the employees.

804
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,660
Three of me is funny what you're saying.

805
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,100
Three of us.

806
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,380
And there's, okay, so Santa's also hitting the dab.

807
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,060
He's throwing up a dab, right?

808
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,620
He's kind of like, yeah, sort of doing that.

809
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:43,620
I think it's certified freak seven days a week,

810
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,900
wet and gushy.

811
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,260
It's the radio edit.

812
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,860
Oh yeah, wet and gushy, yeah, yeah, I'm familiar.

813
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,700
I think I've said that on the show before.

814
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,460
Do you think that certified freak is,

815
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,020
let's say, look, hypothetical, you're back on the market.

816
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,220
Certified freak, is that really,

817
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,500
would you wear that out to a bar, to a function

818
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,140
with the Santa, with the mistletoe?

819
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,500
I mean, you're not a super young man anymore.

820
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,740
No.

821
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,580
No offense.

822
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,420
He also has, no, none taken.

823
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,420
He has like red wave hair style laces on.

824
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,300
So, you know, he's ready to party.

825
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,940
Yeah, but what age are you,

826
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,220
what's the age you would wear this?

827
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,180
At 19?

828
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,620
You would have worn this at 19, you think?

829
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,460
Maybe 20.

830
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,940
Okay.

831
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,020
If this was like 20 or $15.

832
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,900
Again, I think these are all closer to 50

833
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,820
because they light up.

834
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,180
There's an electrical current going through them.

835
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,180
Okay, interesting.

836
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,980
Siri wants to get in on this.

837
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,900
I mean, these are gag Christmas gifts.

838
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,500
The store is mostly gag Christmas gifts

839
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,100
and then some legitimate lights and stock.

840
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,860
Can I say, are there vibrators in the store?

841
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,180
There are no vibrators,

842
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:06,460
but you could get your photo with Santa after Black Friday.

843
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,900
They were set up for Santa and he was there at the opening,

844
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,940
but he was not there when we were there.

845
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,420
Okay, but regular Santa, not like horny or drunk Santa.

846
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,980
No, I don't think he's drunk and horny

847
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,300
and I don't know that he's going to harass you,

848
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,260
but it would be on game.

849
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,100
Right.

850
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:28,100
With this, a good quarter of the store was body sweaters.

851
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,780
Obviously, of course, there's more.

852
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,620
There better be.

853
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,980
So let's examine.

854
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,260
These ones are very special.

855
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,300
One says, hold my beer.

856
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,500
The other says, ho, ho, hold my beer.

857
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,620
Ho, ho, hold my beer.

858
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,260
The other says, full of holiday beer.

859
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,540
And if you notice,

860
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,860
they have koozies around the waist of the sweater.

861
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,700
Okay, like four.

862
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,500
Like the bottom of the sweater, like four.

863
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,700
So you're going to have some brews.

864
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,540
Yeah.

865
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,820
You can have some high-lifes

866
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,060
and you don't have to go back to the cooler.

867
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,060
Yeah, you could put,

868
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,220
oh, you could put like figures in there or something.

869
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,820
You could put like, you could hold things too.

870
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,020
So I guess, yeah, like they're,

871
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,580
yeah, it's almost like the Ninja Turtles,

872
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,820
like weapon holsters.

873
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,740
Yeah, Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, Rafael.

874
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:17,780
And then Sue, Reed, Johnny, and Ben, the Fantastic Four.

875
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,340
You could just put them in there.

876
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,180
Yes, that's true.

877
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,940
You can, these are like, I can see,

878
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,180
I can see people wearing this at the holiday function.

879
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,940
Again, the uncle thinks he's being funny here.

880
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,780
Ho, and like no one mentions it.

881
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,620
Everyone's like, oh, it's a little weird, but okay.

882
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,300
Should we talk to him about, every year we're like,

883
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,540
should we talk to him about it?

884
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,380
No, no.

885
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,220
Right, it's a whole big thing.

886
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:42,340
But yeah, so I get, this is a little bit more

887
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,540
I don't want to say normal, but there's a little more normal

888
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,420
for what you would expect at this.

889
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:54,420
Okay, so I, I'm just kind of.

890
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,620
You weren't expecting this, huh?

891
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,820
Well, I wasn't, no, I was not,

892
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,740
I didn't know we were going into body territory.

893
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,660
That's not why I didn't expect that, you're right.

894
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,220
No, just wait until we get to the details.

895
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,900
Oh my God.

896
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,700
But first, horny and lit.

897
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,540
Oh my God.

898
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,380
There's a sweater.

899
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,900
There's a sweater that says horny and lit.

900
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,260
And there's a picture of a reindeer

901
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,020
with like a three-dimensional antler situation going on.

902
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,500
He's kind of embossed.

903
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,420
He's kind of, or embroidered, he's kind of raised

904
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,740
and there's some fake lights.

905
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,580
He's very raised.

906
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,500
He's very raised.

907
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,900
He looks like a stuffy that's been merged

908
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,740
with the Christmas sweater.

909
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,420
It looks like there's a pound of antler on this sweater.

910
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,340
Yeah.

911
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,340
Man, we really, this should be, yeah,

912
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,660
we need to release the full keynote for people.

913
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,180
Horny and lit.

914
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,940
Again, this is a sweater, if it was reasonably prior.

915
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,220
I'm gonna look for this.

916
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:49,340
I want you to wear this if I can find it online.

917
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,740
Cause I looked up Spirit Christmas

918
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,700
and there's none in the area.

919
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,700
There's none in California.

920
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,660
No.

921
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,700
If you would like to visit a Spirit Christmas,

922
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,260
here are the locations.

923
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,660

Marlton, New Jersey, Maze Landing, New Jersey.

926
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,980
That was when we went to.

927
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,980
Woodbridge, New Jersey, Albany, New York,

928
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,620

00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,540
I'm gonna send your dad $30 in the mail

931
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,420
and I'm gonna tell him.

932
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,980
That's gonna buy two tea towels.

933
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:28,580
Go to Spirit Christmas and ship me

934
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,620
a horny and lit sweater for Jason.

935
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,420
Please.

936
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,540
Merry Christmas, Michael.

937
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,140
Love, Michael.

938
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,100
I wanna celebrate Jason and Jane's engagement.

939
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,940
Right.

940
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,660
I want a horny and lit sweater.

941
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,260
Horny and lit sweater.

942
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,100
Yeah.

943
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,620
That you're holding it, right?

944
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,460
That looks small.

945
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,380
That's not for like a child, is it?

946
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,820
No, no, no, no.

947
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,420
I think Jane is holding that.

948
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,260
So, yeah, I don't know.

949
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,220
The sizes were kind of all over the place.

950
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,980
Here's another one.

951
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:07,260
This says North Pole Dancer.

952
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,860
And it has a reindeer pole dancing on a candy cane

953
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,820
and the reindeer has a little bit of lipstick on it.

954
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,740
Hold on here.

955
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,580
Hold on, right.

956
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,860
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

957
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,700
Yeah.

958
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,140
Let me examine this.

959
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,140
Yeah.

960
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,180
Okay, this is, yeah, it's a regular looking pattern

961
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,060
for a Christmas sweater.

962
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,900
But it says North Pole Dancer.

963
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,180
Okay.

964
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,020
So,

965
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,540
the reindeer, why is it a reindeer

966
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,180
and why isn't the reindeer like sexed up?

967
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,460
I don't know.

968
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,380
Do you know what I'm saying?

969
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,220
Yeah, I do know what you're saying.

970
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,780
This looks like a regular normal reindeer.

971
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,260
Say regular Reagan bass cartoon reindeer.

972
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,100
Right.

973
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,260
That is like hanging off a big candy cane,

974
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,100
as Jason said, with like a little lipstick.

975
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,620
So they've taken like a normal reindeer

976
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,940
and glued it to a candy cane.

977
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,500
And I don't know if this part of the reindeer

978
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,740
under the head is supposed to be like a chest.

979
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,260
I thought that would just be a normal rib cage

980
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,100
for a reindeer.

981
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,940
It doesn't look like-

982
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,140
It doesn't look like erotic in any fashion.

983
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,220
Oh, I see what you're saying.

984
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,020
Maybe they thought they were gonna make

985
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,460
the reindeer have like human bosom.

986
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,460
Yeah, this one feels like a miss.

987
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,020
Like the word play is there.

988
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,380
Everything else was a hit, but this is a miss.

989
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,140
Everything else was a hit.

990
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,500
So, and there's like, they're not in a strip club

991
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,540
looking place.

992
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,660
This just, this looks like animal torture

993
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,260
out at the North Pole.

994
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,500
Well, it looks like the reindeer

995
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,940
is enjoying themselves a bit.

996
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,980
I can't tell that that candy cane is like room temper,

997
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,980
like icy cold.

998
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,860
Well, it would be out in the elements.

999
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,700
I assume it would be cold.

1000
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,780
I would think so, yeah.

1001
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,340
There are snowflakes all around.

1002
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,300
This sucks.

1003
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,420
Yeah, this one's pretty-

1004
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,260
This sucks.

1005
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,420
At least like, now I'm not mad.

1006
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,420
I'm not offended by it.

1007
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,020
I'm just saying if you're gonna make this joke,

1008
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,900
quote unquote, like give me a full on

1009
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,660
anthropomorphic hot reindeer woman

1010
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,260
who's half reindeer, half woman, okay?

1011
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,900
And she's gotta be hot.

1012
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,420
Like a creature.

1013
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,260
Yes.

1014
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,220
Like a hot creature.

1015
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,660
Yes, she has to be a hot creature.

1016
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,380
And again, I don't want this.

1017
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,780
I'm not making the demands because I need to see this.

1018
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,500
You're just giving constructive criticism.

1019
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,180
I'm a creative.

1020
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,900
I was gonna call myself a young creative just now.

1021
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,340
That's not necessarily true, but a mid-

1022
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,580
I think you're still very young.

1023
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,140
You're wearing a backwards trucker cap.

1024
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:40,980
Thank you.

1025
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,380
What says Margaritaville on the other side?

1026
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,220
Nice.

1027
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,620
I'm just saying I'm giving constructive criticism

1028
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,220
that if you're gonna give this shirt,

1029
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,420
it's just not fulfilling the promise of the premise.

1030
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,260
Yeah.

1031
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,100
It's confusing.

1032
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,180
And I don't like it.

1033
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,020
Let me see what the back side is.

1034
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,860
And it makes me feel sad for that reindeer.

1035
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,460
And I don't want, I want that reindeer to be empowered.

1036
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,500
Go back to the other slide.

1037
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,420
We're not done talking about this.

1038
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:08,620
I want a human reindeer hybrid woman

1039
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,020
who looks like she's having a ball,

1040
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,020
not this actual real life reindeer

1041
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,860
that is being forced to be glued to a candy cane.

1042
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,020
What was that movie like 10 years ago

1043
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:24,020
with the like lab creature, not slither,

1044
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:28,420
it was like a lab creature, but it was kind of horny.

1045
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,340
Do you remember this?

1046
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,980
It was like a monster movie.

1047
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,980
It was like a horror sci-fi movie.

1048
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,140
Or wait, Shape of Water is the Guillermo del Toro movie.

1049
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,860
No, Way of Water is erotic in many different ways.

1050
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,740
Well, Shape of Water is too.

1051
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,020
It's a horny-ish, some horny stuff in there.

1052
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,420
I mean, it's a little more, I don't know,

1053
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,020
innocent love in some ways.

1054
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,860
It is.

1055
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,500
They do fornicate.

1056
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,340
What's her name?

1057
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,580
Sally, what's her name?

1058
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,780
She fornicates with a fish man.

1059
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,260
Oh, in the way, in the Shape of Water.

1060
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,660
Shape of Water, Way of Water.

1061
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,500
Sally Hawkins.

1062
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,820
Sally Hawkins, thank you.

1063
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,660
Yeah.

1064
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,860
Yeah, so this one, this offends me the most

1065
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,180
as a young creative.

1066
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,100
Yeah.

1067
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,220
As somebody who would come up with a premise

1068
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,740
and then try to fulfill it.

1069
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,180
Well, we're gonna reset on the next couple,

1070
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,540
which are more like goofy uncle.

1071
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,100
Okay, okay.

1072
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:20,940
Sweaters.

1073
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,780
Got it.

1074
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,540
And before we get into a confusing territory.

1075
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,220
So, gangsta rapper.

1076
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,740
Rapper with a W.

1077
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,180
And it's Santa with some Christmas gifts.

1078
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,020
Yes.

1079
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,620
And he's throwing up a sign.

1080
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,460
Uh-huh.

1081
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,100
So this is like,

1082
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,820
this is like, you know, acoustic covers of rap songs.

1083
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,020
It's like, oh, it's a little.

1084
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,220
This is the dynamite hack of shirts.

1085
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,340
The, what?

1086
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,580
Dynamite hack did the Boys in the Hood cover.

1087
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,060
Yes.

1088
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:52,900
20 years ago.

1089
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,740
Yeah, yeah.

1090
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,580
That was on the radio in Chicago.

1091
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,940
It's like a me first in the gimme gimme.

1092
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,140
It's kind of like, ah, it's a funny swing cover

1093
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,140
or Scott cover.

1094
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,860
So you're saying this isn't the most cutting edge of ideas.

1095
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:09,740
No, but it's probably so far the least unpleasant

1096
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,580
of the sweaters.

1097
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,420
Really, you think?

1098
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,460
I think the least of like,

1099
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,420
oh, people would laugh at this word.

1100
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,660
Oh, ha ha, isn't that clever?

1101
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,500
You think you're showing up

1102
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,420
and you're getting a couple of chuckles with this thing?

1103
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,820
Yeah, with your aunts who's a little more like,

1104
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,660
oh, I get it.

1105
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,540
I was young not too long ago, you know.

1106
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:30,180
You're saying that gangsta rap has been around so long now

1107
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,020
that everyone can enjoy a little chuckle or two.

1108
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,180
Everyone can enjoy a little chuckle at this.

1109
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,940
I will say, at least as premise wise, I understand it.

1110
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,060
It's similar and the picture makes sense

1111
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,300
to what they're going for.

1112
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,180
Yeah, now this one's a little bawdy in a different way.

1113
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,860
This is a bunch of weed leaves,

1114
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:51,300
it's a bunch of marijuana leaves on it

1115
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,140
and it says, Santa has your stash.

1116
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:59,780
Okay, so Santa is stealing your weed?

1117
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,340
Or bringing you weed.

1118
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,140
Oh.

1119
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,220
You thought he was stealing your stash?

1120
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,420
Well, why would he, your, Santa?

1121
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,100
For like a gift.

1122
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,380
I know, but Santa has your stash,

1123
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,300
Santa's gifting you a stash.

1124
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,420
Why would it be Santa has your stash?

1125
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:23,260
Well, Santa brings items, he doesn't take items

1126
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,660
besides milk and cookies and carrots.

1127
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,980
That's what I thought.

1128
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,820
Okay.

1129
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,900
Yes, that's my understanding is that he brings you stuff,

1130
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,900
but this is confusing to me.

1131
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,900
Santa has your stash, it just means like,

1132
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,540
instead of your normal drug dealer or your dispensary,

1133
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,220
this month Santa is giving you your stash.

1134
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:41,900
Yeah, you have to sit and listen to Santa talk for a while

1135
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,260
about the, oh man, the North Pole's kind of a bummer

1136
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,620
some days, you know, I love the guys,

1137
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,740
but it's a lot of work.

1138
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,180
Well, the guys are the elves?

1139
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1140
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,180
I love the guys, but.

1141
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:59,180
I love my old lady, but I hate December, let me tell you.

1142
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:03,660
I love January, cause then I can put a bathing suit on

1143
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,420
and go to the beach.

1144
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:08,100
We had to make so many nutcrackers this year.

1145
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,100
Who's buying all these?

1146
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,460
Nutcrackers and wooden horses, that's all we make.

1147
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,660
There's like 10, the spirit Christmas stores,

1148
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,940
why do they need so many nutcrackers?

1149
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:19,140
Did not see a ton of nutcrackers, surprisingly.

1150
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,020
That's the perfect gift.

1151
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:25,420
Yeah, I also, I feel like I didn't see too many nut base,

1152
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:28,500
like nutcracker sweaters.

1153
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,820
Wouldn't that be a perfect thing,

1154
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,460
like to have an actual nutcracker

1155
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:35,780
that you would crack nuts by the nutcrackers nuts?

1156
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,860
Yeah, or like you'd wear one that says,

1157
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:40,700
don't crack my nuts.

1158
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,820
And he's got, it's like two nuts towards the bottom.

1159
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,740
I'm talking about a practical nutcracker that works,

1160
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,820
but it's not the mouth,

1161
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,660
which is traditionally where you crack nuts

1162
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,500
on a nutcracker.

1163
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,300
You crack it at the crotch, is that what you're saying?

1164
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,140
That's what I'm saying.

1165
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:52,980
Oh, okay.

1166
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,820
Yeah, that could work.

1167
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,940
Or are you crushing his balls?

1168
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,740
That's what it would be.

1169
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:02,020
Oh, like a nutcracker, could it play audio like, oh.

1170
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:04,420
Every time you want a fresh walnut.

1171
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:09,420
So, okay, picture this, Christmas Eve.

1172
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,380
Yeah.

1173
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,580
You want a fresh walnut as you do.

1174
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,500
As Jason Sheridan does.

1175
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,500
Well, I did grow up,

1176
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,500
my grandparents did have a big barrel of fresh nuts.

1177
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,340
What?

1178
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:23,580
For many years, and we had the metal nutcrackers.

1179
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,740
Wait, a big barrel?

1180
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,700
A big barrel of like walnuts,

1181
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,780
probably like three feet,

1182
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,860
and they'd go and buy the uncracked nuts.

1183
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,380
And we would crack them,

1184
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,860
like with the crab cracker kind of handheld cracker.

1185
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,740
So going into your grandparents' house

1186
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:43,500
was like going into a Five Guys

1187
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,700
where there was a big barrel of nuts?

1188
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,620
Kind of, it was a little more elevated than peanuts.

1189
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,140
Peanuts you can do with your hand.

1190
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:54,860
But like walnuts, I guess, hazelnuts.

1191
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,180
Was it a wooden barrel?

1192
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,460
Was a wooden barrel.

1193
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,420
It was three feet tall, full of walnuts?

1194
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,980
It was like two or three feet tall.

1195
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,300
You just go over and grab a few and get a cracker,

1196
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,460
and you'd eat it with your little smokeys

1197
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:09,980
or your broccoli and ranch.

1198
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,500
This is before a Thanksgiving dinner

1199
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,500
or before Christmas dinner or whatever.

1200
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,580
Was there an animal around?

1201
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,620
I feel like an animal would get at those nuts.

1202
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:21,540
Interesting, I feel like the only animals

1203
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,500
around my grandparents,

1204
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,100
I feel like my mom had a bird.

1205
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,260
Did you just say mum-mum?

1206
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,540
Mum-mum and pup-pup were my mothers.

1207
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,580
Have you never revealed

1208
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:31,700
just mum-mum and pup-pup were the?

1209
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,940
Those are pretty common East Coasts.

1210
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,220
Man, I guess Mitch.

1211
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,020
And then my dad's parents,

1212
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,940
we call it grandma and grandpa.

1213
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,620
It's pup-pup?

1214
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:44,420
P-O-P. P-O-P or pup-pup?

1215
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,260
Pup-pup, yeah.

1216
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,020
But you would say pup-pup?

1217
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:47,980
Yeah.

1218
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,940
Pup-pup.

1219
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,580
Pup-pup and mum-mum.

1220
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,900
Pup-pup and mum-mum?

1221
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,620
If you're saying it fast, yeah.

1222
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,500
M-U-M, M-U-M?

1223
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,660
M-O-M, M-O-M.

1224
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,420
So it was pup-pup and my-mum.

1225
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,700
That's how I would say it in Chicago.

1226
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,940
But you're saying, you said pup-pup and mum-mum.

1227
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,380
Pup-pup and my-mum.

1228
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:07,940
You can say it how you say it.

1229
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,620
I'm not trying to shame you for saying it like that.

1230
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,500
I'm just trying to figure out what you think the spelling was.

1231
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,100
I feel like I go back and forth.

1232
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,660
It's like my own last name, Sheridan, Sheridan.

1233
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,340
Sheridan?

1234
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,180
Yeah.

1235
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,220
What have you ever called it, Sheridan?

1236
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,540
Occasionally.

1237
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,380
Really?

1238
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,340
Yeah.

1239
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,060
Should I call you Jason Sheridan?

1240
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:27,740
Sheridan is how I normally say it.

1241
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:29,780
But if I'm trying to say it.

1242
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:32,460
I usually hear you say Sheridan, I feel like.

1243
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,300
Huh?

1244
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,980
I feel like I usually hear you say Jason Sheridan.

1245
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:35,820
Yes.

1246
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,900
If I'm trying to say it to someone on the tele,

1247
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:43,300
like a tele, you know, a pharmacist or a telemarketer.

1248
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,220
Sheridan, because they get it wrong sometimes.

1249
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,540
They write E-E-N and I'm like, no, O-N or E.

1250
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,580
So this is my life.

1251
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,820
Sheridan though.

1252
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,340
Should I call you Jason Sheridan?

1253
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,220
No, unless you're calling me

1254
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:00,180
for like customer service reasons.

1255
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,300
Which maybe I will.

1256
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,140
Okay.

1257
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,900
Hey, I don't know what job I'm gonna get in the future.

1258
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:06,660
Oh, that's fair.

1259
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,140
Okay, okay, okay.

1260
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,540
Hold on, you just hit me with a bunch.

1261
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,180
I was going off into this great comedic premise

1262
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,140
and you just threw me off

1263
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,580
with like a couple nuggets of history

1264
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:19,140
that mum mum and pop pop had a three foot barrel

1265
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:22,220
of walnuts that you would snack from.

1266
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,940
And others stored at tree nuts.

1267
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,380
And other tree nuts that you would snack from

1268
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,820
pre Thanksgiving meal.

1269
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:33,820
And mum mum is M-O-M-O-M but it would be mum mum and pop pop.

1270
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,540
Mum mum and pop pop, I guess.

1271
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,380
Mum mum and pop pop.

1272
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:39,180
Again, you don't have to correct yourself

1273
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,020
if you just call them mum mum.

1274
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,740
I feel like I would say it both ways

1275
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:45,020
if I was just speaking fast, you know.

1276
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:45,860
I like pop pop.

1277
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,300
Certainly as everyone got older,

1278
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,940
as my grandparents got older,

1279
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,220
I don't think they were into cracking real nuts.

1280
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:53,540
What happened to the barrel though?

1281
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,380
Huh?

1282
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,220
What happened to the barrel?

1283
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,060
I am, you know what?

1284
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,780
I've been thinking about that this whole time.

1285
00:47:58,780 --> 00:47:59,620
Thinking about the barrel?

1286
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,900
Thinking about the barrel.

1287
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,820
The other, I'm trying to think of what else

1288
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:03,980
was in that house.

1289
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:08,980
A lot of my uncles were in the services in Korea or Vietnam

1290
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:13,900
and there was a ton of military dress uniforms

1291
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,860
down in an arm war in the basement.

1292
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:16,700
Oh my God.

1293
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,580
And I'm like, what happened to those?

1294
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,420
Were they just paused?

1295
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,740
You never put them on?

1296
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:22,580
Huh?

1297
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:23,420
You never put them on?

1298
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:24,260
I never.

1299
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,260
A lot of jokes about you in the Navy over the years.

1300
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,380
I never did stolen valor.

1301
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,820
Was there a Navy uniform?

1302
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,660
I can't remember.

1303
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,540
I feel like it was Army and Marines.

1304
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,420
But no Navy man's uniform.

1305
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:36,260
No, I'd have to-

1306
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,020
That would explain a lot if you could,

1307
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,820
you were going over there all the time.

1308
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:43,260
That's why you like good ship lollipops so much.

1309
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,060
That's why you're a fan of the classics.

1310
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:45,900
I had said-

1311
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,780
The boogie woogie bugle boy, like the Andrew sisters.

1312
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:51,020
I had said you and Gio and Zach,

1313
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,740
hey, I found this sailor hat.

1314
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,780
We were emptying some boxes today.

1315
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:55,620
Yeah, you thought it was me.

1316
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:56,940
Was this a mic purchase?

1317
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:57,820
I don't think it was.

1318
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:58,660
Yeah.

1319
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:00,580
And so it might've been another sketch

1320
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:03,020
that just didn't stick with me.

1321
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,820
And because I have a captain's hat.

1322
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:09,180
And I was like, yeah, Mike wouldn't derank me.

1323
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,940
Mike wouldn't send me down to sailor.

1324
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:15,900
How many, you were on what's called mod night

1325
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,980
for many years at the UCB theater

1326
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,300
where you would write sketches.

1327
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,140
Yeah.

1328
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,140
So what, six years, you have six years of sketches,

1329
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,620
which is one a month?

1330
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,540
Yeah, one a month.

1331
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,540
Usually we take one month off.

1332
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:31,060
So you have 60 sketches that you've written.

1333
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,580
Probably, yeah, probably.

1334
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,220
And then more that didn't go.

1335
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:37,620
How many sketches involved someone in the Navy?

1336
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,460
I don't know.

1337
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:39,980
For a sailor boy. I wrote a sketch once

1338
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:43,660
about baked Alaska night on a cruise ship.

1339
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:44,500
Okay, that's close.

1340
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,780
But a cruise ship that starts sinking

1341
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:49,860
but the Raiders are still doing the baked Alaska dances.

1342
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:50,700
Wait, what?

1343
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,540
The big, I must've talked about it.

1344
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:53,900
What is an Alaska dance?

1345
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,660
Like when it was on the cruise,

1346
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,380
I went on a cruise in like 1996.

1347
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:02,420
My parents were like, oh, it's baked Alaska night.

1348
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,900
And the waiters came out with trays of baked Alaska

1349
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,100
dancing around with them.

1350
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,100
And you can find videos of this on YouTube.

1351
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,180
I think some cruise lines still do it.

1352
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,740
Other waiters are following behind swinging napkins

1353
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:18,300
and baked Alaska, they're carrying these things around

1354
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,660
and then they put them down on a stand by your table

1355
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,220
and then they light them on fire.

1356
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,060
But they would do a dance.

1357
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:24,900
Is this a thing that-

1358
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,740
They would do a dance, yeah.

1359
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:26,980
But is this just for that cruise

1360
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,620
or is there a baked Alaska dance?

1361
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:31,900
I think, no, I think it's just like a hup, hup, hup.

1362
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,580
Like they're kind of dancing and carrying the trays out.

1363
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,980
But this was just for this cruise

1364
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:40,100
or is this how you traditionally serve a baked Alaska?

1365
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,100
I don't think it's how you traditionally serve

1366
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:43,940
a baked Alaska.

1367
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,260
This is just the fun thing the cruise did.

1368
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:47,100
I think it's a fun thing cruises did.

1369
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,900
My parents had been on cruises before

1370
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,340
and they kind of knew what was up.

1371
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,220
Well, obviously they were like, it's baked Alaska night.

1372
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,060
It's baked Alaska.

1373
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,980
Which again, you're your parent's son.

1374
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:56,820
It's fun.

1375
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:58,500
We were excited about baked Alaska night.

1376
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,060
Well, and we were excited for the midnight buffets.

1377
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,140
I don't know if this is still the thing on the cruise,

1378
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:06,300
but the one night was a buffet

1379
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,180
where you went through one of the big kitchens.

1380
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,460
So you got to pick stuff up

1381
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,700
and see all the prep stations and stuff.

1382
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:16,060
My favorite chocoholic buffet.

1383
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:18,020
So it's all chocolate stuff.

1384
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:21,340
It's chocolate mousse and cookies and cakes.

1385
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,660
So that would be a night on the cruise?

1386
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:23,780
It would be a midnight.

1387
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,780
Every night on the cruise there'd be a different buffet.

1388
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,900
Oh, so the chocolate would be,

1389
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,740
one night would be chocolate at midnight.

1390
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,820
One night would be chocoholic.

1391
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:35,140
One night would just be a standard buffet.

1392
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,740
No, chocoholic was one night.

1393
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:37,860
They were all themed.

1394
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,980
One night would be like seafood night.

1395
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:41,940
Trying to think.

1396
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,580
But wouldn't there be just seafood during the day?

1397
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,420
Yeah, of course.

1398
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:47,180
But wouldn't it be fun to eat a full meal at midnight

1399
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:50,020
and then go to sleep on a rocking boat?

1400
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,260
I mean, it would, but I'm saying like chocoholic,

1401
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,100
okay, I get it.

1402
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,500
They're gonna give you all these chocolate delicacies.

1403
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,980
Everything else so far seems like,

1404
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,220
well, that's not nearly as fun

1405
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:00,300
as chocolate midnight buffet.

1406
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:05,300
You know, I've just watching some cruise ship vlogs lately.

1407
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:10,300
Like there's Guy Fieri branded restaurant on cruise ships.

1408
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,020
There's taco shacks.

1409
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,940
There's food trucks, you know.

1410
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:16,060
Like at midnight you would have a Guy Fieri meal?

1411
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:17,220
Fieri, whatever you pronounce.

1412
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,940
Fieri, I think that's like a quick service.

1413
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:22,660
Like you can go any time that it's open.

1414
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,460
But you also want a lot of cruise ships.

1415
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:28,380
You can get 24 hour room service complimentary.

1416
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,340
Right.

1417
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:32,340
So like, I feel like I'd be eating chicken fingers

1418
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,500
in the room a lot.

1419
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,460
Do you think, what do you think is a better dance?

1420
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:39,060
The hot to go dance or the baked Alaska dance?

1421
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:41,660
I'd love to see a version of the hot to go dance

1422
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:45,100
where they serve the front row of the audience

1423
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:48,220
some baked Alaskans, but it's probably not safe.

1424
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:51,740
Can we get, can you release a song called Baked Alaska

1425
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,620
and you just steal the dance from the cruise ship

1426
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:55,340
and see if we can make it a national phenomenon?

1427
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:58,020
I feel like that right wing guy is gonna sue me.

1428
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,860
Oh, the baby whose name is Baked Alaska?

1429
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:00,980
He's somewhere in Southern California.

1430
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,100
Can we change it?

1431
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,980
Like a B, it's like we take the A out.

1432
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:04,820
You take it back?

1433
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,740
Well, we should take it back.

1434
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:07,740
We take it back.

1435
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:11,780
We use like a Silicon Valley naming

1436
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:14,220
where you just remove the vowels.

1437
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,060
That's what I'm saying, yes.

1438
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:15,900
And you just mush together.

1439
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:16,900
Like it's an app.

1440
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:17,740
Yeah.

1441
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:18,700
Baked Alaska is an app.

1442
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,340
I was about to say that you,

1443
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:22,980
I was gonna set the stage for like Christmas Eve

1444
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,460
where you were looking for a warm walnut

1445
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:30,460
and you went to use a nutcracker that was pants-less

1446
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:34,140
and probably had like a little wooden peen or something.

1447
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,380
And then the section for when you crack the nut

1448
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,700
was under his little wooden peen.

1449
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,020
Excuse me for being vulgar,

1450
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:40,860
but that's what you've introduced in this episode.

1451
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,700
I thought it was gonna be above

1452
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,380
and that way the peen guarantees the nut splits in half.

1453
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:47,220
Wait, what was?

1454
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,220
It bounces off the peen.

1455
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,380
Wait, hold on, hold on.

1456
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:51,220
The place.

1457
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,140
It's a normal nutcracker,

1458
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:55,900
but it's got a peen to make sure it breaks even.

1459
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,940
Like it falls down.

1460
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,500
Well, in my mind, the peen,

1461
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,540
if we're talking about the peen,

1462
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,420
is the part that breaks the nut.

1463
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,180
So you move the lever back

1464
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,260
and then the peen goes and crushes the balls.

1465
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,820
Oh, instead of a jaw.

1466
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,500
Okay, I see what you're saying.

1467
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,340
Right.

1468
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,100
And then you crack it

1469
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:15,420
and you enjoy your warm walnut on Christmas Eve.

1470
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,780
And you're of course in your,

1471
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:18,740
you're in your,

1472
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,660
I was gonna say your kerchief and your cap,

1473
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,860
but that was what mother and father

1474
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,220
in the night before Christmas wear.

1475
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:29,100
Right, mine or kerchief and I in my cap or whatever.

1476
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,780
That's the line from them.

1477
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:31,620
So you're wearing that,

1478
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:34,140
but you're also enjoying a hot walnut

1479
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,140
from your body nutcracker.

1480
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,860
There has to be a body nutcracker.

1481
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,260
It has to exist.

1482
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:41,700
You could change the picture here.

1483
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,500
I feel like I've seen nude nutcrackers

1484
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,460
at like each town. Dirty nutcracker.

1485
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:47,940
Yeah, dirty nutcrackers.

1486
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,740
Jason Sheridan's dirty nutcracker.

1487
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:54,260
We can market that too, but yeah.

1488
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,260
Dirty nutcracker.

1489
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,060
I'm not seeing an actual,

1490
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,340
I'm seeing like some like mock-up

1491
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:02,340
where like there's an S and M nutcracker.

1492
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,180
Yeah, it's gonna be easy.

1493
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,860
But it's still like the mouth is where you crack it.

1494
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:06,700
I want something where the-

1495
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,900
But how could the mouth be?

1496
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,820
Shouldn't it have a red ballgag?

1497
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,900
Well, there's one that also has a red ballgag.

1498
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:13,740
Oh, okay.

1499
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:15,580
So you wouldn't be able to use that.

1500
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:18,860
But there's gotta be something here, so.

1501
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:20,500
There's gotta be something.

1502
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:25,100
Okay, well, I was hoping to move on from bodying this

1503
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,660
and then I saw what the next pictures are.

1504
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:31,620
Which is a Hooters sweater.

1505
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:35,380
Okay, well, but Hooters is in the scheme of things.

1506
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:37,540
It says all I want for Christmas is Hooters

1507
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,380
and it is the brand Hooters with an owl.

1508
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:40,860
It is officially licensed.

1509
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,700
It's got the owl.

1510
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,180
We are back in the territory of like,

1511
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:46,980
who's wearing this at what party?

1512
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,340
And who's still going to Hooters

1513
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:53,740
in enough that there are two sweaters.

1514
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:55,380
The last time I went to a Hooters,

1515
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:57,940
I went to the bathroom at a Hooters,

1516
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:59,900
not to like pervert.

1517
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:00,940
I literally, it was just,

1518
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,540
there used to be one at the Burbank mall.

1519
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,620
Yeah, next to the sushi place

1520
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:08,220
and this was all built into a parking garage.

1521
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:11,540
Yes, and then it's not, the Hooters is no longer there.

1522
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:14,260
But I, the last time I was in a Hooters

1523
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,980
was in Schomburg, Illinois.

1524
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,700
Every time I've eaten at a Hooters,

1525
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,380
I've gotten sick.

1526
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:21,780
How many times have you eaten at Hooters?

1527
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:22,700
Twice.

1528
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:23,540
In your life?

1529
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:24,380
I think so.

1530
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,340
What ages?

1531
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,740
Like 21 and 22.

1532
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:30,580
Yeah.

1533
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:31,420
Something like that.

1534
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:32,380
If I told the story on the show before

1535
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,540
about the high school teacher

1536
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:37,420
who would always take the graduated students out to Hooters.

1537
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:38,460
I don't like that.

1538
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,280
I don't like that.

1539
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,120
Well, you don't.

1540
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,300
I don't know about that.

1541
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,020
Would he take the guys and girls?

1542
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:46,900
No, but he was a guy who we think was fired

1543
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:49,380
for stealing a credit card

1544
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,260
and calling like a phone sex line

1545
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:53,460
or finding a credit card in the high school

1546
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,660
and calling a phone sex line.

1547
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:55,780
But he was also the,

1548
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,660
oh, I've talked about him before in a different context

1549
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:01,500
because he would say creepy stuff about my friend.

1550
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,340
Yes, and I've talked about that.

1551
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,220
Okay, that's what I'm thinking of.

1552
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:08,020
Yes, because we made like a movie in his film class

1553
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,140
and he in front of the class said,

1554
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:10,980
I swear he said like,

1555
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:15,460
you got like a hot chick like blank in the hair

1556
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:17,660
and you're not gonna use her more.

1557
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:18,780
And we were like, uh-huh.

1558
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,180
And we were all like, oh my God, this guy.

1559
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,820
But he would take the students out.

1560
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:23,820
Maybe I did say this to you.

1561
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:27,280
He would invite all the kids out to Hooters afterward

1562
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,420
and he came, oh, shit.

1563
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,660
I'm gonna have to edit this because it's gonna seem,

1564
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,740
well, I don't have to edit.

1565
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:36,500
Basically, he came up to me after,

1566
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,720
like at the high school, like senior brunch.

1567
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,200
I've told this story, I know I have.

1568
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:44,080
And he goes, hey, let's face it guys, blank's name,

1569
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,040
who listens to the show, hello, is hot.

1570
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,000
Okay? My God.

1571
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
And we were all like, and I mean, I already had my like,

1572
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,840
oh, let's see what crazy stuff this guy had.

1573
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,640
That instinct in me at age 18,

1574
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,760
I knew this guy was out of his mind

1575
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,880
and I could probably fire him,

1576
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,160
but her boyfriend slash now husband

1577
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,400
is sitting at the table and I go, hey, Mr. So-and-so,

1578
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,920
that's her boyfriend over there.

1579
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,120
And he goes, well, I wanna shake your hand.

1580
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,360
Yeah, that's awful.

1581
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,200
Yeah, that's really rough.

1582
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,020
And I was like, wait a minute,

1583
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:15,320
then this guy would take the students to Hooters

1584
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,240
and we have a debate among some high school friends of mine

1585
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,600
that one of our friends went to the actual Hooters with him

1586
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,720
and he claims that that did not happen,

1587
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,820
but I believe it did.

1588
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,760
And for comedy's sake, I wanna believe it too,

1589
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,040
but really, yeah, you went with the-

1590
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,240
He never turned down a free meal, you know?

1591
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,280
I don't even know that he was paying,

1592
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,760
but maybe he should.

1593
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,120
There's other guys we know who I like, kind of like,

1594
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,240
maybe did go, but we all were like, he invited us,

1595
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,200
we were like, we are not going to Hooters

1596
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,800
with our creepy high school teacher.

1597
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:45,720
No.

1598
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,040
We do not want to do that.

1599
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,640
But I want it for comedy's sake,

1600
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,120
I wanna believe one of my friends from high school

1601
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,360
did do that.

1602
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:57,080
I want to believe that he went with the pervious teacher,

1603
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,920
out of a bunch of pervy teachers, by the way.

1604
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,000
Yeah, well, we have plenty.

1605
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,960
You would think it would be easy not to be overtly pervy

1606
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:04,960
and teach high school.

1607
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,360
Just keep whatever awful thought you have to yourself.

1608
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:12,440
But apparently, it's impossible for the type of folk,

1609
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,240
older man they let teach high school.

1610
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,920
A friend of mine revealed it once.

1611
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,800
We went to an open mic night to watch,

1612
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,400
I think, as some friends were doing it.

1613
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,840
But then this substitute teacher was also there,

1614
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,400
playing acoustic guitar and singing.

1615
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,240
That's just cool.

1616
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:34,680
And a friend recently was like, yeah, when we graduated,

1617
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,120
he asked for my other friend's phone number.

1618
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,040
And I'm like, that's not cool.

1619
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:43,840
Even if he was 22, that's bizarre.

1620
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,560
That's not okay.

1621
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,360
No, well, have I ever said this?

1622
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,280
One of our student teachers came and watched wrestling

1623
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,120
with us after the school year was over?

1624
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:54,480
That is odd on a number of levels.

1625
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,840
And then we went out in the backyard

1626
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,800
and we were backyard wrestling and he was there.

1627
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:02,800
And then he was like, oh yeah, chop me in wrestling.

1628
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,080
And the funny thing about it was,

1629
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,680
he put his hand up as if he was gonna brace.

1630
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,840
In wrestling, there's a thing called a chop,

1631
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,760
where you would take a guy who basically slaps

1632
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,680
another guy in the chest, or whoever, a performer.

1633
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,960
And it's just a move where you get slapped,

1634
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,040
that's the move, you get hit.

1635
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:23,480
And he put his hand up like he was gonna block it

1636
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,200
or something, or take it, this is how you do it.

1637
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,320
We were just like, this guy sucks at backyard wrestling.

1638
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:32,320
This guy's older, but I go, he's a loser.

1639
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,280
But only because he wouldn't take the hit.

1640
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,120
He wasn't tough enough.

1641
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:35,960
Yeah, I know a lot of those guys.

1642
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,960
So it's like, why are you hanging out with high school?

1643
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,200
Why are you hanging out with the nerdiest crop

1644
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,440
of high school students?

1645
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,880
I understand in hindsight, it is odd

1646
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,040
because there's three or four years apart

1647
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,360
when it comes to 22 and 18.

1648
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:54,040
Yeah, it's really not that much of an age gap.

1649
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,920
But it makes a lot of difference.

1650
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,880
If you just wanna do a LAN party

1651
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:01,840
and play Counter-Strike at the time, that kind of made sense.

1652
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,160
But it doesn't, don't do it.

1653
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,000
Yeah.

1654
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,560
Don't, don't.

1655
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:11,560
Anyway, this sweater vest has the classic Hooters ensemble,

1656
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,720
the Hooters waitress ensemble getup on it.

1657
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,920
Right, so it's almost like you put it on,

1658
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,240
but it's like you're not really wearing the Hooters outfit.

1659
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,760
But the sweater makes it look like you have

1660
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,920
a Mark Weiner style.

1661
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,000
Yeah.

1662
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,240
From Weinerville, of course, from Nickelodeon,

1663
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:30,040
where you would have a human head and a tiny body.

1664
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:34,280
This is like you go to Myrtle Beach or the Wisconsin Dells

1665
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:38,120
and you get the big t-shirt with the Bikini Bee body on it.

1666
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,320
Right, that's a classic.

1667
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,280
Classic.

1668
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,960
Everybody can enjoy that.

1669
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,360
Okay, now we get into funny socks.

1670
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,200
Yeah.

1671
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:51,440
Now these are a little, little small, little harder to read.

1672
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,800
We've got Duck Off.

1673
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,200
Okay, and it's a picture of a cute little duck.

1674
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,520
This isn't even, this isn't even Christmas.

1675
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,640
What is this?

1676
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,400
Again, this is, some of these areas that were like,

1677
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,240
what is that?

1678
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,480
Stocking stuffers.

1679
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,080
This is like a little knock.

1680
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,680
Oh, I see, but nothing Christmas related here.

1681
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:09,920
This is just different stuff.

1682
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:14,160
Yeah, domestic AF, I think that's like a dish towel.

1683
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,400
What is, and then that means what?

1684
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,240
You're like-

1685
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,640
A domestic as fuck, like you're-

1686
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:18,480
I know that, I know that.

1687
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,600
Yeah, you're like doing household stuff.

1688
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,560
I see, you're like kind of like a housewife,

1689
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:26,560
but it's hard, like you're kind of like a harder housewife

1690
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:29,160
or a house husband.

1691
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,640
Yeah, here's one that says go to hell.

1692
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,480
And that's all it says, it just says go to hell.

1693
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,760
It says go to hell and above it, live, laugh, fuck off.

1694
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,280
Why didn't you buy one of these?

1695
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,120
You should have bought something.

1696
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,520
I don't know, I should have bought you back something.

1697
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,040
So this is like for the, yeah, this is for like somebody

1698
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,880
who like does all the chores, but they're kind of cooler.

1699
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:49,840
They're kind of hard.

1700
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,480
Call me, socks that say call me old fashioned

1701
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,920
and has the cocktail on it.

1702
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,680
Okay, okay.

1703
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,320
Eat, sleep, pickle, ball, repeat.

1704
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,600
Well, hold on.

1705
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,440
Yeah.

1706
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,520
Eat, sleep, pickle, ball, repeat.

1707
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,720
So that's just like if you're a big pickle ball player.

1708
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,560
Yeah, which attracts a much older crowd,

1709
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,880
so would probably be a real hit with the boomer.

1710
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,640
I guess, I understand pickle ball sweeping the country.

1711
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,280
I am a little resistant to it.

1712
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,200
I am a tennis player.

1713
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,760
I'm a tennis and then I know pickle ball is very popular

1714
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,480
and it's a smaller court from what I understand.

1715
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,440
Smaller court, a bigger ball.

1716
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,280
Bigger ball.

1717
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,480
Kind of a paddle.

1718
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,920
It seems like bullshit to me, kind of honestly,

1719
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,560
because I'm a tennis guy.

1720
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,360
We have a small ball in a big court.

1721
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,320
That's the way I know how to play.

1722
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,160
I.

1723
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,320
If I'll play pickle ball.

1724
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:41,320
Well, look, we can all pull your challenger level skills.

1725
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,600
I think pickle ball with the smaller court,

1726
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,760
there's a lot less running and stomping

1727
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,000
that needs to be done, so it's easier on the joints,

1728
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,200
but it is still active.

1729
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,640
Yes, it's easier on the joints,

1730
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,240
but come on.

1731
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,440
Here's a sock that says,

1732
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,720
I'm silently correcting your grammar.

1733
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,520
So that's the gift for the like.

1734
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,360
That's a teacher type.

1735
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:04,440
Unpleasant person in your life or teacher.

1736
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,160
Yeah, that's like the English teacher gift.

1737
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:11,160
For the pervy English high school teacher in your life,

1738
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:14,480
get them that and get them like one of the horny shirts.

1739
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,000
Here's one with a dog and it says,

1740
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,280
dogs make me happy, you not so much.

1741
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:26,280
I was at the buds with pot leaves.

1742
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:27,760
I get that.

1743
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,800
I was disneyling yesterday

1744
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,600
and a guy was wearing a shirt that said,

1745
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:36,600
I basically like I work to afford my wife's Disney addiction.

1746
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,640
Okay, yeah.

1747
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:40,480
And I was like, okay,

1748
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,800
and you're wearing that shirt around.

1749
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,360
But you, yeah, that's weird cause he bought that shirt.

1750
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,120
Well, it's possibly get gifted or a gifted.

1751
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:49,960
Yeah.

1752
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:54,040
So let's see what other socks and tea towels.

1753
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,640
Y'all need Jesus.

1754
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:56,480
That sucked.

1755
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,440
Okay.

1756
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:02,440
There's one that says the tiny human stole my sanity.

1757
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:03,640
I don't really get that.

1758
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:04,840
For like a mom, I guess.

1759
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:07,720
Mom or dad, you know, sometimes the kids are a handful.

1760
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:08,560
Sometimes your kid.

1761
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,520
Yep.

1762
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,720
Oh, I should got you those.

1763
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,600
They're purple, your color too.

1764
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:13,440
It is my color.

1765
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,480
Sometimes your kid melts down outside a small world holiday

1766
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,000
and you gotta get out of line.

1767
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:18,820
Sure.

1768
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:20,300
Oh, it's kind of a mess back there.

1769
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:21,140
And the parade was going on.

1770
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:22,140
Trophy husband.

1771
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:24,180
I think that was.

1772
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:25,020
That's cute.

1773
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:26,980
That's a play on of course, trophy wife.

1774
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,220
I'm real, I found them.

1775
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:31,140
Do you feel like you're the trophy husband, right?

1776
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:31,980
You should have gotten those socks.

1777
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:33,220
I guess so.

1778
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,060
You know, you grimaced hard when I said that.

1779
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:37,820
I don't sew in like that much of a catch.

1780
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:38,660
What are you kidding?

1781
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:39,500
Come on.

1782
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,820
All right.

1783
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:41,860
Don't sell yourself short.

1784
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:43,420
Another rack of socks.

1785
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:45,660
I'm realizing in the midst of all these socks,

1786
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:49,380
there was like a bunch of horror figures,

1787
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:52,500
like tiny horror, like they said like

1788
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,660
the world's smallest Chucky doll.

1789
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,060
It was like an inch tall.

1790
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:59,580
And I'm like, that's just a reason for you to charge $9

1791
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:00,900
for an inch of plastic.

1792
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:02,140
Well, look, I'm a figure expert.

1793
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:03,900
So you would need to show me pictures of those.

1794
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,060
But if you have no any of your pictures,

1795
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,140
I'm not gonna be able to assess the value of them.

1796
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:09,780
And if I think they're the right price.

1797
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:13,540
My cat thinks I'm cool, grill master, don't be a dick.

1798
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:14,820
Okay, these are pretty standard.

1799
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:17,340
Yeah, these are all pretty standard novelty socks.

1800
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:20,580
I mean, like my favorite salad is wine.

1801
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:21,420
Do we have any of those?

1802
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:24,140
Some classic sock market city walk style socks?

1803
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:25,380
Bitch, please.

1804
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:26,220
Okay, bitch.

1805
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,700
And you know what I like the bitch, please.

1806
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,900
Yeah, it kind of has a Kodak colors.

1807
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:33,180
Yeah, I like that little rainbow on the bitch, please socks.

1808
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:37,300
Here's a sock covered in lemons and it says, suck it.

1809
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:40,020
I think.

1810
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:43,500
Suck a lemon.

1811
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,340
I mean, I guess suck it is like a derogatory.

1812
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:47,500
This is actually using that.

1813
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:51,260
That's not a, that's using sort of a sexual phrase

1814
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:55,980
in like a go F yourself way, not in a fun sexual way.

1815
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:58,740
Here's some socks that say bless your heart,

1816
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:01,060
kind of the Southern fuck off.

1817
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:03,380
Oh, I see.

1818
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:05,620
Here's another pair with headphones on it that says,

1819
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:07,340
go away, I'm gaming.

1820
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:09,780
Oh, okay.

1821
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:15,780
Here's a tea towel that appears to say kitchen closed.

1822
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:17,620
It's pickleball time.

1823
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:19,780
Wait, what's the point?

1824
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:21,020
Pickleball is very popular.

1825
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:23,980
Mine is very popular, but are there people that like

1826
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:27,340
are so obsessed with a pickleball that they need to like

1827
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:28,820
present it on a tea towel?

1828
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:29,660
I guess so.

1829
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:33,060
I'm sure it's playing on like ESPN three or something.

1830
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:33,900
Maybe.

1831
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:37,740
Bless this shit show of a home.

1832
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:39,140
Bless this shit show of a home.

1833
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:40,380
Okay, all right.

1834
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:43,820
Yeah, there's the rest of the pickleball.

1835
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:45,540
Is the rest of this just the gag gifts

1836
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:47,140
that you would get at City Walk?

1837
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:51,340
Don't make me poison your food, says one towel.

1838
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:54,580
Is that a Phantom Thread licensed towel?

1839
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:55,420
I wish it was.

1840
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,260
No, that would be a bunch of mushrooms.

1841
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:58,100
Oh, right, right, right.

1842
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:58,940
This is just poison.

1843
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:00,660
How much Phantom Thread merchandise would you buy

1844
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:01,500
if it existed?

1845
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:02,740
Oh, I would love. What would you want?

1846
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:04,300
Novelty Phantom Thread.

1847
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:07,420
I would love like the Phantom Thread characters

1848
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,900
drawn like the Beetlejuice cartoon characters,

1849
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,100
like a 90s.

1850
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:14,220
You would want an animated series Phantom Thread.

1851
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:16,460
Yeah. Figure series.

1852
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:20,420
Alma and Woodcock, you know, all the guys.

1853
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:25,180
Could you pitch on Phantom Thread, the animated series?

1854
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:26,420
Well, cause like obviously they'd have to have

1855
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:28,300
further adventures.

1856
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:30,180
Well, he's got a lot of dresses to make.

1857
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:32,260
Right, so they would just get into different antics.

1858
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:33,580
Would it be period?

1859
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:35,900
Would it be the period or would you put them in the 90s?

1860
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:38,100
Would it be like Yo-Yogi?

1861
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:40,500
Where all of a sudden Yogi Bear was wearing 90s clothes

1862
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,100
and there was 3D episodes and it was like rap music.

1863
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:47,460
I think what you're pitching is Phantom Thread Jr.

1864
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:51,620
So like Woodcock Jr., like James Bond Jr.

1865
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:55,780
Yo Phantom Thread or it could be that if you wanted like,

1866
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:59,940
if you wanted a clean way in canon to explain why

1867
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:04,940
Reynolds was in the 90s with, you know, a neon,

1868
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:08,860
a colored clothing, I suppose.

1869
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:11,820
But it would, so yeah, what year does Phantom Thread

1870
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:12,940
take place in?

1871
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,140
I think it's like the 50s, isn't it?

1872
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:16,700
Is it? I thought it was before that.

1873
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:17,540
Is it earlier?

1874
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:18,360
It could be earlier.

1875
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:19,200
Maybe, I can't remember.

1876
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,040
I've seen it once.

1877
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:20,860
Forget it.

1878
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:22,140
There is a New Year's party in it.

1879
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:22,980
Right.

1880
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:23,980
But I forget what year it says.

1881
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:25,380
But they don't even have a television,

1882
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:27,020
I don't think in Phantom Thread, right?

1883
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:28,740
No, I don't think so.

1884
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:33,100
So I think Phantom Thread, new Phantom Thread,

1885
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:33,940
another Phantom Thread.

1886
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:36,060
The New Adventures of Phantom Thread.

1887
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:38,500
The New Adventures of Phantom Thread.

1888
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:42,500
And it's, and it's like, that's the start of the theme.

1889
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,340
And it's a cartoon.

1890
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:44,160
I like that.

1891
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,000
I like, I think we've really stumbled

1892
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,060
on something interesting here.

1893
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:49,580
Hit on a lot of a new intellectual properties today.

1894
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:51,220
What I think is funny that's happened on this episode

1895
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:53,260
a couple of times where I feel like I've thrown on

1896
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:55,020
a very good premise and you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1897
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:55,860
Okay.

1898
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:56,680
Well, enough of that premise.

1899
01:09:56,680 --> 01:10:00,660
I'm just excited by my little slideshow.

1900
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:01,500
I understand.

1901
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,820
I'm trying to split the difference.

1902
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:04,940
I don't want to lose track of these pictures.

1903
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,260
But there'll be like, I'll be like, I'll be like,

1904
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:07,380
okay, here's this, this is funny.

1905
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:08,200
This is funny.

1906
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,040
And you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1907
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,340
But I want to read a tea towel that says like,

1908
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,860
I wish I had wine for dinner or I wish I had wine

1909
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:14,700
for breakfast.

1910
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:16,340
I'm gonna read the tea towel with a bowl of Froot Loops

1911
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:19,060
that says, I can't adult today.

1912
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:19,900
I understand that.

1913
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:20,720
That's still going.

1914
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:21,560
I'm not saying we're not getting to it.

1915
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:22,540
That's still going.

1916
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:24,820
I'm just saying the premises are rich.

1917
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:25,660
I think we're-

1918
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:26,500
These are rich premises.

1919
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:30,860
I think we're both bringing a lot to the table today.

1920
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,380
I didn't say you're not bringing anything to the table.

1921
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:34,380
Don't misunderstand what I'm saying.

1922
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:36,380
Well, as we wrap it up,

1923
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:39,380
we'll be able to revisit some of your favorites.

1924
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:41,340
Hopefully we can.

1925
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:43,260
All right, what else do we have here?

1926
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:48,100
These are all cocktail napkins that are like, body.

1927
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,380
Oh, come all you thirsty.

1928
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:52,340
Okay, does it say, is it C-U-M?

1929
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:53,380
Is it, what is it?

1930
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:55,420
No, it's not that body.

1931
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:57,660
Oh, there's a line they have to draw

1932
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:58,660
at the spirit Christmas.

1933
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:02,140
Have yourself a merry little cocktail.

1934
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,380
But is it regular cocktail or is cocking?

1935
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:07,380
Yeah, no, these aren't, we've gotten away from sweaters.

1936
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:09,220
This isn't body then?

1937
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:10,060
This isn't dirty.

1938
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:12,500
This is just kind of the stocking stuffer contingent.

1939
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:16,300
Here's some gift bags with swearing on them.

1940
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,940
Well, could you wanna read them, please?

1941
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:24,440
Fa la la la la, let's get fucked up.

1942
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:28,100
This one's clean.

1943
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,400
You wouldn't buy one of these.

1944
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,240
Why didn't you buy one of these?

1945
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:34,600
This is exactly what you didn't ask for.

1946
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:37,040
Okay, I guess that's kind of funny.

1947
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,880
No obscenity in that, but it's rude.

1948
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,480
It's beginning to look a lot like fuck this.

1949
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,960
That really seems like you're just making this up

1950
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,840
off the top of your head, but they're there, they're there.

1951
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,240
Merry go fuck yourself.

1952
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,960
Jingle, does any of, okay, let me guess.

1953
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,660
Jingle Bell Rock, fuck you.

1954
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,040
Wrapping is hard.

1955
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:02,680
The 12 days of Christmas, go fuck yourself.

1956
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:08,640
Santa got run over by a cyber truck.

1957
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,760
Go fuck yourself.

1958
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,320
Is that on there?

1959
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,900
No, I'm trying to read this one.

1960
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:15,580
It's really tiny.

1961
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:19,520
Chestnuts roasting on a fucking fire.

1962
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,860
Eat my ass.

1963
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,080
I'm just trying to throw these out here.

1964
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,040
I'm just trying to, I'm gonna guess.

1965
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,500
I'm gonna guess from now on.

1966
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:30,460
Rudolph the red-nosed.

1967
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:31,300
Bitch?

1968
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:32,120
Bitch.

1969
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,860
Rudolph the red-nosed asshole.

1970
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:39,300
Rudolph, some of them, you don't wanna make them too clever.

1971
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,780
You really wanna make them very, very simple.

1972
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:42,620
Right.

1973
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:44,580
Yeah, cause that would be, how many more?

1974
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:48,140
There's only a couple more slides.

1975
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:51,040
Little drummer fucker.

1976
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,820
Little drummer fuck boy.

1977
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:55,100
Oh, too clever though.

1978
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:56,420
Oh, little, oh yeah.

1979
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,780
It's good, but it's too clever.

1980
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:02,740
So that could be a guy wearing like a Speedo

1981
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:07,060
and he has a drum, but he's got those sunglasses

1982
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:10,020
that are just slats from the 2010s.

1983
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:10,860
Yeah.

1984
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:13,700
Like party boy in some gelled hair.

1985
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:16,380
The little drummer boy is like a little fuck boy.

1986
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:17,220
Little fuck boy.

1987
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:18,980
Little drummer boy on F-Boy Island.

1988
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:19,820
You would do that.

1989
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:21,700
You would wear that, I think,

1990
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:22,980
if we could get that mocked up.

1991
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:24,940
That could be under the umbrella.

1992
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:29,940
Matt Massani introduced the idea of big Jason t-shirts.

1993
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:33,540
If we could make these under the same label.

1994
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:38,540
That I think would definitely be big Jason t-shirts.

1995
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:43,260
Old King, when was it?

1996
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:44,500
Whence's loss?

1997
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:49,980
Okay, I found, I was able to zoom in on the one picture.

1998
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:51,780
It's like a gift card holder.

1999
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:54,300
It says, it's got a checkboxes on it.

2000
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:55,980
It says naughty, nice.

2001
01:13:55,980 --> 01:14:00,020
And the one that is checked says, tried my fucking best.

2002
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:04,060
How about this Old King, whence's loss sucks.

2003
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:04,900
Yeah.

2004
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,660
And then he looks like a loser.

2005
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:08,180
What do you, would you know

2006
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:10,860
what Old King, whence's loss looks like?

2007
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:11,860
Would I know that?

2008
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:12,700
Yeah.

2009
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,020
If I saw Old King, whence's loss on the street now,

2010
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:14,940
would I know what he looks like?

2011
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:15,780
No.

2012
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:18,460
But I guess it's just, I'm critiquing now.

2013
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:21,180
I'm like, how would you know a fucked up one?

2014
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:23,580
But it would say old, it would say it on this shirt.

2015
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:25,300
And he looks a little busted.

2016
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:26,140
He looks a lot busted.

2017
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:28,140
Oh, he looks really busted.

2018
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:30,580
Like he has this, like a body sweater on,

2019
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:33,580
but it's so dirty, you can't even read it.

2020
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:35,220
Was there a play on whence's loss?

2021
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,940
Like whence, whence to?

2022
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:39,580
You're going too far.

2023
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:40,420
You're going too far.

2024
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:41,820
I mean, that's too clever.

2025
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:44,220
Old King lost at slots

2026
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:46,220
and he's just sitting at a slot machine.

2027
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:47,060
That's pretty good.

2028
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:48,140
And that's pretty good.

2029
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:49,940
There really was in gambling once,

2030
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:53,540
despite this being 20 minutes outside of Atlantic City.

2031
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:55,500
Right.

2032
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:58,860
Did I already said Santa got run over by a cyber truck?

2033
01:14:58,860 --> 01:14:59,940
Well, that one's good.

2034
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:00,780
I like that.

2035
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:01,820
That one's topical.

2036
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:03,740
You know, Elon would retweet that

2037
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,900
with the like crying emoji.

2038
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:10,580
Maybe he was laughing at those at the UFC event

2039
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:11,820
that he was at with the-

2040
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:12,780
Oh, when he was pretending to laugh

2041
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:14,220
at something to make Trump notice him?

2042
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:16,580
Trump and his potential cabinet members

2043
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:17,940
and Speaker of the House.

2044
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:20,620
Can we, how much do the people who make these come,

2045
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:23,060
like how much do these people make a year

2046
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:25,140
writing shirts like this?

2047
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:29,420
Well, I don't think this is all original spirit Christmas.

2048
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:30,380
No, I understand that.

2049
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:32,340
I'm just saying, is this a correct,

2050
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:33,540
cause we could do this from home.

2051
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:34,780
We did the, we just,

2052
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:37,620
I just shit out a bunch of great ones.

2053
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:38,460
Yeah.

2054
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:40,100
How much did the people that make these,

2055
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:41,500
I mean, I'm serious.

2056
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:42,340
Does anyone know,

2057
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:44,780
does anyone work in this arena?

2058
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:45,820
Does anyone work,

2059
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:50,820
know people that write dirty shirts, dirty socks,

2060
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:54,380
dirty tea towels for a living?

2061
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:56,300
Is it lucrative?

2062
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:58,140
This is sort of like a question,

2063
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:00,580
like movies,

2064
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:04,220
comedies or movies of character living in the city,

2065
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:05,740
they need to have a cool job.

2066
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:07,260
Oh, they write for magazines.

2067
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:09,380
Oh, they write greeting cards.

2068
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:10,220
Right.

2069
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:13,580
Like her, Joaquin Phoenix was a greeting card writer.

2070
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:14,660
Yes, that's right.

2071
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:15,980
But is anyone-

2072
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:17,300
Is anyone writing-

2073
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:18,140
Dirty t-shirts-

2074
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:19,700
Big Johnson-esque-

2075
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:20,540
Right.

2076
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:22,220
Spencer's gift shirts.

2077
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:23,420
Somebody is doing it.

2078
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:25,420
And I want to know who it is.

2079
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:27,460
I want to know the guru,

2080
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:28,620
the like Bruce Valanche of-

2081
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:30,260
Who's the best of the best.

2082
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:31,100
Yeah.

2083
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:31,920
Who's the best of the best.

2084
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:32,760
Cause I think we could do it.

2085
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:33,980
I think we could be up there,

2086
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:34,820
but I don't,

2087
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:36,580
I want to know that the cash is there.

2088
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:38,460
I don't want to give this away anymore for free.

2089
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:39,300
Oh yeah.

2090
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:40,620
If we don't have the cash.

2091
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:42,340
No, do you want to be paid in cash?

2092
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:46,060
Like they just drop a Santa sack of money off?

2093
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,780
I want to be paid in the shirts we create.

2094
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:49,620
I want just a hundred-

2095
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:52,140
You want to be paid in the body shirts.

2096
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:52,980
Yeah.

2097
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,780
Little drummer fuck boy shirts.

2098
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:56,220
I want 500 of them.

2099
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:57,060
Okay.

2100
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:57,980
And then I'm selling them.

2101
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:00,020
I'm selling them out the back of the car.

2102
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:01,220
You know, in the parking lot.

2103
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:04,260
Rudolph the red nose horn dog?

2104
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:05,100
That's good.

2105
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,420
I mean, horn deer.

2106
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:08,380
Horn deer?

2107
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:09,340
Yeah, I guess that's two.

2108
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:10,460
Yeah.

2109
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:11,300
I think I already did.

2110
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:12,140
I said already,

2111
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,380
Rudolph the red old asshole,

2112
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:14,220
I think I said.

2113
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:17,980
Rudolph the red little rain dick.

2114
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:21,580
I don't know, I'm not as good as you.

2115
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:22,860
No, you're doing fine.

2116
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:24,220
You're doing good.

2117
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:26,820
I'd said something about his asshole before I think too.

2118
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:28,620
I threw out a couple ideas,

2119
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:29,540
but I don't know.

2120
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:31,780
Yeah, I think we could do it in a second,

2121
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:33,660
but I want to know,

2122
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:35,300
I want to know who's doing it

2123
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:36,540
and how much money they're making.

2124
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:37,660
Yeah.

2125
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:41,340
Well, as you say that about making money

2126
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:44,500
and like we're weighing all these license properties,

2127
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:47,500
that brings us to the finale of this part

2128
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:50,580
for A Christmas Kiss Good Night.

2129
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:51,420
Okay.

2130
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:54,220
Because this is a Spirit branded store.

2131
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:56,660
This is Spencer's gift to the store.

2132
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:58,980
And walking around that first,

2133
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:00,700
I feel like I was like,

2134
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:04,460
I'm missing one of my friends.

2135
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:07,940
I'm missing one of my beloved characters

2136
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:10,140
whose movies I've never seen.

2137
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:12,340
I'm missing Art the Clown.

2138
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:13,180
Uh-huh.

2139
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:16,180
And thankfully we turned an aisle

2140
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:17,940
and it did not disappoint.

2141
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:21,180
Here is some Christmas Art the Clown sweaters

2142
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:22,620
from Terrifier.

2143
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:25,260
And this is the last Terrifier a Christmas movie?

2144
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:29,620
No, is he in like a Santa suit?

2145
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:31,300
Is it kind of a Christmas movie?

2146
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:32,140
I don't know.

2147
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:34,060
I'm just saying like this would make sense.

2148
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:35,940
I mean, was there a lot of,

2149
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:38,420
you said there's like Chuckies involved in there.

2150
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:40,060
There's a toy of Chuckie,

2151
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:41,580
but does Art have the most presence

2152
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:43,900
of any like horror movie character in this Christmas store?

2153
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:45,260
I think so.

2154
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:49,780
There's a little rack of like NECA or reaction figures,

2155
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:50,620
are they called though?

2156
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:51,460
Like three and four.

2157
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:52,300
Those are super seven makes those.

2158
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:53,140
Super seven.

2159
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:54,420
There were some of those.

2160
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:55,300
Okay.

2161
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:59,980
One is says, a sweater says holidays are terrifying.

2162
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:02,300
And the other sweater says,

2163
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:11,260
the most, it's the most terrifying time of the year.

2164
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:14,860
Now I think Terrifier 3 we're up to.

2165
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:17,100
I think might take place at Christmas.

2166
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:17,940
Okay.

2167
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:18,780
So then it makes sense.

2168
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:19,620
So yes.

2169
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:21,380
I feel like you, you front loaded with body.

2170
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:22,660
I think you should have ended with body.

2171
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:23,860
Cause odd the clown.

2172
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:24,700
Yeah.

2173
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:26,460
I was kind of bringing us in,

2174
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:29,420
like you're finally drifting off to sleep at night.

2175
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:31,740
So Sanic can do all his business.

2176
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:33,820
So you don't believe in a traditional climax

2177
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:35,500
for like a movie or TV show.

2178
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:36,340
Well, I do, but.

2179
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:39,300
You like the climax to happen about halfway through.

2180
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:41,100
Well, I wouldn't say halfway.

2181
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:45,220
I'd say that the body stuff was like the majority of it.

2182
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:46,700
And then right as I was leaving,

2183
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:49,980
I realized they had kind of gift wrapped the stanchions

2184
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:51,940
so that a car doesn't run into you.

2185
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:53,260
Oh, that's nice.

2186
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:54,100
That's nice.

2187
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:55,020
Like a candy cane.

2188
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:56,100
That's cute.

2189
01:19:56,100 --> 01:20:00,500
And so that's when we'll say Merry Christmas to all.

2190
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,940
And to all of fucking good night.

2191
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:04,780
Oh, I should have done that.

2192
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:07,820
Well, I'll update that before we put this somewhere.

2193
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:10,300
A PDF is probably the best version.

2194
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:11,140
Okay.

2195
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:14,860
I don't think this store goes far enough.

2196
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:15,700
Yeah.

2197
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:16,820
I think if you're gonna do it,

2198
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:18,460
you go all the way like a Spencer's.

2199
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:20,380
I think Spirit Halloween.

2200
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:22,220
I mean, Spirit Halloween also anytime I've been in one

2201
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:25,340
doesn't strike me as an extra dirty thing.

2202
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:28,620
I know more I feel like than other Halloween stores.

2203
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:29,460
Maybe.

2204
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:31,420
Do you notice dirty stuff in a Spirit Halloween?

2205
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:35,300
There's like sexy nuns, sexy whatever.

2206
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:37,140
But that's in every Halloween store.

2207
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:39,100
And that's at this point, that's just normal stuff.

2208
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,460
That's just an outfit.

2209
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:44,780
I guess what I would say about this.

2210
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:47,460
Like half the store was dirty sweaters.

2211
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:50,820
And then half was like the big inflatables.

2212
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:52,860
And get your photo with Santa.

2213
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:53,700
Yeah.

2214
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:56,300
And here's a bunch of candy for stocking stuffers.

2215
01:20:56,300 --> 01:21:00,340
And half are like deck the fucking halls you pussy.

2216
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:02,300
Like sweaters.

2217
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:06,060
So maybe it's like half for the parents

2218
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:08,860
and half for like kids don't come over here.

2219
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:12,060
Naughty, naughty.

2220
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:14,020
Mom and dad are getting sweaters to wear

2221
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:17,220
at the unofficial company party at Yard House.

2222
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:18,380
The swingers party.

2223
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:21,500
Well, I did not see any pineapple based.

2224
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,340
Wait, what?

2225
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:23,180
Oh, is that what you-

2226
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:27,580
Upside down pineapple is like a code for swingers.

2227
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:29,380
Where do you put it?

2228
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:32,220
I think people put it at like-

2229
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:33,220
No, I mean, where do you put it?

2230
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:34,340
Where do I put it?

2231
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:35,180
Oh no, just kidding.

2232
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:37,380
Oh, I was just saying, yeah.

2233
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:40,380
I feel like cruise ships, you say it.

2234
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:43,580
This is for guys, a podcast about guys.

2235
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:45,860
I am a mere observer.

2236
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:47,500
When you would be on the cruise ship with your parents,

2237
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,460
would you walk down the hall and see a bunch of pineapples?

2238
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:53,380
I can't say I saw any body activity on the cruise ship.

2239
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:55,220
Okay, but you wouldn't have known what a pineapple meant

2240
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:56,060
when you were a kid.

2241
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:56,900
No, I was 12 years old.

2242
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:57,740
I wouldn't have registered that.

2243
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:00,140
You would have just picked it up off the door and ate it.

2244
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:00,980
You'd be like, oh, free pineapple.

2245
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:03,900
Well, I wouldn't have been afraid of cutting my hand.

2246
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:04,940
Oh, because of the exterior.

2247
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:07,460
Yeah, because the exterior of the pineapple.

2248
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:09,700
But you would wear your pineapple gloves.

2249
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:10,540
Yeah.

2250
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:11,360
To be able to handle it.

2251
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,200
Sure.

2252
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,300
That's like your falconry glove.

2253
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:15,660
To be able to eat a pineapple.

2254
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:17,300
I mean, it would just be my mittens

2255
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,660
picking up a can of dull pineapple

2256
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:22,540
because that's mostly what I knew of pineapple

2257
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:25,580
for the first half of my life, I feel like.

2258
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:26,500
The first half of your life,

2259
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:27,700
you didn't know where a pineapple came from?

2260
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:28,780
No, I knew where it came from.

2261
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:30,420
I just didn't encounter it.

2262
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:32,940
Well, I don't really chop open a pineapple very often.

2263
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:37,940
No, I remember going to Ohana at Polynesian.

2264
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,980
You can buy a drink at the bar there

2265
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:42,540
served in a whole pineapple.

2266
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:43,980
Oh, I've done it.

2267
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:44,900
Yeah, it's really fun.

2268
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:45,740
Yeah, it's great.

2269
01:22:45,740 --> 01:22:47,180
But it didn't cut up my hand.

2270
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:48,020
Huh?

2271
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:48,860
It didn't cut up my hand.

2272
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:49,680
Yeah, it's gonna cut up your hand.

2273
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:50,520
No, it didn't cut up my hand.

2274
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,520
Oh, it didn't, okay.

2275
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,740
They didn't give me gloves to wear.

2276
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:56,740
It's probably three quarters of a cup of liquid.

2277
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:59,480
You're mostly paying for the novelty.

2278
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:00,900
Very much you're paying for the novelty.

2279
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:02,140
But yeah, I don't think,

2280
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:04,380
I don't know if they shave the coconut down,

2281
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:06,340
the pineapple down so you don't cut yourself.

2282
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:07,980
I think they shave it down on the sides,

2283
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:11,060
chop the top off to fill the inside.

2284
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:12,740
Do you think there are a lot of pineapple injuries

2285
01:23:12,740 --> 01:23:14,300
in the United States every year?

2286
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:16,220
I don't know about that.

2287
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:17,340
You don't know anything about that.

2288
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:18,180
I don't know.

2289
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:19,020
That's none of your business.

2290
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:20,580
Anything about, none of my business.

2291
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:23,080
What do you think about Spirit Crestes?

2292
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:25,540
Were you expecting this much body sweaters?

2293
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:26,780
No, I didn't think, again,

2294
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:28,740
I don't think of the Spirit brand as being,

2295
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:30,280
even though, yeah, Spencer's owns it,

2296
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,360
and I never think of that brand

2297
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,480
as being something that's dirty.

2298
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,380
So I was not expecting that.

2299
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:38,420
Now that I've seen it,

2300
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:39,760
I do think it's in the middle

2301
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:42,560
of a regular Christmas store and a Spencer's.

2302
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,120
And I, look, I've been into Spencer's.

2303
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,480
If you go, just go to Spencer's.

2304
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:50,200
I want it to be either wholesome and normal

2305
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,880
or vulgar and sexual.

2306
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:53,800
Yeah.

2307
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:56,040
So I'm kind of, I feel like it's in between

2308
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,360
and that doesn't appeal to me.

2309
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,640
I want the extremes.

2310
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:01,320
I feel like I bought the famous,

2311
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:06,040
the Simpsons poster with all the characters on it there.

2312
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:10,080
But then also, a gaggle of 13-year-olds

2313
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:13,960
would go and laugh at the Boner Pasta box.

2314
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:14,920
Right.

2315
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:15,960
But yeah, I was in,

2316
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:22,160
I was shocked at how Spencer's is still Spencer's.

2317
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:23,040
I am impressed.

2318
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,680
I don't know what the business model is.

2319
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,020
I don't know who's going in there and buying stuff.

2320
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:29,860
But it exists still.

2321
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:31,560
So yeah, spirit Christmas.

2322
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:34,580
I feel like it needs to get more extreme next year.

2323
01:24:34,580 --> 01:24:36,980
I feel like no kids allowed.

2324
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:37,820
No kids allowed.

2325
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:39,580
No kids allowed in spirit Halloween

2326
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:40,420
or spirit Christmas.

2327
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:41,680
I keep saying the wrong thing.

2328
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:44,140
Do you think it could expand nationally?

2329
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:47,460
I feel like that's a pretty narrow part of the country.

2330
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:49,900
It doesn't seem like it would.

2331
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:52,660
What would be the reason?

2332
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:54,500
I mean, people sell Halloween,

2333
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:55,540
but I think the niche,

2334
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:56,900
and somebody correct me if I'm wrong,

2335
01:24:57,780 --> 01:25:01,060
is that there's not a ton of variety

2336
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:02,860
at like Target for Halloween.

2337
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:06,420
They have decorations and they have some costuming

2338
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:09,260
and like CVS has some costuming around Halloween,

2339
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:11,260
but it's not a ton.

2340
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:13,860
And there's probably a gap to be filled

2341
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:15,160
in Halloween stores across the country.

2342
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:16,000
We are in Burbank.

2343
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,500
There's plenty of Halloween stores

2344
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,660
just that exist here year round,

2345
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:21,060
but not across the country.

2346
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:23,800
So I bet that's a very smart business thing to fill.

2347
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,180
But I bet Christmas is,

2348
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:27,900
there's so much more Christmas crap everywhere.

2349
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:29,500
I just think they could probably,

2350
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,820
if they're leasing empty storefronts,

2351
01:25:31,820 --> 01:25:35,180
and this is in a part an area

2352
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:39,080
that's just all strip malls and shopping malls.

2353
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:40,140
I just, I don't know.

2354
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:42,680
I will be interested to see if the market is there for it

2355
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:46,060
and what their identity is as spirit Christmas.

2356
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:48,180
I feel like, well, that's the other thing.

2357
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:51,660
I don't think I was able to get a good picture of like,

2358
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:56,660
this is half of whatever the store used to be.

2359
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:58,940
Maybe it used to be Bed, Bath, and Beyond.

2360
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:01,540
And I don't know if it's gonna open up

2361
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:04,180
for the like full swing of the holiday season

2362
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:07,020
or they're like, this is all we have.

2363
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:09,100
Well, when they had a spirit Halloween

2364
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:10,860
in the old Toys R Us over on Victory

2365
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:12,860
by the Back to the Future Burger King,

2366
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:14,740
which is now in Aldi.

2367
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:17,300
I'm glad Scott's not here to hear all the different stores

2368
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:19,460
that we like to shop in and what they are now.

2369
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:20,820
But they had a spirit Halloween in there

2370
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:22,380
and it was only half the Toys R Us.

2371
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:23,820
And honestly, it creeped me out

2372
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:26,300
because I would go to that Toys R Us on Victory

2373
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,300
and then all of a sudden you're in it and it's empty.

2374
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:30,640
That's one of the scariest like nightmares as a kid.

2375
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:33,020
You go into a store and it's not the store you know.

2376
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:33,860
Oh yeah.

2377
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:36,100
And like this was spirit Halloween in the old Toys R Us

2378
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:37,920
but it was only half set up.

2379
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:40,620
So it was like some of the shelving from the Toys R Us

2380
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:42,940
and like it gave me the creeps being in there.

2381
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:45,540
But it was only, they never expanded it

2382
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:47,380
to finish my thought about what you're saying.

2383
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:51,420
It's sort of like the old Bed Bath and Beyond at Burbank

2384
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:54,940
that was the exhibit of a big Disney auction.

2385
01:26:54,940 --> 01:26:59,520
And now it's a store called Glendale Halloween

2386
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:02,820
but it is located in a Burbank mall.

2387
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:04,020
Yeah.

2388
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:08,620
I'm gonna predict the demise of spirit Christmas

2389
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:09,460
in two years.

2390
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:11,660
I just think if they're getting sweetheart deals

2391
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:15,780
on short-term rental space for Halloween,

2392
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:19,640
I feel like they could flip it in a day or two.

2393
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,300
Yes, you're right.

2394
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:22,140
That's true.

2395
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:23,300
It's a nice transition.

2396
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:26,100
But obviously they're only trying it in a couple places.

2397
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:28,060
They're not doing it at every location.

2398
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:30,940
So that's why I'm thinking who's going in there?

2399
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:32,540
Who is it for?

2400
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:33,380
And we'll see.

2401
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:35,180
I think failure.

2402
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:36,100
I think not happening.

2403
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:39,300
We'll see in two years unless they wanna take our advice

2404
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:43,660
and get dirtier my advice or hire the bad boys

2405
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:45,460
to write some naughty little shirts.

2406
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:48,620
Like a naughty super store.

2407
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:50,540
I want a naughty super store.

2408
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:51,660
Naughty mega store.

2409
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:52,780
Okay.

2410
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:53,620
You know what?

2411
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:54,660
That's even a better idea.

2412
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:57,580
Let's have Target but have it be naughty.

2413
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:59,660
I like Target fine but what if it's naughty?

2414
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:01,780
But no porno, just naughty.

2415
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:06,700
No, no porno but everything on it is naughty.

2416
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:09,980
So it's like wheat bread

2417
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:13,380
but the wheat bread is giving you the middle finger.

2418
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:14,380
Okay.

2419
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:18,660
Yeah and like on the back and it's like the wheat bread

2420
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:21,860
is like the packaging has.

2421
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:22,820
A butt?

2422
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:23,660
A butt on it.

2423
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:24,500
On the back side.

2424
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:27,060
Right and it's pooping.

2425
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:27,980
Oh it's pooping?

2426
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:29,260
Yeah but it's just on the package.

2427
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:30,100
It's regular bread.

2428
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:30,940
So it's gross.

2429
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:33,620
It's not like a sexual butt.

2430
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:35,220
It's not a sexual butt.

2431
01:28:35,220 --> 01:28:38,340
It is a pooping, a functionary butt.

2432
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:39,340
Okay.

2433
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:43,820
So yes, imagine Target but everything's naughty in it.

2434
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:47,220
And I think you put Target right out of business that way.

2435
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:49,340
Out of business entirely.

2436
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:50,340
Well if you do it right.

2437
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:51,420
Okay.

2438
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:52,900
If you do the naughty Target right.

2439
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:53,740
I'm always saying there's.

2440
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:55,460
However it's medicine but it's dirty.

2441
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:56,300
There's a bottle of dirty.

2442
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:58,660
There should be even fewer stores.

2443
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:00,460
Yes, there should be fewer, yes.

2444
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,660
There should be all one store and it should be naughty.

2445
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:03,500
Yeah.

2446
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:05,700
It's vitamins but they're naughty.

2447
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:08,500
Vitamin C and we know what that means.

2448
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:09,540
Vitamin D.

2449
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:13,660
Vitamin D and it just says you know what that means.

2450
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:15,380
Vitamin E.

2451
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:16,420
Vitamin F.

2452
01:29:16,420 --> 01:29:18,100
Vitamin F is cleaner.

2453
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:20,740
Vitamin E also says you know what that means

2454
01:29:20,740 --> 01:29:22,340
but it's not explained.

2455
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:23,180
No.

2456
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:25,100
Because it's like we didn't really think of one for that.

2457
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:28,140
It should be vitamin erection I guess.

2458
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:29,860
That is cleaner than I thought.

2459
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:30,700
That's clean, yeah.

2460
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:32,620
And they all, I mean look, there's one word for everything

2461
01:29:32,620 --> 01:29:33,900
but can you imagine?

2462
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:35,860
You mentioned the laughs.

2463
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:38,300
If the Empire Center replaced the normal Target

2464
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:39,740
with the naughty Target.

2465
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:40,580
Sure.

2466
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:41,400
You'd be hearing laughs every day.

2467
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:42,660
It would be like a low rumble.

2468
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:44,300
People would be going buying their vitamins,

2469
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:45,380
giving a good laugh.

2470
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:48,660
Well, Target already has those giant red balls outside

2471
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:51,620
and I think it'd be pretty easy to paint them blue.

2472
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:53,140
Oh yeah, that's great.

2473
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:54,980
So yeah, and it will be called,

2474
01:29:54,980 --> 01:29:56,940
the store will be called Naughty Target.

2475
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:00,140
So you'll be there, yeah.

2476
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:03,260
So while the retail wars are going on,

2477
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:06,380
you can decide, am I gonna go to Target or Naughty Target?

2478
01:30:06,380 --> 01:30:10,220
Do you think Bullseye should be smoking a big Stoge?

2479
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:13,660
Bullseye should transform into the Dick's Last Resort

2480
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:16,740
character that's a dog named Assbite.

2481
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:17,580
Okay.

2482
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:20,980
So yes, Bullseye will be bawdy.

2483
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:22,580
He's gonna be a lot more.

2484
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:25,060
It sounds like you're trying to make an umbrella

2485
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:28,820
like Marcus Lemotis combining his fashion companies.

2486
01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:32,100
You're bringing Dick's Last Resort and Big Johnson

2487
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:34,860
and Spencer's and Naughty Target.

2488
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:35,700
Yeah.

2489
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:37,620
And this is why you're a visionary.

2490
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:39,580
You're a retail visionary.

2491
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:43,620
Yes, so I mean, look, if Target, the company wants

2492
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:47,820
to market these like McDonald's is doing with Cosmix, fine.

2493
01:30:47,820 --> 01:30:49,620
Hit me up, I'm willing to work with them.

2494
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:52,580
But if not, we're just gonna have to do Naughty Target.

2495
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:55,460
And if we need to change the name Target to like T,

2496
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:59,860
like you're saying, like it's an app, TGRT or whatever,

2497
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:02,780
like to get rid of the vowels, fine, we'll do it.

2498
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:03,620
Okay.

2499
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:06,220
And then the money will roll in.

2500
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:07,940
All right.

2501
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:08,780
And Walmart wants to do it too.

2502
01:31:08,780 --> 01:31:10,540
We could do Naughty Walmart.

2503
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:12,100
I'm not against it. Okay.

2504
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:14,900
You're trying to Naughtify all the stores.

2505
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:17,980
Naughty Coles. Naughty Coles.

2506
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:20,460
We could do Naughty Coles, Naughty JCPenney's,

2507
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:22,860
Naughty Sears, which one do you want?

2508
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:25,420
Do you think if everything was more Naughty,

2509
01:31:25,420 --> 01:31:26,900
you'd feel more comfortable?

2510
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:29,060
Oh, oh.

2511
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:32,100
If all the retail quadrant, all the quadrants.

2512
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:33,380
I would think I would, I actually would know

2513
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:35,180
I would feel more uncomfortable, but I would feel,

2514
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:37,340
I would be rich because that was my idea.

2515
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:38,180
Oh, okay.

2516
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:40,980
So you could just rent out the top floor of a hotel,

2517
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:44,900
like Howard Hughes and just retreat from society.

2518
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:45,740
Finally.

2519
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:50,780
So I, a failure, Spirit Christmas failure

2520
01:31:50,780 --> 01:31:52,580
next year prediction.

2521
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:53,420
Okay, we'll see.

2522
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:54,500
I don't think it's coming back next year.

2523
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:55,620
You don't think it's coming back.

2524
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:57,780
Everything you showed me is completely unremarkable.

2525
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:59,300
Mark this time code.

2526
01:32:00,980 --> 01:32:02,540
Everything you showed me is not exciting.

2527
01:32:02,540 --> 01:32:05,260
I think even to like people that would buy stuff like that

2528
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:07,980
and wear it and offend their relatives.

2529
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:09,140
Okay.

2530
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:10,220
So that's my prediction.

2531
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:12,140
We'll see, we'll see what happens.

2532
01:32:12,140 --> 01:32:14,300
Grandma really didn't like that shirt,

2533
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:15,940
that sweater you wore last year.

2534
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:19,420
So if you could just wear one of the ones she got you,

2535
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:22,020
it would cause a lot less conflict.

2536
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:23,340
What do you mean?

2537
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:27,140
The Santa licks my balls sweater, it's offending her.

2538
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:27,980
Doesn't even make sense.

2539
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:31,060
And then he kicks over the big barrel of walnuts

2540
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:32,380
that grandma has in the house.

2541
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:33,420
Don't you dare.

2542
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:37,340
You need to find that barrel and get it in your apartment.
