1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:10,300
When your town has made you frown, When your square has made you swear,

2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:19,920
When life gives you one more punch, You need a doughnut soaked in Captain Grunge,

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:29,540
You need a place, a place to stroll with alcohol, A place that features part of the Berlin Wall,

4
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:37,540
Where steampunk robots sell chocolate snacks, A place where you can tattoo your lower back,

5
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:47,520
So let's go take a walk, let's all go to City Walk Orlando tonight, tonight.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,260
Podcast The Ride presents the City Walk Orlando Saga, Multiverse of Madness, a daily,

7
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:03,480
extremely necessary series, exploring the shops, restaurants, and cosmic wonder that make up Universal

8
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,360
City Walk Orlando.

9
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,340
Welcome to the first ever saga episode on Club 3.

10
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,100
Club 3, a new invention

11
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,180
since sagas, yes, since the dawn of sagas.

12
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,720
We podcast scientists invented Club 3, but not

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,100
only for this new saga, was it available.

14
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,720
It really is history, I would say, and you know,

15
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,880
we start these things casually, we don't always introduce ourselves, but we have to introduce

16
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:40,720
a special guest who you know we had to bring to visit the Club 3, the VIP supporters of this show,

17
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,720
Sector Keeper in the building.

18
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,240
Boys, boys, Club 3, let me hear you in the balcony.

19
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,800
Wow, he's revving the crowd up.

20
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,200
I love that.

21
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,880
You know, this is the party people here.

22
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,040
That's that Club 3 treatment.

23
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,160
Yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:54,700
Wow.

25
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,900
Club 3 should have been a place at City Walk.

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,160
It would have been at least three stories.

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,360
Yeah, of course.

28
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,440
Massive sprawling failure, yes.

29
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:04,820
Yeah,

30
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,840
it would have failed for sure.

31
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,560
It also, it would have been called Club 3, but it would have been

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,620
four stories.

33
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,340
Yeah.

34
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,400
And so everything.

35
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,000
Not perfectly just not clean.

36
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,300
A good amount of

37
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,180
conversations between guests and wait staff.

38
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,780
Like, so there are three, well, there's actually

39
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,040
we do this every day.

40
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,600
Yeah.

41
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,100
It's good to see you Sector Keeper.

42
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,780
You know, you sent us to the

43
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:36,420
Land of Fallen Brothers and Never Built as like a punishment, but we ended up, it's weird to say,

44
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,080
I kind of liked the Sector Creeper a little bit.

45
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,020
You saw the Creeper?

46
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,220
We met the Sector Creeper,

47
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,240
he looked exactly like you, but with a Chris Gaines soul patch.

48
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,240
Yes, exactly.

49
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,420
I mean,

50
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,500
sort of like this chill fun Bealejuice kind of deal.

51
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,200
Yeah.

52
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,340
I mean, it's wild down there, right?

53
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,240
It is wild.

54
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,840
Yeah, but there's like a lot of cool places.

55
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,660
You guys liked it.

56
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,540
We kind of liked it,

57
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:58,680
actually.

58
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,720
Other than some of the things popping out and like threatening to hurt us.

59
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,240
The potential

60
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,020
to be crushed to death or to be impaled while taking a shit.

61
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:06,420
Yes.

62
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,280
Yeah, we didn't want that.

63
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,980
I did stick around for a little while and I lost a lot of money in those poker games

64
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,760
because he kept getting five kings.

65
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:16,780
Yeah.

66
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,800
Oh, Jason.

67
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,660
Yeah, that's my fault.

68
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,500
That's my fault.

69
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,180
There's only four in a deck.

70
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,460
Yeah, I know.

71
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,460
I feel like we're in a comic strip.

72
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,000
Look, my.

73
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,800
Just this episode you felt that way?

74
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,680
He said, you sure you don't want to play?

75
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,740
I got a three card Monte table

76
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,380
and then I was like, all right, I know how to win three card Monte.

77
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,420
And then he started

78
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,860
dealing five card Texas Hold'em.

79
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,260
Oh, man.

80
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,520
I'm sorry about that.

81
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,060
Yeah.

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,120
Did you get anything

83
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,380
like any free swag?

84
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,940
I know he's got boxes of it.

85
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,260
I got a couple boxes of very pungent Stoegies.

86
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,120
Really?

87
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,860
He just he's always looking for him.

88
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,120
He's always looking for me.

89
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,240
He said, oh, take those.

90
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,860
They're empty.

91
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,640
And I tried to tell them they're not.

92
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,980
And then he forced me out with like force

93
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,580
powers.

94
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,080
That's he didn't display those powers to us.

95
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,640
I guess he also had force.

96
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,200
But wow.

97
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,540
Wow.

98
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:13,780
I mean,

99
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,500
it's kind of like Leia, like suddenly flying through space.

100
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,140
Some force powers that's true.

101
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,160
Come out of nowhere.

102
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,820
They come out later.

103
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,840
Sometimes they come out later.

104
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,560
And the more

105
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,220
fuel rod kiosks that pop up, his force grows.

106
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,320
His force grows.

107
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,680
Yeah.

108
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:28,680
Yeah.

109
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:28,840
Yeah.

110
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:28,980
Yeah.

111
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,140
Yeah.

112
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,920
All the energy of the unused fuel rods.

113
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,100
Yeah.

114
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,220
All kind of like gives him the force of a

115
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:36,520
iPhone.

116
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,480
Yeah.

117
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,040
It gives it gives each one gives him the force to power a phone for 35 minutes.

118
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:48,000
If he gets enough of those kiosks, he'll be able to charge a fuel rod battery

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,680
all so much it will get a phone to 80 percent.

120
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,680
Oh, I'm glad you got out of there.

121
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,200
Yeah.

122
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,460
For the best.

123
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,840
And you know, and we're happy to be here on like, you know, in a place we understand

124
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,020
in Club 3.

125
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,880
So you have you have climbed the paywall if you're hearing this.

126
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,120
And that means that you

127
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,300
get an episode about a wall.

128
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,200
You know, I know the usual rigmarole here is that the Sector Keeper

129
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,620
does the reveal, which we can do.

130
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,680
However, you listening to this have known already for a while

131
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,360
what this topic was going to be, because for the first time ever in a saga, there was a power

132
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,800
more powerful than the Sector Keeper.

133
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,580
And that's the power of democracy.

134
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,600
Thank you all for picking

135
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,140
today's topic, which we will still let the Sector Keeper.

136
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes, boys, boys, audience,

137
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,200
poll takers.

138
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,820
Phase four sector two is the piece of the Berlin Wall behind the Hard Rock Cafe.

139
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,820
Good luck, boys.

140
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,280
So there you go.

141
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,120
That's again, that kind of stuff we get up to here that people

142
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,600
want to hear here in crazy Club 3.

143
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,260
Yesterday, we handled everything.

144
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,520
We cleared out everything

145
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,560
about the Hard Rock Cafe besides this.

146
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:02,880
Yeah.

147
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,740
And I like it because it took it off the plate.

148
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,200
Let that

149
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,260
be a leaner episode.

150
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,080
And now we can just really meditate on this wall.

151
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,100
Some other things didn't

152
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,600
quite get there.

153
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,720
I really liked all these suggestions.

154
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,520
Fallen Brothers, we ended up taking

155
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,300
care of in a different way.

156
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,020
The idea, there was the idea floated of a mini saga in the Knotts

157
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,640
marketplace, a little shopping center outside of Knotts.

158
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,880
And I'm of two minds there.

159
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,320
One,

160
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,940
on one hand, I'm kind of happy we didn't have to go do the work.

161
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,000
But on the other hand,

162
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,980
it's a very, it's a fun place.

163
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,300
I'm sure we would have met some sort of colorful,

164
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,680
I am her character or brought along a favorite keeper from the past.

165
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,740
I am a little shocked,

166
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,140
impressed that the audience would rather talk about the Berlin Wall piece than have us do a

167
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,920
full mini saga in one episode.

168
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,420
Yeah, that was mini saga, I think was the key word there.

169
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:58,680
Yeah,

170
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,440
it would have like, imagine.

171
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,880
I mean, that could have been a five hour thing.

172
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,380
Could have been.

173
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,820
Somebody said, somebody's rationale in everybody's kind of campaigning for what they want there.

174
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,560
And somebody had the rationale, come on, mini saga, we got to put the boys to work.

175
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,240
Another rationale that I saw in pushing what we did end up do.

176
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,480
Oh, no, actually, no, this was

177
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:21,920
open ended.

178
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,280
Actually, this was like, you know, just general strategy.

179
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,520
Somebody, Eric said,

180
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,520
you know, it's possible that all these topics will be covered.

181
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,460
It's just a matter of which

182
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,880
one is behind the double paywall.

183
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,980
If that's the case, pick the one that will help the good boys

184
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,640
drum up the most new Club 3 subscribers.

185
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,720
That's very kind of it.

186
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,420
It is very nice.

187
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:40,600
Now,

188
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,900
the answer to that is not this one.

189
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,800
Yeah, no, I picked the least interesting.

190
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,760
No, it's interesting.

191
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,340
It's interesting.

192
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,360
Pick the cement wall.

193
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,660
Sorry, Eric.

194
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,680
Eric's wishes were not fulfilled just in

195
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,040
terms of, but I think this will excite everybody.

196
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,300
Look, it won and I'm excited about it.

197
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:58,600
You know,

198
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,580
this would have gotten a big chunk of core in the other one.

199
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,660
And it's you know, what we're

200
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,840
talking about here is like, oh, it is like a big walk.

201
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,100
And then behind something, it is like the

202
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,220
double paywall.

203
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,820
It's secret.

204
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,400
It's a secret.

205
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,200
It feels secret.

206
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:12,740
It is.

207
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,280
It's like I think I walked

208
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,140
by before when I was just kind of exploring, totally forgot about it.

209
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,680
And I mentioned to

210
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,480
someone who worked at Universal, we were going to do a bunch of city well stuff.

211
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,140
And they said,

212
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:30,080
don't forget about that piece of the Berlin wall behind Hard Rock Cafe.

213
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,620
And I was like,

214
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,060
I simultaneously know exactly what they mean and not.

215
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,560
And then sure enough,

216
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,420
when we just kept going, it's right there.

217
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,260
It really, it's kind of the I like that don't forget

218
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,860
rationale because it kind of is the like dotting of the I, the crossing of the T.

219
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,520
Yeah, I know

220
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,700
we're doing a lot of days of this still unclear on how many at this point.

221
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,060
Who knows?

222
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,800
You're almost

223
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,420
halfway.

224
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,260
Oh, God.

225
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:00,700
Almost.

226
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,520
I'm gonna crunch some numbers on that.

227
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,360
What does that mean?

228
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:12,980
But it's a number halfway to eternity is like, you know, I live in a different real Cheshire

229
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,060
cat smile.

230
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,960
As you say that there is no halfway when we're talking an infinite loop.

231
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,520
Yes.

232
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,760
Oh,

233
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,140
God.

234
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,180
OK, well, we'll see.

235
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,540
But anyway, it is, you know, it's possible that we could have forgot if

236
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,880
we were to do an exhaustive, I'd have to think the only exhaustive covering of City Walk,

237
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,920
Orlando, we had to hit this.

238
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,220
We had to give it ample time.

239
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,200
So here we are.

240
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,740
This topic suggested

241
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,120
by multiple people, Miguel Sandoval, Melanie and Chad H.

242
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,080
I had the question of how to say your name

243
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,460
before.

244
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:50,360
E.

245
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,380
I just don't know.

246
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,420
It's H.

247
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:45,820
A.

248
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,240
E.

249
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,660
F.

250
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,020
E.

251
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,320
L.

252
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,080
and I'm going to fuck it up.

253
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:49,820
I'm not going to.

254
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,360
I owe

255
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,260
you more respect than that, Chad, than to bungle your name.

256
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,040
You spelled it.

257
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,040
That's Chad Havlach.

258
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,020
That's a way to at least pay respect.

259
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,460
Yes.

260
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,200
Yeah, absolutely.

261
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:58,840
Yes.

262
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,420
So he's given full credit.

263
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,160
So we are here.

264
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:04,800
We're at the.

265
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,140
Why don't we describe what happened, how you get here?

266
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:18,100
Yes, because Jason alluded to this as we covered yesterday, the giant Hard Rock Cafe with a concert

267
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,980
venue, huge footprint.

268
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,080
And then so just even if there was nothing in the back to take a walk all

269
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,140
the way to the back.

270
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,460
Yeah.

271
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,960
Be kind of a long journey.

272
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,380
Yeah.

273
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,680
And I only did this at night.

274
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,180
So I have

275
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,740
kind of like the mysterious air.

276
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,720
I did do it twice.

277
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,100
I did go back here twice.

278
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,200
I was there.

279
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,180
Yeah.

280
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,500
But like it's, you know, it's shadowy, it's dimly lit, there's bushes.

281
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,680
What's in the bushes?

282
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,300
You're on the outskirts of the park and there's very much a vibe.

283
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,260
Like, you know, as you're walking,

284
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,320
the hard, the rock part kind of stops.

285
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,560
You're not seeing a bunch of like guitar pillars or

286
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,580
sprinkler heads that look like speakers or drum pedals.

287
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,240
I don't know.

288
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,340
It feels like you're going

289
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,380
in a place like a part of like a maintenance entrance or something.

290
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,840
This is not for the public

291
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,660
to walk down.

292
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,260
It feels like you got like, oh, we walk around here because like we're like, we have

293
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:20,040
to give a bunch of like containers of soda syrup or something to load into the six flags like

294
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,240
similar to six flags.

295
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,480
When you're just suddenly in what you suspect might be a delivery road.

296
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,700
A back entrance in the Hard Rock Cafe.

297
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,500
You could go through the restaurant.

298
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:30,880
Yes.

299
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,440
I'm describing

300
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,680
the specific way where you're not even in the restaurant.

301
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,180
Yeah.

302
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,420
It just doesn't feel like an

303
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,660
image.

304
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,760
It doesn't feel like they want you back there.

305
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,500
It's kind of near that weird side entrance

306
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:49,620
that Universal uses sometimes for overflow or if you were going to the old Blue Man Group show,

307
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,360
like it's kind of in that neck of the woods.

308
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,020
Yes.

309
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,380
Yes.

310
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:53,600
Yeah.

311
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,200
Kind of an alternate way to get into

312
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,700
the park.

313
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,380
But there's a point in the middle there where you're it's almost like, am I supposed to

314
00:11:59,380 --> 00:11:59,920
be here?

315
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,200
Yes.

316
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,780
Is this correct?

317
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,000
Yeah.

318
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,820
Is this the right way?

319
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,580
And no one is there.

320
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,560
No one's there.

321
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,720
If you go back there and there's other people there, I think it'd feel very strange.

322
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,200
It would

323
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,160
feel like an accident.

324
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:09,760
Yes.

325
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,180
Yeah.

326
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,280
Or like you're about to get jumped or something.

327
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,340
Like there's

328
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,320
something like going on a secret meeting here.

329
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,320
You know what?

330
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:15,560
Nowhere.

331
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,220
We don't bear responsibility

332
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,000
for any robberies that occur when you're on the way to the Markable Berlin Wall.

333
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,040
There is.

334
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,500
Okay.

335
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:29,360
Once you get back there and you stand and stare at the piece of Berlin Wall, you look to one side.

336
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,520
You jump to the right to the end of the story.

337
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,900
Oh, what?

338
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,100
You get all the way back and there's

339
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,720
a piece of Berlin Wall standing there.

340
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

341
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:37,680
That we already said that.

342
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,180
I was weaving

343
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:38,660
a tale.

344
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,100
But anyway.

345
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,060
Oh, okay.

346
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:48,160
It really feels like a college student dissertation on like the 20th

347
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,380
century because there's a Berlin Wall.

348
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,300
There's a theme park to your right.

349
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,460
And if you look to your

350
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:58,720
left, there's a Hard Rock Cafe with a replica CBGBs on it.

351
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,560
You're saying these are like important

352
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,520
things for American culture.

353
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,120
It's a random sampling.

354
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,480
Important things or like important

355
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:13,500
things in the language of Hard Rock Cafe where it's like, you know, 20th century big events,

356
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,140
rock and roll, CBGBs, Berlin Wall, you know?

357
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:17,940
Big studios.

358
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:18,340
You know?

359
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,740
Love all serval.

360
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,220
You know?

361
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,480
Like a verse from We Didn't Start the Fire.

362
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,620
I was about to say how many of these things are in

363
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,080
We Didn't Start the Fire already?

364
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,760
Some of them.

365
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,520
Berlin Wall.

366
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,160
Berlin Wall.

367
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,340
When did it come out?

368
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,780
Was Berlin Wall still standing?

369
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,200
Yeah, good question.

370
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,760
The next verse sequentially would have

371
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,420
been Nickelodeon Studios.

372
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,540
The list of all the double dare Hard Rock Cafe.

373
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,140
What else do I have to say?

374
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,660
We Didn't Start.

375
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,060
Where they filmed Gullah Gullah Island.

376
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,900
Barbecue menu.

377
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,620
They push it really hard.

378
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,860
Yeah, but it's like, it really doesn't feel like you're like, I mean, it feels like you're like,

379
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,200
you're on the outskirts of a stadium or something.

380
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:07,660
Yeah.

381
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,040
Yeah.

382
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,900
And then and it and then like,

383
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,520
and then you're just looking at a gate.

384
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,920
You almost have to like, just like peer to,

385
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,520
you're gonna like go even a little further out of your way to get to this odd little,

386
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,980
it's a planter.

387
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:24,520
It's a planter that then has a cement block.

388
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,320
You would think it would be like,

389
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,980
obviously there were lights back there, but you would think it would be like a thing that's fully

390
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,320
like just a straight shot.

391
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,180
And then there's like kind of a like a circle, like you walk around it,

392
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,260
maybe on a sidewalk and it's well lit.

393
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,360
And like you go, oh, I see they've made a real like piece

394
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:39,980
out of this thing.

395
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,460
They've made a real like, it's a real presentation versus what you're saying,

396
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:48,440
it's like, you kind of go around a little bit and it's like, it's kind of quiet back here.

397
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,120
Okay.

398
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:49,600
Yeah.

399
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,760
Maybe there's some like, like really muffled speakers are playing like,

400
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,480
and you're really, I know what it's like.

401
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,060
25 year old song.

402
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,340
Radio after you radio after you.

403
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,540
Yeah, that's right.

404
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,180
Yes.

405
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,380
But then, but you get there and you get to a, to a planter

406
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,940
and you see this, this piece in its glory.

407
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,580
Yeah.

408
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,540
Now, all right.

409
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,140
It makes, I guess it makes you

410
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:28,420
think, it makes you think about, about history and you know, and where we've been as a nation

411
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,920
and all the significance of, but it's also just, it's a wall.

412
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,020
It's also a wall.

413
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,800
It's kind of,

414
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,880
it's kind of unremarkable in and of itself.

415
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,460
Remember the famous quote, Mr.

416
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,220
Gorbachev,

417
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,500
tear down that wall and put it behind a hard left.

418
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,040
Of course you forget about the second.

419
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:51,680
You forget.

420
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,920
You forget.

421
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:53,500
Yeah.

422
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,580
So yeah.

423
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:55,900
Yeah.

424
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,880
There's a little, there's some writing there, but yeah, it's not,

425
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,940
you don't, it's not an impressive thing on its own.

426
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,500
It's big.

427
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,480
It's a big piece,

428
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,720
but it's like without again, like a museum with a big like backdrop that maybe shows you what it

429
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,760
like it, which part of it it was like pointing out a big picture of it.

430
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,620
Maybe here, this is the

431
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,400
part or something.

432
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,780
You know where it stood, you know what part of town and any like kind of local

433
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:26,800
news articles about it are very much like an interesting fact about universal Orlando behind

434
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,860
the hard rock cafe.

435
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,560
There's a piece of the Berlin wall and then just a paragraph of the Berlin wall

436
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,980
erected in such and such today torn down in 1980, November, 1989, checkpoint Charlie,

437
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,740
like every article mentions.

438
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,580
And of course, checkpoint Charlie to go between East and West

439
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,220
Berlin.

440
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,500
And I know article answered the why.

441
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,600
So you're mad that they said,

442
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,540
give me the info I'm here for.

443
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,980
Give me the real history.

444
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,700
Get here.

445
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,220
Charlie Soviet this

446
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,780
bridge of spies.

447
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,920
Did I come park bid for it?

448
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,780
There was some people on Reddit.

449
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:21,020
Someone said it used to be more centrally located by the old

450
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,000
hard rock cafe.

451
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,540
Oh, I was wondering if that was part of the old one, but wait, because yeah,

452
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:30,640
as we addressed it moved from across the park over by the old by the psycho house,

453
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,880
by the fake psycho house.

454
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,640
Yeah.

455
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,760
Because now it feels like you're keeping us up with this.

456
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,340
Sorry, boys.

457
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,920
I dozed off.

458
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,060
Oh no.

459
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,320
No, no, it's all right.

460
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,780
No, we used to be a secret creeper.

461
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,560
What a love doll.

462
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,880
Yeah, you would have been down an old crumbling wall.

463
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,040
That's where he lives.

464
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,300
He loves everything in his world.

465
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,860
The rest of the walls down there.

466
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,780
All the parts that weren't saved for all right.

467
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:57,380
Yeah.

468
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,040
There used to be a very weird section of

469
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:05,780
universal Florida where you would go past five was playground, see a recreation of the psycho house

470
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:12,100
and next door was the hard rock cafe, which you could leave the park to go to or enter it from

471
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,260
outside the park.

472
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:13,980
Yeah.

473
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,840
Pretty awesome.

474
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,360
Now, you know, I mean, he knew we'd sector keeper knew

475
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,320
already, of course, but you know, and where does checkpoint Charlie come into play?

476
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,020
Well before this on the other side of the world.

477
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,620
Well, but you do have to consider, I think the

478
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,600
those checkpoints between restaurant and theme park, those are kind of miniature

479
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,800
checkpoint Charlies in their own right.

480
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,100
Right.

481
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,880
And there's sort of tend as there was tension

482
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,520
between the West and the East, there's tension between restaurants and paying customers.

483
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,040
There are now checkpoint Charlies as a part of the South.

484
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,840
Oh, in the multiverse.

485
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,500
Oh, so we're gonna have to get out of here via checkpoint.

486
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,620
OK, portals, gates, wormholes,

487
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,000
checkpoint Charlies, jump points, checkpoint Charlies.

488
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,640
Makes sense.

489
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,720
Galactic ones.

490
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:06,600
Well, you know, I do think that to understand everything about this, I think it is time to

491
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,780
dive into our deep lengthy analysis of the Cold War, the causes of it, the effects,

492
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,520
ongoing effects of it.

493
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:22,960
And what I mean, like, OK, you could we could read what's on the thing.

494
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,900
That's boring to do, I guess.

495
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,460
I'll do it.

496
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,440
But it tells you it does.

497
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,080
They do.

498
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,560
It's a tidy explanation

499
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,140
on the plaque of what it is.

500
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,580
You know, I guess in 1961, this infamous symbol of the Cold War

501
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:39,220
was erected to keep the East Germans from fleeing in order to wait in order to the way.

502
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:39,460
All right.

503
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,780
Well, I don't think they wrote down all the words on this.

504
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,220
All right.

505
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,760
What I copy pasted has

506
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,780
some weird in order to fill it in, make it up.

507
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:53,100
C.

508
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,820
The sick S.

509
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,000
I.

510
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,460
when there's a yeah.

511
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,100
Yeah.

512
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,940
A blue state, three blue men picked up the piece of wall and carried it across the ocean on a

513
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,540
steamship, used it as a silly drum.

514
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,360
Yeah.

515
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,520
The Soviets built a wall between the West.

516
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,060
Fucking this up is why I don't just swear this is an history podcast.

517
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:14,020
So it's built a wall between the East and West sections of Berlin for the next 28 years.

518
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,180
The

519
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,420
Cold War raged on and checkpoint Charlie.

520
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,060
There you go.

521
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,800
Take a shot.

522
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,780
Govern passage.

523
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,860
The wall stood

524
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,840
as a harsh reminder of the chasm between the non-communist West and communist East.

525
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,680
On November

526
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,600
9th, 1989, the wall was symbolically brought down.

527
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,400
Only a few parts of the wall remain.

528
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,400
The Hard Rock

529
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,480
Cafe is proud to display this piece of history that symbolizes the wall of oppression.

530
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,660
The wall

531
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,920
stood as a harsh reminder of the chasm between the non-communist West and communist East.

532
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,400
On

533
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,460
November 9th, 1989, the wall was symbolically brought down.

534
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,380
Only a few parts of the wall remain.

535
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,280
The Hard Rock Cafe is proud to display this piece of history that symbolizes the wall of oppression.

536
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:53,760
Yeah.

537
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,800
I mean, this and they know the weight is on them because they know that they would have had

538
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,240
to start building walls like this to keep planet Hollywood away.

539
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,940
If that if those tensions had grown

540
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,440
and they started building next door everywhere, they already had a hard rock.

541
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,040
Yeah.

542
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,340
Why does anybody

543
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:19,380
ever propose doing a world history cafe that's full of just like, you know, old stuff and I don't

544
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:25,820
know, pieces of walls and different, I don't know, tanks, different history, historical artifacts.

545
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,200
That's true.

546
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,940
It's the only way you're going to get us to learn about anything.

547
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,700
Yeah.

548
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,700
If you name a

549
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:38,440
terrible burger, they've got Napoleon's hat in the world history cafe.

550
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:39,440
Wow.

551
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,440
John Wilkes Booth

552
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,520
chicken tenders.

553
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,200
Yeah.

554
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,060
Cause like that there's got to be something close to it in like a museum

555
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,520
somewhere.

556
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,340
The Bill of Rights rice bowl.

557
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,720
The Bill of Rice.

558
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,560
That's good.

559
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,980
It should, they should do it.

560
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,320
Yeah.

561
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:57,640
History.

562
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,060
This is the way, the only way to get people to learn nowadays.

563
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,180
By that we mean us.

564
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,780
I'll write a little paragraph and like send it to Robert Earl and all the other different

565
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,540
restaurateurs, Tillman Fertitta and stuff.

566
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,140
Shaq.

567
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:09,940
Shaq?

568
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,320
Sure.

569
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,040
Uh huh.

570
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,080
Shaq will sign off on anything.

571
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,720
Oh and Shaq will be dressed up as all the, like the historical figures.

572
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,300
Oh, Shaq in a powdered wig.

573
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,120
That's right.

574
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:17,840
That's fun.

575
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,620
General Shaq Washington.

576
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,560
But then the general will sue him for a general

577
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:23,820
thing.

578
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

579
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,980
That's muddy if there's other generals involved.

580
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,800
Seeing Shaq as Napoleon

581
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,700
would be funny and confusing as Napoleon was short.

582
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,380
That's true.

583
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,780
He'd have to get on his knees,

584
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,640
put little shoes on like Dorf.

585
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,560
Yeah.

586
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,460
Which would be a Dorf on, Shaq doing a new, an updated Dorf.

587
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:41,980
That's what I was about to say.

588
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:47,000
Shaq bought Dorf and it's, and his, he goes on his knees and now he's just a regular

589
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,660
size person.

590
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,180
Sector Cuber, do you know who Dorf is?

591
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,740
I remember.

592
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,740
I made a reference to it and forgot,

593
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,680
I forgot who it was and then you were like, no, that's who I'm talking about.

594
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,600
It was Tim.

595
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,540
Tim Conway.

596
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,260
I remember the VHS as Dorf goes fishing.

597
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:03,420
Yeah.

598
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,400
Even as a kid, I thought this just feels off.

599
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,440
It's an early sign that not everything is good.

600
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,220
I think that's right.

601
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:11,960
Yeah.

602
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,060
We just got Dorf as a club three suggestion and it was like a, like,

603
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,120
wait, okay, we had to stop recording because Jason like coughed and I thought it was just a

604
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,100
coughing and water thing.

605
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:28,740
But then you said, you said it was, it was caused by you not knowing what

606
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,300
Dorf is.

607
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:29,880
It was a combination.

608
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:34,300
I started laughing and then choking water and coughing.

609
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,580
And I was trying to get out.

610
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,640
I don't know what Dorf is.

611
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,060
I was sitting here going like,

612
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,960
why are you all like, I don't think we should be saying that.

613
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,020
What are you talking about?

614
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,540
I don't think we should be saying that.

615
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,360
We weren't saying Dorf.

616
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,640
No, no, no.

617
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,640
I was like,

618
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,040
is that the term?

619
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,600
Dorf is not a slur.

620
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,500
It's not that we are not taking anything away from any

621
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,340
group or it's one that I don't, it's so obscure.

622
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,220
I don't know about it.

623
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,700
Do I remember his name is

624
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,360
spelled D-O-R-F.

625
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:04,580
Yeah.

626
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,500
I had no idea.

627
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,200
I was so confused.

628
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,360
Well, you know what I was about to

629
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:16,720
say is that it was suggested on club three and the person is like Dorf, which was a series of

630
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,480
Tim Conway did where he's and I'm like, I know what Dorf is, but Jason did not know what Dorf is.

631
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,080
And thisDP is not the kind of thing it is.

632
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,380
Probably it's, it's probably reasonable and better

633
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,000
that you don't know what Dorf is.

634
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,820
There was all these home videos in like the home video

635
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:35,020
initial rage in the eighties where he, he, he, he gall.

636
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,380
He was like a German guy or like Dutch

637
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,040
or something.

638
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,740
Like, cause he had an accent.

639
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,980
That's part of it.

640
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,920
And then I love getting explained

641
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,520
from the ground up, but he was, he did instructional videos, mostly golf,

642
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,000
but he would go on his knees and put little shoes on his knees.

643
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,860
These were like very short person,

644
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,940
no money.

645
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:53,620
Yeah.

646
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:53,880
Really?

647
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,900
Like you get the vibe from it.

648
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,960
You were like, this feels like a bootleg

649
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,180
tape of some kind, but it was literally, they just, no one had put any money.

650
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:00,500
I don't know

651
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,520
how much Tim Conway may probably made a decent amount.

652
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,760
I would think, but maybe not.

653
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,200
So maybe

654
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,220
probably nobody was exploiting that, that area, the home video market.

655
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,720
But then also there'd be

656
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,760
things like if he's on a golf course, they would dig little holes for his legs to go so that then

657
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:21,260
he could like tip around and like go back and forth, like a blow up doll or like an inflatable,

658
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,580
you know, like outside of cardio.

659
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,040
Yeah.

660
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,180
Yeah.

661
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:23,840
You know what I mean?

662
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,180
Yeah.

663
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:24,360
Yeah.

664
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,140
But still with the

665
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,000
little shoes seems like second rate earnest.

666
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,800
That's, that's pretty right on.

667
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,060
Yeah.

668
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,040
Yeah.

669
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:33,740
Yeah.

670
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:36,820
Yeah.

671
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:40,920
And it never got, it stayed second rate because there was never a door film.

672
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:46,240
Well, I didn't really have plans for the rest of the day and I guess they will be taken up by

673
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,180
searching door on YouTube, obtaining the rights to door.

674
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,600
So you can take the mantle.

675
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,120
Here's what I

676
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,220
think.

677
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:56,400
I think you'll have the most, like, I think you will be just like doubled over laughing for

678
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,900
six minutes and then it'll just kind of like turn to silence and like, huh, huh, how much more

679
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,560
for two?

680
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,840
I was going to hit you so hard and then just taper off.

681
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,080
I'm going to be begging for like

682
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,380
the thing Griffin told us about where Popeye meets all the King features syndicate characters.

683
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:19,180
That's really something that he, he proposed that in the last club three, he proposed that to us

684
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:23,140
and that he was like, even for you guys, this is too boring.

685
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,340
This is too unremarkable for you.

686
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,000
Yeah.

687
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,420
Okay.

688
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,340
Where were we?

689
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,940
Dorf.

690
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,660
Dorf.

691
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,280
Cold war.

692
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,820
Let's see.

693
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,340
Where were we?

694
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,120
Checkpoint Charlie.

695
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:32,880
Dorf.

696
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:39,320
Um, dude, we are immediately pop by Russian soldiers.

697
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,120
They see dwarf come and they're not

698
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,940
fucking around.

699
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,980
I can't make heads or tails of what that is.

700
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,200
Shoot him.

701
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,900
Um, anyway, but your, um,

702
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,760
dwarf was a communist.

703
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,720
Um, so you gave me, you had a question when we shut down for a second, which was

704
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,680
why would the, the hard rock cafe end up with this and put it behind their restaurant?

705
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,320
Yeah.

706
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,140
Um,

707
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:06,880
and you, and you said like, why would it, wouldn't a museum want this?

708
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,220
Um, and I think I'm sure that

709
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:13,440
I know that there are many pieces of the Berlin wall in museums.

710
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,760
Uh, that's definitely true,

711
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,640
but they, they seem to be sorta up for grabs for a little while.

712
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,060
Yes.

713
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,960
Cause a lot of odd places

714
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,040
have them.

715
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,360
Uh, my film school had one, Loyola Marymount university.

716
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,000
Uh, it was, uh, as I recall,

717
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,220
across from the Jamba juice.

718
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,380
Um, so I passed that a lot.

719
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:37,760
Yeah.

720
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,720
Uh, Chapman of film school.

721
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,200
I, I

722
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,260
liked it not to go to also has one.

723
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,940
I remember when I was deciding between the two, uh, Berlin wall

724
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,840
holding film schools in Southern California.

725
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,520
Um, the Reagan library has one.

726
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,240
Makes sense.

727
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,620
She said

728
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,240
the thing.

729
00:27:54,860 --> 00:28:00,020
Um, the Nixon library has one and that, that covers a lot of, there is a website where

730
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:05,440
you can track where they all are across the world and in California.

731
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,400
I was curious about the

732
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,420
California ones.

733
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,180
Um, but mainly I was going through the website a little bit and like, okay,

734
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,560
if it's not somewhere stupid, I don't want to hear it.

735
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,260
Oh yeah.

736
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:14,560
Yeah.

737
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,940
There's like museums and

738
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,140
stuff.

739
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,920
Of course.

740
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,620
When I was a kid, I saw one in DC at the new Zium.

741
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,220
If you remember the new Zium,

742
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:28,500
that was kind of the news and reporting journalism museum.

743
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,100
And then parts of the big stretches of it

744
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,720
are still up in Berlin.

745
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:36,320
And I went to one when I studied abroad there.

746
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,920
Um, and it was, uh, cool

747
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:46,080
and powerful to see, but have I thought about the Orlando one behind the Hard Rock cafe more?

748
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,020
Probably.

749
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:47,800
Yeah.

750
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,580
And that's why I'm done.

751
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,440
That's why I'm as dumb as Dorff.

752
00:28:53,800 --> 00:29:01,400
But, uh, there's also, it's not the only Berlin wall segment in Orlando.

753
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,120
There is another one

754
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,440
elsewhere in the city.

755
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,800
Uh, that is at, there's a 10 foot by 10 foot panel in the Ripley auditorium

756
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,680
on international drive.

757
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,720
Ripley entertainment purchased 16 panels of the wall in the days

758
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,600
after it came down for $48,000 plus shipping.

759
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:20,300
Wow.

760
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,020
I didn't see how much it was.

761
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,320
That is not

762
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,020
a lot of money.

763
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:24,840
I feel like.

764
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,280
How much would you pay for a Berlin wall, Jason, if you had a pretty

765
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,040
big bank account?

766
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,520
Well, I thought, I thought $48,000 would be for one chunk of the wall.

767
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,860
Oh, 16.

768
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,700
How big is that?

769
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,080
10 by 10 is what they said.

770
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,880
10 by 10.

771
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,400
Yeah.

772
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:40,620
Yeah.

773
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,400
That's, that's because

774
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,740
the other ones are, I usually you see them as rectangles.

775
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,080
How big would you say this one is?

776
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,260
Like 10 by five or 10 by four?

777
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,780
Six maybe.

778
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,220
Yeah.

779
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,980
It's a little wider than that, but yeah.

780
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,220
And a little taller and a little, it might be like 12.

781
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,120
Chopped up maybe.

782
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:56,900
One by six.

783
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:57,320
Yeah.

784
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:57,860
I'm not sure.

785
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,540
Second market.

786
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,360
It's a little bit like a 2001 monolith.

787
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,880
Like a smaller white 2001

788
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,420
monolith.

789
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:10,040
It looks like the crystals in, or it looks kind of like it would be in the, um,

790
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,640
space or something by like a Zordon or something.

791
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,060
Yeah.

792
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,360
It looks, that's the shape of it.

793
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:15,640
I'm not

794
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,900
saying it's a crystal like that.

795
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,340
Yeah.

796
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:17,880
Yeah.

797
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,480
Uh, um, what do you notice when you look at it?

798
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:21,660
Let's

799
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,040
talk about what's on the wall.

800
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:23,400
Oh yeah.

801
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:23,680
Yeah.

802
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,020
Yeah.

803
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,360
What's, what do you see on the piece itself?

804
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:27,940
Um,

805
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:28,680
dirt.

806
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,440
Yeah.

807
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,320
Yeah.

808
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:30,880
Yeah.

809
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,840
Nothing, right?

810
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,300
Nothing.

811
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:32,660
Yeah.

812
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,400
The one in my film school had some interesting

813
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:41,020
graffiti and, and, uh, a lot of them have just like pieces, like, uh, you know, just like, like

814
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,040
art and people expressing themselves and sending messages to people.

815
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,980
And the one back there just

816
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,640
has nothing.

817
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,960
And Chad H whose name I don't want to butcher claims in the comments, the Berlin wall

818
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,540
has no graffiti on it because a well-meaning maintenance employee didn't know the historic

819
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,420
value and power washed it.

820
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,320
Really?

821
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,520
Oh man.

822
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,300
Isn't that interesting?

823
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,680
That rules.

824
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,280
Oh no, better clean this wall.

825
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,800
This wall is full of, that's a kind of goof Dorf would make.

826
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,120
Yeah.

827
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:15,760
Yeah.

828
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,080
Dorf on maintenance.

829
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,320
Dorf in a museum, like a racing the Mona Lisa.

830
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:31,640
This, uh, I would encourage him to turn that power washer 10 feet to the left and get the hard rock

831
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,080
cafe a little more.

832
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,840
Torben museum is a good, I think.

833
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,200
Yeah.

834
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,500
Yeah.

835
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:36,600
Yeah.

836
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,080
Absolutely.

837
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:37,780
Well, yeah.

838
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,620
A couple, well, you know, you know what he'd do is, and, uh, again, how uncultured I am, I can't name

839
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,620
the artist who did, whose piece was the urinal.

840
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,860
Um, but you're like, that's Duchamp.

841
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,340
Okay.

842
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:49,960
Uh,

843
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,400
you know, he'd be peeing in that Duchamp photo.

844
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:52,480
Yeah.

845
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,020
Perfect thing for Dorf to do.

846
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,280
Oh yeah.

847
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,500
He's covering up, uh, Michelangelo's David, of course.

848
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,560
Oh, he's a penis.

849
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:00,840
Yeah.

850
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,640
He's covering it up.

851
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:01,980
Oh yeah.

852
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:07,240
He just, he has, he just goes and gets a pair of underwear and then he can't figure out how

853
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:12,800
to, uh, get them on him because the feet, he's very heavy and the feet are stuck on the ground.

854
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,320
So he ends up in trying to put, uh, underwear on David.

855
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,140
He knocks it over, falls in.

856
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,380
And then

857
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,220
he's got to try to put it all back together.

858
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,000
Yeah.

859
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,980
I might put it in like some, some like

860
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:28,120
it knocks over a trash can and then there's like cups and wrappers that, sorry, what are you saying?

861
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,400
No, I was just gonna say he pokes his eye out with his dick.

862
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,820
Oh, well you can do both.

863
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,380
You can do both.

864
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,540
That happens first.

865
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,460
And now he knows it's a nuisance to children.

866
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,300
So he has to put underwear on him.

867
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,780
So he knocks it over, gets mixed up with trash can pieces.

868
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,300
And then a weird big trash David gets.

869
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,260
That might be a little lewd for the tapes.

870
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,300
I don't know what rating they were.

871
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,720
Plenty of room on that VHS.

872
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,060
Kids need to learn about art.

873
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,540
It's not pornographic.

874
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,360
It's, it's,

875
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,040
it's art.

876
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,980
And they, you know, if the way they need to learn that is by seeing

877
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,620
Dorf get poked in the eye by David's dick.

878
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,940
Dorf on, it's like Dorf on golf, Dorf on baseball,

879
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,360
whatever.

880
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,620
Dorf on David's dick.

881
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,220
Dorf would vector.

882
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,800
I, I, I'm amazed.

883
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,500
To be your Pluto have not made a call to like, we want Dorf.

884
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,300
You, you should be Dorf.

885
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,380
You should just start doing Dorf and don't even get the rights.

886
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,500
Oh, sure.

887
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,120
Just Jason as Dorf.

888
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,660
And you just do it.

889
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,020
And let's just see if something like the widow,

890
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,340
Katim Conway's widow comes after us.

891
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,220
They're, they're cheap to make.

892
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,340
It wouldn't take long.

893
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,020
I guess so.

894
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:45,280
Do you think there's, do you think it's important name recognition or would he get the

895
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,520
Dorf or Zorf?

896
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:47,840
Dorf.

897
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
Yeah, why not?

898
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,820
Well, that's, that happens if the widow sues us or if that's

899
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,800
the estate sues us.

900
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,480
Oh, then you just repackage all of it.

901
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,060
Yeah.

902
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,200
I mean all the, how many YouTubers

903
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,340
or whatever got famous just doing Jim Carrey's voices?

904
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,880
Uh, that one fucking idiot who just did

905
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,820
Shanaynay the Martin character, uh, just stole it whole cloth.

906
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,320
Yeah.

907
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,860
Uh, so that, you know,

908
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,960
yeah, just that, that's your way to YouTube fame is just start doing.

909
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:12,660
Yeah.

910
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,940
Dorf goes to the Bob's

911
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,280
Big Boy and Burbank with all the classic cars.

912
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,280
Mr.

913
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,060
Beast, Hunst, Dorf.

914
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,760
Well, that's a crossover

915
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,300
for later.

916
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,420
Yeah, I know.

917
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,960
That's once you're doing Mr.

918
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,980
Beast numbers, which is probably two, three

919
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,640
months away.

920
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:27,920
Yeah.

921
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:28,660
Yeah.

922
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:35,380
Um, if I could circle back around, I brought up the, the, there's a piece of

923
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,220
it at Ripley's.

924
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,180
Remember Ripley's in that same complex where we did our live show.

925
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:40,960
That was a

926
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,260
perfect, now that we've discovered that that place was sued by Universal because they wanted to call

927
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:46,900
it I walk.

928
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,320
And that's where the, uh, if you were going on a national treasure style hunt to put

929
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,280
the Berlin wall back up here, you could, that's where those are.

930
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,220
These are the two places you

931
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,980
stop in Orlando.

932
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:04,020
That is, that should be in, if they do a third national treasure, which are always

933
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:10,260
talking about, they just try to find a hunk of the wall that has like a codex or a secret message.

934
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,300
Hidden in it.

935
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:12,600
Oh yeah.

936
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,510
You have to search every hard rock to find it.

937
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,940
Every Mills outlet mall.

938
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:23,380
Uh, I was trying to fit that stumbling upon finding the hard rock piece

939
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:30,380
reminded me when I went to, uh, my old college roommate Jack's wedding in Staten Island.

940
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,380
Uh,

941
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,560
the wedding hotel was a Hampton Inn back kind of next to an office park.

942
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,680
So there was a few offices,

943
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:44,360
buildings, Hampton Inn, Hilton garden in with a cabaret that had a big sold out Joe Piscopo side.

944
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,980
So couldn't have stuck around from his cabal, but I was just went for a walk one day and was

945
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:55,640
walking around this like parking lot, some pathways and stumbled upon this giant like

946
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:04,640
chunk of metal and it was steel beams from the twin towers in the back of this office park.

947
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,080
And I

948
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:10,260
think it was, uh, you know, the plaque was a tribute that some hook and ladder companies from

949
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,060
Staten Island had responded.

950
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,740
It was like a plaque and this was a little.

951
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,460
Yeah, the plaque and then like a

952
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:16,580
piece.

953
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:21,020
Foot tall, like, um, you know, chunk of metal from the building.

954
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,180
I wonder if that's common.

955
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:28,260
It was just such an odd, it, it much like the Berlin wall piece was just kind of like so off the beat

956
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:28,720
and bare.

957
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,420
Why are they hiding all these things?

958
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,320
I don't know.

959
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,080
What's the agenda?

960
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,900
We hide, we hide

961
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,860
parts of our history.

962
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:34,140
Right.

963
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,720
And maybe that is what it is.

964
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,580
Maybe that's what we're getting.

965
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,480
I, where is, do we know where the Ripley's is, uh, where the wall is displayed in the Ripley's?

966
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,080
Is it first?

967
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,720
Is it end?

968
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,400
I think you, I think you got to pay to that's, that's past the paywall.

969
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:45,940
Oh, right.

970
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,660
Cause they don't want you.

971
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,120
Yeah.

972
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,200
Um, I think I'm not sure.

973
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:49,340
Yeah.

974
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,460
That's not just in an

975
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:50,980
office park.

976
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,640
Uh, um, I believe by the way, I believe Ripley's believe it or not.

977
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,000
I believe the wall.

978
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,500
I believe they had a wall.

979
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,420
Yeah.

980
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,700
It's not like a thing.

981
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,980
Oh, I believe it.

982
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,820
Like I believe it.

983
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,660
Denial of this, of all the things that are denied things in Ripley should really make me go, I don't

984
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,680
believe it.

985
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,060
Oh yeah.

986
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,700
Well, that's for other things.

987
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,840
That's for, you know, when there's like a statue

988
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,020
of a man who was nine feet tall or whatever.

989
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,300
Right.

990
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,600
I prove that.

991
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:17,820
Right.

992
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,560
But I, maybe, I don't know.

993
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,380
Maybe I don't believe it.

994
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,780
Those proportions seem strange.

995
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,680
There was, there was a wall that, uh,

996
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,420
divided Berlin.

997
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,080
I do believe it.

998
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,440
That's the believe it section.

999
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,280
The Cardiff giant drawing was like,

1000
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,160
or not.

1001
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:30,520
Yeah.

1002
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,540
All right.

1003
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,400
So they have a mix.

1004
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:33,480
Yeah.

1005
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:33,880
Yes.

1006
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,380
That's what they give you the choice.

1007
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,540
Unlike the multiverse right now.

1008
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,880
We're trying to do is restore the balance.

1009
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:44,240
Yes.

1010
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:44,820
That's right.

1011
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,620
Uh, um, I feel like I have an idea that I want to run.

1012
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,780
Yeah, please remember guts.

1013
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,700
I loved guts.

1014
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,320
Yeah.

1015
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,120
Instead of getting a glowing piece of the aggro crack, you should have gotten a little

1016
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,160
piece of the wall of the Berlin wall or the aggro Berlin.

1017
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,220
Oh, the Berlin wall.

1018
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:00,720
Okay.

1019
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,360
Well,

1020
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,840
it was recent history then it had just been torn.

1021
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,120
And like, what better way to, you know, we had a

1022
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:11,280
lot of fun here on guts, but like, maybe you need to think about, uh, or put it at the base of the

1023
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,840
crack and you had to climb over it.

1024
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,140
Okay.

1025
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:13,640
Yeah.

1026
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:13,960
Sure.

1027
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:14,440
Yeah.

1028
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:14,620
Yeah.

1029
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,700
Would have been a good, also a good

1030
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,340
thing on legends of the hidden temple.

1031
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,840
Like the, you know, yeah, make it talk like, oh, Mac,

1032
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:27,600
could I, could I, could I also suggest that maybe there was a historical guts where at the end of

1033
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,420
the show, kids would have to climb the Berlin wall.

1034
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,480
Yeah.

1035
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:30,960
Yeah.

1036
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,840
What else would you have to do?

1037
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,760
Well, you'd have to cross the Gettysburg, I think for sure.

1038
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,800
Cross the Gettysburg.

1039
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,680
No, no, what

1040
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,100
12 miles of battlefield.

1041
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,240
Like it's about folks.

1042
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,520
You don't come to us for the history.

1043
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,120
The what you know, you could recreate the crossing already.

1044
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,420
Are you trying to say cross the Delaware?

1045
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:55,840
Yes.

1046
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,100
Yes.

1047
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:56,740
Yeah.

1048
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,580
Okay.

1049
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,620
Cross the Gettysburg address.

1050
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:02,400
The kids, the kids have to give, recite the address.

1051
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:02,840
Maybe.

1052
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,060
Well, right on the back of a train.

1053
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:04,640
Yes.

1054
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,400
Right.

1055
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,520
But like that's like a Douglas debate

1056
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,120
on the back of a train.

1057
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,560
This is a good painting though is, is Washington crossing the Gettysburg

1058
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:19,880
and then it's so the address is in on papers on the ground and it's just him stepping over it.

1059
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,380
There's been some colossal blunders in the last few episodes.

1060
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,580
Let's go to Moe.

1061
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,160
Moe.

1062
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,240
She's in a powder wig and we're subtracting points from all the boys.

1063
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,440
All of them are mealy

1064
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,640
mouthed, misremembering everything.

1065
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,320
I don't think any of them have what it takes to go all the way.

1066
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:35,960
That's right.

1067
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,220
Back to you, sect to keep it.

1068
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,580
And then whoever wins global history guts,

1069
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,800
they get to enjoy being serenaded by Mr.

1070
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,260
David Hasselhoff.

1071
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,380
He once did a musical performance of

1072
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:47,960
the wall.

1073
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,100
Oh, okay.

1074
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,840
Death defying segways.

1075
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:51,460
Yeah.

1076
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,020
All right.

1077
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,060
Oh no, I got the tag.

1078
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:54,840
I got the tab

1079
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,160
open.

1080
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:55,900
Oh, it's here.

1081
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,400
You know, I'm thinking about the Hoff.

1082
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,240
Of course.

1083
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:58,880
Yeah.

1084
00:39:59,060 --> 00:39:59,700
Is it worth?

1085
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,820
Yeah, of course.

1086
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,700
It's always worth hearing.

1087
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,520
Gasoloff sing.

1088
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,140
Yeah, please.

1089
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:17,040
The main thing is, yeah, he's wearing a light up jacket and then the like the tie is piano.

1090
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,280
No,

1091
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,880
it's a scarf that's piano keys.

1092
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,140
You know, that that's stuff with him in Germany is definitely

1093
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:24,620
true.

1094
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,140
Really?

1095
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,420
Yeah.

1096
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,480
Lose their fucking mind.

1097
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,940
I just saw some with it was some weird like opera

1098
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:34,520
or classical performance where he made a surprise appearance and everybody lost their fucking minds.

1099
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,580
It was an audience of entirely 60, 70 year olds.

1100
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,820
I forget where maybe in Belgium or something.

1101
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,220
Yeah.

1102
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,240
And they I've never seen a crowd while out like this.

1103
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,180
Fucking bananas other than the

1104
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:50,540
half an hour earlier in the concert when Los del Rio showed up and did the Macarena.

1105
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,100
Wow.

1106
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:51,440
I don't

1107
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,320
know what this is.

1108
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,500
This I was thinking this might be there's also like a like this, like a some like

1109
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:02,080
big hippo chase or something through again, this is a classical music concert and all of this happens

1110
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,540
and we all look up what this is.

1111
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:03,980
How recent?

1112
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,720
I don't know last seven years or so.

1113
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:07,140
Yeah,

1114
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:07,960
it's really good.

1115
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,520
Fairly recent.

1116
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,040
Again, we will get cultured if you make historical restaurants,

1117
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,380
if you if Haseloff shows up at our opera.

1118
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,300
Only option we have now to remember anything about

1119
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,540
American or world history.

1120
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,720
We're too dumb.

1121
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,100
We think you crossed the Gettysburg.

1122
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,080
Club three knows how

1123
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,900
dumb we are.

1124
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,500
Fun fact about Gettysburg, I grew up Pennsylvania.

1125
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,920
I've been to Gettysburg multiple

1126
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,360
times.

1127
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:30,700
Sure.

1128
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:39,700
Just outside Gettysburg, the farm where they retired Dwighton Mamie Eisenhower.

1129
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,560
You can tour the Eisenhower farm.

1130
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,080
So that'll be something that would be on the global

1131
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,400
history guts.

1132
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,020
It's tour.

1133
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,380
You have to go through the Eisenhower farm.

1134
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,000
You got to leap over cows

1135
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,620
at Dwighton Mamie Eisenhower.

1136
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,320
That sounds good.

1137
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,060
That sounds fun.

1138
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:54,440
That's great.

1139
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,520
Yeah, we're like

1140
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,820
a basketball like while in a kayak next to his house.

1141
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:04,320
Yeah, I think so.

1142
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,400
And then the next step

1143
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,940
becomes like, what if we don't do it on the farm?

1144
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,400
What if history is not part of it?

1145
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:08,820
What if it's

1146
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,700
just a basketball kayak show?

1147
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,100
Forget the history.

1148
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,400
OK, here's OK.

1149
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,600
So I think we all find this

1150
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,640
kind of odd that it's there.

1151
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,500
It's not what hard rock does.

1152
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,920
Hard rock is about, you know, having

1153
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:34,620
you know, like receipts that Fred Durst's you like that he got from clothing purchases, 30%

1154
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,480
a real one from yesterday.

1155
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,600
But, you know, so why do they have this piece here?

1156
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,440
Why are they tied

1157
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:42,980
into this?

1158
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:48,900
What I have found is that Hard Rock Cafe has made a concerted effort to align their

1159
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,240
brand with the brand Berlin Wall.

1160
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,340
But there's a couple of steps to this one.

1161
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,760
Of course, it

1162
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,780
follows that there is a restaurant in Berlin.

1163
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,160
There is a Hard Rock Cafe there in West Berlin,

1164
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,480
less than three miles from where the wall stood.

1165
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,540
That makes sense.

1166
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,520
You have one of those in Berlin.

1167
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,600
It's a major city.

1168
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:17,140
What I didn't realize till a couple hours ago, one of the things they have

1169
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:22,900
is a guitar that is made from one of the pieces of the Berlin Wall.

1170
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,860
That's a real thing.

1171
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,180
They

1172
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,920
shaped some of it into a guitar shape.

1173
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,880
Seems a bit impractical, but it is cool.

1174
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,780
It was probably a real challenge for whatever

1175
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:36,200
stone artisan and it, you know, it ended up looking like a prop from the Flintstones.

1176
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,180
Definitely very silly.

1177
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,140
But nonetheless, it's there.

1178
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,260
Now, as we've discussed, Berlin is kind of in the

1179
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,760
shadow of this, of the Cold War, of its division.

1180
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,760
There's pieces of it that are still up to remember.

1181
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,560
Then there is Checkpoint Charlie, after mentioned by Jason.

1182
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,440
That is still a primary

1183
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:05,240
tourist spot to remember the Cold War and reflect on it.

1184
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,740
As of 2020,

1185
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,100
literally there's the booth.

1186
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,320
Checkpoint Charlie, which was a little booth where somebody stood,

1187
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,700
where they try to keep people from crossing.

1188
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:24,660
Here is, there's the booth and right behind it is

1189
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,620
something called the Hard Rock Rock Shop.

1190
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,140
It is literally at Checkpoint Charlie.

1191
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,620
I kept double checking this.

1192
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,720
Am I crazy?

1193
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,760
It's at Checkpoint Charlie?

1194
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,740
Yes, it is.

1195
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,440
They have a rock shop right there and there's a ton

1196
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,720
of touristy crap there, so it's not the only thing.

1197
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,200
There's a coffee place, there's a McDonald's.

1198
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,100
Checkpoint Charlie actually is kind of a stupid tourist trap place now.

1199
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,740
This was a spot where

1200
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:56,540
there was a showdown between US and Soviet tanks that lasted for several days, in which there was

1201
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:02,920
genuine concern that nukes would be launched and a true nuclear war would begin because of what's

1202
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,960
happening at this spot.

1203
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,320
Now there's a Hard Rock Rock Shop at it.

1204
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,040
It's like the ultimate capitalist twist of the knife.

1205
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:16,800
Yeah, yeah, like Jason was saying, all of it combining in this weird confluence.

1206
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,460
And can I just confirm that is a standalone Hard Rock gift shop.

1207
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,380
It's not the restaurant.

1208
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,760
It is only the shop.

1209
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,200
The restaurant is two to three miles away and they only have,

1210
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:33,080
it's pretty narrow, it is just a rock shop and it says Checkpoint Charlie on the window.

1211
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:40,540
The only other place I've seen that was when Disney MGM Studios on the way to Tower Tower

1212
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:43,720
had a standalone Planet Hollywood shop.

1213
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:44,400
Oh yeah.

1214
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,620
Even though the Planet Hollywood, the giant globe

1215
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:51,620
one was miles away at then downtown Disney.

1216
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,340
Hold on, hold on, help me out with this one.

1217
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:57,400
A-bombs didn't drop, now it's a Hard Rock Shop.

1218
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,880
If you could fit in the phone.

1219
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,760
There's a couple more in there.

1220
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,140
Now it's a Hard Rock Rock Shop.

1221
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,320
Hard Rock Rock Shop.

1222
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:05,640
Yeah, yeah.

1223
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,520
I think that actually worked better.

1224
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,240
That's great.

1225
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,560
It fits right in.

1226
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,760
It tells you everything you need to know in a way.

1227
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,960
We didn't power wash the rock.

1228
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,200
The new version.

1229
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:22,500
We didn't power wash the rock.

1230
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:27,980
99 Hard Rock Shops floating in the summer sun.

1231
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:34,060
Anyway, they even, again, the desperation of Hard Rock Cafe to be aligned with the

1232
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:37,840
Berlin Wall and the Cold War, they wanted to build a Hard Rock hotel there.

1233
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:38,760
They ended up

1234
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,120
getting rejected for that due to historical significance.

1235
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,480
Okay, but could we build just

1236
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,340
like a little shop though?

1237
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,120
Yeah, yeah, sounds good.

1238
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:45,780
You could do that.

1239
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,600
They really want you,

1240
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:51,380
when you hear Hard Rock Cafe, to think of Berlin Wall.

1241
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:54,840
Because it's the most famous piece of Hard

1242
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,300
Rock.

1243
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,120
Whoa.

1244
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,140
That's what I'm thinking.

1245
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,840
Wow, wow.

1246
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:01,720
Because they can't get a piece.

1247
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,480
The original

1248
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,360
Hard Rock.

1249
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:07,280
The wall predated the existence of Hard Rock music.

1250
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:07,580
Right.

1251
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,000
Wow.

1252
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,140
So they have all

1253
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,840
your favorite artists of rock and Hard Rock.

1254
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:16,360
And now this is literally a famous piece of Hard Rock.

1255
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,300
What else would they want?

1256
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,700
Great Wall of China, but that's not, they're not.

1257
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,160
They'd want a piece

1258
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:20,940
of that for sure.

1259
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:21,740
That's more famous.

1260
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,780
I feel like that's the more famous wall.

1261
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:24,760
Maybe more famous.

1262
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:26,000
Stonehenge.

1263
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,660
It's not really a wall though, but they're famous pieces of rock.

1264
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,580
It's Hard Rock.

1265
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,100
Yeah, you're right.

1266
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:30,520
No, you're right.

1267
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:30,780
Sorry.

1268
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:31,720
What are we arguing here?

1269
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,120
We're saying that they want

1270
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:33,820
Hard Rock.

1271
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,260
You're right.

1272
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:34,580
You're right.

1273
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,000
You're right.

1274
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,900
They would want Stonehenge.

1275
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:37,860
They'd want

1276
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,380
the Ten Commandments.

1277
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:48,920
They want to track down the actual true Moses held Ten Commandments.

1278
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,260
Right.

1279
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,480
Well, now we're actually,

1280
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:51,020
wait a minute.

1281
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,860
We don't even need a new brand that's the History Cafe.

1282
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,360
If they would just branch out

1283
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:02,480
definition of Hard Rock to be important historical Hard Rocks.

1284
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:02,740
Yes.

1285
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:03,660
Yeah.

1286
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,100
Yeah.

1287
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,080
This has to be part

1288
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:05,300
of it.

1289
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,100
This is good.

1290
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,960
What about like rocks that stoned people to death?

1291
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,460
Well, can you name a famous

1292
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:10,940
one?

1293
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,920
I know I was trying to, I don't know.

1294
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:16,040
I mean, it's the one that slayed Goliath.

1295
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,600
Oh, okay.

1296
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,260
Yeah.

1297
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:20,580
I'm in a little bit of a church peril.

1298
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:21,800
Oh, that's right.

1299
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,280
Yeah.

1300
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:22,600
Yeah.

1301
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:22,740
Yeah.

1302
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:22,900
Yeah.

1303
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,000
Yeah.

1304
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:23,660
You've been,

1305
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,440
you've been going to church.

1306
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:25,440
Yeah.

1307
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,380
Jason's been letting you say all the church stuff too.

1308
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:28,680
Yeah.

1309
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:29,400
Thanks, Jason.

1310
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:30,780
He's testing.

1311
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:31,640
Well, he's testing.

1312
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:32,080
Yeah.

1313
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:32,640
Yeah.

1314
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:32,820
Yeah.

1315
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:32,980
Yeah.

1316
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:33,180
Yeah.

1317
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:33,280
Yeah.

1318
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:33,280
Yeah.

1319
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:33,280
Yeah.

1320
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:33,280
Yeah.

1321
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,560
My catechism home.

1322
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:39,040
You guys aligning on the, you guys staying with each other has been great

1323
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,040
because I was worried I would have to put you up for a while.

1324
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,320
I got a kid in there.

1325
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:43,780
It just makes

1326
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:44,920
sense for you to stay with Jason.

1327
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,340
It makes a lot of sense.

1328
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,860
And I'm glad you've been doing it for so many days.

1329
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,100
Yeah.

1330
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,700
Me crashing with Jason's for sure.

1331
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,960
And I got, I got you, man.

1332
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,060
I know I owe you rent for a couple

1333
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,000
months now.

1334
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,480
Well, you know, yeah, you do what you can.

1335
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:56,160
Okay.

1336
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:56,580
Thanks.

1337
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:57,460
Thank you.

1338
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,000
So I didn't mean

1339
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,860
nothing, but you did win the Powerball.

1340
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:02,420
Sure.

1341
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:02,880
Yeah.

1342
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,060
Yeah.

1343
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:03,400
Yeah.

1344
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,660
You did win the Powerball.

1345
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:04,780
As

1346
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:10,260
soon as the Venice Beach Boardwalk keeper Venmo's me, I'll Venmo you.

1347
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,220
You might be waiting for a while.

1348
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:20,920
He's got a, you know, pay you in Maserati paintings that man, Michael Ferrari,

1349
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,320
Michael Ferrari, excuse me.

1350
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,540
Maserati.

1351
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:25,420
It's close.

1352
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:28,180
It's the Maserati of paintings for sure.

1353
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,380
But yeah.

1354
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:39,640
Well, as we search for significance here, do they want hard rocks because that's in their name?

1355
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,820
What is the greater meaning?

1356
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,380
Why the why?

1357
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,620
I, I, and I'm about to read a listener comment,

1358
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,780
but I also want to, I also want to read Chad Kinsell Mo in his voting for this topic.

1359
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:51,640
He said

1360
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,600
you had me at behind the hard rock cafe.

1361
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:55,940
He's right.

1362
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,160
That is definitely, that's a big,

1363
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,080
that's a big part of the why it's really strange.

1364
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,900
The mystery of it, the journey

1365
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,200
that you have to take.

1366
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,900
I actually honestly loved as I talked about yesterday, because there's so

1367
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:12,260
much space in the hard rock cafe that there's many giant empty rooms.

1368
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,140
I kind of had some moments of

1369
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:14,960
peace there.

1370
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,280
Yeah.

1371
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,800
It was otherwise a very hectic trip and I felt the same way.

1372
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:19,580
Just like getting a

1373
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:25,000
little stroll and no one's back here in the calm of night and I can't hear the imagined dragons that

1374
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,500
much.

1375
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,920
And then you go back and you reflect on history, but not really because you got to get

1376
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:34,520
back to the NBC sports grills and meet Mike to get some bad chicken sliders.

1377
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,300
But anyway, I, I think

1378
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,820
the behind is a big part of it, but here's the other one.

1379
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,620
I was so, by the time this comment was

1380
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,940
written, I was like, it has to win.

1381
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,720
And this is another comment from Chad H whose name I will not

1382
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,100
butcher.

1383
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:54,460
After he revealed that it has no graffiti because it was power washed.

1384
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,420
He kept discussing

1385
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:03,640
his love of this spot and why it's not on any map and has no signage pointing to it.

1386
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:04,660
This is almost

1387
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,100
like the, like, but he was, but a humble carpenter.

1388
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:07,460
Yeah.

1389
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,560
Not a care did he have, not a penny to his

1390
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:10,860
name.

1391
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,120
It has no signage pointing to it.

1392
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,940
To see it, you have to walk so far that it feels like you've

1393
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,580
gone somewhere you're not supposed to be.

1394
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:18,980
I ripped off your point, Chad.

1395
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,820
Your reward is a blank slab

1396
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:22,680
of concrete.

1397
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,780
It's my favorite place in all of City Walk.

1398
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,980
My own personal hemisphere dancer story to

1399
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:29,620
tell people.

1400
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,600
I would be forever delighted to have it immortalized in a saga and appreciate any support.

1401
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:38,740
And while Chad, isn't that beautiful?

1402
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:42,020
And where we've had so much like disappointment and

1403
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,240
sickness and borderline food poisoning and all of that, that can't happen here.

1404
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,000
There's no food

1405
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,720
available here.

1406
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,240
All there is to do is take a quiet walk and look at a blank slab of concrete.

1407
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:54,500
Chad,

1408
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,100
I think really put it in context.

1409
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,280
I think that is beautiful.

1410
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,300
And I think, yeah, I think anybody who

1411
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:04,380
goes down there, go and check it out and take a couple of minutes and appreciate it because

1412
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:09,880
I think it's very soon where the plant life will completely overtake it.

1413
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,620
The way it looks like things are going.

1414
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,600
They're letting some, I don't know, tree or bushes sort of

1415
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,580
start to get in the way.

1416
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:18,140
Yeah.

1417
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:18,240
Yeah.

1418
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:18,360
Yeah.

1419
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,820
So I just appreciate it while you can.

1420
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:20,240
That's what I'm

1421
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:20,380
saying.

1422
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,180
Not be available to see soon enough.

1423
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:22,500
Yeah.

1424
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,460
And do you, one of you have pictures?

1425
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,760
We took some pictures, but I didn't find them on my phone.

1426
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,240
I think I might have them on my

1427
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:29,640
phone.

1428
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,600
Yeah, we took some very somber photos.

1429
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,580
So you will see us paying our tributes, but honestly,

1430
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:37,680
the face that we're making, it's less about what happened now.

1431
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,600
And I think more about what Chad

1432
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,660
said about it.

1433
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,180
When you see the pictures, think of us paying homage to that, these sentiments.

1434
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:48,820
Yeah.

1435
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:49,700
You know what?

1436
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,720
I think this was a nice little bit of calm.

1437
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:52,440
Yeah.

1438
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,220
And we got,

1439
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,020
there's less people listening now.

1440
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,140
I feel the calm of that too.

1441
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,020
Smaller audience.

1442
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:58,560
We're only

1443
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,520
friends here.

1444
00:52:59,880 --> 00:52:59,880
Yes.

1445
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:01,540
An intimate moment.

1446
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:02,000
Wow.

1447
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,940
You know, we do always sign off with that,

1448
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:07,980
the optimist prime line.

1449
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,880
And I guess we, yeah, we are providing a moment of intimacy.

1450
