00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
FOREVER! DOG!

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
A sublime hot topic and bill of bong

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
A place where you can purchase a candy thong

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So let's go take a walk

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's all go to City Walk

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Tonight

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Podcast The Ride presents

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The City Walk Saga

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A 19 part, extremely necessary series

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Exploring the stores, restaurants, and wonderful magic that make up

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Universal City Walk Hollywood

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The City Walk Saga, Sector 2

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We're here, we're very early in the run of this

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Great endeavor

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And I want to say, because I don't think we said it in the first one, our theme song

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
For this saga, music and lyrics by our very own music maestro

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Mike Carlson, who is here today

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Vocalz, sung by the great Zach Reno

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Our dear friend from the Off Book Podcast

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And of course, Scott Gairdner

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Am I looking sharp today?

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You are looking sharp, and you're

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The finder, Scott, you always impress me with

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh, now we're just being nice to each other, that's nice

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You find these amazing oddities of rides and theme parks and you're very good at searching archives

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The research is very good

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That has been a nice thing about this podcast, I have always had this weird

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Wanting to dig and find some little off

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Find one thing that's not on the Wikipedia of the rides

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I think we owe the audience that

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
There's some fun odd stuff in this sector and throughout this whole

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Series, I'm looking forward to it, and in case people didn't realize, this is the proof

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That we really are, we've never done two days in a row of episodes

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And we've certainly never done 19 days in a row, here we are

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's really happening, and the other thing that's really happening is that we are joined once again by

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The great spirit who overlooks City Walk and guides

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Us into these sectors, it's the Sector Keeper

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Hello Sector Keeper, very good

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Good to see you, your strength brings me strength

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Wonderful, we have a long way to go, we have to rebuild you

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
All the way up to being alive again

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes, being alive and then allowing me to die and go to heaven

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I guess that is what we're doing

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And I thank you, you're on this journey

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This journey is exciting, yes?

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You already look a little better since the first one

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I can feel the blood coming back to my face

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I can feel that as you

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Go into more sectors, I will grow more into my soul

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And also on top of that, color is coming back

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
To your face, and you're also becoming less translucent like a Back to the Future

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Photo, and we can see you much more clearly

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Now, I think your opacity levels have raised at least 3%

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes, check out my shirt

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh, that was one of your favorites back in 1993

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
When you left this mortal coil

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah, don't read

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Well, we don't want to get into it

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Billy West, on the other hand, still a prolific great

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Voiceover actor, and he ended up taking over

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
For Ren, and in some ways was even better

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah, absolutely, very nice

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So there's still good men out there, and I hope we're among them

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Oh, then we can help you

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We're in Sector 2 today, great Sector Keeper

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Boys, gather round, gather round, in order to attain the Sector 2 Stone

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Please discuss Dodgers Clubhouse Store

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The Crepe Cafe, Sock Market

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Future Italian Restaurant, and

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The now retired Upstart Crow

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay, can do, we are ready, willing, and able, yes?

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Sephora also part of this

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He was testing us to make sure

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Well, I can understand why you wouldn't want to

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Bring it up, but sorry, we have to do the accounting

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
In case you're joining us for Episode 2, Sector Keeper Perish in the City Walk

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Fountain, which we'll cover in a few sectors, and that one might be a dark one for you

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We'll try to keep things light, and we can keep things light right now by talking about

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The Dodgers Clubhouse Store

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Go Dodgers! They're one of the great LA teams represented at

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
City Walk, well the only great LA team as the Raiders Store

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Has not been an LA team for some time

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But the Dodgers certainly are the pride of LA

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And it's a great store. I can recognize, look, I'm a guy who likes

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Like collecting crap, you can see it in the apartment, I have a lot of toys

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
There are graphic novels, which by the way

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Right as I was talking, I got a little distracted, because I was looking at your Leonardo

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Over there, does he have a penis? No, no, no, that's his tail

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
His tail, let me see if I can actually move it, so you're right, it does look like it's just got

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
A little dangly penis happening here

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's kind of just stuck there

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We're going to have to pose it very much like his penis

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, give it a tug until it's clearly not a penis

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There was a limited run

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Dynamic forces, limited run of ones where you did see

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Leonardo's hog, but no, that's definitely supposed to be a tail

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's supposed to be a tail, and it's probably anatomically correct as far as a turtle is concerned

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If a turtle was standing upright, his tail would just be dangling there right between his legs

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Why did they need to represent this? Because that's not on a suit or anything

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This is a mondo turtle, mondo is a company that makes posters and

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Different toys, and there's two different heads, one is the red bandanna

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
For Leonardo, because they all had red in the original Mirage comic, they did not have

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The color bandannas, so I believe this is more of a gritty

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Ninja turtle, a more original design, and I think the original designs

106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Had the little tails, had the penises, had the little penises dangling

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Not Fort Shildren

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It probably says that on the box, adult collectors

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You keep it out and open, you display penis

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Well I think it's cool, because it's a nice design for the toy

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
In future, all adult men have Ninja Turtles with penises

112
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay, let's get back to the dodger story

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Kind of a mic specific

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I have just some collectibles, I call them collectibles is what happens

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
They're not toys necessarily, that's your euphemism for your sex toys

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Adults buy toys

117
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's a lot to explain, in a future sector there's a store

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That sells collectibles like this, things from another world

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So we can probably talk more about adult collectibles then

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This is how much we're avoiding

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Talking about sports stuff, I was just trying to talk about turtle dicks

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I steered it right into stuff I liked when I was six

123
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
This is you getting in the head of a sports freak

124
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That's what I was trying to do

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Right, I was imagining, say this was a Ninja Turtles store

126
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And it was at City Walk, if they had the amount

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And different types of merchandise and clothing, I would be in heaven

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
If it was just multiple different Michelangelo toys and t-shirts with Casey Jones

129
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And every version of Casey Jones, it was movie Casey, an early cartoon Casey

130
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And Mirage Comic Casey, but also Archie Comics Casey

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Which is a different set of turtle comics that were running at the same time

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I would have been, oh my gosh, it would have been heaven for me

133
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So I'm saying it's a good store because I imagined my interest being the Ninja Turtles thing that I liked

134
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
When I was a little boy

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
This metaphor would apply to anything though, Sephora, imagine if Sephora instead of makeup

136
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You have Ninja Turtles things and you've got every type of

137
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Well now you're making all the stores sound really great to me, so you're right about that

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm just saying the amount and the quantity of things even more so than even

139
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Like if we're talking about Billabong

140
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Which I felt didn't have as much merchandise and didn't have as many options

141
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
For whatever, their board shorts and their skateboard decks or whatever

142
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm talking about Dodger's, the place was packed, it's a crowded store

143
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't have any merchandise, that's sort of especially what I'm saying and that's why I'm trying to pay it a compliment

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Do I care about any of it? No, I don't give a shit, it's the Dodgers, it's baseball

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I like going to the game, I like all that stuff, but if we're talking

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
If it was a Ninja Turtles store

147
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Here's a fun fact about the Dodgers, the name comes from, the Dodgers were originally from Brooklyn

148
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yes, yeah, another fun fact in and of itself

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah, and once when I was in New York I took one of those double decker bus tours

150
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And the real New York guy giving the bus tour was very

151
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Adamant about, the Dodgers should have never left Brooklyn

152
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Even the name is Brooklyn, because there used to be these very cumbersome

153
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Trolleys that would come down the avenues in Brooklyn and that's how people

154
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Would get around in the early 20th century

155
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And they would spark, they were constantly sparking from the top

156
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But then they also didn't have great braking systems, so people would dodge out

157
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Of the way when the trolleys were like coming down

158
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That's a weird, so they named the baseball team after like, getting out of the way

159
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Of public transit, that's weird, that's very weird

160
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And those were the days man, leaping away from fires

161
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And giant gnarling mechanisms that might smash into me

162
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You used to name baseball teams after avoiding accidents

163
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah, can't believe they kept that name when they moved to Chavez Ravine

164
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Texas duckers, you would have to duck out of the way of gunfire

165
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh the gunfire, they're always shooting those guns down in Texas

166
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The duckers should have stayed in Texas, okay, the Baltimore

167
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Maymes, I guess they're Maymes because they aren't the

168
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Maymers, if you're getting the maimers, the collateral damages

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The collateral damages, damages, damages

170
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Oh yeah, I guess that works too, collateral damages, maybe, correct, yes

171
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm sure there are in all sports teams related to the hurricane

172
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Avoiders, the punch blockers

173
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Local maladies should always be the source of team names

174
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That is interesting, that is fun, I agree

175
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Can you imagine being a sports fan listening to this, we can't name one player

176
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
People punching their radio or their phone

177
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Stop it, feeding up their own podcast

178
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You wanna hear about Pweeg, you fucking nerd

179
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You seal Pweeg

180
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So yeah, I gotta say, it's a great store, I thought it was cool

181
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's a lot, if you're a Dodgers fan, you'll find something there

182
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's packed, it's like everything they have at Dodgers Stadium, all in one tiny

183
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
city walk location, you can make a custom jersey which I think is cool

184
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You used to be able to get Dodgers dogs up there, oh is that true, in that store

185
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
There was like a hot dog stand next to it, or outside of it, but it's gone

186
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
They did used to have Dodger dogs within the park, and I would get those

187
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
on my lunch breaks as a tour guide, and then I remembered

188
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
that hot dogs are not good to have many

189
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
times a week, no yeah, nitrates, too many nitrates

190
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I love hot dogs, you and me both sector keepers

191
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You are a child, we miss the days when we could eat

192
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
this way, although for Jason those days persist

193
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
How many hot dogs a week are you eating, 5, 6?

194
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Well here's the thing with hot dogs, when you're a single man and you buy a pack of hot dogs

195
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You're gonna want to freeze some, because you're gonna get sick of them quick

196
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Cause like, you know, if I buy hot dogs, I'm gonna be eating hot dogs

197
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
for a few meals that week, you still buy hot dogs in the store?

198
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
How often other than a cookout are you buying hot dogs?

199
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Once every 6 weeks or so?

200
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You buy hot dogs once at home? Every sector keeper, you look shocked

201
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Like what? You eat hot dogs at home?

202
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That's interesting, cause I haven't bought hot dogs for a while, maybe I did it once

203
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
like 7 or 8 years ago, I'm not anti-hot dog

204
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
If I go to a baseball game I have a hot dog, but I haven't bought hot dogs other than for a cookout

205
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
in years. Well sometimes they'll switch it up and do like a kielbasa

206
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Or like, if that week, if it's like, oh I'll make

207
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
pasta, you know, pasta with sauce and sausage

208
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You could buy a sausage. Cause like a hot dog really is just bologna

209
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's the exact same thing as bologna really, it's just like this weird

210
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
processed meat. You get the good ones, you get like the kosher, you know, the Nathan's

211
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Well of course there's quality to bologna as well, I'm just saying if you get an Oscar Meyer hot dog or Oscar Meyer

212
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
bologna, it's basically the same thing. You've really turned me off with that, I've never been a bologna

213
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
guy. Oh so now I've put you off of hot dogs even more

214
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
See we weren't a bologna household, but we were a hot dog household, we always had hot dogs

215
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'll say we were a bologna household and a liver sausage household, which is insane

216
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Oscar Meyer liver sausage in that like tube, sector keeper

217
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
you know what I'm talking about? Did you have that when you were alive? Yes, my father would

218
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
eat liver sausage sandwiches and you spread it

219
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yes it's a spread. So this is different than liverwurst, which is similar

220
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
We would have liverwurst, scrapple, east coast we would have

221
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I've heard of scrapple. I've never had that. This is all like, I don't know why we were eating like depression

222
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
era food in the 1980s and 1990s, but we were. And in the 2010s

223
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Well for Jason, yes, he's still eating scrapple

224
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I, look, I still, my baby boomer parents, you know, I still like

225
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
go to the grocery store, it's like alright, need bread milk eggs, you know

226
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'll often be like, mom why were we eating liver

227
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
sausage? Like it's crazy, it's like what even was it?

228
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
My family eats very traditionally and I'll get text messages

229
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
from my younger sister who's, I think

230
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
prone to misspellings and the autocorrects don't always work out and she was complaining

231
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
about the poor quality of the meal they had, ham over rice

232
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
but also, which is a horrible. Ham over rice? Over. I was

233
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
like, why was it dressed up with over? Did my mom tonight

234
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
have ham over rice? And you would not have that as a child growing up. No, that was not a common

235
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
that's apparently new in the Gairdner household, but the other thing was

236
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
she was complaining about the smell of the food that was being prepared all day

237
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
in the cock pot. This was a text message

238
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I see, I see. That's good, that's funny. So funny, seeing cock pot

239
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
in print. Leonardo cooks in a cock pot. He's a walking

240
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
cock pot. See, a nice ham dinner, I would, I feel like we

241
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
defaulted to all gratin potatoes. Yeah, that makes sense

242
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's a fancy potato. Rice is not a thing anyone does. Were you a ham family?

243
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
We were not. Oh yeah, ham, pork loins. Pork loins, really?

244
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah, pork chops, I feel like we stopped, we used to be

245
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
a lot of pork chops, but I think as we got older, we were all like, these are

246
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
dry and kind of like, and then we switched to pork loins, which tend to be a lot

247
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
juicier and flavorful. Interesting. If you're just joining us, this is Podcast

248
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
the Ride, the podcast about theme parks and rides

249
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and amusement parks. And processed meats. And processed meats.

250
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
We ate as children. And facts about, oh no. Oh, sector keeper, we have to keep moving.

251
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Boys, boys, please continue with

252
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
the crepe cafe. Well, this is, I mean, this is all me, cause I

253
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
This ties right back into food. Yeah, this ties right back into food. So I went to the crepe

254
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
cafe. I had a caramel crepe

255
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
and I thought it was good. I really like crepes.

256
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I don't get them often. I feel like it's not a thing you get

257
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
like on the go or out and about in America a lot. It's not like

258
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
an everyday, it's not like a hot dog. Yeah, it's not like my beloved hot

259
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
dogs, but I do like crepes. I mean, this one was essentially like, you know,

260
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
caramel syrup or spread in the kind of thin

261
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
crepey pancake. My big complaint about this

262
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
crepe cafe though is they served it to you on a styrofoam plate. If you had

263
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
a crepe before, you kind of got to saw through it like a crepe. You got

264
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
to saw through it a bit, but like when you're doing that, when you're putting that

265
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
extra oomph into like cutting it, if you hit the plate, it's

266
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
styrofoam, like that, you don't want bits of styrofoam

267
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
like flying everywhere. When you were trying to cut the crepe, did you ever like meet the

268
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
metal of the table with the plastic knife?

269
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Well, no, because I had the plate was on a tray

270
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
and I never cut through the plate, but I like, you know,

271
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
ding the styrofoam a bit. I scored it.

272
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So I would say like crepe cafe, switch to paper plates. Come on, what are you

273
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
doing? Also styrofoam in this day and age, like we know it's bad. But paper plates look so,

274
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
so cheap. Don't you think the presentation would suffer if you weren't?

275
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
No, you can get nice higher quality paper plates.

276
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Stock paper plate. I think styrofoam looks cheaper. I can help.

277
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh, yes. Yes, I'll put in a word. With the distributors?

278
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yes, yes, yes. I think that's smart. It seems like it's a

279
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
maybe a profit margins situation. It's, I'm sure

280
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
styrofoam is cheaper than like heavy duty paper. Do you think the crepe

281
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
cafe is having financial troubles and all crepe

282
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
restaurant outside of the... It's been there a while though. This is hanging on.

283
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's survived a few generations of city walk. Was there a crepe craze?

284
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
At some point? I feel like there's been attempts at it

285
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
but like... It's been in fits and starts with the crepe craze. It never hit like frozen yogurt did.

286
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It never hit like donuts did. Which is interesting that you bring that up because

287
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
the other thing about the crepe cafe is they have a whole side of the menu

288
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
that is like European style, like Belgian fries with

289
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
a variety of dipping sauces. Which is

290
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
interesting because it's like there are savory crepes.

291
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Question mark, not me. I don't, it seems like they're like

292
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
the crepes aren't cutting it. We need something else. And fries are

293
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I mean that's a profit. Do we know is that, is there anywhere in the world where

294
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
a crepe in a Belgian fry is a meal? Maybe in Europe

295
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I guess. Perhaps in Europe. But like Jason's Kitchen

296
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Oh, I'm not, these are labor intensive foods.

297
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
He doesn't have a fryer. I don't have a fryer. An oven fryer, I don't know about oven fries.

298
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Like that's a dicey proposition. You don't buy oven fries ever? Not usually, no.

299
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
A bag of oven fries? Not, yeah I don't think. You're making a face like I'm making you sick.

300
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
No, I mean I like to like slice up a sweet potato

301
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and dress it with olive oil and bake that a little. That's real good. So it's like

302
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
it's kind of like a fry. It's kind of, but like I find oven fries like those

303
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
orida oven fries in a bag. I hear what you're saying. Very dry. You just gave

304
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
a clue if any young eligible podcast the ride

305
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
fans out there want to seduce old Jason Sheridan. I made you

306
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
your favorite sweet potato drizzled in olive oil.

307
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
With hot dogs. With hot dogs as a side. And a scrapple

308
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
in a glass. A scrapple is like a loaf, it's kind of a loaf

309
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
a meat, meat-ish loaf. What a first word

310
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
to describe to make something attractive. This is a breakfast meat. So you cut slices

311
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and you grill it up so the inside is soft and the outside is crispy. If you go to

312
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
a diner outside of Philadelphia or in South Jersey and you look at the breakfast section

313
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
your meat choices are many and various. You're talking

314
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
bacon, sausage, hot Italian sausage, sweet Italian sausage

315
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
scrapple, pork roll. Keep going. Leonardo

316
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
dick. Leonardo dick. You're a ghost

317
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
too? No, I'm very much alive. I'm

318
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
a 32 going on 33 year old band. You talk like from the 1930s.

319
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I don't, you know, you just, you watch enough

320
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
like Nick at Night and syndicated like Colgate

321
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
variety hour shows that should have burned up in fires

322
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
but were somehow preserved. I like that by the end of this we'll realize that Jason is

323
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
truly a child ghost from the 1930s and is beginning like hard

324
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
tack. Who was diving out of the way of a

325
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
cable car careening down the hill and maybe the spark

326
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
created kind of a lightning bolt back to the future thing. And he wanted to be a

327
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Pittsburgh diver, a baseball player when he was older. Pittsburgh diver.

328
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Anyway, I liked crepe cafe fine.

329
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I think that $8.50 caramel crepe was okay. I

330
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
thought my popcornopolis experience was a lot more fun so

331
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I didn't try any of the savory crepes. You like popcornopolis sector keeper? So many

332
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
flavors. It's great. Very fun. It's a fun name. Fun. Yeah.

333
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Well, you know, there's right next door there's a lot of flavors

334
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
of socks at, well it's not right next door never mind. Fuck.

335
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I want to talk about the sock market. That's what I'm saying. Sure, yeah.

336
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
The Los Angeles sock market, not to be confused with the

337
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Las Vegas sock market or the San Francisco

338
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
sock market. So this is a, there's three of them all told and the name

339
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
changes depending on where you are. Obviously it's a great pun.

340
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Did you guys clock it as

341
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
a stock market? Like

342
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
something about removing the T, like the pun was not cleared in the end until I thought

343
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
about it for a while. I, like many people that

344
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
pass through City Walk for the first so many years of living in Los Angeles and going to City Walk

345
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I didn't even register that it was there. But then when I was aware of the

346
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
name, the sock market, I think I did not think about it until

347
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
maybe we started doing this series, we talked about doing this saga

348
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and then it was like, oh the sock market, oh

349
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
okay, oh stock, okay. Like it was truly not a

350
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
like I didn't, the first time I saw it I didn't like stand there looking at it and laughing and going oh my

351
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
god that's the greatest. The best jokes take years to hit you.

352
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
The logo makes it kind of obvious but they really should have gone

353
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
harder with like a graph of arrows pointing up and there's a little of it

354
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
but it should be like. Like a picture of Ben Bernanke or something. There should be Ben Bernanke

355
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
there should be Alan Greenspan. Well on the

356
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
website of the sock market there is

357
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
some literature in the About Us about the head of the Federal Reserve

358
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Board, I'm not sure why that's changed. Why there's a D at the end of that.

359
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Don't know, but the head of the Federal Reserve Board is Alan

360
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Seem Span. So they did Sockify

361
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm getting all these but I don't care for them. Like I don't

362
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Yeah getting does not equal approval. Yeah it's that, that bugs me

363
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
when like you can tell when a company is putting a joke or something out

364
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
there but it's like god it's making my skin crawl how this is like

365
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
was approved but it's not landing. Uh huh. Well

366
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I think the sock market itself is full of things that might hit that same

367
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
criteria. Oh for sure. There's a lot of great sock

368
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
comedy going on. Oh my gosh. I mean everybody feel free to

369
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
call stuff out. What I think this if you had to ballpark

370
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
it does this it's not a bit it's a retail spa that is

371
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
not any bigger than this this living room and I think there are I think there are

372
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
seven thousand types of socks. Yeah it's like more almost as

373
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
packed as the Dodger's store. And it's split between like novelty

374
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
and like porno socks. Like sexy

375
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
socks. Mike I can see on your computer. Well they call it X-rated is what they have.

376
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
If you go on the website there's different categories and they have men's, women's and kids

377
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
and then there's shop by design and that says like you can shop by age, animal

378
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
argyle, comic, fashion, name socks, novelty patterns, sports and there's collections

379
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
flag, artist, photo, NFL player, sports team and then

380
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
X-rated. And of course you gotta go right to

381
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
X-rated and I'll just start with my favorite sector keeper.

382
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So we're gonna do some bad language here. So if I

383
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
get I have some allowance would you boys

384
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
go in and buy me some? Oh cause you can't go in and

385
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
buy it cause it's too it's X-rated so I wouldn't feel right.

386
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I feel like I could go to jail if I buy you some of these socks. I'll buy you some Homer Simpson socks or

387
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
like some Batman socks but not that. I'll say

388
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
this though sector keeper you're not aware is that now in this

389
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
modern age a lot of things are online so if you can get your hands on

390
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
a credit card. Online? Computer, computer like in the lab

391
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
at school. People have those in their homes now. Where you play Oregon Trail on?

392
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Yes. So they're like much more advanced now and you can buy things on

393
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
the computer so I would say if you can find a credit card

394
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
you could buy socks and just pretend you're an adult.

395
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Oh well I'm dead so. That might be dicey.

396
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It might be hard. But maybe maybe. Can you pick pocket

397
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
like a person at city walk and get their credit card?

398
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It says you have that ability? Yes well yes I could do

399
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
that. I have to continue my training much like Patrick Swayze in the

400
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
movie Ghost where. Oh right. So I'm still working

401
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
on this. Your ability to manipulate the real world. Yeah my abilities my abilities.

402
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
You can appear on podcasts and hold microphones but reaching into somebody's

403
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
pocket is a little complicated. It might be a little complicated. So there's like a Vincent Schiavelli

404
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
type at city walk also that you've been training with? Another ghost

405
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
man I guess? City walk is

406
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
filled with ghosts. Oh wow

407
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
really? Yes. Really? They walk amongst the entire city yes.

408
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So dimensionally you'll never see them. But you

409
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
will never see them. But I see them yes. That sounds horrible. Yeah that's like a scary thing. That's like part of your burden

410
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
to bear. Um yeah it's awful.

411
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
They just took out the upstart crow which is in this sector

412
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
in the crow's nest and that had a big scary crow on the

413
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
outside. I mean it was for children but it scared me. Is that crow

414
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
stomping around city walk and only you see him? That crow is

415
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
the devil's best friend is what we call him. Oh my gosh. Yes yes.

416
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Are you afraid of him like snapping your head off

417
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
or something with his giant ghost beak? Sometimes yes but other times

418
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'll cut deals with him and I'll feed him Menchies and he'll leave

419
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
me alone. Oh okay you know how to distract him. Yes. This is your

420
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
smart for a little one. Oh thank you. Yeah you can manipulate

421
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
ghost birds. I would just be careful of that like ghost artful dodger

422
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
that's training orphan ghosts at city walk to pick pocket

423
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
nests. Boys boys boys this is why it's so important to

424
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
rescue me. Oh okay right right. We're not even close to okay let's talk about these

425
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
X-rated socks to save your soul. X-rated socks alright. My

426
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
favorite sock and the X-rated sock section is

427
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
a sock that has like clouds and like stars maybe and it

428
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
says carpe the fuck out of this DM.

429
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Uh. Yeah so sorry for

430
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
swearing and cursing. That's hurting my spirit.

431
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Yeah so that's like the first sock you see when you're on the X-rated section

432
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
the next sock. When I thought you said wine.

433
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
The next sock is as aggressive

434
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and it just says but it's less clever even which the other one wasn't clever

435
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
it just says don't let anyone fuck with you and that's

436
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
it. What? It just says don't let anyone fuck with you. I don't

437
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
know if you're a person who needs that reminder on their socks if you really get

438
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
strength from that and you're going to your job and you know some supervisor

439
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
is gonna give you a flack. You're like yeah cause like

440
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
there's a big or yeah you're like I gotta talk to the boss today and you're like I'm gonna put on my

441
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
don't let anyone fuck with you socks. Put on my agro socks

442
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
my encouragement socks. No one's gonna fuck with you today. You're the

443
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
star. Are you trying to distribute that information to someone else

444
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
because it's facing out so other people will read it. Well no it's not facing out

445
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
it's on your feet. It says don't let anyone fuck with you like on

446
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
this part of your sock. Oh okay. So it's just for you. It's just a little special surprise

447
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
for you. If you take your shoes off. Yes. Or if you're wearing

448
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
sandals. Sandals with garish printed socks? Yeah

449
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
which case you're probably a great candidate for someone to fuck with you.

450
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Yeah. Those are the two

451
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I would say from X when they're calling them X-rated

452
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
those are the only two with like F's fucks in them on the website.

453
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Okay good. But then when we were in the store I noticed there are

454
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
actual like lingerie and fishnet stocking

455
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
but there is actual like sexy stuff for sale. That's one of a few places you can get stockings

456
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Hot Topic being the other one although they're of course deemed to Harley Quinn

457
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
at Hot Topic. Sure. But yeah you can get stuff like that

458
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Yeah they call them X-rated. Oh you know I take that

459
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
back there's an F word on a woman's sock and it just says I gave a fuck

460
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
once. That's one of them.

461
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
So cynical. These socks are so cynical. Sorry sector keeper.

462
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm just going to run. I'm going to read a bunch of them real quick.

463
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Alright these are the women's socks. Get shit done later.

464
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Don't judge me. Good slash bad weed.

465
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Hellraiser. I don't care. I'm high.

466
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I hate everyone. Kick this day in its

467
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
sunshiny ass. Love you weirdo.

468
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
My favorite salad is wine. And then stay away

469
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
from assholes. My favorite salad

470
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
is wine? Yes. This doesn't make any more sense to us

471
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
the adults who are a lot. Future weird? Future weird.

472
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Future Winter is like random. It's like seriously random.

473
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
If you knew how random it was in 2018. Random equal

474
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
funny? It does. For some people. Yes it does.

475
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Commercials think they're funny and they do a lot

476
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
of random humor and then people will say like oh that's

477
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
so random. So that's like what it's like in 2018.

478
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
That's a random punchline? Well

479
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
sometimes not. Yeah these are all socks

480
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
for someone who you would describe as like lot going on or

481
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
coming in hot. But there's other

482
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
there's other socks. There's other socks. There's lots of

483
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
cute like dogs and cat socks. Well and socks through which you can

484
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
proudly represent your sexual preferences

485
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
like the sock with an arrow pointing up at you

486
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
that says under that I think he's gay.

487
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Really? What? He must feel while wearing that. Or the sorges

488
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
talk about pride. The sock that just says proud with rainbow letters.

489
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I mean that's nice. That's good. Next to which and proud is stacked

490
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
between bitch and boobies.

491
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
This is quite an array. Lesson. And just a couple of notches

492
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
over from bacon. Yes I see on the website there's a lot of bacon stuff.

493
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Oh so that's another 2018 comedy thing? Bacon and stuff being described

494
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
as epi- bacon. It's hopefully on its way out. People love

495
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
bacon. Again tiring. Things being called the pizza of other things.

496
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Beyonce is the pizza of music. I thought you were going to say pizza of bacon.

497
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Beyonce is the pizza of bacon. Jason is trying to push

498
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Beyonce is the scrapple of bacon. Yeah I think it's

499
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
time. I think it's time we moved on to bacon and I tried to do pork

500
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
roll a few years ago but the north jersey people got very upset because they call it Taylor Ham.

501
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
It's a whole thing. It's a whole regional fight. But now we have an audience so if our audience would

502
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
please say instead of like bacon or pizza say scrapple

503
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
please. Well scrapple is the new thing. And

504
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
beseech the- go to the- find the official Twitter of the

505
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
sock maker gumball poodle and demand that they

506
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
put next to their bacon sock. A sock that says

507
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
scrapple. And then maybe Jason you could get one of those and another one that says proud.

508
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So you could have proud and scrapple. Sure. So you could show your pride for your

509
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
scrapple. Elon Musk will like tweet scrapple when he's talking about

510
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
like a cool thing. That's when we all will have made it as a podcast. Elon Musk is a

511
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
cool man in the future. He's good and not at all bad.

512
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Oh yeah if you were curious who the coolest man is in 2018. He's

513
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
a bounty hunter?

514
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Well I mean he certainly is a company he's gonna set up to do

515
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
that. But it's gonna be in 20 years it's gonna be made. Only hunting rabble rousing

516
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
union drive organizers. That's true. No as far

517
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
as I know I think he's just like hanging out with the Rick and Morty

518
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
staff. But he's not a writer. He doesn't help with Rick and

519
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Morty but he's with them a lot. Funding like

520
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
real shady comedy endeavor or is he-

521
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
we don't know. There's a lot going on in Southern California. He's stealing

522
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
the staff of the onion. Right stealing the staff. There's some juxtaposition

523
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
that I noticed in the sock market. There was

524
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
a weed leaf socks but they were

525
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
right next to the NYPD socks so

526
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
that's a lot. That's a trap. That is

527
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
a trap. And also

528
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
my favorite juxtaposition in the store a sock

529
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
with a screaming Donald Trump on it placed next to

530
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
a sock with Vladimir Putin.

531
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Which to me is like I do think if I posted this

532
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
on the Donald's reddit it might create a furor

533
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
like what are they doing? They're trying to at

534
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
you know at these Hollywood these liberal locations they're trying to

535
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
you know marry these two figures in people's heads via

536
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
socks but there's no collusion. So like yeah Trump would go on

537
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
a tweet storm railing against the sock market. I think Trump might tweet

538
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
about this if he saw it. Or he might say why can't

539
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
we why can't I be on a sock next to a sock of one of our so-called

540
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
enemies? What bad does that do for us? I think we should do this. We should post

541
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
this on reddit. We have people we know who are on reddit a lot. Maybe today

542
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
yeah let's see how far it goes. We will get this going on the

543
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
day of this episode and see if we can will will Trump tweet about

544
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
it by you know four hours later. And I will make

545
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
a sock puppet account no pun intended. Oh I see. For like

546
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
our the resistance and say like the sock market is clearly

547
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
a Kremlin backed psy-op. The sock

548
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
market and clearly Wolfgang Puck

549
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
had early knowledge about it because Wolfgang Puck Express or

550
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Wolfgang Puck dining got out of there. They got out of the next door location.

551
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
He got out of it. Yep. Mueller knows all this

552
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
or Mueller is daddy or 76 year old. And Mueller is

553
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
dressed as Rocket Raccoon in a meme that you post. Yeah.

554
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I want to how about the proud you wear one sock that says proud and

555
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
another sock that says QAnon. Why aren't they appealing to the QAnon crowd?

556
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
You know we could also just go back and like start to

557
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
make our own juxtaposition. Like you could just take the Trump sock and put it

558
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
next to different ones and then be like look what they're stocking next to. Like we could

559
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
create our own narrative. Oh yeah. Via the socks

560
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and create maybe a whole like conspiracy theory web of

561
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
like a narrative that the sock market is trying to push. Yeah. And really get this thing going.

562
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
The sock market is creating a narrative and planning clues. A real number

563
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
23 sort of. We could also make

564
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
our own socks and like put them in there. Like try to

565
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
like add them to the show. Like so like make a Stormy Daniels sock

566
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
and just add it to the like the pin next to the Donald Trump

567
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
sock. We could do a whole. I mean that's maybe a bit too ambitious

568
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
but it's a good idea I think. We can do the low five version of this.

569
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Yeah. We might be able to imply that Trump is interested in seizing the fuck

570
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
out of this DM. You know he'd say what you want

571
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
about Trump. He seizes the fuck out of every DM. Yeah. From like 11 to

572
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
3 PM. He seizes the fuck out of a

573
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
small percentage of each DM. He's on a European work day.

574
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Oh. Oh yeah. We've been at this extra

575
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
for a while. Boys please move on to future

576
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Italian restaurants. It's okay. Future Italian restaurants. Is it going to be open by the time

577
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
we. I don't know when the opening date is. So it's

578
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
called Il Vino and this is an Italian restaurant concept that Universal

579
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
first introduced. Universal Orlando CityWalk is coming here.

580
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It seems like it's well reviewed in Orlando so I'm excited to have a new food

581
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
option at CityWalk. It used to be a Wolfgang Puck. I

582
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
don't know that a full spot more like a. Are you going to keep going to restaurants

583
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
at CityWalk when this is done? Well it's new.

584
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
But not a full spago level

585
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Wolfgang Puck experience. I'm just saying I've consumed my body's weight

586
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
and sodium while doing all this. Yeah I mean I went to. We're only two

587
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
sectors in. I went to Margaritaville. You've got to drink some water.

588
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Drink some electrolyte water. For not the CityWalk saga I

589
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
went to just Margaritaville the other day just with my friend to eat. How dare you.

590
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So like I'm just saying I'm still going casually. Yeah.

591
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Oh boy. I think I might be. I might need a break.

592
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
But we'll see. You know things are still. We've got a long ways to go.

593
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
That's a long and short of the Italian restaurant. That place is replacing

594
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Wolfgang Puck. Yeah. Again kind of a more like

595
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
casual Wolfgang Puck. I never really ate there. It didn't

596
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
seem like the full Wolfgang Puck experience. It seemed closer to like the Wolfgang Pucks

597
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
that are like at LAX. Hey guess what. I've got a

598
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
yeah it was okay. I mean by CityWalk standards it was decent. I've actually got a fact

599
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
about one of the neon signs that is above. I'm not sure if it's above

600
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
this restaurant but it's in this sector and it's restaurant related.

601
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So all of the neon signs at CityWalk were all bought by the Museum of

602
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Neon Art and Universal cut a deal to bring up all of their

603
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
you know their biggest signs and display them.

604
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Make it as you know kinetic street art up there and there is a sign

605
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
for a place called Condi's which I think was maybe in like Altadena or in the

606
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
San Gabriel Valley somewhere and there's two where there's a face

607
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
of a chef on it and apparently there was two

608
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
brothers and they would switch off who was facing the public and

609
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
seating people and who was back in the kitchen making the food so they would change the sign

610
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
every six months based on which brother was going to be cooking. Oh my

611
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
god that's so fun. Yeah. The Museum of Neon Art if you're ever in

612
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Los Angeles very cool. Which is now in Glendale. Now in Glendale. It has moved

613
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
to a different mall, the mall where Bug Main lives.

614
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
There's several attractions, the Museum of Neon Art

615
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
and omnipresence of Bug Main and Susan Lucci?

616
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Yes that is the rumor that Susan Lucci. Oh. Are we allowed to say

617
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
that? Is this a dox? Well I think that's more public I think than the spirit

618
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
of Bug Main. I mean Bug Main is all around us. It's part of the mythology

619
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
of the mountain. Oh okay. He lives there I think. Alright as long as that's public. Yeah

620
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
but anyway much like Bug Main and his

621
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
multiple identities this Conde sign would change

622
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
and shift shapes. That's cool. Yeah that's just a fun fact. That is a fun fact.

623
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I'm not sure which, like is it

624
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
well he's got a chef's hat so I guess it would be the chef one

625
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
who they would portray. But anyway next time you're up there appreciate

626
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
that Conde sign and in fact all of the great neon art. The neon art

627
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
yeah terrific. And okay Wolfgang Puck we talked about Sephora

628
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I don't know what I got to say about Sephora. It's a

629
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
yeah it seems nice. It's one of the new locations at both downtown

630
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Disney and City Walk. Present at both the other being Starbucks. Both sides of

631
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
the line. Yeah. I hate to be such like a little boy about it but like Lindsey

632
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
goes in there and I like kind of wander around and be like oh well I'm gonna go to another store

633
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
oh I'll meet up with you later mom. Like that's basically the feeling of like my mom would go into

634
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
like the you know what I'm saying? Right on. I know we're talking about

635
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
something you can relate to. Yeah yeah. Go to a fun place. Yeah

636
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I run over to Hot Topic and I look and see if they have any Ninja Turtle

637
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
or Harley Quinn stuff that I'm interested in or toys or something. Well you know it's a store with

638
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
some fun stuff. Well it's no longer there but the Upstart Crow. Yes.

639
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Which I forget is which is the Italian restaurant replacing that or which

640
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I don't know I'm all discombobulated. Fallen Brothers. Yeah. Fallen Brothers. That's right.

641
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
We call them Fallen Brothers the former stores and the Upstart Crow

642
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
is there for a long time. It's a

643
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
some article that I found where they were talking about you know what

644
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
residents want. There was a minute where Universal had to pretend that this was a real city

645
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
and they had to talk to locals about what would you want to see in a

646
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
thriving shopping living dining community

647
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
and apparently quote this article, Residents wanted a bookstore

648
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
which explains the presence of the Upstart Crow bookstore and coffee shop. A tiny

649
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
intellectual oasis with a big black bird perched on it.

650
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
There he is. Sorry he haunts you this day. Yeah yeah.

651
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Look what they, I blame the residents for this. Yeah. That's why that

652
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Crow's wash is in now. Especially the 1990s resident because bookstore with a little cafe

653
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
one of my favorite kind of shops because I was a child of the 1990s

654
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
like that is a 1990s ass-wrapped store. And every

655
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
because every sitcom Friends is a little bookstore

656
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
coffee shop. Frasier, Ellen, this was

657
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
the 90s. Coffee was new and books were

658
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
briefly popular again. You've got Mail is about a big bookstore with a coffee shop in it.

659
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And also, Rest in Tea, I'm sorry to tell you this, Sector Keeper, Borders has since gone under.

660
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Barnes and Noble is still going strong.

661
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And there is a Crown Books, even though that company like went

662
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
under, there's a Crown Books in a weird mall over on the other side of the 405.

663
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Yeah there's a couple of those. There's like just like Outliers but they're still exist

664
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Borders gone? Yeah I know it's hard. I always thought

665
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Borders was the cooler one. I always liked Borders more.

666
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
How do I buy Lethal Weapon

667
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
for $30? On VHS is that where you would go

668
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
pick up because they had that big media section. Well now everything

669
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
All the books are, now you buy books from a guy

670
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
named Jeff Bezos who's even cooler than Elon Musk.

671
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Jeff Bezos, he's a race car

672
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
driver? He's probably driven a race, when you have that much money

673
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
you can do whatever the fuck you want. He owns the books and the

674
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
markets. Yeah he's telling groceries. Buying stuff online, he

675
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
sort of like figured out a way to do that and figured out how to like

676
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
cripple local economies and pay people

677
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
low money wages. We found a new way for just 10 people to be in charge of everything.

678
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
That's back in a big, that wasn't

679
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
in your childhood. Yeah that's in Jason's childhood.

680
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Yes, your Carnegie's, your Melons, your

681
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Rockefellers. Pre-New Deal stuff, you know, stuff Jason knows from his child.

682
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
You like this one new Boss Tweed?

683
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I thankfully was a nemesis of Boss Tweed.

684
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Me and FDR took him down. So he's confirming that he was a child, he is a child

685
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
from the 30's. Wow, you guys have so much in common.

686
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Yes, brothers. Both are so ghost. From different eras but

687
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
with a big commonality, your ghosthood. So yeah the Upstart Crow

688
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
like it was a bookstore but then it also sort of has a section

689
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
well much more so than a bookstore. It became

690
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
it's like Hollywood junk. Yeah so I'd like to read this Yelp review to show you

691
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
what exactly. Yeah. Oh this illustrates the transition.

692
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Well yeah so this is from, I won't say the user, but this is a

693
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
person who posts a lot on Yelp. It just says no more books

694
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
just a bunch of the same old plastic crap they sell on Hollywood Boulevard.

695
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Who needs another fake Oscar statue anyways? With the S at the end.

696
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Upstart Crow died in the flames of tourism and the bird that rose from

697
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
the ashes is a real turkey. The great coffee house and bookstore is

698
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
long gone. City Walk needs to take down the sign or change the name to Store

699
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Full of Crap. And then there's a William Shakespeare quote. I must be cruel

700
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
only to be kind. Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.

701
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
That's an interesting choice because the term Upstart Crow

702
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
comes from Shakespeare's rival Robert Greene

703
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
in his groats worth

704
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
of wit. He describes Shakespeare as an Upstart Crow

705
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
beautified with our feathers. So

706
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
bodied, owned, Shakespeare eat it. So this was

707
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
a good quote to put into this Yelp review of the Upstart Crow at City Walk.

708
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Apropro. Apropo? I still don't know. Did you say

709
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Aprocrow? Oh I wish I did. Oh I wish I said Aprocrow.

710
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
You can from now on. Yeah but an Upstart Crow beautified

711
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
with our feathers I guess because people would throw feather, tarzan feathers.

712
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I don't quite understand this bird. You aren't that old

713
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
of a bird. No I'm not that old. But you know

714
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
in the defense of the Upstart Crow there is some excellent

715
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
culture going on there which specifically

716
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
they sell a very cool item which is

717
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
driver's licenses of some of your favorite

718
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
stars. This was a big loss.

719
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I have a pile of photos of this nature and

720
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
you know, well first of all if you're in the fake ID

721
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
market, if you're a youngster like yourself actually if you wanted to

722
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
get a drink you could get one of these and you could pose as John Lennon.

723
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
People might believe that you're John Lennon. I could use John Lennon's ID

724
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
to get naughty socks. Ah yes. It's true. Go straight next

725
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
door. Well you gotta get this from a different location now. I think now

726
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
your only option for novelty driver's licenses is

727
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
35 stores on Hollywood Boulevard. But if you get that head up the hill

728
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
and get some rainy socks. Yeah once we free you, once we release you.

729
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
The first place I'm going Hollywood Boulevard. Hurray for Hollywood.

730
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
This ghost boy is getting a prostitute.

731
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
You're making up for lost time.

732
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Let's learn. But let me read

733
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
there's a lot of great details about all of these driver's

734
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
licenses because like a real driver's license it has a lot of different stats.

735
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
You know birth date, the day that it expires and then an area

736
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
called restriction. So let me read some of John Lennon's stats

737
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
here. You get just height, weight, regular stuff. But then you get license number

738
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
FAB4. That's fun. His birth date, his real date

739
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
in 1940 and then expires 12-8-1980.

740
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
That's insane. That's the most morbid thing I've ever seen.

741
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Real date of John Lennon's murder. I cannot believe they would do that. Why would they do that?

742
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
On this fun thing where we remember old cool John Lennon. We have

743
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
to remember the date he was shot. Wait what is his address on it too?

744
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Is it the Dakota? It's the Dakota apartment. Jesus Christ.

745
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
That is so crazy.

746
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
It may as well be covered in blood. Like let's be honest.

747
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
What's his name? Chapman. He would love this thing. When it was a

748
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
bookstore was this next to a rack of the catcher of the ride?

749
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
You could use this as a bookmark. And then this odd

750
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
kind of freestyle section, restriction, where in all of these they kind of do

751
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
whatever there. His restriction is listed as Yoko Ono.

752
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
That's fucked up too. What does that even mean? Yeah very odd.

753
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
There's a license, if you keep going there's a license plate for

754
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
a driver's license for Jack Bauer. A.K.A. Keith or Sutherland.

755
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Keith or Sutherland. His restriction is

756
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
terrorists and he expires never. And of course his license

757
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
number 24. If we keep going down the line

758
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Carlos Santana

759
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
his class is smooth.

760
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Well that's for sure. I would only buy that if I could

761
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
buy the Rob Thomas one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Restriction. Give me your

762
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
heart class. Make it real. Address or else forget

763
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
about it. The driver's license

764
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
for Halle Berry. She is

765
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
a license number, this is very appropriate, license number 34

766
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
2236. Upsetting. Yeah, her class is

767
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Oscar, that's true, good for her and her

768
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
restriction is diabetes. Does she have

769
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
diabetes? Evidently, I sense of Google. God damn it. But that's a fact

770
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
you learn from this novelty driver's license. And then

771
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
yeah this is, these are incredible. And then one more right under

772
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
that, Megan Fuchs whose restriction is Decepticons.

773
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
And her across the top says smoking hot.

774
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
This is a great area of

775
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
merchandise. I would have bought all of them except

776
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I realized why spend $45 when I could take photos

777
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
and talk about them on a podcast two years later. If the place was open it would

778
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
that is worth investigating like what company made that to really figure out

779
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
like to dig deep and figure out like and same with the stock market figure out who is

780
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
there's different companies that do it but like figure out the joke writers

781
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
maybe like I think one or two big companies own a lot of those

782
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
sock lines and just sell them as different like

783
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
it's like a Jeff Bezos style scam where it's like

784
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
all the same company but they have like different shell companies and they name it different things

785
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
yeah or how like Old Navy Gap, Banana Repo

786
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
that's all like one umbrella with different lines. Yeah those licenses

787
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
the Lenin one is the craziest. It expires. It's insane

788
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
yeah if they did that for Princess Diana

789
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
and Prince and restriction

790
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
fentanyl. Opiates. Like what?

791
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Why is that a fun? Yeah maybe Christian Science

792
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
maybe Jehovah's Witness

793
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
maybe Good The Store Clothes

794
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
maybe Good. Could be true. Alright so not every fallen brother

795
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
is a bad fallen brother. Justified. Yeah yeah

796
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
ran its course. Stop insulting the dead. Was mine? Aren't you

807
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
stone. It's the sector 2 stone. Go ahead hold it

808
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
and take a look. Oh wow. Beautiful. Wow it's shaped like the Dakota

809
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
apartment. That's right. And John Lennon's body is lying outside of it.

810
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
On the back side of it it says Carpe the Fuck out of this DM. Yes.

811
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000

814
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I think we're gonna do. I'm so excited to see where it takes us. Your opacity

and to obey the sector scrolls.

818
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Okay. Yes. We'll make sure there's no deviation from

819
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
these sector borders that have been set up. Right if it's sector 7

820
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
and it's 4 different places we'll stick to those 4 places

821
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
and that's what we'll do. Be real firm about this. Yeah. Alright we'll come
