1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I've got a opening joke, but it's not for me to say.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So I'll just say it in a few.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And well, all right, so it is this.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm the Jason, gotta love me.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Of course.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah, yeah.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm ready for my close up, Mr. DeBell.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I thought you would have argued to say that.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh, I should have.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Like I have it, I got it, I got it.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There's your chance.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yeah.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We were recording, so that could have been this.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh, that's true.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
No, it is.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We're handling this business now.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, if you'd like to, you don't have to.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Oh, okay.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, why don't you introduce everyone?

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh, that's a good idea.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
All right.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hey, welcome to podcast the ride.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The second gate.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I can't think of how to start this.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I don't know.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I don't have a good dinosaur's idea.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Scott Gardner is blanking.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Mike Carlson, do you have any idea?

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't know if there's a way to perfectly.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Is there a point of our hosts?

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Our brains are mush.

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Daddy's brains are mush.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
One of our hosts seem like they're one of the characters on dinosaurs.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I can't think.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't know.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You're tall like the Sherman and the Bull.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The Sherman Helmsley triceratops.

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's true.

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Jason Sheridan.

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm the Jason.

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Gotta love me.

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Whoa.

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We walked right into it.

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I had written down that I'm the baby.

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Gotta love me and not the mama.

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Very quickly when I was very young, quickly entered the pantheon of Jason.

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Please stop.

50
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Like you gotta, you gotta stop.

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I like that's really, that's enough.

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You gotta because.

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I dinosaurs was very popular in my household.

54
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You know, I have numerous memories of us all repeating these lines.

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The whole family, the whole family.

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And then I just let's say it.

57
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Three, two, one.

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
My memory is that I just kept pushing.

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Wow.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You don't do not wake us up in the middle of the night screaming it.

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I Jason with like a frying pan to like hitting his father.

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Jason, you're pushing it.

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Your favorite character in fiction, baby Sinclair.

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You can't act like him anymore.

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You're too old to just poop in front of us.

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He loved it though.

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So you're so a big fan of dinosaurs growing up, the early nineties, ABC show.

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
With the involvement of Jim Henson and the Jim Henson creature shop.

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Did we all watch the show?

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Enjoy the show.

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Jason loves it.

72
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What are your feelings, Mike?

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's I have complicated feelings about it because I was fascinated by it,

74
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
but it creeped me out and I watched episodes, but I really, I wanted to be into it more,

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
but I couldn't.

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah.

77
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
In my, in hindsight, it was, it was something I wanted to love, but I had an odd feeling about it.

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It might have been because the episode, there's the one episode where I was like,

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
trying to do a mating dance and I knew that was sex and that was a bad thing to talk about.

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's like maybe my strongest memory of watching it when I was little.

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So I don't know if that's made me be like, there's an adult show.

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Drugs too.

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It creeped me out.

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Well, I was not, for some reason I had drugs.

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We're not even, I wasn't worried about that.

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The main thing.

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The main thing I was like, this makes me uncomfortable is this mating dance episode.

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You didn't have the dare program, but you had it in the household.

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So, but your parents didn't care if you, you could skip that for all you want.

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah.

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
We're giving you a personal stay off of sex program.

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah.

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah.

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What was the, what does dare stand for again?

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't know.

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What does dare stand for?

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
If it was a better program, we'd know.

98
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Right.

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I was just, I was going to do a perfect joke with the sex.

100
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Young enough to do the program.

101
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Not currently young enough to be buying the t-shirts ironically at urban outfitters.

102
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Drug abuse resistance education.

103
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So.

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, it's not that funny.

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If you put sex in there.

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No, it's not.

107
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You got to get the A out too.

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
How am I going to do that?

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Well, you got all episode.

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You don't even worry about contributing to the rest of it.

111
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You can just do your own project over there.

112
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm going to turn my mic off.

113
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No need.

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I will not be saying anything.

115
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It didn't make a click.

116
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Well, it kind of made a click.

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I think my feelings about dinosaurs, I, I certainly, I watched it all the time.

118
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There was, I feel like there was a time and maybe some listeners will, will back me up.

119
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
If you were of the right age, at least in my head, and it feels insane to say this now,

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:01,000
but like the big pillars of kids entertainment with attitude, if we're talking Simpsons and we're talking Ninja Turtles.

121
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah.

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You know, I think dinosaurs right in there at the time I viewed it as, yeah, I like Simpsons and I like Ninja Turtles and I like dinosaurs.

123
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Wow. That's a cool teen one and they look cool.

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And who are the coolest characters on TV?

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Probably Bart and Baby Sinclair.

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh, Baby Sinclair.

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What a star.

128
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yeah.

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If you don't remember the show, I'm sure I won't synopsize it very well, but you know, there was, there were, there was TGIF, of course, all the family sitcoms.

130
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But this was the only one where it wasn't humans.

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
These are creatures from the Jim Ensign Creature Shop with impeccable full body suits.

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah.

133
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And robotic, however, whatever you want to call the faces.

134
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And it's a very, like the most traditional family show where it's big, schlubby husband and the wife who knows better and the teen boy is cool and likes to date and do mating dances, of course.

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And the teen girl likes to shop, I think, probably is what I recall.

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And then the very post-Michelle Tanner scene stealing baby, the catchphrases go to the baby.

137
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yeah.

138
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And grandma, grandma sort of post-Golden Girl, grandma sassy.

139
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Uh huh. Uh huh.

140
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Who's that voice? Was that? Oh, that's a good question. I don't remember.

141
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Was that a Stingy?

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I mean, the big one was Jessica Walter was the mother. Is that right?

143
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yes. Yes. Way before Arrested Development.

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah.

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And I'm so curious about the, it's from Michael Jacobs who created Boy Meets World later.

146
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So a very big 90s on ABC.

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What a resume. Wow.

148
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah. Yeah. Indeed.

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I think I'm wrong. I don't think that is Sally Struthers is probably the biggest.

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Charlene Sinclair.

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah. Yeah.

152
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Steve Whitmire is Robbie.

153
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Mm hmm.

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Was he the voice though?

155
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh, that's a good question.

156
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Not sure.

157
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
No, no, he wasn't.

158
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You know what I always loved on the show was Earl's boss, who I just mentioned, Sherman Hemsley.

159
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yes.

160
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Hemsley, Hemsley.

161
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You know, the way his, oh, it's not Florence Stanley was the grandma.

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I still get a waste of time. Sorry.

163
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Pretend you didn't hear any of that.

164
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But I always liked him.

165
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Mr. Richfield and he would scream.

166
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He was so hulking in that little office set.

167
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah.

168
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Scream Sinclair from that little window.

169
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah.

170
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And a legitimately terrifying looking character.

171
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I think I was scared of the show.

172
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's kind of what I'm getting at.

173
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Because the show is scary.

174
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Like if I watch it now, I'm not scared of it, but I can see maybe in the same way that I was like afraid of earnest things.

175
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
There was something like gross about it and fright, frightful to me.

176
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
They're all huge.

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
They're terrifying.

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
They're giant dinosaurs.

179
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And the lips, I mean, like the puppetry is fantastic.

180
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah, it's unbelievable.

181
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Much like the Ninja Turtles movies and it's kind of the same technology.

182
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah.

183
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's still like, it's still weird and analog and radio controlled and wonky.

184
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So those, at some point, those mouths are going to contort into a really bizarre shape.

185
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Some of it is animatronics.

186
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You saw something that like for at the time, this might have been the most expensive half hour episodes.

187
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
God.

188
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, man.

189
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I did.

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah.

191
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I watched a making of, which was pretty fascinating, and they went straight to 13 episodes because to just do a pilot would have been seven million dollars for the one.

192
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So like, you know, those costs are spread out if you make a bunch of them.

193
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Kind of insane.

194
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This was just once they were that confident about something that could have just not worked.

195
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It went straight to 13.

196
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I think there was two things I think at play.

197
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
One, this is like one of the very last things that like Henson had a hand in developing.

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Jim Henson had a hand in developing.

199
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The other I saw it mentioned that the immediate hit of the Simpsons executives were like, I guess people will take a chance on something weirder.

200
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Oh, and it looks different.

201
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah.

202
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Sure.

203
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That isn't the same old multicam that we've owned.

204
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But yeah.

205
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's a big leap.

206
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And to do this, that kind of technology and these kind of suits on a TV scale as opposed to movies, which is kind of the only place they'd been done and still like sparingly.

207
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You're looking at more per episode.

208
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You got more suits than the Ninja Turtles movie.

209
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh, yeah.

210
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I can't imagine what a nightmare this was to put together.

211
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah.

212
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Like you hear the elf stories just of one generally one puppet just with massive long shoot days.

213
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Actors just burned out.

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The puppet didn't quite work.

215
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
This is a hand puppet.

216
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah.

217
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's a small puppet.

218
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And ultimately just pop up where it needs to be.

219
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah.

220
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And like sometimes the guy in a suit.

221
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But yeah, like this is everybody's wearing a dinosaur suit.

222
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah.

223
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And public.

224
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah.

225
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I can't imagine how long some of these shoot days were.

226
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So it's like a lineup of people with the like telemetric.

227
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yes.

228
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Like, you know, the it's it's so impossible to describe with a little like sleeve, but the little like it's like it looks like an undressed Kermit that you put your hands through.

229
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So you're still puppeting it like a sock puppet, but it's it's very advanced and radio controlled.

230
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So those signals are going into the face.

231
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's a few feet away.

232
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So just turn the camera around besides even the set and how crazy it is.

233
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And they're running steam through it and everything has to be custom built.

234
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah.

235
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And you're now pan over here and here's like seven guys all controlling different radio mouths.

236
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And they made sixty five of these.

237
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yes.

238
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
They're all in Disney Plus.

239
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You can watch these and they kind of look like shit because it seems like they ripped VHS tapes or like just really burned out.

240
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Did you beta masters?

241
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
These I think, yeah, whatever.

242
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Like they did not remaster.

243
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We've talked about this before in Disney Plus.

244
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Some of the things look like, oh, they really they made this look nice.

245
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And then some of the stuff and it's like it's inconsistent with Disney afternoon stuff because sometimes I forget which show it was, but you'll like watch a DuckTales or a Gummy Bears and you go, this looks like I taped it off TV 35 years ago.

246
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And then some like another show will be like kind of pristine quality in a way.

247
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm like it's random what looks good and what doesn't on that.

248
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
They can't all be the beautifully done Baywatch remastered on it.

249
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Truly maybe the best looking really show.

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah.

251
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The remaster process.

252
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't know who financed this.

253
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't know if this is out of Hasselhoff's pocket, but they went back to the film master.

254
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Wow.

255
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It looks stunning.

256
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It is bright and bold.

257
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You can tell that it was shot on film.

258
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It looks better than some movies that came out the same really impeccable remake makes it so watchable.

259
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The only thing I'm trying to think, I'm sure they've done other shows, but the only other ones they've done next generation and the original Star Trek have been like remastered and they went and cleaned up some visual effects and stuff.

260
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But then like we sold those on Blu-ray and DVD, but I was so much just Baywatch and those two.

261
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
They just got to have the financing somewhere.

262
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I mean Seinfeld when you're watching Seinfeld on stream, that's like they went back because since that was shot on film, which was rare.

263
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Right.

264
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That's really the issue.

265
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I mean, this show must have been.

266
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Where was it?

267
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I don't know if this is a dinosaur.

268
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's a good question.

269
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Or film.

270
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I feel like it's probably crappy video.

271
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I mean, as we're talking about this, I am thinking about back to working in various like in media storage media vaults and how much people would just drop.

272
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Digivade like just drop tapes or HDR like the master tape like just shit.

273
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
We get dropped or like accidentally or they accidentally.

274
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And then the original before means himself.

275
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Oh, I was pretty good.

276
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I was actually pretty.

277
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Except with have you ever seen a quarter inch tit like a it looks like a it's giant and it's like heavy and it kind of has a handle.

278
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh, I guess.

279
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I would like try it like put those on carts like that was.

280
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah, I know.

281
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yeah.

282
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Digivade like it went like quarter inch Digivade HDR like those were the stuff like the broadcast man.

283
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Like the broadcast masters and then some stuff you say I worked on the Star Trek remastering to it that company and they would could see and I was like, or I tracked all the like master like film reels and they were put them in a tele cinemabay to like redo the effects or redo timing and stuff on it dropped all of them and then dropped.

284
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The episode where data has sex you dropped on the floor.

285
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I was.

286
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah, I assure you a lot of those canisters already looked like shit.

287
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Sure.

288
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah.

289
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So do you think that all of the dinosaurs episodes were dropped before they were?

290
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't think stuff was well.

291
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah.

292
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Like this is not exactly like you know, oh, they remastered all the Hitchcock movie.

293
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
They remastered some Spielberg movies and stuff.

294
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The lesser film star, the lesser media remaster places.

295
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's just like, we'll do it.

296
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's just like throwing tapes to each other stooges.

297
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yikes.

298
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And then like one bit of film gets caught on somebody's leg.

299
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So he starts running drags the other guy behind Muppets labs like beaker and Dr. Bunch and honey do try to remaster.

300
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
We take the utmost care.

301
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Those devices.

302
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Incidentally, when I was describing the like gray puppets that go to the to the turtles faces, the dinosaurs faces in watching the behind the scenes, they're demonstrating one and they really quickly casually call it a Waldo.

303
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Oh, wow.

304
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That must refer to Waldo see graphic.

305
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Of course, the CGI character from a vision 3D.

306
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And it does.

307
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That's not a coincidence.

308
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But Waldo is named after the device.

309
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's actually the other way.

310
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Right.

311
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That is how they got the lip sync for Waldo.

312
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And they like, you know, computer analyze that.

313
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But it's all based on some old short story about a disabled scientist named Waldo who got robotics to do what his body could no longer do.

314
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Really?

315
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That is some story from the 30s or 40s.

316
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Interesting.

317
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That is why the device is a Waldo and why Waldo see graphic.

318
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Okay.

319
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It is a deep literary reference.

320
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That's interesting.

321
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Book.

322
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I might know that Muppets.

323
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I don't know the name of the book.

324
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I can't get you started.

325
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I don't care.

326
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
No, no, no.

327
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
If I learned all I need to learn.

328
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Waldo first showed up in like an 80s show, like a different.

329
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah.

330
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
He was not at the first appearance.

331
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Right.

332
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Was a different Henson thing.

333
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yeah.

334
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So I, cause I don't want to even say what the name might have been.

335
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Was it called the Jim Henson hour?

336
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If I get this wrong, we're getting big emails.

337
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Yeah, you're right.

338
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
A lot of corrections and a number of them are from Griffin Newman.

339
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'll let it this out.

340
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Cause I don't want Griffin to text us about the correct.

341
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I don't want to.

342
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
We've weird.

343
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yeah.

344
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I think he was in the Jim Henson hour.

345
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You're not going to hear the audience.

346
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You're not hearing this now because I've cut it out.

347
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You're not hearing it.

348
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Stop.

349
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Don't hear it.

350
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You can't.

351
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
If I forgot, if I, if this is in, I forgot.

352
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I didn't even realize this is a Muppet show.

353
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
We're making mistakes.

354
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You're right.

355
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Even knowing it.

356
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
We've made like 20 mistakes.

357
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Cancel the episode.

358
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
We get ourselves into this.

359
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh no, no, no.

360
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Okay.

361
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
All right.

362
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Here's the facts that we know.

363
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Here's something that is notorious about dinosaurs.

364
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And it is the very bleak ending of our series where if you don't know fun

365
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
sitcom about dinosaur family,

366
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
hi Jinx and then in the final episode,

367
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
the ice age is beginning and everybody is looking out a window,

368
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
pensive and scared about the forthcoming ice age saying,

369
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I don't know.

370
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I hope it turns out okay.

371
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And then it's just a sad news reporters signing off.

372
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And then the show never came back again.

373
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
This is so Alf parallel.

374
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
There's so many parallels.

375
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I feel like between Alf and Alf ends on a really scary, sad thing.

376
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Why are we murdering our pub?

377
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And they're both like three season shows, I believe,

378
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
or maybe else a little longer,

379
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
but they're both kind of around the same length as far as I think,

380
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
which means for me and they're, yeah.

381
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And they're like, they were like hits,

382
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
but not Seinfeld like they couldn't last past.

383
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
They're sort of like of the era.

384
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yeah.

385
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And they could, yeah,

386
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
they didn't have like longevity to get them over that like syndicate five

387
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
seasons syndication.

388
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
They are marker.

389
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah.

390
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
They both have like really sad endings.

391
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Dinosaur ended at four and I 94.

392
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
No, four seasons.

393
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And I think was plagued by moving.

394
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Oh, you're right.

395
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It was moving airing nights a lot.

396
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Oh, it wasn't always on TGIF.

397
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I think it was sometimes, but those are, that was prime real estate.

398
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
They're, they're kicking and trying to like launch crappier shows in those

399
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
slots.

400
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
But I don't remember following it for years and years.

401
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Like I don't.

402
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Like it came out of the gate hot and just slowly cools much like the earth

403
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
cools around them.

404
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Yeah.

405
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It does.

406
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I would feel like it, like this was,

407
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
that's what I'm saying when you go Bart Michelangelo baby Sinclair,

408
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
it seems weird now because Bart and Michelangelo have arrived in various forms.

409
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I get what you're saying.

410
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't disagree with that because I, I, again,

411
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I wanted to really like this and I would watch it,

412
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
but I was too big of a baby. I was too, I guess,

413
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
or something like that.

414
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Scary to look at and weird little like when they,

415
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
when they like had creatures around who they were in the house just for them to

416
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
eat.

417
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah.

418
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And then they spoke in British accents and they were kind of like pleading.

419
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Yeah.

420
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That bothered me weird.

421
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I, I'll say this.

422
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
NECA showed off at Comic-Con last year that they are doing baby Sinclair

423
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
and Earl figures.

424
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Oh,

425
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
they look fantastic.

426
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm so excited.

427
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm probably going to buy them.

428
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Even though you were,

429
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
it doesn't like take you back to some phantom.

430
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Well, it might, but I also have a, I have a Hellraiser, NECA Hellraiser toy.

431
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I have Pinhead in my office.

432
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The NECA is how you face your fears.

433
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
That's right.

434
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You got Pinhead.

435
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I got a, a, the Xenomorph too,

436
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
which I was terrified of.

437
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
NECA has so many things to show you a world beyond pleasure and pain,

438
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
you know,

439
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
just like Pinhead himself.

440
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Oh yes.

441
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yes.

442
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yeah.

443
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Catch.

444
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That's a catch ray.

445
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah.

446
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I think that's every current catch phrase.

447
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And then I would like you guys to watch,

448
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
um, um,

449
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Hellraiser two and see how far you can get.

450
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh, I tried Hellraiser one once and I got,

451
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I didn't think boredom would be the problem with already.

452
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Did you make it to the flesh tearing?

453
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
No.

454
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Oh wow.

455
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Hellraiser one.

456
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yeah.

457
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I can see there's some, it's a little sleepy early on,

458
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
but also again, I've said it many times.

459
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I fall asleep.

460
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So,

461
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Oh yeah.

462
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm fresh from it.

463
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It taking me three nights to finish the Brendan Fraser,

464
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Albert Brooks vehicle, the scouts.

465
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Oh wow.

466
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The scouts of the scout for me.

467
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I would like to see if you could,

468
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
the dense film that I could not,

469
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
but my brain could not possibly handle.

470
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
There's some scene.

471
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm so tired.

472
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh, I'd love to see both of you guys do make it through Hellraiser two though,

473
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
cause there are so gross.

474
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I heard the TV show, the Hulu show got pretty good reviews.

475
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah.

476
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
But it feels too,

477
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
that felt too like nice to me.

478
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Well, that's beside the point and not grow.

479
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It felt like it wasn't gross.

480
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Cause the first two hellraisers gross, very gross.

481
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That's a big part of it is seeing closeups of skin tearing.

482
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
If I could keep us on the point of gross.

483
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Yes.

484
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And I'm going to, we're going to start heading to,

485
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I think what we didn't say at the top is that we did not,

486
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
there were, we're talking about any of this.

487
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
There was a dinosaurs show parade combo of both.

488
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Yeah.

489
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So float checked neither box in a way.

490
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yeah.

491
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yeah.

492
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
There was a Disney MGM studios.

493
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
The attraction of some kinds.

494
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It was on the map.

495
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
But I'm, I'm starting.

496
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What I'm heading to now is the Disney company association with this

497
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
series.

498
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And there's a very important piece of media.

499
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
With one of our,

500
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
one of our favorites.

501
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I will play you this now.

502
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Baby Sinclair.

503
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
What are you doing?

504
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
My chair.

505
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Number one.

506
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And two.

507
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You know what?

508
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Baby Sinclair.

509
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
My gift to you.

510
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Thanks Mike.

511
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
By the way.

512
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Michael eyes, baby Sinclair.

513
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Pisses and shits and Michael Eisner's chair.

514
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
That's an affront to all of us.

515
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That's the most, that's the more important chair in the office.

516
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm mad about that actually.

517
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Now I'm not mad.

518
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm just, I'm just,

519
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm just,

520
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm just,

521
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm just,

522
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm just,

523
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm just,

524
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm just,

525
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm just,

526
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm just,

527
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm just,

528
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm just,

529
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm just,

530
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm just,

531
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm just,

532
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm just,

533
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm just,

534
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm just,

535
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm just,

536
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm just,

537
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I frança,

538
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I transluc,

539
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I abdominus.

540
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What were you thinking about that actually?

541
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Now I'm not going to get the baby Sinclair.

542
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yeah, I probably saw that at the time.

543
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And that made me uncomfortable.

544
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
The disrespect.

545
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And the disrespect continues.

546
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Because.

547
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What I think?

548
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I think this.

549
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Clip.

550
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
He.

551
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
By the way.

552
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What?

553
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Just the.

554
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Like.

555
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The,

556
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
what's the joke there?

557
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Number one and number ten.

558
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Then he just makes a big effort face.

559
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Walt would be horrified by that.

560
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yeah.

561
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Willy wears a diaper.

562
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Baby Sinclair has a little diaper on.

563
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But Jason, look as a father, as a daddy, you know.

564
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
That pee and poop doesn't always stay in that diaper.

565
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Oh, sure.

566
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
That can leak out.

567
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You can have what's called a blowout.

568
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I bet.

569
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I think baby Sinclair is causing blowouts on purpose.

570
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I think so too.

571
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Yes.

572
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Baby Sinclair aware that if the,

573
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
if there's enough propulsion with that.

574
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That's coming out the diaper.

575
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
That's coming out the leg.

576
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
That's coming out the back.

577
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
He, this character, he comes out of the way he,

578
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
his egg cracks and then he's just talking and insulting Earl in episode one.

579
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So I, I am sure he had very precise poop control.

580
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Yeah.

581
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So the joke here is that Michael is going to let him keep his chair.

582
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Yeah.

583
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Because it's covered in feces and urine.

584
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah.

585
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
If he knows what's good for him,

586
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
he wants to try and litigate against the screen actor skill.

587
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
They'll tear him apart.

588
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
So the second half of this,

589
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
and this is it'll get more disrespects to our favorite Mr.

590
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Eisner.

591
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So he,

592
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
here's the catch phrase in motion,

593
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
which,

594
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
you know,

595
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
usually it's his father Earl in this position,

596
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
but he smacks Eisner in the head with his very thick bottle.

597
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It's a sizable bottle.

598
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It's a very,

599
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
it's a very,

600
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
it's a very,

601
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
it's a very,

602
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
it's a very,

603
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
it's a very,

604
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
it's a very,

605
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
it's a very,

606
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
it's a very,

607
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
This is it.

608
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It's a very,

609
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
it's a very big one.

610
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Not a glass bottle.

611
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
That's a sizable bottle.

612
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah.

613
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
But really the star of this entire sequence is what is coming,

614
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
which is some of the best Eisner acting.

615
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I've ever heard.

616
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Actually.

617
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
One of the stars and see his angel lands.

618
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
She's seeing the title song from our new animated film.

619
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Beauty and the beast.

620
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Shameless plug.

621
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Shameless plug.

622
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I mean, that's a funny bit.

623
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Yeah.

624
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm seeing stars.

625
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And one of the stars I'm seeing.

626
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
No transition to the actual stars.

627
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm seeing insane clown posse, the hot new act on our Hollywood.

628
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Records label.

629
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Wow.

630
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
That's great.

631
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
One of the stars powder, the star of promising new film from promising producer,

632
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Harvey Weinstein.

633
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Angela lands.

634
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Potter is not phenomenal.

635
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
In her chilling role as Lawrence Harvey's mother in the Manchurian candidate tonight

636
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
on the wonderful world.

637
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
There is something Michael seems again, Michael wants to perform,

638
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
but also there seems like he was one take and he was out.

639
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And maybe that's wrong.

640
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Maybe you tried a lot because we obviously see you have seen out takes.

641
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
So we know we had to do other takes.

642
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,000
But well, I think the rumor is that in an early 30 rock where Jack Donaghy has to do

643
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
like a litany, it's a really basic performance and he's there all day.

644
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Right.

645
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's so it's such a process to get it.

646
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And I think that is maybe based on Michael Eisner.

647
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
OK, I think possibly.

648
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
But he want like that's what he has the interview show after doing this,

649
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
like he wants to be on camera.

650
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
There was a desire for him to do that.

651
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And I wonder if he would just come on our podcast if we could get to the root of this.

652
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
If he if we can convey that we will not ask anything hard,

653
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
we it is going to be about his performance.

654
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
This is essentially inside the actor studio with this guy.

655
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
We're just going to go.

656
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
We're going to play clips.

657
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
We're going to ask what he remembers about that day.

658
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah, right.

659
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Is it an honor to work with Baby Sinclair?

660
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Right.

661
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You got to you were he performed with how many people on this earth got to perform

662
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
with Jim Henson doing Kermit the Frog?

663
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Not that I mean, the positions he was in or Frank Oz doing Fozzie.

664
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yeah, I know.

665
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
He got like, you know, astounding experiences.

666
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
That's what I want to ask about.

667
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Right.

668
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Yes.

669
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
We want to give him the biggest softball interview of all time.

670
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
This ball softest ball we are.

671
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And we will roll it softly to him or the ball doesn't have to go anywhere.

672
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
If he says something like, you know, and, you know, a little disappointed in California

673
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Ventures started out like, no, sir, no, it's great.

674
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Don't wait.

675
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
She's down like that.

676
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It was great.

677
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Leave that to there's a guy named Kevin Perger.

678
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Leave the leave the shit talking of you to him.

679
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
We'll give you is we don't want to hear them, but I just felt like there's some problem.

680
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
You know, some of the films were no, the films.

681
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
What are you kidding me?

682
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
We love the films.

683
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Have you revisited Jungle to Jungle lately?

684
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It holds on.

685
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Go to Joe.

686
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It's better than the original French movie, French movie with Gerard Parto.

687
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I think maybe your French movies are better than the three men and a baby.

688
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Oh, man.

689
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
If Gryffindorff's tribe was based on a French movie, I'm sure it was better than that.

690
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah, he he shows up.

691
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I was watching some interview with Leonard Nimoy and Shatner and some Star Trek.

692
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And they're, of course, talking about Star Trek coming back in the movies.

693
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And they have talked about Eisner because he was a paramount back then.

694
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Oh, yeah. He was a big part of that.

695
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
He factored into while I was on Ram Perez's podcast, Mama Needs a Movie, we talked about Mommy Dearest.

696
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
They surely talk about dinosaurs with what would not the mama.

697
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Right. Yeah.

698
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
But Meisner had to green light that film.

699
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Mommy Dearest was given to us essentially by Michael Eisner.

700
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Wow. Thank you, sir.

701
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Thank you.

702
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Thank you.

703
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Come here so we can thank you.

704
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
We just want to thank you.

705
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Come to the garage.

706
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I just want to thank you for giving us the best parks of our lives.

707
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
We'll sing that song to him.

708
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Not with the Stan lyrics.

709
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
They're mean and dark.

710
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
The good ones. Yeah.

711
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,000
OK, to start getting us into the Disney MGM studios, I would like to show you guys this photograph.

712
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
This was going around recently on on Twitter.

713
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I feel like somebody just kind of I mean, in illustrating the vibe of Disney MGM studios in those early years.

714
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And this this really does tell you just the like collision of pop culture that we are looking here is a group photo studio gate.

715
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And in this photo, the Ninja Turtles with April O'Neill, Roger Rabbit, Beauty and the Beast, a bunch of Star Wars, Chewbacca,

716
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:07,000
C3PO and a new couple of walks, Little Mermaid and Eric, Indiana Jones and then the dinosaurs.

717
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I like I mean that they fit in this group that I wouldn't have I would never would have questioned that seeing that at this age.

718
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Of course, of course, they're in there.

719
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Yeah, they're icons and they always will be.

720
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
But but in general, also this you talk about great stuff Eisner gave us.

721
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I mean, this like I, Aaron is sometimes like, I don't understand this park.

722
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It's kind of a hodgepodge.

723
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I don't read.

724
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I think you had to be there.

725
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
There was a time for a couple of years.

726
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
This photo tells you everything that's missing from the park and it'll never be back.

727
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
You know, we talk a lot about sort of that Epcot feeling that's gone that will never come back.

728
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And we have talked about this a little bit, but maybe I feel like maybe we haven't underlined it.

729
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And this photo is the perfect representation of being a little kid.

730
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And when this park was new and feeling like this chaotic photo of all these characters, yeah, was the magic of Disney's MGM studios.

731
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:12,000
On a personal note, also like my my early vacay, I had wonderful vacations with my my family always.

732
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
But they were often driven by like golf and my dad wanting to golf and go to golf resorts.

733
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
So I would always have fun as a kid, but I would find myself like this is kind of a dry place to be.

734
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Sure. I mean, I'll make do, but it's a little so there'd be vacations where like, OK, they have a pool.

735
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I guess that's good. OK, I'm sorry.

736
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Where's the next vacation taking us?

737
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
A place where the Ninja Turtles and the dinosaurs and Chewbacca.

738
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Like, yes. Why do we ever go anywhere but here?

739
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Yeah, I completely feel that looking at this.

740
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Yes, I know. And that's what that's missing now from that place.

741
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Yeah, it's like, I guess what like you want to see the mysterious Benedict Society?

742
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
You want to see Will Trent?

743
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
You want to see them all in one?

744
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I want to see the modern family.

745
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I want to see them at Disney's Hollywood.

746
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
That's right. Yeah, they're nowhere to be found.

747
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
The modern family are not there.

748
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
There should be a family.

749
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
They own every character. Right.

750
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
This is a mere fraction of what they own today.

751
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
They aren't due. It's not the big, silly mismatchy pile.

752
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And then, of course, a couple of characters that they don't own, and I'm not sure why they're there.

753
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Right. That's an important part of it, too.

754
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Well, that was you talk about that.

755
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And I think the characters they didn't own like turtles and stuff being in there, that made it more as a kid.

756
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I was like, they're all here. Everyone's here. All of my favorites are here.

757
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Yes. And new stuff. That's the important part of it.

758
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Stuff that's just open or just coming out or going to come out.

759
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
It wasn't just classic characters. It was stuff that felt new and relevant.

760
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And they were all there. All the friends were there.

761
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And again, outside of Marvel with new stuff from the shows popping up, it's like there's not really...

762
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
That's probably how you feel now. If you're very into every Marvel show.

763
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Every week and then...

764
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Yeah. But it's still it's within the universe. You're not seeing this fun mashup of turning the corner.

765
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Nowhere to be found in the parks is the character on Obi-Wan played by Flea.

766
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Where has he been? I haven't seen him anywhere.

767
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I hear you.

768
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Vect NoCrew.

769
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Where's Vect NoCrew?

770
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I wish. I feel disgraced. I'm like that I didn't know Vex's name.

771
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I did have to look it up.

772
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I saw the show.

773
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I'll never forget it now.

774
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Vex, yeah.

775
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Vex NoCrew and his famous modern shirt and modern jacket and no signifiers that he's anything but regular flea.

776
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Vex No Park presence.

777
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Yeah. So that, yeah, seeing this and then watching the video of the dinosaurs, it's like it would be interesting.

778
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Obviously there was, I don't know, it feels more fun back then the newer characters.

779
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
But what a version of that now would be if you were a kid, I guess Bluey would be there.

780
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Bluey, the Navi, all the Avengers.

781
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
That's good. Right.

782
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And it would be like cheaper looking Avengers.

783
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It wouldn't be like recreations of the clothes.

784
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It would be like the Avengers.

785
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
They look a little goofy.

786
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
There's somebody blue and like just their shoes are a little bit like have a lift in them, but they're not that tall.

787
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And that's comforting.

788
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
If you're a nervous child, it's comforting that they look a little shit.

789
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
It looks too good.

790
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Yes.

791
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
The events of the movie might break out around you.

792
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Right. And then Grey's Anatomy characters are also there.

793
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Oh, yeah.

794
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
That's on ABC, I think.

795
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Yeah.

796
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
That's still running.

797
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Modern Family is over, so I guess it wouldn't be the Modern Family.

798
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
But yeah, that's blackish.

799
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Yes. There you go.

800
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And I haven't watched television forever, apparently, so I can't remember any other shows.

801
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Is Abbott Elementary on ABC?

802
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It's on ABC, but it's streaming on HBO Max.

803
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Well, I can't talk about I can't get into that now.

804
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
That's too confusing.

805
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
But yeah.

806
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I want Guillermo from Jimmy Kimmel.

807
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I want to walk around Guillermo.

808
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
What about that? Yes.

809
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
They should do that, actually.

810
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Honestly, they should.

811
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
They should.

812
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
There should be some sort of Kimmel presence in the Disney and Hollywood studios because that's their talk show guy.

813
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
They have. They finally have.

814
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Oh, God. Yeah.

815
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Why have they? How have they not made him host some bad attraction?

816
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Yeah, there's so many things in the past where they would have an ABC Stu Carey or whatever.

817
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
They had David Letterman in the pre-show of that sound show.

818
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Yeah, they've had all the characters. They've had Stephen Webber host something.

819
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I mean, they've had so many different stars that have been on the show.

820
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:52,000
The dinosaur parade that becomes a street show ran from September 1991 to August 1992,

821
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:01,000
which I say because I was there in November 1991 and definitely was very thrilled to see the hit dinosaur.

822
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
This was a big trip where it's like my family and my grandparents and we all stayed at the Polynesian.

823
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
This was an exciting trip.

824
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Yeah.

825
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And probably I was watching a few versions of this show and I was like,

826
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Oh, my God, is this imprinted in my head like some earliest memories?

827
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Because I think as they're coming down, like musical memories, as they're coming down to Hollywood Boulevard,

828
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I think it's like an uptempo instrumental version of I Got Rhythm,

829
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
which is a standard that like Ella Fitzgerald sang. Gene Kelly did it in an American Got Paris.

830
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And then in front of Grailman's Chinese theater, they do, was it Walk the Dinosaur?

831
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
The hit song Walk the Dinosaur.

832
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
The hit song Walk the Dinosaur.

833
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I guess that is a recent song for then because when's that song?

834
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
That's from like it was like 89 maybe.

835
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
89 in America.

836
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And in America only.

837
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I know it was released in Europe like before.

838
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Oh, yeah.

839
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I'm just joking.

840
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,000
But like that song just has stuck with me for like every now and then I'll just come into my head.

841
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And like I had to remind myself getting ready for this episode.

842
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I was like, was that for the show? No, it was a single.

843
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
It was a hit single by Was Not Was.

844
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah. Yeah.

845
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Well, we're now we're here.

846
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
We're in Don Was territory.

847
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Oh, man.

848
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I'm excited.

849
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Is it a five timers that I said I saw him at a concert once?

850
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I don't remember.

851
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I feel like just his name being said is a five timer.

852
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I believe I saw him at a Wilco show.

853
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
He was in the lobby and I go, Oh, my God, it's Don Was.

854
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Now, how many listeners know who this is?

855
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I don't know.

856
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Well, he wrote this song.

857
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
He wrote Walk the Dinosaur, which is the basis of this show.

858
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And he produced my favorite Bare Naked Ladies album, which I'm sure I've said this before on the show.

859
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Yes.

860
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Is that why you care about Don Was?

861
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
That's certainly the first time I heard about him.

862
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
But then once I learned he's like a kind of a character, an ancillary character in Rock It's Not Ancillary.

863
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I want to diminish his contributions.

864
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Well, and that thing we talk about where the aging rockers look progressively more insane with all of their distractions and dyed black hair that you know is not right.

865
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And how are we styling the hair?

866
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And how many layers are we wearing?

867
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Scarves?

868
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
How many scarves?

869
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
All of Depp's moves.

870
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Don Was is one of the craziest looking people there is.

871
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Insane.

872
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
That's probably why I was like, Who's that?

873
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Oh, I like that's why I recognized him, I think, at the time, because he is very unique or specific looking, I guess.

874
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yeah.

875
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Did you know Little Steven from the E Street Band, they're on tour.

876
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:00,000
He I think a couple of concerts go dressed in full pirate outfit, full big pirate hat, full big coat.

877
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It's kind of amazing that hadn't happened.

878
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I know, right?

879
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Yeah.

880
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
He's like halfway there at those bandanas.

881
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Yeah.

882
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
He's like, I'm going to go ahead, you know.

883
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
But yeah, he posted a photo of it.

884
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And I'm like, Yeah, why not?

885
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I this song Walk the Dinosaur, I do I feel like it's kind of in that lane with Hot Hot Hot, where it's as much of a recent hit song as Disney's willing to use.

886
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And it's almost impressive that they were doing any music from within the decade.

887
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
But the song itself, I have always struggled with.

888
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Really?

889
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Yeah.

890
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Do you do you like Walk the Dinosaur?

891
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I think I like it.

892
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Yeah, I know I like it, but I don't like love.

893
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I'm not going to throw myself.

894
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I'm not going to protect it like any of the songs on Bare Naked Ladies Maroon.

895
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
But yeah, I think I like it.

896
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I think it's just such a like it feels like it's a song for babies.

897
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
It makes sense.

898
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
They use it in the theme parks.

899
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Yeah, it makes sense that I loved it at six years old.

900
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:12,000
You know, there's the only thing that imprint imprinted more was the Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine song, Kanga, because that was played all over the parks, I feel like.

901
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And was like in I think was done for the Caribbean Beach opening.

902
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It was in a parade or was in some Disney show where like all the characters are on the beach.

903
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
OK.

904
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
So they grab sort of recent.

905
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Yeah, there were three songs.

906
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Yeah, they were they felt comfortable with.

907
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yeah, I well look, if you this show, if you haven't seen a video of what we're describing, it pretty much hinges on your enjoyment of Walk the Dinosaur because it is played for.

908
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Yeah, about 10 straight minutes.

909
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
You better be into.

910
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Chorus specifically.

911
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I hope you only kind of like the verses in the bridge.

912
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Yeah.

913
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Or the pre chorus or whatever, because you will hear over that.

914
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
It is the show.

915
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I'm going to let me Cliff notes version of the show without getting into the character dynamics and why they're there.

916
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
There is a big double decker bus.

917
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Most of the dinosaurs are on top.

918
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
The grandma is on the bottom.

919
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
The bus takes a long time to come from the airy.

920
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Yeah.

921
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
The bus is in front of the Chinese theater.

922
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Once it arrives, there is a performance of a lyrically modified Walk the Dinosaur.

923
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Then the same long path is taken for the bus to get out of there and go backstage and the chorus of Walk the Dinosaur is played the entire time.

924
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
We just gave a lot of praise to like the early five of this park.

925
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I'm watching a video of this.

926
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I feel about this.

927
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Hey, the Viograd.

928
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
The idea.

929
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
What I like is the picture.

930
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I like the picture.

931
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:57,000
This show seems a little trying to me, but only Jason would know I didn't see it live.

932
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I don't think I did.

933
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
You believe you did, though.

934
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I think you'd I think I did.

935
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I would have been there.

936
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I'm sure someone would have looked at a map and went, oh, the dinosaurs.

937
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
We watched it.

938
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Yeah, let's see what that is.

939
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And like that was you made you one of your relatives sound very dumb.

940
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I thought the dinosaurs there was we watched that show.

941
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I'm just trying to imagine the synopsis, you know, and just trying to give me watch that me watch that we go now.

942
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Oh, the kids are like the kids are like this.

943
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
It was a tribute to the show.

944
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Yeah, right.

945
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Yeah, I'm sure I'm sure I would have seen.

946
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I mean, like all of the stuff that we like, I mean, this park, the selling point of this park, it all worked on me.

947
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Like for like young kids, like all those cartoons, all the ABC shows, they're all here.

948
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Yeah.

949
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Yeah.

950
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
The show.

951
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It's it's not nearly as good as the Ace Ventura Hollywood Studios show.

952
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I disagree with that.

953
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I thought that was dog shit.

954
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I don't like the Ace Ventura show, but I think there's more of what you would want from Ace Ventura in that show.

955
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
He repulsed on a building.

956
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
There's some animal antics.

957
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I'm not saying this is one of the greatest team parks as Ventura is, but I think that you get more of what you would want from that show.

958
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It's a little longer.

959
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
There were different versions of it.

960
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
This is like a dressed up parade float.

961
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Yeah, it is.

962
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
It's like a brief parade.

963
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
But you know what?

964
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
You get those suits, you get weird, creepy versions of the dinosaur.

965
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I know I just said I didn't feel great about the show, but you just brought up what I think is one of the worst things we've ever talked about.

966
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
The Ace Ventura show?

967
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I thought that show was terrible.

968
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Well, I'm not going to defend the show as not being terrible, but I do think it's better than this.

969
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Hmm, Jason.

970
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Well, I know I think this delivers on the prop.

971
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Like the suits look pretty close to the, you know, TV show suits.

972
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And they're kind of far away.

973
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I guess you could get close and it would look cool.

974
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Baby Sinclair says not the mama.

975
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Like it's everything you want.

976
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Yeah, there's quips and it's a puppet.

977
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
He's being done puppet wise and then there's suits and they dance.

978
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
You get a big, I think just the scale you get.

979
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It's puppets, it's suits, it's a big bus.

980
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
You've just swung me back.

981
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
That's how much I hated that Ace Ventura show.

982
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I turned it right around.

983
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Yeah.

984
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I feel like that was a show.

985
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It was a show.

986
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
We were like deep pandemic and I, we finished that and I'm like, there's a miserable time.

987
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And we just talked about a miserable show.

988
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
We got it.

989
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
We got to cheer up.

990
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:46,000
It was a bad, it's a bad show, but I do think it fulfills the promise of an Ace Ventura show.

991
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I don't know.

992
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I want, oh, here's the difference though.

993
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I don't want an Ace Ventura show.

994
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I want a dinosaur show and I'll settle for a bad.

995
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I'll settle for one that I just a few minutes ago said I didn't think was good.

996
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,000
It still gives me joy more than this kind of slow crawl down a rope and there's one bird in a window.

997
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I really hated it.

998
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
There's a toilet joke in that Ace Ventura show.

999
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And like that, you shouldn't have either.

1000
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
All right.

1001
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,000
This show has also, I said it at the top, but Babies and Claire says, I'm ready for my closeup.

1002
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Mr. DeMille.

1003
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
It's a Sunset Boulevard joke in the sun.

1004
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It's a joke in a Hollywood theme park.

1005
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And the crowd, I say, I bring that up because it gets a big response.

1006
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
You can hear people laughing in like the home movie copies of this show.

1007
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
How many people do you think?

1008
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I don't know.

1009
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
No, it seems like it plays really well.

1010
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
It seems like a baby would play well.

1011
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I don't know.

1012
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I don't know.

1013
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Play well.

1014
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And so that's also a phrase that I was saying for years.

1015
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Well, really?

1016
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And also I watched, I watched.

1017
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
So annoying.

1018
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
It is very annoying.

1019
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Like your parents.

1020
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Stop saying it.

1021
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
And I watched Sunset Boulevard at like 11 or 12.

1022
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:11,000
You know, I stayed inside on a nice summer day because I was like Turner Classic Movies is showing Sunset Boulevard next.

1023
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And the line is actually the other way around.

1024
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Mr. DeMille.

1025
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I'm ready for my closeup.

1026
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
But one of those remembered.

1027
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
It's like I'm ready for my father.

1028
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
They're not.

1029
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Beam me up Scotty.

1030
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
That's not what he said.

1031
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
It isn't?

1032
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
No.

1033
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Did he never say that?

1034
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I don't believe he ever said beam me up Scotty.

1035
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
That's really?

1036
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Yeah.

1037
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Wow.

1038
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Yeah.

1039
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
People said that to me my whole life.

1040
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Oh, they did?

1041
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Oh, really?

1042
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Of course.

1043
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Yes.

1044
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Oh, yeah.

1045
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
How can we bother this guy named Scott by saying that?

1046
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And it did bother you.

1047
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Yeah.

1048
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
What am I supposed to say that?

1049
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I have no response to this.

1050
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Play it again, Sam.

1051
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Probably the most famous one.

1052
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
He doesn't say play it again, Sam.

1053
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Ingrid Bergman says play it, play as time goes by.

1054
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Yeah.

1055
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Beam me up Scotty.

1056
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Catchphrase a misquotation that made its way in the popular culture.

1057
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Wow.

1058
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
You should have just thrown that in people's face.

1059
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Actually, that would have really gone over well.

1060
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Excuse me.

1061
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I would like to correct you on the phrase you're using.

1062
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
You're thinking.

1063
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
That was never said.

1064
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
So it's irrelevant.

1065
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I got to do something else.

1066
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Do say to Everest.

1067
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I don't know how we've gone this long without talking about this.

1068
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
This is with all the movie studio theme parks out there.

1069
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I think I'm ready for my closeup.

1070
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Mr. Dimmill is a tent pole.

1071
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
How many?

1072
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Yeah.

1073
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And I couldn't tell you where, but like, don't you hear?

1074
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I'd like, I feel like I've probably heard that a hundred times.

1075
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Yeah.

1076
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I don't even know in what I didn't like any of them.

1077
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Yeah.

1078
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
But that's such a, and it's still said this long after such simple part,

1079
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
this long after anybody really knowing what Mr. Dimmill did.

1080
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Yeah.

1081
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Yes.

1082
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I think that's probably like I'm bugs bunny is I feel like he has said it many times.

1083
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I could be wrong.

1084
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Oh, sure.

1085
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Um, yeah, I would, I would believe almost any character said that at one point.

1086
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Did Michael Angelo say that on the original animated TV show, Ninja Turtle show?

1087
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Probably.

1088
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I don't know.

1089
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Of a similar piece, uh, uh, you mentioned movie studio based theme parks.

1090
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
This is a thing I love in movies, studio theme parks, the fake camera truck.

1091
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
There was a fake camera truck.

1092
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Yeah.

1093
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
As if they're filming, driving ahead of the parade float.

1094
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,000
This is still, you can still see the fake camera rig at the Indiana Jones stunt show.

1095
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Oh, that's the same one in the early days.

1096
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Yeah.

1097
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
It's still an ancient like film reel.

1098
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
We don't.

1099
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Yeah.

1100
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Ignore that.

1101
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Like you can film car, see moving scenes with little cameras with like phones.

1102
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
And there's also the more you think about that stunt show, you're like, wait, I, has

1103
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
anyone mentioned the phrase Steven Spielberg or George Lucas?

1104
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Steven Spielberg might be set at some point, but you're concerned that they aren't using

1105
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
their name.

1106
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I feel like it doesn't come up.

1107
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
You mean like you're shooting the movie?

1108
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
They're shooting the movie.

1109
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
So you think like somebody should be playing Spielberg in the Indiana Jones stunt show?

1110
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Yeah.

1111
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
In theory, cause they're shooting in rapid sequence.

1112
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
All the set pieces of the movie.

1113
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Who's the Fableman's?

1114
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Who's good?

1115
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Do you have that kid?

1116
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Is the kid, when he gets older, there's a sigh Fableman, but I don't remember if that's

1117
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
the kid.

1118
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Oh, I can't remember.

1119
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I get, I only, all I got, I haven't watched Fableman yet.

1120
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Vect no crew.

1121
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Vect no crew is the most important name to know after this episode, but that's an interesting

1122
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
point.

1123
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Yeah.

1124
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I mean, Spielberg though, probably with the universal association, he can't be represented

1125
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
in a Disney park.

1126
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Sammy Fableman.

1127
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Sammy Fableman.

1128
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
You're thinking of Cy Abelman from a serious man.

1129
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Oh, you're right.

1130
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
From the Cohen brothers movie.

1131
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Yeah, I don't think there is a Cy Fableman.

1132
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Cy Abelman is the great character from, he goes, we're going to be fine.

1133
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
We're going to be fine.

1134
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
You're going to be fine.

1135
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
We're going to be fine.

1136
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
We're whatever.

1137
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,320
Cy Abelman is not Cy Fableman.

1138
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,320
There is no such thing as Cy Fableman.

1139
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,800
Cy Fableman is really good.

1140
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,320
I wonder if somebody could see why.

1141
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,320
Cy Abelman.

1142
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,880
I let me, okay.

1143
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,880
I described the parade route, but now let me say the premise of the show.

1144
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:22,900
The premise of the show is every day at Disney MGM studios, there is a event called surprise

1145
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,920
family of the day.

1146
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,480
That's all that always happens.

1147
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:33,840
Probably mostly regular families could be yours on a different day, but today it's the

1148
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:40,200
Sinclair family who are dinosaurs and who are as acknowledged in the show from the hit

1149
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,640
series dinosaurs.

1150
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:46,680
So they are alive today, happened to be vacationing in Disney MGM studios have become the stars

1151
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,480
of a show that would not normally star them.

1152
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,480
Right.

1153
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,960
Yet there is an original song that they sing about being dinosaurs and about the show having

1154
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,480
picked dinosaurs that is ready to go.

1155
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,800
The music is loaded up and on all the park loudspeakers.

1156
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,480
This is also being filmed.

1157
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,120
It's a movie studio park and this is important.

1158
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,360
Camera truck as Jason mentioned.

1159
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,020
I think there's a big crane.

1160
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:15,440
So it's a parade that's being filmed with accidental contest winners who happen to be

1161
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,040
the stars of dinosaurs.

1162
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,260
No, I don't know how they're alive today.

1163
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:24,240
And at the end they say, and that's a wrap.

1164
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,160
How many premises did I just say?

1165
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,160
Four?

1166
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,160
It seems like four.

1167
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,440
Got a lot going on here.

1168
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,520
A lot going on and like two.

1169
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,520
Yeah.

1170
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,560
Well, they could have just been family of the day and there's the dinosaurs and who

1171
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,920
cares or don't do.

1172
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,920
Why is it family?

1173
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:37,920
The word doesn't.

1174
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:38,920
Here's the dinosaurs.

1175
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:39,920
Everyone.

1176
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,920
So here's the dinosaurs is fine.

1177
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:45,280
And they sing a song and then he baby Sinclair says something and he leaves the dinosaurs

1178
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,860
are here today.

1179
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:47,860
Could have been the name of it.

1180
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:48,860
I think that's right.

1181
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,860
Yeah.

1182
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:50,860
I would have accepted that.

1183
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:51,860
Yes.

1184
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:56,180
I don't know why they're competing premises and I don't know why they're around.

1185
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,060
I saw them die.

1186
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,060
I watched.

1187
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:02,420
Hey, they were thriving with this.

1188
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,820
See, bark show is going on.

1189
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:04,820
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

1190
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:05,820
That was before they're down.

1191
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,940
No, they were season schedule.

1192
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,460
These are we need to make a note.

1193
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:16,300
If we ever talk to one of these older imagineers again, Tony back to Joe Roe or Joe Joe Roy

1194
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:19,060
or something, we have to ask about stuff like this.

1195
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,060
Yeah.

1196
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,180
Has this ever come across your desk?

1197
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:27,780
Who would have decided on the premise for the dinosaur float attraction that would like

1198
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:28,780
pop in and out?

1199
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,780
Did you?

1200
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:30,780
Did you even know?

1201
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,780
Were you aware of it?

1202
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:32,780
This is a different department.

1203
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:36,740
Like I have so many questions about this type of entertainment in the parks.

1204
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:37,740
Little nitty gritty.

1205
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:41,380
Does he never hear anything about ace Ventura show or this show?

1206
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:46,220
I think Bob Weiss was a big part of this getting this park open and running.

1207
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,220
Great.

1208
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,220
So he would be the.

1209
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:49,220
Yeah.

1210
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:55,380
So we'll get this major imagineering and not ask him about the dinosaurs show.

1211
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,340
Do we even know the name of it?

1212
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:59,340
I guess we'll have to by the time this comes out.

1213
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,860
Is it called dinosaurs live?

1214
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,820
What is the YouTube called?

1215
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,140
I believe it was called dinosaurs.

1216
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,140
There's a few ones.

1217
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:12,180
Yeah, there's it's not something that is it is.

1218
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,180
There's live excavation.

1219
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,180
There's live.

1220
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,460
Don't forget the excavation point.

1221
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,020
Yeah, because it's exciting.

1222
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:21,060
Yeah, so you can't Google it because you search dinosaurs live and it's all these current

1223
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,620
things with Jurassic World.

1224
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,100
Oh, man.

1225
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,780
No footprint for this.

1226
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:31,740
It's all like insane money laundering schemes to like fill anchor stores and dying malls.

1227
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:32,740
Oh, yeah.

1228
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:36,060
Oh, I loved dinosaurs and whatever mall that was in the South.

1229
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,060
Oh, yeah.

1230
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,060
A lot of dinosaur stuff.

1231
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,060
Dinosaur is live.

1232
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:43,420
Listener, I'm sorry I didn't know the name of it and you're this deep into an episode.

1233
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:44,420
You know how these things go.

1234
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:46,300
You're not going to look at the video anyway.

1235
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,380
If you're listening, I mean, maybe you will.

1236
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:53,500
Maybe you've pulled it up at this point, but it's not there's not much by the guy we know.

1237
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,300
Yes, that's right.

1238
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,420
By Ian. Yeah.

1239
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,660
He was his last name.

1240
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,060
But Kebani. Kebani.

1241
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:58,660
That's right. Yeah.

1242
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,940
Well, he's he posted his old home.

1243
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:03,380
Oh, yeah.

1244
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,540
And what if I'm looking at a video and like, wait a minute.

1245
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,620
Yes, he posted it.

1246
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:08,820
I have not asked him about it.

1247
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,820
Thanks for posting it.

1248
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:10,900
It was very helpful.

1249
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:13,020
Very good quality home movies.

1250
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:13,820
Like, yes.

1251
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,900
Yeah. Good rip.

1252
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:19,740
Better transfer in these sorry ass transfer houses early, slipping on the tapes.

1253
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:20,420
Yeah.

1254
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:23,300
And everyone. But Jason is clanging them around,

1255
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,060
tossing them out the window,

1256
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,660
slow and hot soup on

1257
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,860
brother beloved episodes of Next Generation.

1258
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:37,620
Look, the the staff of a lot of these post houses,

1259
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:43,820
you know, the lower rungs at some of these places, it's a mix of recent college graduates.

1260
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:50,140
Thank you for thankful for any job during a recession time and a lot of burnouts.

1261
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,420
Oh, boy. A lot of burnout.

1262
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,300
Jason's calling you out.

1263
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,860
Yeah. Calling burnouts out.

1264
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:04,700
I was trying to think like, like, what what do I want from dinosaurs,

1265
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:09,180
from a cheapish thing that you could pop up in a park like this?

1266
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,460
Like, what do I want from it?

1267
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:16,940
And I think I want really what I want is some sort of a room that you can walk in

1268
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,580
and they're just in there.

1269
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:20,260
Yeah, you can see them for a little bit.

1270
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,300
I'd rather do a meet and greet for sure.

1271
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,380
Yeah. Even if I don't get to like take a picture with them,

1272
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:30,700
just getting to be in like a weird Stone Age kind of room and just see them.

1273
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:33,140
I think it could be 45 seconds.

1274
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:36,020
And that's going to give me what I want closer to what I want.

1275
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:39,540
You know, if somebody's really mean when the 45 seconds is up.

1276
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:43,620
Yeah, somebody really ushers me out and I get in trouble if I stay too long.

1277
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,500
Yeah, I think that would be.

1278
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,820
You're in trouble. Tell your mom.

1279
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,940
OK, I'll know if you don't tell.

1280
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:57,460
I do have because I think I was there in like 91 and 92.

1281
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,780
I have pictures with a walk around beast.

1282
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,100
OK, a giant walk around beast.

1283
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,740
Pictures with the Ninja Turtles of thrilling.

1284
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:08,020
Oh, yeah. Stars of stage and screen.

1285
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:11,180
But I feel like there was a I don't I.

1286
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,420
Maybe this is a thing in general where it's like

1287
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,380
bringing stuff that's really current.

1288
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:21,180
It's very they're not going to build the tickets when something's new.

1289
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,660
It's a TV show, especially.

1290
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,380
It's got to really now go.

1291
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:27,300
We got like Guardians is kind of almost a fluke, I feel like,

1292
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,820
because that would that's fairly new as far as I know.

1293
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,980
And it came together fast. Yeah.

1294
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:35,460
But it's like there should be spaces for

1295
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:40,380
current stuff in the parks to set up like a little maze

1296
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,140
or a little meet and greet that looks thematically like it.

1297
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:48,340
Well, that's what Disney Mickey's Starland was. Yes.

1298
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:52,260
That was a space for like little kind of themed facades

1299
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,540
where you could meet the Disney afternoon character

1300
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,940
and they could slide those in and out.

1301
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:58,620
So that did fulfill.

1302
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:01,220
And at the time where we needed it the most, of course,

1303
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,660
we really wanted to meet Darkwing Duck. Yes.

1304
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:08,300
So because you can get otter stuff if it's not

1305
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,740
you don't have to build something elaborate.

1306
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:15,220
But I want to. Yeah, I want to go in like Earl's boss's office.

1307
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,660
And I think they could do that. That wouldn't be too expensive.

1308
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:21,340
Yeah. You don't have to have his boss in there.

1309
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:24,180
Did this they just have the bus already?

1310
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,300
Is that why they're on a bus? For sure.

1311
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:31,740
Definitely. That was why the family of the day theme, because in a

1312
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:35,420
if the if it's like the dinosaurs parade,

1313
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:38,420
then you expect it to look like rocks.

1314
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,460
Yeah, this is the way they can get away with.

1315
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:44,140
They're just on a like a iron.

1316
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:48,100
Yeah, it is an old double decker from Magic Kingdom.

1317
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:51,060
I was going to say it's definitely from a parade of Magic Kingdom, right?

1318
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:51,900
Yeah, I think so.

1319
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,500
That was my first thought when I saw it. Yeah. Yeah.

1320
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:58,260
But they would do more parades at NGM Studios in the early days.

1321
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,300
So I got to go.

1322
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:03,220
Now I want to look up pictures and see like, OK, the dinosaurs are off.

1323
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,220
Aladdin and friends are on. Yeah.

1324
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,620
Hercules and friends are on.

1325
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:10,500
There was definitely a Hercules like victory parade.

1326
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:14,180
I feel like it was a weird way to phrase it.

1327
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,780
But victory parade.

1328
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,900
It's something like that of celebration or it's good, though.

1329
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,460
That was very that was pretty heavily themed.

1330
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:24,420
I think a lot of new stuff at that

1331
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,260
is supposed to just throw on the dinosaur.

1332
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:30,100
But is this not I kind of hadn't put it together.

1333
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:34,740
It's recent characters from TV, not film.

1334
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:38,740
And you don't get too close to them, but they're up on a second story

1335
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,260
and they wave at you.

1336
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:42,420
This is Avengers campus.

1337
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,220
This show invented Avengers.

1338
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,300
Oh, you're right. Yeah.

1339
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,100
There's a little balcony.

1340
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,140
New characters wave at you. Yeah.

1341
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,580
Yeah. And they do a little show up there.

1342
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:56,260
Uh huh. Now, do I wish that the Hawkeye and

1343
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:00,100
I can't name any more

1344
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:03,620
Hawkeye and Thor are dancing to walk the dinosaur?

1345
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,300
Of course. Oh, yes.

1346
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:10,020
Oh, that big Hulk, a big helmet Hulk had done walk like in the dinosaur.

1347
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:13,940
That the thing they announced, which is the joke from Hawkeye,

1348
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:17,780
that the musical thing in the old Frozen and the old Aladdin theater.

1349
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,140
Rogers. Yeah.

1350
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:22,100
Rogers, a musical, which is a kind of a parody of.

1351
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,780
We're talking about Mark Shaman again here.

1352
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:26,860
Yeah. A parody of musicals.

1353
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:31,420
It's it's close to what I want with characters dancing to

1354
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,340
the dinosaurs, do the whatever, walk the dinosaur.

1355
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,580
You think so? You think it'll be like as silly as that?

1356
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:40,660
Well, the show is it's a big over the top musical of like

1357
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,980
how the battle and the first Avengers went.

1358
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:46,820
OK, and it's very like like silly and then Broadway style.

1359
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:49,140
Like and the joke is Hawkeye hates it.

1360
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,220
Yeah, he's like, Joe, that's funny.

1361
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:54,020
The joke is Hawkeye is like, this is annoying to me.

1362
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:58,180
How over the top this is and like Hulk and like he looks just like Broadway

1363
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,780
man dressed as Hulk and stuff.

1364
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:03,580
I think Hawkeye is honestly my favorite of all the Disney plus Marvel shows.

1365
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:07,860
But that's close to having some fun.

1366
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:11,220
I will I give them that credit because we really just want

1367
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:14,380
what I really want is a hyperspace hoopla with the Marvel characters.

1368
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:19,420
When the lights go down, I want them to twerking to new music.

1369
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:22,460
But this is pretty close to having some fun.

1370
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:23,940
I will give them that. Yeah.

1371
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:27,740
Uh huh. And it's got to be like it's not they have to make new stuff for it.

1372
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,980
Unless it's only going to be like a five minute show.

1373
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,220
No, I think it's long.

1374
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,380
No, right. I think it's going to be long.

1375
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:34,740
I'm saying they have to write new stuff.

1376
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,540
So we'll see what it is.

1377
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,780
Maybe they'll go sincere, which I hope they don't.

1378
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,500
Yeah, they need to.

1379
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,940
I mean, well, this is a good this is a step in the right direction.

1380
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:46,700
And as somebody who was not

1381
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:51,140
blown away by a film called The Eternals, OK,

1382
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:56,380
somebody who, let's say, didn't understand for one millisecond

1383
00:59:56,380 --> 01:00:01,300
what I was watching or why, why anyone would find any of this interesting.

1384
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:05,860
I might change my tune a little bit if they if they got a little

1385
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,060
into some musical mischief.

1386
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:09,740
Kingo is singing.

1387
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,380
You know, it's possible.

1388
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:14,300
If Kingo's Singo's.

1389
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,700
Yes, that's the show.

1390
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:18,420
That's the show. That's the show.

1391
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:20,580
He's not even on Kingo's Singo.

1392
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:24,380
Maybe that'll be the other characters from the other movies.

1393
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:26,140
Then they can make up new songs.

1394
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:29,660
I am the king of wishful thinking.

1395
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:32,900
See, that's yeah, that's what I want.

1396
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,260
I want like parody, Marvel.

1397
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:37,220
I refuse to give in to Thanos.

1398
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,780
That's not how it's going to be.

1399
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,820
Yeah. So, yeah.

1400
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:44,700
OK, imagine hyperspace hoopla.

1401
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:45,860
Yeah, we talked about this.

1402
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:48,460
If listeners, if you go go back, this is on a Patreon

1403
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:52,620
where Star Wars characters would twerk to new like newer songs

1404
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:55,020
and then, you know, like beat it or something.

1405
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:57,780
Beat it. You know, something newer.

1406
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:00,380
I say new, I mean, last 40 years.

1407
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:01,660
Oh, Mickey dances.

1408
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:03,740
Don't they all come out and dance to Gangnam Style?

1409
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,940
I don't know. Of course, of course, of course, Jason.

1410
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:09,420
We're joking. Yeah, it's it's a piece of work.

1411
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:12,580
Yes. But imagine hyperspace hoopla and then like they will baby

1412
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:14,660
Sinclair out at the end.

1413
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,100
I mean, that's fantastic.

1414
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,380
Sorry. Wait, I'm lost.

1415
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,660
What are we?

1416
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:22,700
Is this hyperspace hoopla or is this Marvel hyperspace hoopla?

1417
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,660
What show are you describing?

1418
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:26,860
And what year are you saying?

1419
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:32,060
You guys are giving me two options for what I'm too many options for what I meant.

1420
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:37,540
Oh, you're like grabbing the side of your face because you're smiling so big.

1421
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:41,340
OK, so here.

1422
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:46,260
I'm just going to pick an arbitrary year to make it seem like I knew what I was pitching you.

1423
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:54,140
Say it's the year 2023 and it's your Hollywood studios and they're doing hyperspace hoopla again.

1424
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:57,500
Yeah, and it's Star Wars and it is.

1425
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,540
Well, Star Wars up until the end of this point.

1426
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:02,700
And the big thing at the hyperspace hoopla was at the end, Mickey came out

1427
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:07,740
and everyone lost their shit. Revolutionary, utterly unpredictable.

1428
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,660
Even more so than the last year.

1429
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:14,340
The perfect moment of surprise in fiction.

1430
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:18,740
Audience was so excited about it, even more than the baby Sinclair

1431
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:21,820
doing the Sunset Boulevard line.

1432
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:28,620
And baby Sinclair comes out and do a Lippa song place.

1433
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:34,940
And then baby Sinclair twerks like that would be that would be fantastic.

1434
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:39,700
Well, again, I as somebody who bristled at the notion that Mickey coming out

1435
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:43,060
at the end of a show at Disney World was that surprising.

1436
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:45,260
Now, baby Sinclair doing it.

1437
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:48,420
So you agree. Now I'm out of nowhere.

1438
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:52,460
OK, I don't even know if that gets a huge response just due to the confusion

1439
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:56,780
build up at the end.

1440
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:58,660
And his baby is in a suit.

1441
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:00,860
I guess it's a suited character.

1442
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:04,380
I think he's in the high chair, but he like rotates and he's kind of like

1443
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:08,020
it works. I think, yeah, I like it.

1444
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:12,260
He kind of it looks like the chair is kind of like hopping forward.

1445
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:14,740
They had to develop a stunt tronic for this.

1446
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:17,580
They were like, yeah, yeah, the flying Spider-Man out of the way.

1447
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:22,660
Now we need a realistic baby Sinclair that can make his entire high chair twerk.

1448
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:26,580
What about just it's a suit and the top half is the baby

1449
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:29,060
and the bottom half is are the legs of the high chair.

1450
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:31,980
And it's just the human legs in the chair.

1451
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,380
So somebody's like legs are.

1452
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:35,900
Wait, are the legs his?

1453
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,740
No, the legs are the OK.

1454
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:42,540
So so the front two legs of the human performer are the legs of the high chair.

1455
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:46,260
And then there are two other legs coming out like the butt of the suit.

1456
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,700
But they're obviously there's no legs in there.

1457
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,540
And then we need more than two legs for a high chair.

1458
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:54,740
Well, you do. I'm just saying like you're like sitting on two of them.

1459
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:56,340
So it's like this.

1460
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:57,340
I mean, you don't know what I'm saying.

1461
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,900
So I'm like, these are the legs in the chair.

1462
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:02,820
And then there are two other legs kind of coming out the back of the costume.

1463
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:03,820
It's like a kickstand.

1464
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:04,740
So kickstand. Right.

1465
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,660
And then it stands this top half.

1466
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:07,780
You want to take a picture of this?

1467
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:11,140
The top half is sort of in the high chair.

1468
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:14,140
Gram and we'll take it to the patent office.

1469
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:16,300
This is a revolutionary kind of suit.

1470
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:19,140
Well, yeah, draw the diagram and then mail it to yourself.

1471
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:20,100
You know, yeah, yeah.

1472
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:20,980
First, first.

1473
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:24,260
So then once the song, the Dua Lipa song hits,

1474
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,900
Baby Sinclair can start twerking very easily.

1475
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:31,820
And it's kind of like the back of the high chair is going along with his little tail.

1476
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:34,540
So that's just fun.

1477
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:35,620
That's just a fun thing.

1478
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:38,740
Well, yeah, get this registered.

1479
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:42,540
And in that dry away where Disney doesn't reveal they are, you know,

1480
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:45,060
Universal doesn't say this patent is for the Donkey Kong.

1481
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:49,620
Right, right. This is this is a premise that would provide for the future.

1482
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:52,980
Yeah. Of the dinosaur sitcom prehistoric

1483
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,820
based twerk entertainment.

1484
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:58,740
Prehistoric baby baby.

1485
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:05,700
Prehistoric flatulent baby gyrates to musical merriment or something

1486
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:09,340
in chair in in high chair.

1487
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:11,700
That's what that would be.

1488
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:16,220
The US government recognizes that is the what's being patented.

1489
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,340
That's the thing in the office.

1490
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:22,940
Somebody would get it in that office and like, what's the I quit.

1491
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:28,100
A 70 year career in the patent office is over.

1492
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:32,140
Sorry. And that person, I know one of these countries going hell.

1493
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:34,740
And that person seen the worst things patented to

1494
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:40,100
vile, genocidal chemicals and weapons.

1495
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:45,180
Can we get showing zoomers

1496
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:48,460
dinosaur sitcom going on TikTok?

1497
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:49,660
Oh, OK.

1498
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:52,580
No one you're saying that to be a new trend.

1499
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:56,460
I have seen I've seen this trend on things where, yeah,

1500
01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:01,700
it's just a little video and you show young people stuff from the past.

1501
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:04,860
There's a lot of videos of like young people listening to classic music

1502
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:07,020
that we've watched over the years.

1503
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:09,100
And then like, it would be like, you've seen these.

1504
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:13,020
Yeah. Like you feel in the air tonight or something or Bohemian Rhapsody.

1505
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:15,900
Well, they have other performing a bit.

1506
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:19,100
They're performing a bit, but it's it's kind of interesting.

1507
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:23,220
So you're saying you want this trend with ABC's

1508
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:27,340
I want to say I want to say I'm the baby.

1509
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:28,980
Got to love me.

1510
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:32,460
So like people would just say that back then. Yeah.

1511
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:36,340
So this is what people look like in the 90s.

1512
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:43,020
Jason, is there any video of you saying the phrases?

1513
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:44,540
You think there's any VHS?

1514
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:47,900
I don't know. I feel like we were late to get the video camera.

1515
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:50,780
And you think it was like a priceless faberge.

1516
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:54,500
The way my brother and I were not allowed to touch.

1517
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:58,740
Oh, OK. I did not get a fabled man's time until much later.

1518
01:06:58,780 --> 01:06:59,540
How old are you?

1519
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:02,780
And I feel like you'd be bad at working with media.

1520
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:05,580
And they knew you were all right.

1521
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:07,940
All right. OK, so I was.

1522
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:13,260
I got into great media production and storage and preservation.

1523
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:16,300
OK, so all right.

1524
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,340
I'm going to say action.

1525
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:19,500
And then you say I'm ready for my close up, Mr.

1526
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:21,460
OK, and three to.

1527
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:25,140
Oh, God. Oh, the camera exploded in my hands.

1528
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:31,940
Well, I think I think we did it.

1529
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:37,180
I mean, hey, it's fun to watch a video of the show.

1530
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:41,820
Is this the greatest piece that the theme park entertainment ever put on?

1531
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:44,220
No, possibly not. Possibly not.

1532
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:47,500
But it is fun that this all was there.

1533
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,860
They tried something.

1534
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:51,860
I really I'm so happy because I didn't remember.

1535
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:54,700
I've seen photos with the dinosaurs, but I didn't realize there was

1536
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:58,820
something other than just the characters walking around, which it feels like

1537
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:03,260
there's stuff we can uncover and not that we dug deep, deep for this or anything.

1538
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:05,380
But was his home improvement?

1539
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:09,340
There's a home improvement, like walkthrough thing in MGM Studios or something.

1540
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:12,260
Stuff seems like there would be if there was.

1541
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:13,900
And it seems like there would be.

1542
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,060
But there's stuff like that where you're like, oh, that was there.

1543
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:17,500
So it's like stuff.

1544
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,380
It's fun. It's fun to see what they like.

1545
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:21,540
Little things they tried. Yeah. Yeah.

1546
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:26,340
And also very important that in the law, they have to cover

1547
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:29,100
the ride up with a lot of dialogue.

1548
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:35,620
And it's important that Grandma Ethel wants to go to the energy pavilion at Epcot

1549
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:38,900
because there's a cute Tyrannosaurus that hangs out there.

1550
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:40,460
That is good. That's nice.

1551
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:42,740
Yeah. She wants to go date the energy.

1552
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:45,380
And source.

1553
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:50,180
But they don't do the song that Baby Sinclair sings at some point.

1554
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:51,980
I'm the baby. I love the baby.

1555
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:55,460
Got to love me. Great big guys and really cuddly.

1556
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,380
Yeah. Oh, they're.

1557
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:00,740
Wait, I didn't say another one early in musical memory.

1558
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:03,420
I remember enjoying that.

1559
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:07,220
I like that. I loved that a show was like Full House, that Full House would show

1560
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:12,100
like an Olsen Twins music video or the Jesse and the Rippers forever.

1561
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:16,820
I like ABC because they don't bore me with full long shows always.

1562
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:19,620
Sometimes there's a fun music video at the end.

1563
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:26,460
Well, here maybe I'll I might play a little snippet of that at the end

1564
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:30,340
because the rap is in the middle is pretty good,

1565
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:34,460
which will replace my previous idea of ending the episode musically,

1566
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:37,700
which is just playing the chorus of Walk the Dinosaur

1567
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:40,860
for it for 11 minutes at the end.

1568
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:44,940
If it's just that we left that entire show on.

1569
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:50,340
But OK, so for now, you survived podcast, the ride.

Do you want us to talk about whatever the home improvement experience was?

1575
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:08,180
Or you remember that they had the bookstore from Ellen?

1576
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:09,740
I don't know that.

1577
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:14,540
Oh, it went in the bookstore all the time because it was well stopped with goosebumps.

1578
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:18,860
I don't think I ever put it together that it was the one from Ellen.

1579
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:20,780
I think that was the idea of that.

1580
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:25,740
The iconic bookstore that Ellen worked were apparently or went to.

1581
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:29,740
I could not tell you one detail about all we got to do on that.

1582
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:35,300
But because they didn't do any cool music videos like this,

1583
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:38,580
which leave you with Baby Sinclair's rap.

1584
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:42,420
And you might be able to guess some of the topics of his rap.
