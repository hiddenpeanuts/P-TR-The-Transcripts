1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,700
Welcome, foolish mortals, to Hauntcast the Fright, the show that's more fun than a forced-rigged

2
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,760
game of Mario Kart against your boss.

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,960
I'm TheGarowolf, joined by, there's no way I'm gonna remember these names.

4
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,440
Well, it's changed, I'm now Spike Dracula's son, that's my name.

5
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,440
You are, huh?

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,440
Yup.

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,880
Now, I notice that there's not much of a rhyme going on, is that just due to the, becoming

8
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,120
more aware of Dracula's son from talking about the Monster Mash?

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,120
That's exactly correct.

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
Great, great.

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, sounds good, I'm glad that you have the son construct in your name to properly

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
honor this great character.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,280
I can be anyone's son now, for some future Hauntcast, I can be Werewolf's son, I can

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,840
be any Frankenstein's son, it doesn't matter.

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,840
We'll see what happens.

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,840
Any heretofore unacknowledged son.

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,120
Now, I turn to the name from the third host of the show.

18
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,920
Oh, Jackal Scarridan?

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,120
Great, fantastic.

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,280
It does me well to hear these, it does me well to see you guys even in Zoom form.

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,560
We'll explain why we're on Zoom form, and you might know already, because there's a

22
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,200
bicoastal thing happening here, and let me tell you why.

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,160
Every Hauntcast season, there's things that we revisit, perennial experiences, these Halloween

24
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,080
events that have been going for decades, your Halloween Horror Nights, your Not Scary Farms.

25
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,920
This year, there is a new kid on the spooky block, and that is, of course, Jimmy Fallon's

26
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,680
To Nightmares, the Jimmy Fallon Tonight Show themed haunted experience that is emanating

27
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,560
from Rockefeller Center in New York, and we've discussed it on the show a little bit.

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,600
Our ears definitely perked up when we heard the news.

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,600
And while we believe that Jimmy Fallon's To Nightmares will become a decades-long institution,

30
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:14,440
and there will be many, many years in which we can visit and revisit what will soon become

31
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,920
a Haunt stalwart, we still wanted that first year on the ground energy.

32
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,560
We had to know what year one of presumably 50 would be, and we were worried that all

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,200
of us being here in LA that we would miss it.

34
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,960
Luckily, a New York correspondent rose to the challenge, and we weren't surprised by

35
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,320
this because if there is a challenge, he will complete it.

36
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,360
Please welcome Griffin, the Completer Newman.

37
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,440
Thank you very much for giving me my credit as a Completer.

38
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,400
If you would quickly just...

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,320
I did change my display name on the Zoom for the season, and if you could please introduce

40
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,120
me by my proper topical name.

41
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
Oh, yes.

42
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,040
I mean, there's a dot, dot, dot, but I think I'm still...

43
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
I can do it.

44
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,880
I see it if you need me to do it.

45
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,880
Why don't you?

46
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,880
In case I'm...

47
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
I think I'm seeing it all, but you go for it.

48
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,880
Okay.

49
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,160
And Mike, put a little stank on this.

50
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,560
Oh, okay.

51
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,000
Bobby Boris style, I'm assuming stank you mean?

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I would love that.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I would love that.

54
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
Stank could there be.

55
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,360
Grief Fang Boo Maniac.

56
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,160
I was missing some.

57
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,800
I'm glad you read it.

58
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,240
I was going to just leave it at Grief Fang Boo Man, so thank you for...

59
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,240
Boo Man is good too though.

60
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,240
I don't know how it is you're seeing the whole name.

61
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:34,160
I just want to squeeze every last drop out of it.

62
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,560
I did complete Jimmy Fallon's To Nightmares, but I don't want to take the lion's share

63
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,320
of credit here because this was not a task that one man could complete on his own.

64
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
Indeed, indeed.

65
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,880
I was not a solo correspondent on this one.

66
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
Yes.

67
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,560
And I'm very glad that that is the case.

68
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,520
And now I'm thrilled to do the second introduction of the episode.

69
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:02,080
Griffin, you host the excellent podcast Blank Check, a show which, unlike The Tonight Show

70
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,360
starring Jimmy Fallon, hasn't gone through producers like Toilet Paper.

71
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:17,400
Your show has been guided by the same steady hand for many, many years, who is also an

72
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,080
excellent on-mic personality on the show.

73
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:25,000
He's never been on Podcast The Ride, and I'm thrilled this is a great excuse to do it.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,320
He having joined you for this experience, very happy to welcome to Podcast The Ride

75
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
producer, Ben.

76
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,320
Ben Hosley.

77
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
Hey there.

78
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
Glad to be here.

79
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Hello, Ben.

80
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,320
I see Ben has changed his name though.

81
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520
You're going to have to do it.

82
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520
Yes, I got it in at the last minute.

83
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
At the last second.

84
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,480
So let me let me do my magic right here.

85
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,920
I'd like to welcome Brains Howlslay.

86
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
Hello.

87
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
Very good.

88
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
Yeah.

89
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:57,760
I'm so glad to be on the show and I'm, you know, very I don't know, I don't know how

90
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,880
to feel about what I experienced, but I think it was good that Griffin had someone there

91
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:11,760
with him, just to kind of make sure that like it was in fact that mediocre and terrible,

92
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,400
like just needed someone else to be there to witness and confirm that.

93
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,600
But also an interesting different perspective, right?

94
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,160
Because Ben walks out and immediately asked me like, what is that supposed to be?

95
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,240
Ben is coming from a place where he doesn't have a reference point of what a Halloween

96
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,360
Horror Night is, a not scary form is.

97
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,880
You know, like Ben is comparing this to like what like teenage, like fair haunted houses.

98
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
Yeah, pretty much.

99
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
Yeah.

100
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:48,640
Entry to a genre then and presumably a strange entry.

101
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,640
Yeah.

102
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,640
Yeah.

103
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:57,640
I don't have really a frame of reference, so I, I, I'm there, there was a, I was perplexed.

104
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
Okay.

105
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:05,600
This is where I'm so thrilled that, you know, like basically when Griffin said who he, who

106
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,000
was going to be in his To Nightmares group, I was immediately like, oh boy, I think Ben

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,400
has to join because I feel like you provide like great visceral emotional response to

108
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,600
the materials on Blank Check.

109
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,580
And I was like, I feel like I would be disappointed if we just got like a text read or just heard

110
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,880
a little bit of your thoughts.

111
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,880
I got greedy.

112
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,560
Like I want the, I want the, the real deal on Mike.

113
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,200
You need the Hossley pipes delivering those thoughts too.

114
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
That's right.

115
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:39,880
Here I am on a Sunday afternoon, ready to tell you all how I feel.

116
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,040
We have forced an extracurricular zoom and you know what?

117
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:49,040
You bring up the, the, the timeline and there's, there's another reason to bring up the timeline

118
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,000
and that, that is this, that so we're, we're doing this in kind of a window.

119
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,400
I haven't been recording with the guys very much and I thank you all for doing it on the,

120
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,080
on the weekend as I'm sort of balancing work stuff and baby stuff.

121
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:09,680
And basically Griffin has, this is just an interesting thing about when we're recording.

122
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:17,320
Coincidentally Griffin has sent a gift over for or, or in honor of my, my new son, my

123
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:23,520
second son and total coincidence, it is supposed to show up in the exact window that we are

124
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,880
recording this right now, not even intended, but that is a little like a ticking time bomb

125
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,640
that hopefully will go off by the end of the show.

126
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,880
Hopefully there might be an unboxing.

127
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

128
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,680
That's the goal.

129
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,720
You might have given the arrangement of where I'm recording this in my house.

130
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,880
Now you might even see a delivery truck pull up in the window behind me.

131
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,320
You might see it and I won't.

132
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,000
Could you put up, put up a sign that says deliver straight through the window and then

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,480
you could just hand it through.

134
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,600
It'll take me away from, yeah, all right, I'll leave you guys to talk.

135
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,440
I'll scroll a note and then like, oh, I'm going to have to pop a screen out, but I'll

136
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:00,920
do that.

137
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,600
That's worth it.

138
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,400
It's like Mr. McFeely coming into the house.

139
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,600
I'm Mr. Rogers.

140
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,400
You could also do a whole thing with it and then get the delivery person a mic.

141
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,240
We get a new character out of it.

142
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,960
Yes, absolutely.

143
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,640
We should really schedule more things of this nature.

144
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,040
This is, well, this is a bend move actually.

145
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:23,240
I feel like you've done like coordination of items that arrive mid-episode.

146
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,280
Yeah, I mean, it's been 10 years almost.

147
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,240
When has that happened?

148
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,840
I mean, we did a pie reveal kind of recently.

149
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:43,400
Eva Anderson brought a pie for a recent Twin Peaks episode from Tweety's, the real

150
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,840
RR Cafe diner.

151
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,600
The Mission Impossible episode.

152
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,240
That's what I.

153
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,160
Oh, that's right.

154
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,800
Yes, yes, yes.

155
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,680
A note was read, right, right, right.

156
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,560
You had a messenger show up.

157
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,520
I did to deliver a Mission Impossible style.

158
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,240
This message will self-destruct.

159
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,360
And it was a letter in a manila envelope that led us to a tape recorder taped under

160
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,960
a chair that played a message pre-recorded on mini cassette by our friend Patrick Willems

161
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,480
that I think revealed some third thing.

162
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah, it revealed some third missed take from our past Mission Impossible episode.

163
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,000
Sure.

164
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,160
A famously convenient format, mini cassette.

165
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,400
Yeah.

166
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,320
Who doesn't have a player?

167
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,920
Yes, I do like formats.

168
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,320
Yeah.

169
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,240
Griffin, just to confirm, this is a delivery.

170
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,040
It's not going to be like a terrifying art, the clown impersonator.

171
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,360
Showing up in that window.

172
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,760
Look, we all know I'm not sure I'll jump out of my skin if I see a little art, the

173
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,280
clown in this tiny zoom window, not not to carbon date this episode too much.

174
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,600
As we said, we're we're you know, we moved things around in the scheduling to

175
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
accommodate everyone's busyness.

176
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,720
We are recording this in the midst of art, the clown weekend art, the clown

177
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,120
fever is spreading across America.

178
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,320
This is no longer a thing that's only invoked by Mike and Jason on PTR.

179
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,040
It's like to do a confused Scott.

180
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,520
No, I now know what this is.

181
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,080
Sorry.

182
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,200
What the fuck is art?

183
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,640
The clown.

184
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,600
Hey, great.

185
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,400
I'm not alone.

186
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,000
Okay.

187
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,560
I have learned, but now we have a new art, the clown newcomer.

188
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,440
Does he have to know how is this going to benefit?

189
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,040
Ben, this is a great question.

190
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,280
I should ask this more often.

191
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,440
Do I need to know?

192
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,520
Well, if you go to Home Depot and want to buy your Halloween animatronic of him,

193
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,680
he's just really, I believe there is a Lowe's or Home Depot art, the clown

194
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,400
animatronic, I think so.

195
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,200
Well, Ben Jason did not explain to you who it is.

196
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,520
He just gave you more clues.

197
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,800
He just gave you more hints.

198
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,520
Okay.

199
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,720
So I don't know how much real estate do we do?

200
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,720
We need to do another episode with Griffin where we explain what this

201
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,600
franchise is to another person who's not interested in it.

202
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,280
I think we need to wait for two more movies before we do that episode.

203
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:09,520
Yeah.

204
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,080
Good point.

205
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:11,840
Great.

206
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,120
Great.

207
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,320
They're ordering him out at this point.

208
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,800
Ben, are you Googling art, the clown?

209
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,160
I am.

210
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,760
He's like a, he's like a scary French kind of looking clown.

211
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,040
Hmm.

212
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,320
Yeah.

213
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:20,960
He is, I guess.

214
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,120
Yeah.

215
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,880
Like almost mime adjacent.

216
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,600
Yeah.

217
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,520
Yeah.

218
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:33,320
I guess this, um, uh, doesn't this new one feature, uh, uh, I'll say PTR

219
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,520
legends and, and Jay Leno portrayer, uh, and I will say friend of the show

220
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,080
because I ran into him at Tamo Chan Enter, Daniel Roebuck.

221
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,280
Yeah.

222
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,080
Am I making that up?

223
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,400
Yeah.

224
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:42,880
Yeah.

225
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,320
Robuck is in, Robuck is in there.

226
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,040
Yep.

227
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,520
Yep.

228
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,560
It's all tying together.

229
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,960
I don't, which ties us to tonight's show.

230
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,360
All set.

231
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:50,560
Right.

232
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,040
This is right back.

233
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,360
True.

234
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:51,680
Yeah.

235
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,000
Yep.

236
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,560
I don't think Terrifier is a Christian film, but he is in it.

237
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,320
He is, let the record state, he will do non-Christian films.

238
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:00,920
Right.

239
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,120
He likes Christian films and monster movies.

240
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,400
And those are the only two things he likes to work in now.

241
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,520
I mean, not jump ahead, but it does feel like Roebuck in to nightmares

242
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,760
as a sort of haunted Leno and even perhaps if Roebuck isn't available,

243
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,880
any sort of haunted Leno, I, I don't want to sort of, uh, telegraph

244
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,240
our opinions too early on here.

245
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,400
I think Ben and I shared a complaint about how little of this had to do

246
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,960
with the specifics of who Jimmy Fallon is.

247
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,400
Yes.

248
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:30,800
Okay.

249
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,000
Well, yeah.

250
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,560
And I mean, do we really even know very much about him kind of in general?

251
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,200
Even if we just want to take the most surface level front-facing, he is

252
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,600
the host of the Tonight Show.

253
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,280
Start from there, work out with that.

254
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:45,960
Yeah.

255
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,720
Yes.

256
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,160
The nightmares of a very specific, I mean, cause all, all right.

257
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,640
It's a thing about nightmares.

258
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,240
Okay.

259
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,160
Well, aren't all haunted mazes about somebody's nightmare, a human in

260
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,760
general's nightmare.

261
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,600
And that's what, from what I could tell the little that I know about this, I'll

262
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,800
lean on you guys to explain it to me.

263
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,400
But I know that there's like a scarecrow and a haunted gas station.

264
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,160
And these could be the nightmares of anyone, not the host of the primary late

265
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,320
night institution of the last 60 years.

266
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,480
It's a really specific job and person to say, we're going to see their

267
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,120
nightmares and then it seems like almost none of the nightmares are specific to him.

268
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,640
Hmm.

269
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,040
Yeah.

270
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,880
I mean, I'd say there's definitely an off the shelf vibe to a lot of the

271
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,800
nightmares, I'd say three or four feel a little more specific to him, if not

272
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,080
personal, at least specific to him.

273
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,600
And I was a little more intrigued by those, but I also think maybe, and I,

274
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,280
you know, I don't think any of us have the intention of this episode turning

275
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:53,040
into a full deconstruction, the way the race through New York episode was, but

276
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,600
but I do think you're, you're once again hitting the wall of how much does

277
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,960
Jimmy Fallon really show us of himself?

278
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,600
You know, if you're trying to build something off of his personality,

279
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,440
that is no longer, he's the MC, he's hosting, he's interviewing, he's

280
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,160
playing a game with someone, but is really trying to be an extension of his

281
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,480
worldview, do we really know what that is?

282
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,040
Right.

283
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,200
And is it successful in the way that Jacktoberfest might've been successful

284
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,640
by just adding like a silly over like Shaq is a captain on a boat, which is

285
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,600
delightful, but also doesn't say a lot about Shaq the man.

286
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,280
So I'm saying there's a way to do it, but does it do it?

287
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,120
Does it do it?

288
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,160
That's the question.

289
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,200
We walk out of this and Ben is like, okay, so what is this?

290
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,640
What is that supposed to be?

291
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,200
What are the other versions of this?

292
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,000
Explain to me where this comes out of.

293
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,400
And I give him a sort of a quickish spiel and he's like, but Jimmy Fallon's

294
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,640
a weird guy to do that around because his name doesn't really conjure anything

295
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,960
that immediately translates into like horror.

296
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,600
And I was like, you know, Ben at Halloween Horror Nights, they've been

297
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,480
doing the weekend has a house every year.

298
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,040
And Ben's like, that makes sense.

299
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,440
You say that I get it.

300
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,320
There's precedent in the imagery of his music videos, of his vibe, but also just

301
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,120
like an aesthetic that can be represented visually without him being there.

302
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,880
And I was like, Janelle Monáe is doing one in LA and he's like,

303
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,640
okay, that sort of makes sense.

304
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,400
And then Ben, what do you say to me?

305
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,320
Do you remember this?

306
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,120
I do because I started being like, okay, well, who's a celebrity who's not

307
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,600
necessarily like directly coming from like a horror kind of background in some

308
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:34,680
form, but just like a media personality who I feel like would be at the top of

309
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,760
my list to do this.

310
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,760
And the first name that I came up with was Shaquille O'Neal.

311
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,840
Ben immediately lands on track.

312
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,400
Wow.

313
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,040
And look, and you had no idea.

314
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,240
You did not know the kind of which I assume he filled Griffin filled you in on.

315
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:54,600
No, no, I would argue Ben's pitch for what Shaqtoberfest should be is better

316
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,760
than what they've actually put up.

317
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,000
Right.

318
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,440
So my pitch was it should just be a haunted house.

319
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,960
That's a little bit smaller so that you're getting Shaq's experience

320
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,080
through his day-to-day life.

321
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,120
Moving through the world close to Mike's experience a little bit, not

322
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,640
nearly as much, but a little bit.

323
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,560
That's getting close to your nightmare.

324
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,160
That's true.

325
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:18,640
Yeah.

326
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,520
You're living through his specific horrors, like what To Nightmares is

327
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,000
purporting to do, a glimpse, a walk through the mind, the haunted mind of

328
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,280
Jimmy Fallon, Ben immediately went to what would Shaq hate the most and how

329
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,600
does he place us in his giant shoes?

330
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,480
Like a tiny little airplane bathroom.

331
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,240
Terrifying for Shaq.

332
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:39,920
You kidding?

333
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,360
Wow.

334
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,120
It's based on the tweet, the famous tweet, Shaq's famous tweet about being

335
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,680
at Knott's Berry Farm and he said, and I'm going to paraphrase here, but he

336
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,240
tweeted, I think it's about a decade ago at this point, he said, I'm at

337
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,880
Knott's Berry Farm and I think he said like, my butt's too big to fit in the

338
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,280
seat and he goes like, ow, that's me yelling or something.

339
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,320
Like he tweeted this little tweet and that's what you're talking about.

340
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,480
That's like the Knott's Berry Farm roller coaster is too small for it.

341
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,320
Yeah.

342
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,520
So there you go.

343
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,120
I feel like this requires the, I feel like we got to do the official reading

344
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,800
because this is one of the most well-regarded tweets outside of Kevin Smith.

345
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:18,800
No, no, no.

346
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,160
You, you got very, very close.

347
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,640
I just do.

348
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,560
I just fully want to pay homage to the, to what is a very excellent tweet from 2009.

349
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:24,840
Wow.

350
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,560
From the beginning of tweets.

351
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,160
I'm at Knott's Berry Farms and my butt's too big to fit into seats on ride.

352
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,880
Ah, that's me yelling.

353
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,520
This is really incredible.

354
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:45,000
This is like one of the, uh, very important, it's like any number of

355
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,680
drilled tweets or the Kevin Smith, uh, clip around teen area tweet.

356
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,720
This is like a formative tweet.

357
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,640
Should be in the leather bound book.

358
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,120
Yeah, it should be in the, like the leather bound book that opened and

359
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,720
closed like, uh, classic Disney animated films.

360
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,960
Uh, it's, uh, I love the pitch.

361
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,760
I totally agree.

362
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,160
And it's so funny you flash too.

363
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,320
And then what, what actually existed, Ben was something called

364
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,000
Shaqtoberfest that was just, what if there was haunted stuff near a ship?

365
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,280
And now that same thing is back and it doesn't have Shaq's name on it.

366
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,800
And it seems to make no difference in what the event is or how it is run.

367
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,760
Fair enough.

368
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,080
Okay.

369
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,760
So this was just kind of a, uh, let's attach a celebrity to this thing.

370
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,040
I think so.

371
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,640
I think so.

372
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,280
And it's so funny this all came up because I was thinking, because

373
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,880
we covered this last year and I was thinking how there is kind of a symmetry

374
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:50,000
here with Jimmy Fallon and Shaq, both celebrities who are loathed to attach

375
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,960
their name and face to any product that does not meet their extremely high

376
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,400
standards, both a crusty, the clown level of discernment on what they will

377
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,920
or won't attach their brand to.

378
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,280
Well, here's, okay.

379
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,840
So let's, let's start unpacking this a little, right?

380
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,400
Cause we, I'm trying to remember the exact order of events here, but

381
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,760
this thing gets announced.

382
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,240
I receive some number of messages on various platforms from people in

383
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,600
various corners of my life going, you're obviously going to this, right?

384
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,360
And then I feel like our group text, there's sort of a, like, look,

385
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,920
you, you are your own person.

386
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,560
We grant you autonomy.

387
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,280
We are not forcing your hand, but is this something you would want to do?

388
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,400
And I very quickly was like, yes, I feel obligated to do this.

389
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,800
I'm happy to do this.

390
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,560
I would be morbidly curious no matter what.

391
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,360
I don't want to walk through this alone.

392
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,800
I immediately message Ben and go, would you do this with me?

393
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,600
And Ben goes, yes, I'm down.

394
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,040
Um, in the lead up to this, cause I, I, they announced it, whatever,

395
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,360
I think in August, and then there was even like a sign up for the wait

396
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,160
list of first access of tickets.

397
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,160
And I was like, is this thing going to sell out quickly?

398
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,920
Am I going to be like Oasis reunion?

399
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,960
Like hovering over the computer, refreshing, trying to get a slot.

400
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,680
I felt very happy that I got a slot.

401
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:21,120
I paid extra for a VIP flex ticket access, which only grants you, you are

402
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,760
not married to your specific 15 minute time slots.

403
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,800
You can show up any time on that day.

404
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,920
Um, and then I very quickly afterwards see, oh, these slots are wide open.

405
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,880
They're not being filled.

406
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:42,120
They're offering all sorts of deals, temporary sales, incentives, discount codes.

407
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,400
Um, we've realized scheduling wise, it would have been easier if we, uh, went

408
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,040
a week earlier and thus recorded this episode a week earlier, it was a pretty

409
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,640
seamless process for me to transfer those tickets.

410
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,440
I didn't save money, which I thought I would.

411
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,320
I thought maybe by refunding, uh, I'd be able to buy new tickets at a

412
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,120
cheaper price that did not work out.

413
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:07,000
Um, but, uh, but yes, it does not feel like the thing is a runaway

414
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,080
success that having been said when we showed up there, there was quite a crowd.

415
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,000
When we left, it was barren.

416
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,280
And the thing in theory runs from five o'clock to 10 o'clock every night.

417
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,520
If not 11 o'clock, maybe is closing.

418
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,480
Uh, we were in the five o'clock window.

419
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,520
I think our tickets were maybe five or five 15.

420
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,320
We were probably done with the thing by five 45.

421
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,640
Definitely spent more time trying to figure out where it was and to get through

422
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,800
security than the actual attraction itself, which Ben recorded the audio on his phone.

423
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,520
So we have a real stopwatch of it being exactly 10 minutes.

424
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,280
Okay.

425
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:51,640
Um, but when we got out of there, probably at five 45, close to six,

426
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,680
there was no one in the lines.

427
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,960
I don't know if it's just like, that's part of the reset cycles of the hours.

428
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,560
I don't know if we went at the busy hour.

429
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,640
I don't know.

430
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,120
Uh, I do think they have now reduced the amount of days it's running, much

431
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,080
like the tonight show itself, which is no longer doing episodes on Fridays.

432
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,840
I think all of Fallon's endeavors are dropping.

433
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,560
I think they may be pushed the reservations into a shorter window each week.

434
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,200
Uh, but this thing's supposed to run for five or six weeks.

435
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,920
I did notice on the site right now, there is a Columbus day weekend special.

436
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,280
Uh, so there's another sort of like push to move tickets.

437
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,080
Um, but, but anyway, uh, in the lead up to this episode, we've just been

438
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,760
taxed and texting about, uh, uh, Fallon miscellania, right.

439
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,000
And at one point, Scott, I think you threw out like, is there an entire episode

440
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,560
just for like a catch all Jimmy Fallon side projects?

441
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,440
Cause we were talking about his two Warby Parker co-labs, of course,

442
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,360
uh, flippies and spinnies.

443
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,160
Yes.

444
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,640
And you're familiar with these, correct?

445
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,320
No.

446
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,600
What?

447
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,360
Oh, you got to keep up on war on Warby flippy Warby's flippies and spinnies.

448
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,160
So here's, here's the distinction I want to try to establish in this

449
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,320
crusty, the clown spectrum, uh, you're, you're putting out there, right?

450
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:26,120
Shaq will put his name on fucking anything, but there's something kind of

451
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:32,160
charming about how guileless he is that it doesn't feel like he's even

452
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:37,120
pretending to specifically care about these things and he's like, not

453
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,040
co-signing war crimes, you know, all of it feels kind of innocuous and silly

454
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,920
and chintzy.

455
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,120
I also like, uh, my ex-girlfriend directed a commercial campaign that he

456
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,880
was in and had a lot of conversations with his handlers beforehand and was

457
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,920
really worried about like, this guy does fucking 25 things a day.

458
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,320
He's going to give me nothing.

459
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,400
He's going to be an asshole.

460
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,680
He's going to big time and was like, Shaq came in and was the most locked

461
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,600
in talent I had worked with in a long time.

462
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,000
Wow.

463
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,680
Was great, was collaborative, was full of energy.

464
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,840
And it was one of like six things he did that day.

465
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,320
Like the crusty, the clown element of like, yeah, buy my cereal where it's

466
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,880
like, oh, he doesn't care about this.

467
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,120
And he can't even pretend he cares about it.

468
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,000
Shaq.

469
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,400
I'm like, he is good at being a pitch man.

470
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,400
And I think puts in the work to that, even if he probably has to be

471
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,040
reminded of what product he's pitching when he shows up to film that app.

472
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,480
But once you tell him, he knows.

473
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,240
He likes it.

474
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,720
I think he knows.

475
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,400
Fallon, all of Fallon's side projects, he puts out there as if like, this

476
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:45,200
means so much to me, every Fallon project is his megalopolis, is his like forever.

477
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,720
I have lived with this dream of passing something onto the culture.

478
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,840
Ben Flippes and Spinney's are collabs that Jimmy Fallon did with Warby Parker.

479
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,720
Warby Parker has done collabs with many other celebrities and they go, Hey,

480
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,800
let's work on a line, tell us what your favorite colors are, which frames you

481
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,760
like, and we'll come up with special limited editions.

482
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,600
That was not enough for Jimmy.

483
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,200
Jimmy wanted to get engineers involved.

484
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:14,640
Jimmy said, when I'm bored sitting around, I take my sunglasses off and

485
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,360
I spin them in my hand like this.

486
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,880
I hold the arm, one arm of my sunglasses in my hand.

487
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,360
I spin them like this and the spin just isn't very smooth.

488
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,200
Could you design a sunglass that has a 360 pivot?

489
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,480
Oh my God.

490
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,920
That's so stupid.

491
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,280
It's a fucking fidget spinner, but you wear it on your head.

492
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,080
Correct.

493
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,880
A fidget spinner you wear.

494
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,960
And there are like 15 minute videos of Jimmy Fallon talking about the R&D of

495
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,560
figuring out how to make Spinney's work.

496
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:51,480
And sketches where he made the Warby Parker guys like do comedy with him.

497
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,440
Like the flat Warby Parker founders you have to watch.

498
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,840
So when Jimmy came to us with this idea.

499
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,200
But in this like, and I thought there has to be a better way, as if he's solving

500
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,800
some huge issue in our society, the rigidity of a sunglass fidget spin in your hands.

501
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,240
And that he, that wasn't enough for him.

502
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,240
He had to innovate again.

503
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,880
And he created flippies, which are the, the lenses flip backwards.

504
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,960
So the sunglasses are basically double sided and the arms are double sided and

505
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,600
can like invert, they're like reversible glasses.

506
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,800
So they have two different looks.

507
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,080
Okay.

508
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,360
Okay.

509
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,400
You got it.

510
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,800
And pitched it.

511
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,560
We don't, no one likes Jimmy Fallon, right?

512
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,520
Correct.

513
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,560
He stinks.

514
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,640
You're like cut through the clutter there.

515
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,760
I hate, I like, it's like so visceral.

516
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,280
I'm like, I just am, I'm getting so angry.

517
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,480
Just the glasses really pushed you over the edge.

518
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,520
It sounds like that was the last straw.

519
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,520
Comedy is good, but these glasses really, no, the comedy is good.

520
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,040
We can't, we can't, we can't deny that.

521
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,400
Right.

522
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,560
If the glasses were funnier, you would like them.

523
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:02,760
Yep.

524
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,160
Right.

525
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,960
That's what it is.

526
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,240
If they were like X-ray specs or something, or like googly eyes have popped out.

527
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,600
That would make a lot more sense.

528
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,200
That's funny.

529
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,360
They had a Groucho nose and mustache underneath.

530
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:12,920
Yes.

531
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,320
Oh, stylish, professional Groucho mustache for the glasses.

532
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,800
That's a great modern product.

533
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,640
Warby X Groucho.

534
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,240
Oh man.

535
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,760
That's not far away.

536
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,880
You know, I'd be lining up.

537
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,960
I'd be lining up at one of the handful of Warby Parker physical locations.

538
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,720
This is not far, Griffin and I have been texting about Laurel and Hardy

539
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,400
action figures that are being produced.

540
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,120
So I feel like more like Groucho X something is coming down.

541
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,760
There's a certain point.

542
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:49,160
Mike, I have also texted you about Laurel and Hardy action figures.

543
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,800
What are you doing?

544
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,520
Spread this conversation out.

545
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,520
That's right.

546
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,000
And then let Anne just make sure that you leave Ben and I off.

547
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,240
Don't accidentally add us.

548
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:05,120
I was going to say, Scott, will they change your mind if you learned that it

549
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:11,360
hit the stretch goal of having sashes and fezzes to put on the action?

550
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,520
Yeah, they have fezzes now.

551
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,800
You got to have fezzes through interchangeable parts, specific films.

552
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,160
Yeah.

553
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,640
What are their sashes for?

554
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,120
Why do they?

555
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,720
Why would they have the famous sash wearers?

556
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,400
Maybe.

557
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,040
Yeah, I don't even know.

558
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,480
No one on this knows.

559
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,640
Well, this has been my crisis of faith.

560
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,280
This has been my like sort of dark night of the soul with Mike is when I text

561
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,400
him late at night about wandering planet toys, Kickstarter campaign for highly

562
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,040
articulated and detailed Laurel and Hardy action figures, I say, you know, I

563
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,080
don't really care that much about Laurel and Hardy, but I like the precedent

564
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,120
they're trying to set.

565
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,800
Do I support this campaign because that gives them the encouragement to possibly

566
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,600
lead to other old timey comedy figures?

567
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,600
I would want.

568
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,120
Right.

569
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,680
Yes.

570
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,160
To answer your question though, about the Fez and the sash.

571
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,600
No, that didn't entice me to want to be on the text thread.

572
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,920
Oh, OK.

573
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,320
Interesting, interesting.

574
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,960
I watched both of the full length

575
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:20,000
Fallon Warby Parker videos and in the one for Flippy's, he says that he pitched

576
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,480
them the product as Hear Me Out, Parker Warby's.

577
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,720
He was going to flip it because it flips the notion of sunglasses in general.

578
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,080
He wanted that to be the name and they went, we don't get what that means.

579
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,440
And then he explained the application and they went, well, there's a reason

580
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,000
glasses don't work like that.

581
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,960
And it seemed like it was a very long and belabored process because it's just like,

582
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,880
well, the glasses, the hinges won't hold up to scrutiny.

583
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,160
If you do something that's got that much of a sort of like novelty factor to it,

584
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,320
it kind of sacrifices the integrity of them as functional glasses.

585
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,840
And after years and years of persistence,

586
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,920
Warby Parker team refused to give up and they made the breakthrough.

587
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,920
But we're at the gift shop after to nightmares.

588
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,280
And I pointed and I went, well, right.

589
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,440
This is why this is happening.

590
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,560
There was a copy of Jimmy Fallon's newest children's book.

591
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,200
I think it's called Five Sleeps to Halloween.

592
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,240
Yeah, yeah.

593
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,600
Which you were that was something that you made us aware.

594
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,720
I certainly knew that he, like a lot of celebrities, writes children's books.

595
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,800
This seems like one of the best ways for the modern star to make funny,

596
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,320
make money to and make funny and to make make both make.

597
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,200
Yeah, to make a lot of funny for a lot of kids,

598
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,600
you know, to slap your name on a on a children's book

599
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,400
that you did not write and certainly did not illustrate

600
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,000
or perhaps even get eyes on the illustrations

601
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,000
before you were holding the book on your show to tell people to buy it.

602
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
But Jimmy has done this more than a legend.

603
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,920
You texted us the number.

604
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,440
You texted us a list at some point, Griffin, of ten.

605
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,400
Five more sleeps till Halloween makes ten.

606
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,640
He wrote one prose book for adults along with his mother.

607
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,840
I hate this place.

608
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,840
The pessimist guide to life in 1999, I guess, at the peak of his like

609
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,000
SNL cutie pie status.

610
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,760
But then he has written 10 children books since 2005.

611
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,160
Hmm. And they've been increasing like in speed.

612
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,240
Oh, it's it's one in 05, one in 11, one in 12, one in 15, one in 17,

613
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,840
one in 19, one in 20, two in 22, one in 24 so far.

614
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,400
I'm veering to a bigger question, which is if there is a big if

615
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:46,000
if there is any question as to the quality of the program,

616
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,040
the tonight show starring Jimmy Fallon, would it not be better

617
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,200
if the host focused his efforts

618
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,520
a little more on the job that he has, which has which is a job

619
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,440
that is so important to some two comedians that people have gone

620
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,600
mad in pursuit of it.

621
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,320
And yet he has the chair.

622
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,480
He's in it. What people have grappled for and nearly died for.

623
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,840
And instead, he is not only he's writing 10, he's writing more kids

624
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,920
books than ever.

625
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,640
He's inventing multiple types of classes.

626
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,760
He's doing mazes. He's doing rides.

627
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,080
He's doing songs.

628
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,480
He's hosting entire other shows.

629
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,280
He's I is he not on three shows at the like?

630
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,840
I don't know. Maybe you should hunker down.

631
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,920
Every time he goes on the tonight show to promote one of these new side projects,

632
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,920
he delivers the pitch for the product as if it is

633
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,040
Jimmy Kimmel doing a monologue about his son's health

634
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,720
at the beginning of an episode.

635
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,080
It is done with this degree of like.

636
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,640
And this this is, you know, we have fun here,

637
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,560
but I just need to take a moment to tell you folks something.

638
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,920
We are doing a haunted maze, a Rockefeller center.

639
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:05,560
Can you go on a talk show if you were also the host of that talk show?

640
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,040
He will be the first to figure out how to do it.

641
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,640
Isn't that just called being at work?

642
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,440
He does.

643
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,280
He has more to promote than any of his guests possibly could.

644
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,360
It's it's it's such a pile.

645
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,240
And they're just I think something cumulative happens to where they're all.

646
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,040
Are we also aware there's not OK.

647
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,400
So Halloween is covered by a children's book and this experience,

648
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,040
which we will talk about.

649
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:38,720
Then as soon as all right, Halloween's over October 31st, November 1st,

650
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,800
we flip to Christmas instantly where he is putting out

651
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,320
a new Christmas album called Holiday Seasoning.

652
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,360
What? Yeah, yeah.

653
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,000
New holiday record record, because, of course, it's digital.

654
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,000
But you can also.

655
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,360
But what really caught my eye was that you can buy a vinyl of this,

656
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,320
which is in which is red and white peppermint colored.

657
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,240
So you could spend thirty five dollars on Jimmy Fallon's Holiday Seasoning.

658
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,600
And when you get now the full tracklist has not been revealed.

659
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,200
And I'm sure we will go through it thoroughly as time goes on.

660
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,360
But one track that they did say is on it is a Christmas song

661
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,480
that he did with Ariana Grande and Megan Thee Stallion.

662
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,280
And of course, if you have those caliber of artists,

663
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,920
you want to put that song on your peppermint record.

664
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,960
How could you not?

665
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,840
But maybe there should be a how could you not?

666
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,800
Because that song is called Masked Christmas.

667
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,520
This was a song that he put out for Christmas 2021.

668
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,600
And it's a song about like instead of

669
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,840
cookies, we're waiting for the booster and we're going to in twenty

670
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,000
twenty three years later, you're going to spend thirty five dollars

671
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,400
to get Masked Christmas to get a song where it's like

672
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,760
like this year, the jolly old elf is Dr. Fauci.

673
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,720
So is this album just a grab bag compilation of holiday songs

674
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,680
he's done across 10 years?

675
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,080
I believe so. There may be some original things.

676
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,480
I don't know. Dolly Parton's on.

677
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,960
I don't know when any of it was made from.

678
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,480
But certainly some percentage of it is grab bag. Yes.

679
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,040
Can't he just be like other late night hosts and buy 200 different cars

680
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,840
and spend his time working on them?

681
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,000
Because that's what Letterman did and Jay did.

682
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,840
Spend his time getting burned by them.

683
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,720
Rolling up his denim sleeves and catching on fire.

684
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,320
He already released five more sleeps till Christmas in 2020.

685
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,000
Five more. Five more sleeps in the franchise.

686
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,280
Within. Oh, Halloween is the spiritual sequel.

687
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,840
He's basically got a couple different threads going on in the children's books

688
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,440
because Snowball Fight seems to be its own standalone thing.

689
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,880
Then Thank You Notes, I guess, is somewhere in between children and adult book.

690
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,880
I guess he has two Thank You Notebooks.

691
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,600
So let's amend the data to that.

692
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,640
That's a segment.

693
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,120
That's a segment on the segment of the show and a book series. Yeah.

694
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,640
And we'll talk about Thank You Notes again in a bit.

695
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,160
Oh, good, good, good. Yeah, this guy's going to end up to make amends

696
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,160
for that old Chris Rock blackface bit.

697
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,880
He's going to end up putting out five more sleeps till Juneteenth.

698
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,600
It's coming.

699
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,920
His other book titles are Your Baby's First Word Will Be Dada.

700
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,720
Everything is Mama.

701
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,680
This is Baby.

702
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,360
The aforementioned five more sleeps till Christmas.

703
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,920
Nana Loves You More

704
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,520
and Kon Poyo, A Bilingual Playtime Adventure,

705
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,560
which was co-written by Jennifer Lopez.

706
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,440
So it feels like he's got a couple different sub franchises

707
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,000
going on in his book world.

708
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,200
He's got the holiday thing.

709
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,520
I imagine five more sleeps is going to hit up every major holiday.

710
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,640
Kon Poyos feels like it's setting up a new thread of can Jimmy Fallon

711
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,160
be granted permission to make books about different cultures

712
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,040
as long as he works with someone of that culture.

713
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,080
OK, yeah, right.

714
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,000
And then it's just baby mama, dada, grandma.

715
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,360
Oh, we got a lot of we got lots of a family to go.

716
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,600
Oh, so that can go for 12 more.

717
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,840
Wow. He figured it out.

718
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:13,960
No one has more franchises within their their human shape than this guy.

719
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,720
Jack Park couldn't even imagine this number of franchises.

720
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:24,520
I think every one of these books was still on sale at the gift shop at 30 Rock.

721
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,600
I went to see if there was any proprietary to Nightmares

722
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,480
merch worth getting.

723
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,760
There was a tin lunchbox and a T-shirt.

724
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,080
And that was it.

725
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,720
Neither one, I thought, were worth the cost.

726
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,440
There was also a pretty deep shelf

727
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,960
stocked with the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon shot glasses

728
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,520
and a little placard underneath it that said Jimmy's Tuesday.

729
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,120
Oh, really? My joke, I added, OK, no.

730
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,760
We were like, oh, that's interesting.

731
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,280
Probably he was just leaning into it and just admitting to it.

732
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:02,280
Oh, my God, this, though, there are shot glasses.

733
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,560
The shot glasses exist, and there were a lot of them.

734
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,640
But also just like Ben, do you remember some there was like

735
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,360
there was like a hoodie that just said Fallon in bubble letters,

736
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,720
like not any like sort of logo treatment of the show.

737
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,480
Yeah, yeah, it there was

738
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,160
a Christmas ornament

739
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,000
that was so depressing just to consider

740
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,480
some poor soul out there

741
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,800
already having bought the ornament and then each year

742
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,800
taking it out of the box of ornaments and hanging it on the tree with care.

743
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,000
God, isn't that depressing?

744
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,560
It's an awful, awful vision.

745
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,360
It's too heavy.

746
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,880
Where's never strong enough branches for this?

747
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,160
Can we just get rid of it? No, it's from our trip. God damn it.

748
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,040
We saw we went to the taping.

749
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,160
We got to see Jennifer Lopez come out and talk about their bilingual kids book.

750
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,800
And then we bought the ornament. It was a cherished memory.

751
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,400
Griffin, I am surprised you didn't go in for that tin lunchbox.

752
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,600
Have you thought about

753
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,600
texting anyone who like works at

754
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,280
Saturday Night Live or Seth Meyers like, hey, could you employee discount?

755
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,440
Yeah, could you get your employee discount?

756
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,040
I know you're not ready for prime time player.

757
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,480
Could you go use your employee discount at the 30 Rock gift shop?

758
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,880
Look, it's it's I it's not it's not something I would be afraid to do.

759
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,360
I will say I looked at it.

760
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,680
I was half considering it.

761
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,000
It was thirty six dollars and there was no thermos included.

762
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,760
Oh, well, that's the track of what is the what do you think?

763
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,040
The not ready for prime time player discount is in the NBC gift shop.

764
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,400
Do we think it's 30 percent?

765
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,160
Do we think it's better? Do we think it's worse?

766
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,720
I bet it's 30 percent tacked on.

767
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,720
There may be a surcharge.

768
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,040
And it's way less for featured players.

769
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,960
Featured players. Yeah, that's that's some of what you earn.

770
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:14,400
Yeah. Can I can I throw out in the litany of

771
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,920
you know, because I'm glad this is also turning into a catch all of

772
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,840
of Fallon's output in the in the last four years.

773
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,960
And I, you know, I could set this up or I could just start playing the track.

774
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,400
And I'm curious if you guys have previous experience with this.

775
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,680
Tell me if you can't hear it.

776
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,400
I haven't thrown to a zoom link video, thankfully, in a long time.

777
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,520
But hopefully this just hopefully the incredible

778
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,800
opening note of this song just starts playing right here and now.

779
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,680
Now, this is the one I want on vinyl.

780
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,720
It might be. I don't know if they put on Frosted Out.

781
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,400
I've been looking. I don't think that.

782
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,680
And let me let me just do a quick bit of his verse.

783
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,480
That if you don't know, is from the heralded

784
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,920
feature film, Unfrosted, the directorial debut.

785
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,040
What was that director's name?

786
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,640
Is that up and coming director?

787
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,320
I just know he hadn't made a film before and it was a hell of a hell of a movie

788
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,000
to come out of the gateway.

789
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,240
I think he did. I think he acted in it as well.

790
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,720
The name is someone whose work you've been studying a lot as you embark

791
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,160
on your future film directing career.

792
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,200
Yeah, yeah.

793
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,240
Looking to make such a big splash with a debut feature.

794
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,600
Yeah. Another man with 200 cars.

795
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,400
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

796
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

797
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,400
A normal thing to do with your comedy money.

798
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,600
Yes. And he is proof that if you just invest money in cars,

799
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,280
you will be a great normal man with a good head on your shoulders.

800
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,200
Yeah. Yeah.

801
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,600
No chips on those shoulders whatsoever.

802
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,040
You have what looks like a normal New York brownstone,

803
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:21,120
but is actually a parking garage with an elevator system to store all your cars.

804
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,560
Which lets you know. Is that real?

805
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,160
Is is far away from where he actually lives.

806
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,760
It's a completely separate off site.

807
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,880
An entire property he bought just for the cars.

808
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,000
That's what he has.

809
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,160
But he also has like a secret big dog garage in L.A., I think.

810
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,040
That sounds correct. Yeah.

811
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,000
Yeah, I think so.

812
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,160
You imagine he's going to drive the cars cross country

813
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,800
when he does an L.A.

814
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,440
Comedians in cars. Right.

815
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,600
That's right. Right. I think he has a right.

816
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,280
He has a secret. You're right.

817
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,720
Yeah, you need a space satellite bat cave kind of a thing.

818
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,400
Are comedians still getting in cars, guys?

819
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,560
Have they? I don't know if they've gotten in cars recently.

820
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,000
Yeah, it's been a minute.

821
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,480
There's been a minute at the very least, but I will say it was really tough.

822
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,120
Disappearance. I think people weren't there was an unwillingness.

823
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,600
Yeah, you just could.

824
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,240
You couldn't have two comedians in the same space like that.

825
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,000
Just pure per social distancing rules on drinking coffee as outlined

826
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,680
in the song Masked Christmas, of course.

827
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,680
Sweet morning.

828
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,480
It's really the main components of the show just erased.

829
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,960
Yeah, a sweet sweet morning.

830
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,000
He got shared in our text thread as well when it came out

831
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,320
before the movie was released.

832
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,640
And we were all sort of flummoxed by it.

833
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,000
And how much Jimmy sounds like he's really going for it.

834
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Like, it's not a comedy song performance.

835
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,640
It is part of this weird side thread of Jimmy Fallon and Meghan Trainor

836
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,240
being like, she gets me.

837
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,400
She respects me for the musician I am.

838
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,880
We do the same thing on the side.

839
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,800
So curious to see if in the context of the movie, it's like, oh, Meghan

840
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,280
Trainor and Jimmy Fallon appear on screen as pop singers or, you know,

841
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,480
or jingle writers who are coming up with a theme song for pop tarts.

842
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,840
Like I was like, there has to be a reason these two people wrote

843
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,360
and performed a song for this movie.

844
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,640
Not at all. It's just in the end credits of the film, they play this song.

845
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,160
Jimmy Fallon is never on screen.

846
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,600
Meghan Trainor is never on screen.

847
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,160
The end credits of Unfrosted are always on screen.

848
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,360
Meghan Trainor is never on screen.

849
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:24,640
The end credits of Unfrosted are like B-roll of the cast on set

850
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,920
lip syncing to this song.

851
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,560
Which again, something I'm going to, you know, I'm going to carve out

852
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,240
time on my project to do and I'm making sure that even with the stress

853
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,800
and putting it like, okay, but make sure we get the music part.

854
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,200
Make sure we get the cast goof around and have a fun dance.

855
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,760
Make sure we license Sweet Morning Heat.

856
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,760
I don't want it to be a different song.

857
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,120
Yeah, I just assumed it would be too Sweet Morning Heat.

858
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,800
That's going to be a lot of the budget is licensing that, Danny.

859
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,600
Full homage. It's worth it.

860
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,480
I also, my favorite, the biggest laugh to me in the movie, Unfrosted,

861
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,400
among many, among thousands of great laughs, really funny detail.

862
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,120
My friend Danny caught that at the very, very end,

863
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,640
the final note of the song is like, give me that Sweet Morning Heat.

864
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:20,480
And then it's like, Jerry himself is on screen dancing to it.

865
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,840
And he, on Heat, points and anyone with any performing or dancing

866
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,040
abilities would know you like, hold it for a second.

867
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,560
Like that's, it would be anybody's performer instinct, I think.

868
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,400
He just like, Heat drops it as fast as humanly possible.

869
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,000
He just like, bails.

870
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,800
He like, he, it's like, he does not want to be seen.

871
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,720
Like there's, there's crew guys around.

872
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,200
There's men who carry heavy items.

873
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,120
They're going to see me dancing like a wimp.

874
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,240
I got to get out of this.

875
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,800
I don't want to control why they're laughing.

876
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,480
I believe Jerry is not a fan of Sweet Morning Heat.

877
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,200
He wrote it, Mike.

878
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,040
He wrote the song.

879
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,720
He was on a talk show though.

880
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,600
And I swear he was doing his best to pretend.

881
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,840
That's just my reading of it.

882
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,160
And I can't remember if it was on Fallon or another.

883
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,080
It was on maybe Fly on the Wall or so.

884
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,840
I don't know if it was a podcast.

885
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,360
But I swear he did his best because he's very cranky and it's hard.

886
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,280
Like, it's hard for him to lie about stuff that like he knows is bad.

887
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,760
I think that's my guess.

888
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,280
I'm not saying I know for sure.

889
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:30,800
So I think he did.

890
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,200
And he's definitely very proud of Unfrosted.

891
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,000
Like if you watch and read all his press for Unfrosted,

892
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
it's clear that he genuinely is very satisfied with the movie he made.

893
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,440
Yes.

894
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,400
I think he probably wanted it to be more like an old jingle,

895
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,720
not a modern day Meghan Trainor song.

896
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,360
That's my guess.

897
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,480
But maybe what do I know?

898
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,440
Can I get one thing out of the way?

899
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,360
Because I do feel like we should transition to talking about the experience,

900
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,440
the terrifying experience Ben and I had proper.

901
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:11,200
Jimmy Fallon does not appear visually one time into Nightmares.

902
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:12,640
Really?

903
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,400
I know this was discussed with Shaqtoberfest,

904
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,520
where you guys were disappointed by the lack of like visual Shaq representation.

905
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,240
You know what, let me amend this.

906
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,080
Yeah, he is in one moment.

907
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:29,440
He's in that moment where he turns to the werewolf.

908
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:29,920
You're right.

909
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,320
You're right.

910
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,800
There is one time he appears on a TV screen.

911
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,880
There's a good amount of audio from him.

912
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,760
And there are a couple characters.

913
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,040
Beautifully performed.

914
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,160
There are a couple of characters.

915
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,240
Subtle, nuanced.

916
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:51,680
Played by scare actors who, I guess, are purporting to be versions of him,

917
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,000
variations on him.

918
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:59,040
But like his lift on this seems to have been 90%

919
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,560
what feel like voice memos recorded during a lunch break.

920
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:14,080
And then one shoot that feels like it happened behind his desk at The Tonight Show.

921
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,680
They dress it up a little differently.

922
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,400
They stylize it a little differently.

923
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,720
He maybe is supposed to be playing a different character at that point.

924
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,400
We'll get into the inner logic of it.

925
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,080
But it was interesting how little Jimmy there was.

926
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,160
While also the structure of this thing is basically...

927
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,200
We said the whole attraction in total is like 10 minutes.

928
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:44,240
I want to say fully five of those minutes are spent in liminal spaces in between scare rooms

929
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,120
where you are looking at a video screen and otherwise totally unthemed,

930
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,080
like closet-like in between hallway space.

931
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:57,280
You're looking at a video screen that is sort of like writing out in real time

932
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,880
as if it were a thank you note.

933
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,080
Jimmy's description of what the next room is going to be.

934
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,760
And there's audio in between.

935
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,120
Audio over that.

936
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,720
I wanted to ask about that.

937
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,160
Why does it look like silent film cards?

938
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:17,520
It's very weird because it feels like they got stuck halfway in between it being a sort of like,

939
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,800
oh my god, bloody letters appearing on a page magically, a haunted book.

940
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,440
It almost is like they're stuck between Evil Dead, Necronomicon thing,

941
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,560
and just feeling like it is like fucking Laurel and Hardy intertitles.

942
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:37,840
Which, by the way, I think is maybe a stretch goal that Wandering Planet would include if

943
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,280
they get up to the final tier.

944
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,520
Oh wow, old timey title cards.

945
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:48,240
Because they also have film reel stands that have been introduced in the stretch goals as well.

946
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,600
So yeah, that might make sense.

947
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,960
The future, whatever, title cards.

948
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,320
But yes, that was Jimmy's lift on this.

949
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:04,320
And I question how many, if any, of these ideas came from Jimmy.

950
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,600
Now, let me counter a little bit and say from what I heard,

951
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,920
because here and there we've all known people who've worked at that show.

952
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,720
What I heard is that people saw like, all right, after the show,

953
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,600
a writer's meeting is occurring with him and a couple people,

954
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,760
and they are going through to nightmares stuff.

955
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:29,840
I think it's, but what's really weird is that I think maybe it did all come from him.

956
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,280
And yet felt generic, even if it was his idea.

957
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,520
Between the five of us, we know a fair amount of people who have worked on that show.

958
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:45,040
A lot of them left or were let go right before this project started in earnest.

959
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,880
By following up with some of those people,

960
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,440
I've sort of cracked a timeline of how quickly this thing might have come together.

961
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:00,560
Because it does feel like even in possibly June or July, this thing was not even a notion.

962
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,880
And by August, it's announced and September tickets are on sale.

963
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,840
But yeah, I mean, I just, I don't know if it's.

964
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,320
I believe, let me put it this way.

965
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:22,880
I can fully believe that Jimmy Fallon was personally rubber stamping every major idea in this.

966
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,120
OK, I would just like it doesn't make sense, though, that if he's the one giving the ideas,

967
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:31,600
he's going to choose the least interesting stuff that doesn't come straight from the public's

968
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,400
idea or the public's idea of the tonight show.

969
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:41,360
Maybe. I mean, yeah, it's should we just should we should we try to dig into this in earnest?

970
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:50,560
Sure. And I have a video walkthrough queued up to sort of remind myself, Ben, you have the audio.

971
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,800
You took as well. But let's say we were trying to figure out how to all meet.

972
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,200
It was Ben and I and Sarah, who you guys have met.

973
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,080
And we were all trying to figure out what the best meeting place is.

974
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,880
Ben says, I'm here at the entrance for the event.

975
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,120
I go, where is the entrance exactly?

976
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,320
He went, I don't know. There were a bunch of signs on the subway directing me.

977
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,480
Now, this is like Rockefeller Center, Times Square area.

978
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,920
There are a lot of trains that go to this area.

979
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,800
Ben seemingly took the right line to the right exit that directed him straight to the door.

980
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,040
Sarah and I maybe spend 20 minutes trying to figure out how to get to this.

981
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,120
30 Rock is like a very big building.

982
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:43,680
I had been led to believe this thing was like taking up empty office space in 30 Rock,

983
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:48,320
which is part of what I find fascinating about the idea of Two Nightmares is like,

984
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,960
oh, it's like two birds, one stone.

985
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:57,840
Jimmy wants to further reach out, brand every corner of the universe in his image,

986
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,680
in his twisted worldview.

987
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,960
But also perhaps there have been mass layoffs within the NBC Universal Company

988
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,680
and there is unoccupied office space that needs to be monetized.

989
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,720
We got to do something with floor three, yes.

990
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:16,240
Yes. So we walked to main 30 Rock and trying to, from the website,

991
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,160
follow the directions to where the entrance is.

992
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,680
Then I realized, oh, this is not in the main 30 Rock building.

993
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,400
This is part of 30 Rockefeller Plaza,

994
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:30,720
which basically encompasses like, I don't know, a three or four block area, Ben.

995
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,280
I believe so.

996
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:37,520
There's like this sort of famous 30 Rock ice skating rink is right behind the main building,

997
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:41,600
which is where Jimmy does his show, which is where SNL tapes.

998
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,520
So we've now walked through the entrance to the exit of that building

999
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,520
and realized it's not in that building at all.

1000
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,760
Now the dream has died of I'm going to experience

1001
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,520
Jimmy Fallon's twisted nightmare in the very same building where Jimmy Fallon works.

1002
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,080
We're going to cross the skating rink.

1003
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:01,280
30 Rockefeller Plaza is a little bit of like an outdoor mall as well.

1004
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:01,920
Yeah.

1005
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:07,600
So walking by different like flagship retail locations and restaurants

1006
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:11,600
and then getting basically to, I think it's called Atlas Plaza,

1007
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,400
which is sort of where the tree goes.

1008
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,200
Is that right, Ben?

1009
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,160
Yeah.

1010
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,960
Is that where do we remember?

1011
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,440
Where is that?

1012
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,680
Was the supermodel cafe?

1013
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,480
Oh, that's a great question.

1014
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,000
Was that in that fashion cafe?

1015
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,400
Excuse me.

1016
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,600
The fashion cafe, right.

1017
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,320
That was a supermodel themed restaurant.

1018
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,880
It had to be a right around there.

1019
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,120
Is there a big Barnes and Noble around there?

1020
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,520
There isn't.

1021
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,440
I think there maybe was at some point in time.

1022
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,080
Okay.

1023
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,400
But Jason is bragging that he wants to go there and read a book.

1024
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,360
Well, Mr. Book here.

1025
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,160
Yeah.

1026
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,120
Well, okay.

1027
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,320
Oh, is there a bookstore near there?

1028
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,480
Oh, I'd love to read.

1029
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:02,240
I read the other landmark I know is there's an outlet of Magnolia Bakery

1030
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:07,520
and I don't want to go on a tear about banana pudding, which is delicious.

1031
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:12,720
I was shocked when I did eat there and I'm like, oh my God, this is amazing.

1032
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,640
You're shocked the banana pudding was delicious?

1033
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:20,800
No, I was shocked that it was like, oh, this is like lives up to the hype.

1034
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,360
Oh, okay.

1035
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,440
You had heard about that specific banana pudding

1036
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,680
and it was as good as you thought it would be.

1037
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,320
Yes.

1038
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,600
Okay. Well.

1039
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,440
So I'm trying to figure out where this is.

1040
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,640
I mean, this is the problem is that like there's a little bit of like

1041
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,600
fuzzy math about what gets to call itself part of 30 Rock

1042
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,320
because there are these annex buildings.

1043
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:46,560
There is this sort of like downstairs food court underneath the rink.

1044
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,920
30 Rock is such a like legendary address.

1045
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,800
But not everything there is.

1046
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,360
It sounds like plenty is like really cruddy and mundane.

1047
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,400
Yeah.

1048
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,520
So we're immediately in this sort of annex building.

1049
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,840
Then going down to the basement where there is,

1050
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,160
I want to say like a Banana Republic, Ben,

1051
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,840
do you remember what the clothing store was?

1052
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,880
Yeah, it was a Banana Republic.

1053
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,040
And there was a burger place.

1054
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,760
Guys, we were in a fucking basement to go see.

1055
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,240
We're in a basement.

1056
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,760
Stupid bullshit.

1057
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:30,240
And it feels immediately realized, oh, this is like empty retail space.

1058
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,160
Oh, God.

1059
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,680
That's what this is.

1060
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:39,040
This is clearly like and then we met up with a friend afterwards

1061
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,120
and was telling him about this event and he was like,

1062
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,560
I have heard for a fact that they're really struggling to fill

1063
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,960
those spaces across the 30 Rock buildings,

1064
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,960
especially the annex ones.

1065
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,200
Since the pandemic, I bet this whole thing was born out of

1066
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,680
what's a thing we can do to get something in here immediately

1067
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,360
and like turbocharged sales.

1068
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,960
Now, I've gone down a bit of a rabbit hole.

1069
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,560
I have not found anything to back this up.

1070
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,600
I don't know, but like the second I saw it was like,

1071
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,640
oh, this is clearly where four businesses used to be.

1072
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,040
The whole thing made a lot more sense.

1073
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:12,800
Interesting.

1074
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,640
So like it's a spirit Halloween.

1075
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:14,880
Yeah.

1076
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,800
It's Jimmy Fallon spirit Halloween.

1077
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,760
I like the idea that it used to be like a TJ Maxx

1078
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,600
and now it's a Jimmy Fallon maze.

1079
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,760
That's what it feels like.

1080
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:30,160
A TJ Maxx next to a Ross next to a Burlington Coat Factory

1081
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,720
and that's a lot of floor space.

1082
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,960
That's like the mall by the Portillo's in Buena Park.

1083
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,360
You just listed all three of those things.

1084
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,480
AKA paradise.

1085
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,040
That's right.

1086
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:44,640
The 30 Rock Plaza is a little maybe more like the New York equivalent of the Americana.

1087
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,800
Where it wants to have this air of being a little more upscale.

1088
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,240
Right, right.

1089
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,440
Which I also think has then made it a struggle for them to fill that space

1090
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,920
because they don't want to put a spirit Halloween in there.

1091
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,320
They think that will ding the prestige of the location

1092
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,680
but doing something that's maybe more synergistic

1093
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,680
and vertically integrated within the company does not feel that way.

1094
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:13,760
The weirdly kind of intense security check-in.

1095
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,320
You know, you're in this underground mall

1096
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:22,000
in what feels like it's about to transition to an entrance to the F train

1097
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:28,400
and the lines were all sort of bifurcated and split around corners.

1098
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,120
We went to a person who was wearing a To Nightmares shirt.

1099
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,760
She said, no, you have to check in with that person first

1100
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,520
and then she'll send you back here.

1101
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,680
There was a lot of that and then you're in a line that then is cut off

1102
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,400
and then you're told to transfer from one line to the other line.

1103
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,240
I was trying to explain to Ben.

1104
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,920
I said, Ben, remember you're a journalist.

1105
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,360
Take notes.

1106
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,360
We're going to have to explain all of this.

1107
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:54,000
And I said, on PTR, the theming of the queue is very important.

1108
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Unskippable, some might say.

1109
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,500
Sure.

1110
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,720
It depends if it's unskippable.

1111
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,220
Depends.

1112
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:04,740
We, of course, have Race from New York where the queue is

1113
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:09,220
a replica of these very buildings, the 30 Rock experience.

1114
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:14,340
And it made me yearn for the nonstop excitement of that queue.

1115
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:19,380
Being in the real version of it, poorly run with people who seem stressed out.

1116
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:24,100
Ben, do you remember your immediate take on the attendees?

1117
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:29,780
Yes, I was taking in who was there with us

1118
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:32,900
trying to think about what are their lives?

1119
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,340
What brought them here today?

1120
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,460
I know why I'm here.

1121
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:42,180
And it seemed like it wasn't a lot of New Yorkers.

1122
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:46,580
It seemed like a lot of tourists, which makes sense for the area.

1123
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:57,700
And my guess was that some few different concierge service people

1124
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:03,940
have been, you know, they've been given a hundred dollar bill under the table

1125
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:08,020
to start pointing people over to the frigging Jimmy Fallon experience.

1126
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:13,860
Because the sense I was getting was that it was, yeah, this is this is striking me as like

1127
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:20,900
people who are in their hotel lobby and are looking at the pamphlets that, you know,

1128
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:25,780
sometimes when you stay especially at chain hotels, they'll have pamphlets for local things

1129
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,980
that you can go and do.

1130
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,660
The brochure rack.

1131
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:31,300
Exactly.

1132
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,940
I love the brochure rack.

1133
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:38,580
Yeah, it was a coin toss for some of these people between taking a day trip to the Hudson

1134
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:46,100
Valley Lego land or to Nightmares, which only takes up 30 minutes of their time all in.

1135
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:53,300
Did you guys consider bailing to just go to Nintendo New York, the big Nintendo store?

1136
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:54,260
It is right there.

1137
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,020
Yeah, we didn't consider it.

1138
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:57,060
We were very serious.

1139
01:00:57,060 --> 01:01:02,020
We had our press passes inside the brim of our caps.

1140
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:02,740
The doors.

1141
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:03,220
Yeah.

1142
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:03,620
Yes.

1143
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:05,860
You said press and VIP.

1144
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:07,540
You had both tabs.

1145
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:08,500
VIP flex.

1146
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:13,460
Ben also, because he was waiting there while we were trying to figure out where the entrance was,

1147
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,660
sent a video.

1148
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:26,740
Yeah, there were like a group of maybe 10 to 12 shrouded hooded figures that walk through

1149
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:32,340
the lobby into the entrance of the Jimmy Fallon experience.

1150
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:39,860
And I initially was like, am I going to have to fucking wear a stinky shroud or something?

1151
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,140
Is that going to be part of this?

1152
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:49,220
But Griffin, I think, correctly guessed later that that was probably the people who were part

1153
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:55,860
of the experience in costume, covering themselves up to be able to get in to get into place.

1154
01:01:56,660 --> 01:02:02,660
They were like complete Grim Reaper robes that looked like Ghost of Christmas yet to

1155
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:04,980
come in Muppet Treasure Island, where there's just a void.

1156
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:10,100
You can see nothing specific to not ruin the surprise.

1157
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:14,580
But it did immediately make clear, oh, there's no back entrance.

1158
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:18,820
These scare actors just have to walk through the same shitty hallways the rest of us,

1159
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:24,020
with hoods over their heads, to get in through the front and quickly assume their places.

1160
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:30,020
Now, this is a specific element of Halloween Horror Nights, where if you go at the right time,

1161
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:33,220
you can catch a shift change.

1162
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:36,180
You're like 30 minutes on, 30 minutes off.

1163
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:38,420
And I don't think that's a thing we've said yet.

1164
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:45,140
This is like Halloween Horror Nights creative involved in this experience.

1165
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,460
Is that confirmed?

1166
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:48,980
I believe it.

1167
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,780
What he said, Jason said it, so.

1168
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:53,300
Oh, me?

1169
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:56,260
According to the Sheridan press?

1170
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:00,820
I saw it in the marketing material that it is.

1171
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:01,460
That makes sense.

1172
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:07,140
You mentioned like a cross platform Comcast Endeavor,

1173
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:11,140
and I think it was like all under one roof.

1174
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:15,220
You know, one division of Comcast and another working together.

1175
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:20,260
Well, here's one company I saw credited on this, RWS Global.

1176
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:23,780
We offer everything and everyone you need to deliver an unmatched

1177
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:27,060
guest experience from ideation operation anywhere in the world.

1178
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:32,900
Hmm, very specific to learn about what this company does.

1179
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:33,140
Yes.

1180
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:38,020
Here are some things they have listed on their site.

1181
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:40,100
MSC Cruises.

1182
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,780
Ferrari World Abu Dhabi.

1183
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:45,140
Oh, yeah, we know Ferrari World.

1184
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:49,700
They just list Halloween experiences in general,

1185
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:53,620
and the photo is from SeaWorld Howl-O-Scream.

1186
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:54,900
Oh, right, right, right.

1187
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:55,400
Yes.

1188
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,400
OK, so that's.

1189
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,880
They did the Friends experience in New York,

1190
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,480
which I think has been quite successful.

1191
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:05,240
Which I assume you guys all did regardless of,

1192
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,680
you know, we didn't send you to do it.

1193
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:07,400
We should have.

1194
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:11,320
We actually skipped it this week just because we were doing To Nightmares,

1195
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,920
but usually that is a weekly hangout for us.

1196
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:15,480
Well, you know, you live in.

1197
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,320
We just get together for coffee there.

1198
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,800
That's kind of just what we do on a weekly basis.

1199
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,300
Yeah.

1200
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,280
You guys live in New York City.

1201
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,160
Your lives are the Friends experience.

1202
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,280
Yeah, this is true.

1203
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,400
You're living it.

1204
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,720
You meet at a coffee shop or you meet in a fountain.

1205
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,120
I mean, this is interesting.

1206
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:39,240
There are a lot of like there's some pretty respectable credits here,

1207
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:43,480
but like it seems like they do the stage shows at Hershey, Pennsylvania,

1208
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:48,920
that they work at some degree on the Radio City Christmas Spectacular.

1209
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:56,760
I don't know if they are associated with Horror Nights or not,

1210
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:00,440
or this is just getting folded into a certain degree

1211
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:04,200
because it is part of the universal portfolio.

1212
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:09,000
Well, there's a lot of these third party logistics companies

1213
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:14,360
that do like some of the more grunt work stuff

1214
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:19,720
in terms of bringing a show or a themed experience to life.

1215
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,280
A lot of these are outsourced.

1216
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,640
Well, we're going to have to dig in.

1217
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,000
We're going to have to send some emails

1218
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,320
to really figure out who's responsible for this.

1219
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:35,080
Well, when they say the people behind Halloween Horror Nights,

1220
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:40,520
they mean that like it's somebody who like plugged in a strobe light, you know?

1221
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,020
Sure.

1222
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:45,740
Well, it's the cloak manufacturer, you know, they got to get the cloaks.

1223
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:49,420
We use Halloween Horror Nights branded cloaks, yes.

1224
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:51,660
Yeah, get people on and off stage, you know?

1225
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:58,140
I did think this was one of the more kind of abrasive security processes

1226
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:03,180
for any sort of experience like this I've ever come across.

1227
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:03,900
Jesus.

1228
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,580
It was very disorganized.

1229
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:08,780
I mean, everyone I worked there was doing their best job in a weird space

1230
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:12,780
that also is like there are people walking through these hallways

1231
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:14,700
who are just getting off from work,

1232
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:18,060
like working that as an office building and are frustrated

1233
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:20,940
that like to get from their office to the subway,

1234
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:23,660
they have to walk through a queue for a haunted house.

1235
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:27,660
But there were a couple things that jumped out to me.

1236
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:36,140
One, they extensively asked everyone if they had knives or pepper spray.

1237
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:41,260
Specifically, it was just those two things.

1238
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:44,060
And if you have them, you need to check them in with us

1239
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:45,900
and leave them here before you go in.

1240
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:48,540
And then there were a lot of pre-warnings

1241
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:50,780
about things you could or couldn't do.

1242
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:55,500
And most of them seemed to be about what would scare the actors.

1243
01:06:57,260 --> 01:07:00,620
Well, I couldn't tell if it was in response to some bad incidents

1244
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:03,660
that have already happened or not, if that's just projection on my part.

1245
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,180
But they were like, you are allowed to film this.

1246
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:09,980
Please feel free to film the entire experience.

1247
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:11,340
Take any photos you want.

1248
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:12,860
Do not use the flash.

1249
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,300
It will scare the actors.

1250
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:17,180
The actors are not allowed to touch you.

1251
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:18,780
Don't worry about that.

1252
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:21,420
If an actor does touch you, please let us know.

1253
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:24,780
But also in exchange, you are not allowed to touch the actors.

1254
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,140
That will scare them.

1255
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:29,020
They kept saying these things about like, if you do this,

1256
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:31,180
these scare actors will be scared.

1257
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:36,060
They did not get the bravest set of scare actors, it sounds like.

1258
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:39,420
They got scared at the drop of a hat, like a Laurel and Hardy movie.

1259
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:40,620
Maybe that was the problem.

1260
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:44,780
There was a miscommunication and they got scared actors instead of scare actors.

1261
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:47,340
Oh, yeah, wanted scared actors.

1262
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:51,420
Don't yank their sashes and don't touch their fezzes.

1263
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:51,920
Right.

1264
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:54,220
Final security checkpoint.

1265
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:56,220
Just one thing that has never happened to me before

1266
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:59,580
as a person who wears a hat almost every day of my life.

1267
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:03,820
They asked me as I walked through the metal detector to take my hat off and shake it.

1268
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:06,320
What?

1269
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:10,220
They were like, share your hat above your head so we can

1270
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:13,420
in case a knife or pepper spray falls out that's been tucked

1271
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,060
top your dome.

1272
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:20,220
What did you do if you if you like duct taped a knife to the top

1273
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:25,820
or the top of your hat, wouldn't it be secured enough to not come out when you shook it?

1274
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:27,180
It was interesting.

1275
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:31,020
It just set a tone of wow, this feels more like the TSA

1276
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:35,980
than any sort of theme parky experience I've ever been part of.

1277
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:42,460
And then I would say that vibe continued through the experience itself.

1278
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:48,780
OK, so we sent a skeptical Ben through a TSA line in an office building,

1279
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:53,260
which was sad for like lack of filled retail space.

1280
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:56,700
More than spooky Halloween vibes.

1281
01:08:57,820 --> 01:08:59,020
Yes, you did.

1282
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:01,260
All right.

1283
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:02,220
Well, I cop to it.

1284
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:06,140
I owe you an apology and I haven't even heard about the experience itself yet.

1285
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:11,100
The first room I want to say I thought was pretty good.

1286
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:15,820
Maybe it was lowered expectations, but I walked in there and immediately felt like

1287
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:18,700
this is more holistically themed than I expected.

1288
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:27,100
It was a sort of dare I say it, Hollywood Hotel Tower of Terror-esque vibe.

1289
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,980
It was like decrepit old building.

1290
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:35,500
And you're waiting for a kind of grand elevator at the end of the room.

1291
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:36,540
You're sent in with a group.

1292
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:39,260
So we were with maybe five other people we didn't know.

1293
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:41,020
Does that sound right, Ben?

1294
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:43,580
So we're all in this sort of holding room.

1295
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:46,540
That's like the final loading room before you're going to go in.

1296
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:50,860
And there's a long Jimmy audio track that's being looped.

1297
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:55,340
That seems to have a couple of variations, but he's basically saying something like

1298
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,500
you didn't record this part.

1299
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:01,820
I think your recording started right when we entered the experience itself.

1300
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:06,300
But he's saying something like, oh no, all my To Nightmares start like this.

1301
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:09,180
There's a really creepy old elevator.

1302
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:10,860
Hang on a second.

1303
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:12,060
This is the beginning.

1304
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:15,180
There's no explanation of what a To Nightmare is.

1305
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,300
Not that there needs to be.

1306
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,300
I'm not a dumb person.

1307
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,460
I can make the leap of why it's...

1308
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:21,500
Although, hang on.

1309
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,300
Can I?

1310
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:22,860
All right.

1311
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:29,020
I guess the host of The Tonight Show would have To Nightmares.

1312
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:31,500
That is the single way in which it's been made specific.

1313
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:37,740
It's something only Jay Cohn and Carson Barr, Steve Allen, knew.

1314
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:40,620
Everyone else just has regular Nightmares.

1315
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:41,740
No one else has To Nightmares.

1316
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:44,140
I couldn't barely knew it.

1317
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:44,700
Yeah.

1318
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:48,380
That's what's such a shame is he only sort of got to experience To Nightmares.

1319
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:51,100
The biggest of all, I guess.

1320
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:57,100
But there's no justification of what a To Nightmare is.

1321
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:58,300
They invoke the word.

1322
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:00,220
They make you hear the word To Nightmare.

1323
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:03,660
But do not explain what a To Nightmare is as opposed to a nightmare.

1324
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:03,980
No.

1325
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:05,980
Zero preface until we walk into that room.

1326
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:10,860
There's no Jimmy Fallon like, hi, welcome to my To Nightmares video to set the tone.

1327
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:14,220
I was waiting for a Spielberg E.T. ride-esque.

1328
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:16,060
There's none of that.

1329
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:17,020
So you're in this room.

1330
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:21,020
I think I had to point out like, wait, I think that's Jimmy's voice.

1331
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:24,380
It's kind of playing like in a loop at a low volume.

1332
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:28,780
And he's just sort of saying like, oh, no, all my nightmares start like this.

1333
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:30,460
Oh, no, this is like a bad sign.

1334
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:35,180
Like that kind of vibe, which let's say also he's been pushing this thing really hard on

1335
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:39,820
The Tonight Show every night for like a couple weeks.

1336
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:40,060
Wow.

1337
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:44,620
He was introducing a new character, which would then get posted all over the social media,

1338
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:47,180
a proprietary character from To Nightmares.

1339
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:54,460
And his framework for that every night was him going like, guys, I had another To Nightmare

1340
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:55,020
last night.

1341
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:59,340
Like trying to present it as if not like, hey, I'm really excited.

1342
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:01,900
We have the spooky experience at 30 Rockefeller Center.

1343
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:05,180
But like rubbing the back of his neck like, hey, I'm sorry to the audience.

1344
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:06,620
I didn't sleep all night.

1345
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:07,820
Had another To Nightmare.

1346
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:12,140
And in this To Nightmare, and he's introducing element by element as if the backstory is

1347
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:15,820
these are just the last 30 nights of Jimmy Fallon's attempts to sleep.

1348
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:22,940
Yeah, he did the exact same segment for at least 10 nights in a row with the same format

1349
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:25,260
where he describes a To Nightmare that he had.

1350
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:31,180
And it's just real details of a spooky story that is not, that's kind of like a PG, like

1351
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,220
for 11 year olds type spooky story.

1352
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:38,060
And then there's a fake and then it builds to a torrent and then like, and the monster

1353
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:42,300
said, he said, tickets are available for Jimmy Fallon's To Nightmares.

1354
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:49,260
They did the exact same sketch for 10 nights in a row, which is again, really where you

1355
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:53,660
like, boy, you imagine that like an up and coming, if you're graduating college and your

1356
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:58,860
dream is to write comedy for the biggest show in town or even like, you know, they've they've

1357
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:02,540
as we've said, they've hired many of the funniest people I've ever met.

1358
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:05,660
And then here's what the actual contents of the show are.

1359
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:08,620
10 nights of the same nightmare sketch.

1360
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:14,460
The only change being that this time it's a scary farmer instead of a scary gas station guy.

1361
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:20,380
And look, I don't know if you guys have talked about it at all in any of your

1362
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:24,940
Haunt Cast the Fright episodes, since it is kind of a big news story right now.

1363
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:32,940
But the sort of the fumble of Universal possibly revealing the design of the upcoming Wolfman

1364
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:38,300
movie for the first time as a walk around character connected to Horror Nights,

1365
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:46,300
but not even within the maze at like an open air direct sunlight stand up like pop up kiosk

1366
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:49,580
that looks terrible for one day.

1367
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,620
Yeah, for one day.

1368
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:57,180
But then like, of course, 20 people film it on their phone and it goes viral across every

1369
01:13:57,180 --> 01:14:00,060
like hardcore horror movie fan website.

1370
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:02,300
And they're like, what is this fucking design?

1371
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:05,660
And even the people who are generous and are like, well, that's like a rubber mask.

1372
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:07,180
Obviously, it's going to look better in the movie.

1373
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:09,420
They're like, it still looks shitty.

1374
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:14,700
Fallon was making the same mistake every night, which I don't actually I will say,

1375
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:20,540
I don't think I have any criticisms, major criticisms of any of the character designs

1376
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,820
in the attraction.

1377
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:25,340
But after we went on it and I went back and rewatched some of the videos of him

1378
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:31,260
introducing them on The Tonight Show, they all look worse in that format in high def

1379
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:37,020
standing behind him, brightly lit or in like a standalone Instagram grid picture.

1380
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:40,940
Right. It's like it's like when I saw the Minotaur with the lights on.

1381
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:42,460
Yeah.

1382
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:45,820
And I felt even worse for not having done the escape room.

1383
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:48,460
Like it's not the great way to see it.

1384
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:51,260
No, no, I would have set up more.

1385
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:55,740
I mean, because this is another just not to be like persnickety here.

1386
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:59,980
But I felt unclear while walking through this.

1387
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:05,260
If this is meant to represent one horrible night sleep for Jimmy Fallon,

1388
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:11,340
or is he doing sort of a roundup of here are different nightmares I've had before

1389
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:15,020
because this intro, the non intro at the beginning where he's like, oh no,

1390
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:17,740
all my nightmares start like this makes it feel like,

1391
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:20,620
okay, you are about to go on the waking nightmare.

1392
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:24,700
One long nightmare where all of these things happen.

1393
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:26,460
But then I have a whole other question.

1394
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:27,660
Why are we here?

1395
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:29,500
Why are you there?

1396
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,260
How are you in his brain?

1397
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:37,580
There's no attempt to justify why we're seeing his nightmares, his nightmares come to life.

1398
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:43,500
No, I mean, you get through that first room, you go into an elevator.

1399
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:49,660
This last sort of employee says like, okay, everyone go through this room.

1400
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:53,580
When you get out the other side of the elevator, you're going to meet, I think her name was Tina,

1401
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:55,980
who will be your tour guide.

1402
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:58,380
I warn you, she's a little spooky.

1403
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:06,140
And then we go into this elevator alone and they sort of do a half-assed version

1404
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:09,740
of like a haunted mansion through lights.

1405
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:13,180
We make you feel like you are being lowered even though you're not moving anywhere.

1406
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:15,100
No, it's not an elevator.

1407
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:17,580
It's just made to look like an elevator.

1408
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:20,940
That room does not move a inch.

1409
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:25,820
No, and there's some Jimmy audio happening over that.

1410
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:27,820
And then the doors open and this woman comes out

1411
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:32,700
who's sort of doing a version of like a Tower of Terror bellhop, spooky bellhop kind of thing.

1412
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:37,660
But more than anything does kind of feel like a TSA employee

1413
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:40,540
who is constantly having to yell at us like, no, this way, this way.

1414
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:46,140
Because this is an attraction that needs to turn people through so fully

1415
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:51,980
that you have no opportunity to like explore rooms on your own pace.

1416
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:55,820
It feels like you are rushed in and out of every room.

1417
01:16:55,820 --> 01:17:00,700
Every single room basically has the exact same rhythm of a door opens.

1418
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,980
You have your introduction in the liminal space of Jimmy Fallon being like,

1419
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:10,220
in one of my worst nightmares, there's an alien chasing me in the woods.

1420
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:15,100
And then like door opens and it's the woods.

1421
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:16,860
You're in indoor woods.

1422
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:18,940
Right. And this woman is like, quickly, guys, quickly.

1423
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:21,660
And you just have to make it from one corner of the room to the other.

1424
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:23,980
And it's really like, pasta, pasta.

1425
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:25,260
Let's keep it moving.

1426
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:27,500
And there's some decent set design.

1427
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,740
There's some really like good looking spaces

1428
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:33,740
and you do not have any chance to actually take it in

1429
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:36,620
because this woman keeps being like, hey, come on, you're falling behind.

1430
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:37,580
Let's go, let's go.

1431
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:39,020
Hurry up, faster, faster.

1432
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:41,580
And it's like no slight on this woman.

1433
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:45,740
It felt very much like the the Back to the Future escape room

1434
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:50,620
we did at City Walk Orlando, where clearly sometimes they would push us

1435
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:54,700
to the next room because the group behind us had solved a puzzle faster than we had.

1436
01:17:55,340 --> 01:18:00,060
And yeah, by that, you mean you mean that which that the level keeper did, correct?

1437
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:01,500
Correct. I'm sorry.

1438
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:04,060
You just heard the episode and are remarking on that.

1439
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:05,420
What you heard.

1440
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:10,380
Yes, I was on that trip, but then I feel like the level keeper did some of the things

1441
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:12,140
and I did some of the things.

1442
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:13,180
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

1443
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:13,580
Yes.

1444
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:16,860
No, some things you arbitrarily sat out and stayed at your hotel

1445
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:20,060
and then we met up with this ghost and you guys never had a chance to meet.

1446
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:20,380
Right.

1447
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:24,460
And we each took a different live show and didn't pass each other in the hallway.

1448
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:26,060
I never met backstage.

1449
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:27,740
There's no photo of the two of you.

1450
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:27,900
Yes.

1451
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:29,660
It's a shame because I'm a big fan.

1452
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:35,340
Yeah, I think the cowbell thing, I think his voice is really consistent.

1453
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:36,540
Oh, yeah, it's his thing.

1454
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:36,860
Yes.

1455
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:38,860
Yeah, I love his thing.

1456
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:46,860
But no, it had that feeling of like you have your own personalized tour guide

1457
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:52,700
and their job is to get you into the next room in that liminal space as quickly as

1458
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:55,340
possible so that the following group can do that room.

1459
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:57,260
I was going to say, are there cues?

1460
01:18:57,260 --> 01:19:02,540
Because like you're talking about doors opening, a normal horror night's maze or not maze

1461
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:03,900
is all the doors are all open.

1462
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:04,860
There's no cue or doors open.

1463
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:06,460
There's an organic flow.

1464
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:09,500
Right, so you just kind of walk at a pace, which you still,

1465
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:13,340
depending on how many people are there, you don't get a good chance to sit and look at

1466
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:13,740
everything.

1467
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:15,900
The whole thing felt it.

1468
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:19,740
Look, it felt somewhat emblematic of New York real estate.

1469
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:23,740
You want to do things in New York, going to be in a tiny box crammed in.

1470
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:28,140
You're not going to have some spatial, some backyard where it's like, all right,

1471
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:31,100
this is the New York real estate version of a horror night maze.

1472
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,620
The rooms are really tiny.

1473
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:34,860
It's kind of built like a railroad apartment.

1474
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:37,260
It's really cramped.

1475
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:39,740
There is no organic flow.

1476
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:45,260
So I think the first room you get to that was a little fun off of the elevator was what

1477
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:47,820
purported to be Jimmy Fallon's bedroom.

1478
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:51,100
Now you might be wondering what size bed does Jimmy Fallon have?

1479
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,300
A twin, of course.

1480
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:57,260
Yes, I would say this does not have the same sheets that I have from high school.

1481
01:19:58,220 --> 01:20:00,300
I think he literally says that, doesn't he?

1482
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,340
He does say that.

1483
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:03,660
He does say that.

1484
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:04,460
Yes.

1485
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:07,980
And it's odd because it's like, it's a very easy fix to just be like,

1486
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:11,900
my dream, I'm in my childhood bedroom for some reason.

1487
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:13,500
But he doesn't say that.

1488
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,900
It very much looks like the bedroom of a 15 year old.

1489
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:21,020
But there's booze bottles everywhere.

1490
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:25,980
Broken flippies slammed against the wall.

1491
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:29,180
Watch your feet, everybody.

1492
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:29,680
Flippies.

1493
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:32,380
The failed flippy models.

1494
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:38,300
Take all, take all your rings off or you're in for a scare.

1495
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:43,660
This is all the result of one fall of mine.

1496
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:48,060
I mean, this is the problem is, we certainly, we can get into this, but

1497
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:53,100
we're joking about like, well, what are the nightmares of Jimmy Fallon?

1498
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:53,980
How do you make this?

1499
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:57,900
The public doesn't have any association with how he presents himself.

1500
01:20:58,540 --> 01:20:58,780
Yes.

1501
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:03,420
We all could very quickly come up with 10 rooms that I think represent real scares of Jimmy Fallon.

1502
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:07,100
Which is just a room that is all table corners.

1503
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:14,860
Waiting, waiting for the phone call for the opening weekend gross of Taxi.

1504
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:19,820
Waiting for the phone call for the opening weekend gross of Fever Pitch.

1505
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:24,140
A press pit of only Rolling Stone reporters.

1506
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:28,140
I had a bad, I had such a bad dream.

1507
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:32,620
I had a dream that there was a writer's strike and all the other hosts agreed

1508
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:36,380
to pay their entire staffs out of their pocket for the duration.

1509
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:38,540
And not just for two weeks, which was my plan.

1510
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:39,040
Oh no.

1511
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:47,580
A closing down Virgin Megastore that only has seedy copies on clearance of the bathroom wall.

1512
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:55,740
This first room got me a little, I don't want to say excited, but it was like

1513
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:57,660
you're in a room, you're not moving through.

1514
01:21:57,660 --> 01:21:58,380
It's very clear.

1515
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:01,260
At some point, they're going to open a door and say, okay, onto the next room,

1516
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:03,020
which is how this whole thing works.

1517
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:06,700
Like you're sanctioned to one room until they very quickly bring you over to the next.

1518
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:07,180
Why?

1519
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:11,260
Why if this is, if there's a precedent, if there's maze after maze and it is quote

1520
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:15,660
from the Horror Nights people, why do they do it with doors and rooms?

1521
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:19,500
I think it has to be that the space is just not fucking equipped for this.

1522
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:20,060
I don't know.

1523
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:25,580
Like I was, but this first room, you're not forced to run from one end to the other.

1524
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:26,860
You're in the bedroom.

1525
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:28,940
There's a longer audio track playing.

1526
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:30,780
And then he's like, and in my nightmare,

1527
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:31,580
I'm stuck.

1528
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:33,180
I got caught in the bed.

1529
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:38,940
And then they have an effect that's basic, but I found a little effective where like the,

1530
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:46,140
the quote unquote wood of like the headboard of his bed is actually some kind of screen.

1531
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:49,740
And there are scare actors behind it who are pushing their hands through

1532
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:52,140
as if they're trapped in the headboard of the bed.

1533
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:53,740
And I was like, that's a little spooky.

1534
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:55,340
It's a little atmospheric.

1535
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:59,260
I think one person jumps out from some corner of this room.

1536
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:01,900
And then our tour guide is like, okay, quickly next room.

1537
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:02,860
Then you're in the hallway.

1538
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:03,820
You're in the book again.

1539
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:10,380
I want to get the order of these, but every other room after this is basically save for

1540
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:14,780
the werewolf one, which is the biggest exception of all in all care areas,

1541
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:18,220
quickly run through one end to the other end.

1542
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:24,540
I think that maybe the being stuck in bed is a manifestation of, I think this real nightmare

1543
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:30,300
is that he slept in one day and there was a day where he,

1544
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:33,340
he didn't have three separate shows to host.

1545
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:35,500
And thus he had to spend the day with his family.

1546
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:45,260
I tried to take a photo of something that was under the bed and it came out

1547
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:49,020
too blurry to make out, but there were my kids.

1548
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:49,900
They're reaching for me.

1549
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:54,860
They want their dad to be around for two hours.

1550
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:55,260
Oh no.

1551
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:56,300
What are their names again?

1552
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:03,180
We will not credit them, but Ben and I reached out to someone.

1553
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:08,620
We know who used to work on the show and asked them if they had any insider knowledge.

1554
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:13,740
And they said, I imagine one of the rooms is Jimmy forced to spend time with his family.

1555
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:14,380
Wow.

1556
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:14,940
Wow.

1557
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:15,740
All right.

1558
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:16,940
It was kind of guessing, but

1559
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:21,580
it's like, this is like, if you guys can make this out,

1560
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:25,180
this is like what the text looks like on the screens.

1561
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:27,660
It's like Nosferatu or something.

1562
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:29,980
Right. Appearing in this like glowing way.

1563
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:33,020
And the text of the first one is being in the middle.

1564
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:36,380
I'll try to do it my best, Jimmy being in the middle of the woods is bad,

1565
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:40,780
but you know, it's even worse being in the middle of the woods while being haunted by aliens.

1566
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,660
Like that's the level of energy he gives it.

1567
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:45,660
Haunted by them?

1568
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:48,220
I'm sorry. It did say hunted. I'm sorry.

1569
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:48,700
It did.

1570
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:49,500
Okay. Oh, sorry.

1571
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:50,700
All right.

1572
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:54,460
Door opens tour guides like quick, quick, quick.

1573
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:59,660
Then you see a board with a bunch of like newspaper clippings

1574
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:03,180
of like crimes and conspiracies going on.

1575
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:09,180
I did notice there was a missing sign where the missing information is it's a picture

1576
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:11,820
of Jimmy Fallon from some sketch while he's dancing.

1577
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:12,380
Tight pants.

1578
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:13,580
And it says missing.

1579
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:14,620
Tight pants.

1580
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:15,420
There we go.

1581
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:15,660
Yeah.

1582
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:23,260
Jimmy Fallon, 49, 59, 192 pounds, short brunette, bowl cut, eye color hazel wear,

1583
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:26,460
tight white pants, striped shirt, last seen tonight show rehearsal.

1584
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:28,780
There's a phone number here we could try calling later.

1585
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:30,940
But so there's like a little bit of theming there.

1586
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:35,740
And then you're basically like, once you're past this wall, you're just in quote unquote

1587
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:41,420
the woods, which maybe takes up all of 25 feet and there's flashing lights.

1588
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:43,740
And there are like two aliens that jump out at you.

1589
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:48,060
And this becomes the pattern that basically every room has, which is door opens,

1590
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:50,060
maybe one wall of light theming.

1591
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:53,260
You're told to get to the other end of the room as quickly as possible.

1592
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:57,500
And two people are going to jump out where you can almost set your clock

1593
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:00,780
to the timing of where the scares are going to be.

1594
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:02,860
You can see them coming.

1595
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:03,360
Yes.

1596
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:11,180
They're positioned in a way where they reset to the same spot and they're not well hidden

1597
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:18,940
in a way that I think is a choice that was made to not overly scare people,

1598
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:21,500
to give them some expectation of what's to come.

1599
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:29,740
So that means each group really only, I think like each time I felt like

1600
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:33,420
the characters popped out twice more or less, right Griffin?

1601
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:34,780
Like no more than twice.

1602
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:36,060
Two jumps per room.

1603
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:36,560
Yeah.

1604
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:37,840
Okay.

1605
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:42,160
Because that maybe that's why you have to have groups in it once to all experience

1606
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:44,480
just the two set scare actors.

1607
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,760
Because like there's so many scares happening in a horror night's maze.

1608
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:51,200
If you just walk through it like a line, you're going to get some scare.

1609
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:54,560
But it feels like it would be very easy to walk through this whole thing

1610
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:57,680
in a straight line without getting scares because there's so few.

1611
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:03,360
Yeah, even our group of like eight or 10, depending on where you were in the line,

1612
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:07,920
which is not fixed and everyone gets scrambled up in those liminal hallway spaces

1613
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,760
before you enter the next room.

1614
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:12,560
It's like sometimes you'd walk through a room and be like,

1615
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,640
I was not in a good position for the timing.

1616
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,600
I missed the jumps, you know?

1617
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,640
And you like watch the person ahead of you get them.

1618
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:24,560
But then what you're seeing is that person resetting back to their place.

1619
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,720
And then it happens again for the person behind you.

1620
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:30,560
It's also sort of hurried and they're trying to get in there.

1621
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:36,160
And as Ben said, you basically enter every room and you can immediately clock either,

1622
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:41,040
oh, there are two open spaces here that someone is going to jump out of,

1623
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:45,200
or you can see them and you're waiting for like, when are they going to jump?

1624
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:51,040
Or the other trick a lot of the rooms use is like there are 10 of some kind of creature

1625
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:56,160
and eight of them are dressed up mannequins and two of them are going to move.

1626
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,520
And you're like, which two move?

1627
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:04,240
Is it possible that there at some point were more scare actors in this experience

1628
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:09,840
and many, many of them quit due to Jimmy Fallon's To Nightmares being a toxic work environment?

1629
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:13,760
The rooms are small, like you couldn't fit more in.

1630
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,440
Another important thing about the scare actors,

1631
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:24,320
they never actually scream or make any kind of noise.

1632
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:29,040
When they're making some kind of action, it's pre-recorded.

1633
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:32,880
Yeah, that's kind of a hallmark of a lot of horns.

1634
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,520
Oh, I was thinking that you were going to say like,

1635
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:38,080
they didn't want to yell because they're desperate to be liked.

1636
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:46,080
They want to be liked so much, they don't want to yell at you.

1637
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:53,520
I did hear the familiar voice of one Papa Higgins doing the voiceover.

1638
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,080
Higgins senior.

1639
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:59,920
Gas station dad, which made me really happy to see that Higgins is getting

1640
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:04,160
an additional paycheck for doing voiceover for this while all of the actors

1641
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:06,560
are getting paid less because they're non-speaking.

1642
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,520
That's a really nice balance.

1643
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:10,080
Nice trick.

1644
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:15,440
Is that true though? Is most of universal pre-recorded audio tracks?

1645
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:22,000
Well, it's to do with timing and consistency, but it's also so that

1646
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:29,680
someone isn't working a multi-hour shift screaming and just killing their voice

1647
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:34,400
that they're working there for like two months or six weeks or whatever.

1648
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:35,840
It depends though.

1649
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:39,440
A couple of the rooms have like semi-extensive dialogue though

1650
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:44,320
that is being delivered in theory by people whose faces you're seeing.

1651
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:50,720
Is it all a tribute to Jimmy Fallon's lip sync battle?

1652
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:52,500
Yeah.

1653
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:56,080
Another part of his empire that hasn't come up yet.

1654
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:57,600
Quite possibly.

1655
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,840
Alien room, the woods were just kind of generic.

1656
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:05,360
You're sort of like immediately feeling the come down of,

1657
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,280
oh, is this what every room's going to be?

1658
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:11,680
The setup of the bedroom works a little better where you're just like,

1659
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:15,360
can we all stand here in place and then have some spooky things happen around us?

1660
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,720
Versus this like, go, go, go, you're on a mission, but there's nothing to accomplish.

1661
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:25,440
You know, it did feel almost closer to an escape room in the intensity of it,

1662
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,440
except you had no agency.

1663
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:35,680
And the aliens themselves kind of look like Cirque du Soleil versions of Xenomorphs.

1664
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:39,360
In the moment, they're fine.

1665
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:43,520
When you see the full light versions of them, they look kind of shitty.

1666
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,680
The second room is far and away the most interesting.

1667
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:50,480
The second room, the text in the hallway reads,

1668
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:54,560
and I just want to restate you're in each of these hallways for at least 30 seconds.

1669
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:58,160
You just wait for the next.

1670
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:02,160
It's like you're on a high, like a middle school field trip

1671
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:06,240
and the tour guide is like, I won't start talking until everyone has landed.

1672
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:11,120
And it's like they're waiting for your whole group to make it past

1673
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:15,520
the last room into the space and then they close the door and then the video starts

1674
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:18,640
and then the door opens and then you go to the next room.

1675
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:23,760
Uh, this, this text just says there's a serial killer on the loose

1676
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:25,440
and they'll kill anything that moves.

1677
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:32,560
And then this room you get into and it's like weird supply closet,

1678
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:38,160
like janitorial, like toilet paper rolls and like cleaning supplies.

1679
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:42,400
And then you're in this like concrete brick room

1680
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:46,800
that is filled with a hashtag the panda stuff.

1681
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,120
Okay, here we go.

1682
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,760
There is like a disembodied hashtag mascot head.

1683
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:57,680
There's like hearts drawn on the wall and what seems like blood,

1684
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:00,000
like massacred hashtag merchandise.

1685
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,960
And then there's like a guy staying there who jumps out,

1686
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:08,240
the first scare actor and he's seemingly like chained to the wall.

1687
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:12,080
He's wearing the body of a hashtag costume, the panda's suit

1688
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:14,800
and is yelling at you like, she's crazy.

1689
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:16,000
She wants to kill everybody.

1690
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:24,000
Okay, I'm going to throw things to Ben now and say, and ask what,

1691
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,960
what in the world did you know at this point about hashtag the panda?

1692
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,000
I knew nothing.

1693
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:35,120
So what I mean, what else is there to know?

1694
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,680
I mean, all I knew is that it was a panda.

1695
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:40,400
So I just made the leap of like, okay,

1696
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:44,080
this is a serial killer that wears a panda costume.

1697
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:45,680
Ah, okay.

1698
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:49,840
Right, because her victim is wearing the body suit,

1699
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:52,640
but his head is uncovered and he's screaming like, please help me.

1700
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:53,920
She's on the loose.

1701
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:57,440
And then you whip around and the other side of this very small room,

1702
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,680
there is a woman with pigtails.

1703
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:02,960
She is wearing like a baseball like ringer tee.

1704
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:07,360
She's got a giant knife and she's wearing a panda mask,

1705
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:10,400
but it's not the classic hashtag mascot head.

1706
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:15,920
It's like almost like a purge style version of a panda mask

1707
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,560
with stitched up mouth and blood on its face.

1708
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:23,520
And she's just going like, sort of like stabbing motion at you.

1709
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:28,160
I feel like hashtag the panda has outlived hashtags.

1710
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:29,620
I agree.

1711
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,520
Well, they basically don't exist anymore.

1712
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:38,560
I mean, they're not super useful anymore.

1713
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:39,440
Yeah, they do nothing.

1714
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:42,000
No, it's almost like you would make a hashtag joke

1715
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,040
if you were a Seinfeld-esque out of it comedian

1716
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:48,640
who doesn't actually pay attention to what's happening on social media now.

1717
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:52,320
Have we ever discussed what the origins of hashtag the panda are?

1718
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:55,920
Because I know, I think when Chase Mitchell was on your guys show,

1719
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:59,920
he talked about how part of the bit was that it was funny to make one of the writers

1720
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,640
wear the costume and dance a lot and get really tired and sweaty.

1721
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:04,320
Yes.

1722
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:04,820
Yes.

1723
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:07,600
That's the entire point of hashtag the panda.

1724
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:12,560
The hashtag, it's almost like an anti-character

1725
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:14,880
that has now become a fundamental character

1726
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:18,320
in all of the themed entertainment you can go visit of Jimmy Fallon.

1727
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:22,560
After we go through this, Ben, I'm like, did you get the hashtag the panda thing?

1728
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,160
And he's like, what are you talking about?

1729
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:25,600
Can I explain this?

1730
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,600
And he was like, is this a popular segment?

1731
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,400
I was like, no.

1732
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:32,560
I don't even know the last time they've done it on the show.

1733
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:37,520
I remember this being kind of a thing 10 years ago, but never went super viral.

1734
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:40,000
I think it just lined up with the theme park ride

1735
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,800
and them needing a proprietary character they could trademark.

1736
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:45,360
But I dug in because I was curious.

1737
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:47,760
I was like, where did this actually come out of?

1738
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:51,840
There was some thing like 10 years ago, eight years ago,

1739
01:34:51,840 --> 01:35:00,000
where there was a panda at some zoo that they were worried was depressed or wasn't mating.

1740
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,960
And they put a TV in its pen to try to cheer up its spirit.

1741
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:09,600
And the bit, which I think is kind of funny, was like,

1742
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:13,440
oh, Fallon is now going to do a segment of his monologue every night

1743
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:16,640
that is jokes narrow cast to this panda.

1744
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:23,600
And then they would cut to a feed of, quote unquote, the panda in its pen.

1745
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:30,320
And it was a tonight show writer or at that point, a late night writer in the costume.

1746
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:33,360
And as Fallon would make the jokes, hashtag would get excited and dance.

1747
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,480
And they'd be like, we're doing it.

1748
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:36,960
We're cheering the panda up, which is kind of a funny bit.

1749
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:41,120
So how do we all feel just hearing this right now?

1750
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:42,160
Do we feel good?

1751
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:45,920
Because I feel like this urge to actually scream.

1752
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,720
This sucks.

1753
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:49,520
Here's the worst part of it.

1754
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,840
OK, so then they do this segment a lot.

1755
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:53,600
I guess it gained some popularity.

1756
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:57,840
Fallon announces the panda is now going to be our official mascot.

1757
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:00,640
And we want and that was the other thing.

1758
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:06,560
It was every night he wanted listeners to tweet a hashtag Fallon Panda

1759
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:14,400
to make it go viral, to try to get, I think, the zoo to let him visit or some shit, right?

1760
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,480
But there was some hashtag campaign.

1761
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:20,400
And then after a couple of weeks of this, they do a segment on the show that's like,

1762
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,360
he's now our official mascot and we want to name him

1763
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,480
and we want to let the viewers vote on what his name will be.

1764
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,640
And the viewers voted for hashtag.

1765
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:34,320
And it was almost like a Boaty McBoatface thing of everyone trolling him and being like,

1766
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:36,560
you're pushing this hashtag thing so much.

1767
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,640
Hashtag Fallon Panda, what should his name be?

1768
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:40,160
And they're like, hashtag the panda.

1769
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:45,440
OK, and from that point on, there's basically been no bit.

1770
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:49,120
And I dug into what are the last couple of times they've done hashtag.

1771
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:54,800
And it basically seems like once a year they will have hashtag come out and do a dance.

1772
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:59,040
And then the end of the segment is hashtag takes off his head

1773
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:01,280
and reveals that it is a celebrity.

1774
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:04,880
And the implication is, oh, Lenny Kravitz has been hashtagged the whole time.

1775
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:06,800
They've done this like 10 times.

1776
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:11,360
But they did this with the whale on.

1777
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:14,160
This is so the most done thing ever.

1778
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:15,680
And then hashtag is not.

1779
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:21,440
So hashtag was never like a panda who likes social media or anything.

1780
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:25,040
It's just there's no there isn't a bit.

1781
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:26,880
There's no so far away from the bit.

1782
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,640
It's abstract into nothingness.

1783
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:35,920
And here is a room that is devoted to a hashtag, the panda fan who is so chaotic

1784
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:40,080
and unhinged in her love of hashtag that she started chaining men

1785
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:42,640
and making them wear panda suits and torturing them.

1786
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,200
There's like, I mean, I'll send you guys the photo,

1787
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:48,560
but the wall felt like Buffalo Bill style shit.

1788
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:48,880
Right.

1789
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:52,880
Of like her insane ramblings of like hashtag fan, though.

1790
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:53,760
And she's a hand.

1791
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,680
She's for sure a fan of hashtag.

1792
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:58,640
It's not like a writer dressed up as hashtag.

1793
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:02,000
It's had enough of Jimmy's shit like.

1794
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,520
Mike, great question.

1795
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:06,080
I wish they gave us more of an explanation.

1796
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:08,240
OK, I read you what the prelude.

1797
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:08,960
It could be any.

1798
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,720
That's what I extrapolate this to be.

1799
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:11,120
Right.

1800
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:13,360
For Ben, he's just like that room was chaos.

1801
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:14,400
What does that mean?

1802
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,400
And for me, I was like, well, this is the first room

1803
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:19,280
that actually has something to do with The Tonight Show.

1804
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:21,840
It's interesting.

1805
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:24,880
It's almost like an evil masked singer or something.

1806
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:29,360
Like the Fox show where they have a celebrity under the.

1807
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:30,560
Yeah.

1808
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:34,720
I don't think it's something as dark as what I described,

1809
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:35,760
but it could be anything.

1810
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,200
The point is, you know, obviously we're laughing.

1811
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:42,160
We're loving it.

1812
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:44,960
This is we understand it.

1813
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:46,960
It's successful on so many levels.

1814
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:49,520
And I, you know, why?

1815
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:50,560
Why scream, Ben?

1816
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:51,440
I don't understand.

1817
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,120
No, you're right.

1818
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:54,640
Obviously, a smash success.

1819
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:58,640
Now you understand the full context.

1820
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:02,160
This is a room that basically doesn't have hiding spaces.

1821
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:07,360
Like once you get past the first custodial rack sort of corner,

1822
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:09,440
then you're just in a room where like in one side

1823
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:12,240
there is a woman with a knife and another side there's a guy in a cage.

1824
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:16,240
And they're both like cowering a little bit and then jumping out more

1825
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,360
and both speaking in these prerecorded audio bits.

1826
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:23,520
So if we psychoanalyze this as one of Jimmy's nightmares,

1827
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:25,680
he is one of his greatest nightmares.

1828
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:30,800
One of his greatest to nightmares is that he's afraid of the hashtag on some level,

1829
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,880
whether he feels tied down to the comedy of it, perhaps like.

1830
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:40,480
Or but it's also it feels distanced from him where what he's afraid of is

1831
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:44,560
someone being too fanatical about hashtag.

1832
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:48,320
So maybe he's like, yeah, he's worried about his fans.

1833
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:53,440
There's a lack of viewpoint that's coming very clear at this point.

1834
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:58,480
You know, at Horror Nights in the past two years,

1835
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:02,160
they've had like a walk around David S. Pumpkins.

1836
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:06,800
And I feel like whether you like that sketch or not,

1837
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:10,480
like it's a pretty distinctive look.

1838
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:13,280
And someone goes, oh, it's yes, David S.

1839
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:14,640
Pumpkins got the Halloween suit.

1840
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:15,760
He's got the big hair.

1841
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:20,080
You know, I don't I don't know that people are giving that same reaction

1842
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:24,160
to just seeing hashtag the panda paraphernalia.

1843
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,200
No, no, because you're not even seeing hashtag.

1844
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:29,120
A thing that I think is barely known.

1845
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:33,760
You're seeing things that are riffing on the supposed cultural influence of hashtag.

1846
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:35,840
I mean, David S.

1847
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:41,680
Pumpkins, I want to put a pin in that for a possible plus up conversation at the end of this.

1848
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:45,120
But then the next hallway space, the text is,

1849
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:48,640
I'm a talk show host in the 50s holding a puppy, but it bites me.

1850
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:51,600
And I start to what?

1851
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:56,480
And then exactly we're just these explanations are getting shorter.

1852
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,040
You're sort of like more confused.

1853
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:02,960
Once again, his like deliveries are really kind of like tossed off.

1854
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:07,200
And then you enter what is kind of the most interesting room, Ben?

1855
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,520
I don't know the most successful, but the most interesting.

1856
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:12,560
Define interesting.

1857
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:24,960
You are in the guts like the backstage area of a TV studio with a bunch of on air signs

1858
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:30,480
and like mixing boards and like old school TVs mounted.

1859
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:33,840
And you're like, oh, this is like 50s Rockefeller Center.

1860
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:36,720
And then the TV screen comes on.

1861
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:41,360
As Ben pointed out, this is the one point, the only point where Jimmy

1862
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,320
appears visually in something he specifically did for this attraction.

1863
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:51,680
Jimmy Fallon is on the TV screen in black and white sitting behind his tonight show desk,

1864
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:53,920
but styled as if he is Steve Allen.

1865
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:55,120
He is wearing glasses.

1866
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:57,360
It is not him.

1867
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:03,520
He's having a nightmare about being having the same job he has, but seven decades earlier.

1868
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:09,440
And he is doing a classic talk show animal segment, right?

1869
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:11,840
Holding this adorable little puppy.

1870
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,680
And then he acts like the puppy bites him.

1871
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:15,680
And then he's like writhing in pain.

1872
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:16,880
He's like, oh, no.

1873
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,240
Then the TVs go off.

1874
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:26,400
In the room, there's sort of two big kind of like foggy glass panes.

1875
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:32,640
That I guess are maybe supposed to replicate, like you're in the backstage area behind a curtain

1876
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:35,440
and you can only see the silhouettes of what's happening.

1877
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:37,120
Well, you're in the control room.

1878
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:42,400
So you're like, you're looking out onto like, I guess maybe above the stage

1879
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:44,880
of where the filming is happening.

1880
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:53,840
You see a silhouette of a man writhing in pain and then it like morphs into a werewolf

1881
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:56,080
in like what feels like it's just a projection, right?

1882
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:56,960
Of like a shadow.

1883
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:04,080
And then the two doors open up and a guy jumps out wearing a late night talk show suit

1884
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:06,240
that is somewhat tattered with a werewolf head on.

1885
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:08,640
I see.

1886
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:09,360
Okay.

1887
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:15,440
Animal segment gone awry instead of normal comical animal peas or something.

1888
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:17,840
A werewolf scenario breaks out.

1889
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:24,160
But yeah, I agree that no part of this nightmare should be that he does his job from today,

1890
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:29,120
but in the fifties, because that was a time where functional alcoholism was celebrated.

1891
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:33,760
That's one of his greatest dreams, not his nightmares.

1892
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,960
If only he could time travel and work from then.

1893
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:40,480
But there was no Mario Kart back then.

1894
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:40,960
That's true.

1895
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:42,960
I don't think this room is scary.

1896
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:44,800
I don't think it's very effective.

1897
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:49,520
In a way, it's the least scary because you're just watching the shadow happen and you're like,

1898
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:51,120
well, the werewolf's going to jump out of there.

1899
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:53,680
It's only a question of when the doors open.

1900
01:43:54,880 --> 01:44:00,640
You know, but I'm going to have the time from the doors opening to prep me for the guy jumping out.

1901
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:04,720
But I did in this room go like, well, this is sort of maybe

1902
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:08,080
the thought experiment of how this thing should work,

1903
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:11,680
which is like a nightmare specific to being a talk show host.

1904
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:19,120
Should this not all be in sort of like a spookier version of 30 Rock?

1905
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:22,800
Is it not more interesting to make all of these spaces like fake

1906
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:26,320
behind the scenes TV shit where then spooky stuff happens?

1907
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:30,800
And I'm like, there's a little bit of like A to C I kind of like and like,

1908
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:35,760
what's the thing that a talk show host has to do that could go awry in a scary way?

1909
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:37,760
Well, you do animal segments.

1910
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:40,320
What if an animal segment backfired?

1911
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:42,320
Yeah, a chimp could rip your face off.

1912
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:46,080
But even still, I'm like, a puppy doesn't turn you into a werewolf.

1913
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:46,720
Right.

1914
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:48,880
Why is it not you yourself, Jimmy?

1915
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:50,800
Why is this in the 50s?

1916
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:53,840
What are all these weird over thought steps in between?

1917
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:59,120
Just like why does the why does a race through New York go to the moon?

1918
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:02,240
It's and then there's a tube that gets you back

1919
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:05,520
magically from the front of your of your Tonight Rider.

1920
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:08,720
No, there's like there's an overshoot of the premise.

1921
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:12,160
And then it doesn't have to be maybe maybe they would say,

1922
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:14,080
wasn't that inside baseball or something?

1923
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:18,080
But couldn't it be like people understand that like, I don't know, the lights caught on fire.

1924
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:23,680
It's the nightmare of Saturday night and Jason Ryman's acclaimed sound is fucked.

1925
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:25,920
The sound is fucked.

1926
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,840
The actors are getting into fistfights.

1927
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:29,600
All of these things definitely happened.

1928
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:33,840
My counterpoint to it being to inside baseball would be

1929
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:37,920
you're selling people an experience within 30 Rockefeller Plaza.

1930
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:42,720
And throughout the idea, like, do you think this is just an add on ticket

1931
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:45,120
cost to people who are already doing the tour?

1932
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:49,120
Which is a very popular like New York tourist attraction

1933
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:51,760
to go through the 30 Rock tour, which is excellent.

1934
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:55,200
Yeah, I imagine there's a lot of spillover between the two.

1935
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:58,640
In which case, don't you want something that's owning a little bit more like

1936
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:02,000
this is the most historic building in television history?

1937
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,280
Like, this is where you are.

1938
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:04,720
I just want to play for you guys quickly.

1939
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:07,440
Like, this is what you're seeing in the werewolf room,

1940
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:14,560
which is like as if you are behind him while he's doing the show, like right behind his desk.

1941
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:18,880
Seeing him in silhouette and you're seeing the TV screens, but you're seeing this

1942
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,480
and then it turns into a werewolf.

1943
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:25,520
And then, right, there's a long time of seeing the werewolf silhouette

1944
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:29,280
and the lights go out, a guy jumps out, end of room, quickly, quickly onto the next one.

1945
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:31,920
Yeah, so he's there.

1946
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:33,360
You know where he's going to be.

1947
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:37,280
But yeah, I'm totally with you that there's and also like with 30 Rock

1948
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:41,600
and with this being a famous tourist attraction in general, I mean, just like

1949
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:47,360
zombie pages, the pages all got zombified and there's dozens of them.

1950
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,320
Scott will get to that, but that was another thing where we were like,

1951
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:55,360
isn't this more fun if it's just Jimmy Fallon being like,

1952
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:59,120
you know, there's one television studio here at 30 Rock that they say is haunted.

1953
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:01,040
Nothing's filmed there in 70 years.

1954
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,960
Sure, or his studio is haunted.

1955
01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:06,000
Right.

1956
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,080
Like, do a Tower of Terror type thing where you're like something bad,

1957
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:15,600
make up a fictional story of something bad happened in studio like 27F.

1958
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:16,720
Right.

1959
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:23,760
Have the big Atlas statue, the big metal Atlas holding up the world come to life and like

1960
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:26,400
scare the poor, you know.

1961
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,080
And then it's like Megalopolis.

1962
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:28,320
Right.

1963
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:35,280
And then, yeah, it just it seems like Jimmy's to Nightmares

1964
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:38,800
are really based on a lot of horror movie tropes.

1965
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:40,080
Well, here's the next one.

1966
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:40,880
Maybe you should try

1967
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:44,480
Subsplutient Time Tea or Melatonin before bed

1968
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:49,440
instead of watching all these dank horror movies and having a bad work-life balance.

1969
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:54,640
The next one is, I'm standing outside an old gas station in the middle of nowhere.

1970
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:57,440
I have a really, really bad feeling about this place.

1971
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:02,240
They're becoming like vaguer and vaguer,

1972
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:05,520
less and less passionate every time.

1973
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:08,240
It's just like, what's a basic sort of horror setup?

1974
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:12,240
This also goes back to the things starting and seemingly his childhood bedroom,

1975
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:16,800
then moving to like the woods where you're being hunted by aliens.

1976
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:23,440
Then it's like hashtag the pandas biggest fans janitor basement,

1977
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:27,440
then the 50s version of a television studio.

1978
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:30,560
We're moving around so wildly where it's like,

1979
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:34,720
I think Jimmy Vaughn primarily lives in upstate New York, Westchester these days,

1980
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:37,040
like all millionaire celebrities,

1981
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:40,080
multimillionaire celebrities who quote unquote live in New York actually do.

1982
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:47,040
It's moving interchangeably between city stuff and rural stuff

1983
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:51,600
in a way that really deprives it of any identity.

1984
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:58,640
It gets specific to him a little and then as vague as could be.

1985
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:00,480
Right, because this is the vaguest shit I've ever seen,

1986
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:04,560
which is you enter the next room and it's just sort of like zombie movie gas station.

1987
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:07,280
It's sort of post apocalyptic.

1988
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:10,480
It feels like it would be in fallout or whatever.

1989
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:13,680
It's any sort of like run down rusty gas station,

1990
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:16,240
quote unquote in the middle of nowhere at night.

1991
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:20,800
And then there's like a dad and a daughter who both have like weird makeup.

1992
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:23,440
I don't even know how to describe it.

1993
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:25,840
They're not supposed to be zombies or creatures.

1994
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:30,720
They just both kind of have like spooky face paint and a little blood.

1995
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:34,240
And they're standing by the pumps with knives and they,

1996
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:36,400
I think this is Hagen's voice cameo.

1997
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:42,080
Did Jimmy like play last of us on like PS5 or PS4 recently?

1998
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:43,920
And he was just like, then we'll do a last of us.

1999
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:44,880
It's a last of us.

2000
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:46,000
And they're like, oh, I guess so.

2001
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:50,720
That's where when you are saying that you have heard that Jimmy would hold

2002
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:54,240
these writers from meetings at the end of work days.

2003
01:49:54,240 --> 01:49:57,920
I do believe he was there and was going like, come on guys, more ideas.

2004
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:02,000
But everything feels like a first draft idea of just like, I don't know.

2005
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,120
What's like a thing?

2006
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:04,160
Aliens are scary.

2007
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:05,520
I saw signs.

2008
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:07,840
What if aliens were in the woods, you know?

2009
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:16,720
Texas Chainsaw Massacre, rural scary nothing, you know?

2010
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:17,120
Yeah.

2011
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:22,400
Our tour guide on this one said something of like after his video intro played,

2012
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:24,000
she's like, you know what's really scary?

2013
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,680
Those rising gas prices.

2014
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:31,760
Like she made a kind of universal tram tour style joke off of it.

2015
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:34,080
And I was like, huh, I wonder if that's in our script.

2016
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:35,840
I wonder if she's having fun.

2017
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:39,040
Also in most of the other rooms that she's shepherding us through,

2018
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:42,720
she was saying things and you couldn't make them out because the audio was so loud.

2019
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:46,720
And I'm like, maybe there is funny interplay happening in the writing

2020
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:49,040
and we're missing it every other time.

2021
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:50,640
Right.

2022
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:51,120
Wow.

2023
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:53,760
I have a broader question for both of you.

2024
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:57,120
Were either of you at any point scared?

2025
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:05,120
There is one room where I actually felt like the scare actor kind of got me on timing.

2026
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:08,320
And I think I even turned to them and went, well done.

2027
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:11,840
Like involuntarily, I was like, whoop, you got me.

2028
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:13,040
Okay.

2029
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:13,360
All right.

2030
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:14,080
That's something.

2031
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:17,760
I think I had one of those too, where the timing lined up just right.

2032
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:23,360
For the most part, I was making, because again, these were small rooms.

2033
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:24,000
Small rooms.

2034
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:30,400
So I was making really like direct eye contact with an actor who was supposed to have scared me.

2035
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:33,680
And I didn't want to, I'm not like going to be a jerk about it.

2036
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:36,560
So I would just kind of be like, just to give them a little nod

2037
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:41,600
to sort of just be like, thanks for that.

2038
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:46,640
There was a lot of that kind of like you're making direct eye contact with someone in a very small

2039
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:52,000
room who has failed to scare you, who is now having to reset to a position three inches away

2040
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,680
from where they currently are.

2041
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:57,440
And you just kind of have to hold a look with them and say like, I see you.

2042
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,320
I acknowledge you.

2043
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:00,560
Thank you for your effort.

2044
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:01,040
Wow.

2045
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:02,640
We are performers too.

2046
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:03,440
We understand.

2047
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:05,360
We're cut from the same cloth.

2048
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:06,080
Keep at it.

2049
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:12,080
This is basically a jobs program for the New York improviser community.

2050
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:18,080
I'm glad you all have a nice month and a half of work, you know?

2051
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:23,360
Yeah, that sounds more stressful for me because I want to deliver for the performer.

2052
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:27,600
It's like when you're seeing close up magic and you're right on top of the

2053
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:31,200
performer and you want to like be like, oh, wow, look what you did.

2054
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:35,040
Like, I know that like, if you're not giving the person that it feels bad.

2055
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:37,360
So like, if you don't get scared, I would feel like shit.

2056
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:39,440
This absolutely had this energy.

2057
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:43,680
And I want to say, I thought every scare actor we came across was very committed,

2058
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:45,040
like did their job well.

2059
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:47,920
I think this is not the failing at all of any of the performers.

2060
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:51,120
I think this thing is like designed poorly.

2061
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:55,200
Like the Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon itself.

2062
01:52:55,760 --> 01:53:00,080
The individual efforts of all of the talented people working on the show

2063
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:04,000
are somehow held back by something, something at the very top.

2064
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:11,200
But yeah, it's like guy with a knife, woman with gas station handle.

2065
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:12,960
I mean, I'm just like watching this walkthrough,

2066
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:15,840
getting through the gas station room took less than 30 seconds.

2067
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:21,200
And I've now seen 15 straight seconds of the screen in the liminal space

2068
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:22,560
before the text comes up.

2069
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:28,880
Like the reset times are so much longer than the scare times.

2070
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:32,400
This one says there are creatures that look like they've been trapped for decades.

2071
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:33,840
I don't think they're human.

2072
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:38,640
Which we're just getting so vague now of like, what do you mean?

2073
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:42,960
I had a dream where there was a shadow.

2074
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:45,200
I was in a room and it wasn't fully lit.

2075
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:46,480
I couldn't see the whole room.

2076
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:47,680
Okay, that's all you need to know.

2077
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:48,180
Go.

2078
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:52,400
I genuinely don't even know how to explain this one.

2079
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:55,760
I think it's supposed to be a rundown subway station.

2080
01:53:57,600 --> 01:54:01,600
And then there are creatures with like full unmoving masks

2081
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:04,480
that look a little like Sam Raimi deadites.

2082
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:12,320
But it's just like strobe lights flashing and then them jumping out at you.

2083
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:13,540
Hmm.

2084
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:18,240
I wonder if there was any consideration of being able to re-theme this next year

2085
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:20,960
without the Jimmy Fallon IP.

2086
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:23,440
Quite possibly.

2087
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:23,920
I don't know.

2088
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:25,440
Maybe they're not thinking that forward.

2089
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:25,840
I don't know.

2090
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:29,840
I think this has to have meant to be a subway station.

2091
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:32,640
I don't know.

2092
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:37,200
A couple times I would like see something I want to stop and take a picture of for posterity.

2093
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:41,760
And I could feel how much I was stressing the tour guide out

2094
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:45,520
that I was creating like a five to ten second lag.

2095
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:48,560
Especially because I'm trying my hardest to make sure the flash

2096
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:50,800
is not going to go off and scare the actors.

2097
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:53,920
Scare the actors.

2098
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:55,920
Yeah, this is so funny.

2099
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,080
I don't think it's on purpose, but if it was,

2100
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:03,040
this is the twisted mind of Jimmy Fallon.

2101
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:08,800
If he created an inverse, a flippy of a haunted maze

2102
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:10,960
where instead of the actors scaring you,

2103
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:13,280
there's a bigger threat of you scaring the actors.

2104
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:19,600
Blinding the actors with a phone flash and they trip over their own feet and fall over.

2105
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:22,320
This is an interesting thing, though, because I don't go through these mazes

2106
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:25,200
and I usually get scared in a traditional way.

2107
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:27,840
I don't feel the feeling of guilt,

2108
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:32,480
which is something that this is really, this is really outblowing in a way.

2109
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,320
Oh, you need more of that.

2110
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:37,600
Yeah, Mike, you need more of that in your life.

2111
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:38,320
That's right.

2112
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:40,400
And that's what this maze would bring out of me.

2113
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:44,000
I don't want to speak for Ben, but I was feeling things walking through this.

2114
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,560
I was feeling guilt, shame, regret, embarrassment, my proxy.

2115
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:49,600
That's what good art does.

2116
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:53,280
It was conjuring emotional responses.

2117
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:58,960
The next text is rule number one of being in a cornfield.

2118
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:00,720
Get out of the cornfield.

2119
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:05,120
There's a killer scarecrow who will stop at nothing too, dot, dot, dot.

2120
01:56:05,120 --> 01:56:08,400
At this point, they're all relying really hard on these ellipses

2121
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:13,040
that feels like they just couldn't land the plane on what the statement was.

2122
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:17,600
Less of a cliffhanger and more like, I don't know.

2123
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:25,680
Well, filling something later, you know, I feel like you kind of liked this room.

2124
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:28,880
The cornfield.

2125
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:31,360
Yeah, I mean, it was it had a bunch of like

2126
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:37,520
like corn stalks hanging from the ceiling to sort of simulate

2127
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:40,160
the experience of running through a cornfield.

2128
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:45,760
This was the one time where I felt like I actually didn't see

2129
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:50,560
the the person who was going to jump out and scare me.

2130
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,880
Like I actually was a little surprised.

2131
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:59,200
The cornfield, it being so densely packed with corn stalks helped obscure them.

2132
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:02,960
But I also feel like this is one of the rooms where there are some dummies.

2133
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:05,360
So you're genuinely unnerved.

2134
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:09,600
You can't predict which one's going to move and jump out at you.

2135
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:11,440
I mean, this was a classic example.

2136
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:16,800
If like if we were able to explore this room a little bit on our own time,

2137
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:23,040
I think it would have been fun, but it was maybe 10 feet by 10 feet

2138
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:31,600
and delivered to us as another security checkpoint to get through LaGuardia Airport.

2139
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:37,840
Maybe this is reflective of being in Jimmy Fallon's brain

2140
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:40,960
and that in the way that you couldn't stop and focus on one thing,

2141
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:45,680
that's like how he can't focus on his show or the flippies or the books.

2142
01:57:45,680 --> 01:57:50,800
It is a race from one endeavor to the next and one cameo he said he'd do.

2143
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:54,160
And I said I'd be in this movie and I said I'd stop by today's show

2144
01:57:54,160 --> 01:58:01,120
and I said I'd make an appearance at my kid's play and there's no time to stop and enjoy any of it.

2145
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:11,040
Like outdoor rural space inside New York City room is kind of a fun vibe

2146
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:13,600
and felt like it was evoked fairly well.

2147
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:21,840
But also you're getting, I mean, you cannot get less specific than cornfield with scarecrows.

2148
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:27,200
Yeah, there's like no twist on this.

2149
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:32,640
Okay, next liminal space, the Jimmy text voiceover is

2150
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:36,240
there's a mad scientist turning people into mutants using gamma rays.

2151
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:39,280
That's it. That's the full.

2152
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:40,800
That's the setup.

2153
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:42,400
That's the full setup.

2154
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:47,680
And then you go into a room that has a kind of classical mad scientist character,

2155
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:50,800
wild wacky hair.

2156
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:53,840
Ben, I feel like you and I both agree that we like this performer.

2157
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:56,880
Yeah, he was really going for it.

2158
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:05,200
It also really just shading really a lot of yeah, big acting energy.

2159
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:10,400
Yeah, he's sort of like an evil Doc Brown and he had like a,

2160
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:13,040
you know, a lab coat with a radiation symbol on it.

2161
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:18,880
And yeah, despite the fact that he's all his dialogue is a pre-recorded track he's lip-syncing

2162
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:20,320
to he's doing a bunch of shit.

2163
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:22,240
He's pulling a bunch of levers.

2164
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:27,520
It feels like this is once again, the better way to use the smaller space they have

2165
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:32,000
is to like place you in a room and have narrative elements happen around you rather than

2166
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:37,440
walk through this room and have people jump out at you who cannot hide very well.

2167
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:42,160
So this is like he's doing his like mad scientist experiment and then he pulls some shit

2168
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:47,040
and then some like electrodes go off and then a guy jumps out with what I would describe

2169
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:49,520
as almost like John Carpenter, they live face.

2170
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:54,400
That's I guess their definition of mutant.

2171
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:55,440
He's wearing a suit.

2172
01:59:55,440 --> 02:00:00,640
He's got sort of like blue and red like kind of radioactive face paint and he's like,

2173
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:06,480
but there's sort of a lot of windup of the scientist doing this experiment

2174
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:08,240
and then this guy jumping out at you.

2175
02:00:08,240 --> 02:00:09,520
It's at least a little fun.

2176
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:18,160
Now, this character, the one who jumps out at you, his experiment was presented in Jimmy's nightly

2177
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:23,200
introducing new characters from tonightmares as quote unquote mutant Jimmy.

2178
02:00:27,200 --> 02:00:34,000
And he is wearing a Jimmy style suit much like the werewolf character who was not on their social

2179
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,120
media and on the show referred to as werewolf Jimmy.

2180
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:39,120
He was just referred to as the werewolf.

2181
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:44,400
But this character is supposed to apparently be Jimmy's nightmare of the scientists did this to

2182
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:51,360
him, which feels like another sort of branching like maybe there was one version of this where

2183
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:54,560
every scare room we're seeing is this happening to Jimmy.

2184
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:57,760
Maybe all of these are specific to Jimmy's experiences.

2185
02:00:57,760 --> 02:01:01,760
Like every room feels like it has a different take on what this is supposed to be.

2186
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:03,200
Right.

2187
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:05,040
Is the science relative to him?

2188
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:06,960
Does the scientist look like Lorne Michaels?

2189
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:09,360
Like Lorne's forced me to become this.

2190
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:11,440
Maybe like a great question.

2191
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:13,360
Like is that maybe where it's come?

2192
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:16,480
Whether he knows it or not is maybe that inspiration for this room.

2193
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:17,920
Possibly.

2194
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:18,480
Possibly.

2195
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:22,880
I think that's a little bit more of the kind of the take.

2196
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:27,920
I want the slant, the sort of point of view I'm looking for in this.

2197
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,400
The next room.

2198
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:31,840
Sorry.

2199
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:32,400
Oh, right.

2200
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:36,320
Okay, gentlemen, Jimmy's about to get a little topical.

2201
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:38,320
Oh, always.

2202
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:43,680
I know right now, up until this point, we've been dealing with sort of like abstract totemic scares,

2203
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:49,120
but Jimmy, he looked at the newspaper and he said, this is what's really terrifying.

2204
02:01:49,120 --> 02:01:51,440
What's happening today in our society.

2205
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:52,480
Oh, okay.

2206
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:52,880
Okay.

2207
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:57,680
And I quote, I'm in a giant warehouse where they're building humanoid robots and pumping

2208
02:01:57,680 --> 02:01:59,920
them full of artificial intelligence.

2209
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:00,640
Pumping them full of it.

2210
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:04,320
This is when we all stopped and started clapping before we even got in.

2211
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:05,840
Yeah.

2212
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:09,040
Ben's got a single Chris Pine tear rolling down his cheek.

2213
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:17,440
Yes, Scott, as you point out, pumping them full of artificial intelligence.

2214
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:18,880
Yeah, that's how it works.

2215
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:19,440
Yeah.

2216
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:21,520
AI is, yeah, it's like goo.

2217
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:22,080
Yeah.

2218
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:22,560
Yes.

2219
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:27,760
And then you're just in a kind of like lab-like room, you see there's a manager's office where

2220
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:33,280
the window is a video screen and you see blurry through the window, a robot seemingly attacking

2221
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:40,480
someone, and then there's sort of this longer corridor that is, how would you describe the

2222
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:41,040
robots?

2223
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:47,280
They kind of, they kind of look at the robots, they kind of look at the robots, they kind of

2224
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:57,440
I was going to say like that, but like crash test dummy.

2225
02:02:58,160 --> 02:02:59,280
You're probably, yes.

2226
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:04,800
They all have like identical jumpsuits and then rubber masks.

2227
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:13,840
And the rubber masks are a little creepy and this much like the scarecrow room is like,

2228
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:18,800
there are like eight of them, they're sort of like hanging like this, like they're in

2229
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:24,960
sort of like storage chambers, deactivated, and then two of them are going to jump out.

2230
02:03:25,680 --> 02:03:26,000
Okay.

2231
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:27,120
Okay.

2232
02:03:28,080 --> 02:03:35,520
And is it like, so do they look more like a lot, like do they look like robots?

2233
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:40,080
What you're describing doesn't look like a robot to me, it looks like a dummy, I guess.

2234
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:41,200
See if I can get a picture.

2235
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:46,800
I'd say they, yeah, I'd say even the humans that come to life look more like dummies.

2236
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:51,280
Okay, so yeah, it looks like somebody, like they've been enchanted by some magic or

2237
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:53,680
something versus an actual robot that's mechanical.

2238
02:03:54,560 --> 02:04:01,200
Yeah, yeah, I mean it feels like a, it does not feel like a very up-to-date

2239
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:06,480
perception of what an artificial intelligent, artificially intelligent robot would look like.

2240
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:07,040
Right.

2241
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:11,120
It looks a little bit more like something out of a 90s Disney Channel original movie.

2242
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:14,240
Kind of look like they were pumped full of AI.

2243
02:04:14,240 --> 02:04:16,640
It's the best way I could describe it.

2244
02:04:16,640 --> 02:04:18,560
Okay, now I understand it, now I get it.

2245
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,600
It's very clear now.

2246
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:20,080
Very clear.

2247
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:22,000
It's pouring out of their ears.

2248
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:31,520
Like some sort of bartending robot that's actually a human in a haptic feedback suit

2249
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:33,760
controlling it from another room.

2250
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:40,720
Jason's being topical now too with the recent Tesla unveiling of the Tesla unveiling robots,

2251
02:04:40,720 --> 02:04:41,360
the autonomous robots.

2252
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:43,760
This is what they look like if you can make it out.

2253
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:46,560
Oh wow, that's creepy actually.

2254
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:48,400
I don't mind the design, design something.

2255
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:53,360
I actually found them creepy and I feel like I, and I couldn't make it out because once

2256
02:04:53,360 --> 02:05:00,880
again this event is so loud, but I swear if I'm not mistaken, the one robot jumped out to me

2257
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:05,280
and I think genuinely responded by like, it didn't quite scare me, but I was like,

2258
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:06,400
ah, spooky robot.

2259
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:08,800
Like I said something like that.

2260
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:13,040
And I believe the scare actor said something in response to me.

2261
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:17,120
What it sounded like to me was we don't speak English.

2262
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:22,000
I'm not spooky, I'm a pump full of AI.

2263
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,440
What the hell are you getting about this?

2264
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:27,440
But it definitely sounded like a real voice coming from under the mask.

2265
02:05:28,160 --> 02:05:31,360
And they were fired for saying any words probably right after that.

2266
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:32,400
Yeah.

2267
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:38,400
Their scare is they sort of just act like they're malfunctioning.

2268
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:40,640
Like they just kind of shake a lot.

2269
02:05:41,680 --> 02:05:42,240
Right, right.

2270
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:47,760
But this is, I think you guys are sensing the repetition of the pattern.

2271
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:48,320
Yeah, yeah.

2272
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:49,600
Yeah.

2273
02:05:51,520 --> 02:06:00,720
The next closet space, the text voiceover is, I'm on stage with the world famous boy band

2274
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:01,680
Blood and Guts.

2275
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:03,200
Oh no.

2276
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:07,680
And they're hungry for dot, dot, dot blood and guts.

2277
02:06:08,240 --> 02:06:08,800
Okay.

2278
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:09,120
Okay.

2279
02:06:10,160 --> 02:06:15,120
Now I would describe Blood and Guts as looking like the kind of band Mike would like.

2280
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:20,400
If they opened D23, you're saying?

2281
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:32,240
Their name is spelled B-L-O-O-D-E-N-G-U-T-Z as one word.

2282
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:32,720
Okay.

2283
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:36,800
He says world famous boy band.

2284
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:38,400
So I'm like, oh, interesting.

2285
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:41,920
Is it going to be like spooky one direction?

2286
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:45,920
And then you get in there and they kind of just look like,

2287
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:48,000
Ben, how would you describe it?

2288
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,280
Like mutant slayer?

2289
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:55,040
Yeah, but like even kind of leaning more just generic punk.

2290
02:06:56,240 --> 02:06:58,720
They do not look like a boy band in any way.

2291
02:06:58,720 --> 02:06:59,520
No, right.

2292
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:00,800
That's not their vibe.

2293
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:01,440
This is the room.

2294
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:02,880
Walk into this room.

2295
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:05,920
This is the room when he went through with Prince Harry.

2296
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:10,720
The two actors after they left were like, that was Prince Harry.

2297
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:19,440
You were describing maybe that nights are dropping off and this thing has not been

2298
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:24,720
doing that great despite the fact that they made Prince Harry and Demi Lovato go through it.

2299
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:26,400
And they've plugged it on the Today Show.

2300
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:29,360
There's been on air promos every night.

2301
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:34,720
They have really done as much with that mechanism as they can to get there.

2302
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:36,640
They forced very famous people through this thing.

2303
02:07:38,720 --> 02:07:42,880
That set up of I'm on stage with world famous boy band Blood and Guts.

2304
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:46,800
I'm immediately I'm like, okay, this is getting a little more specific,

2305
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:50,880
descriptive after a couple rooms that are like, you know what's scary?

2306
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:51,920
Monsters.

2307
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:54,400
And you walk in and there's a monster and you're done with the room.

2308
02:07:55,040 --> 02:07:57,040
I'm like, okay, we're creating IP.

2309
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:58,640
Blood and Guts is a new thing.

2310
02:07:58,640 --> 02:07:59,920
Jimmy's on stage with them.

2311
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:05,040
This is a specific nightmare he has about hosting the Tonight Show and musical acts.

2312
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:07,200
And what if a musical act goes wrong?

2313
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:11,120
And then you get to this room and it just looks like the backstage area

2314
02:08:11,120 --> 02:08:13,120
of a mid-sized concert venue.

2315
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:18,240
There are like Blacklight concert posters that also sound like they were written by Mike

2316
02:08:18,240 --> 02:08:20,240
that just have words like rock on them.

2317
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:22,480
I like that.

2318
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:25,520
It's going to have enroll or else it's not Mike.

2319
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:27,360
Roll is his own poster.

2320
02:08:28,640 --> 02:08:28,880
Okay.

2321
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:33,360
Then they're just like a lot of like equipment crates and like amps.

2322
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:41,520
And then in the center of the room, there is like a dummy that looks like a dead person.

2323
02:08:42,080 --> 02:08:48,560
And there is like one guy on top of him with like a studded belt and a black vest,

2324
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:52,240
but no shirt underneath who is like chowing on his neck.

2325
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:56,640
So like John Stamos and Full House when he was in Jesse and the Rippers.

2326
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:00,960
A little, yeah, it's just kind of like generic.

2327
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:06,160
Like he looks more like a leather daddy, but then with some vaguely like zombified elements

2328
02:09:06,160 --> 02:09:10,320
and he's attacking this dummy that you're like, I'm pretty sure that's actually a dummy.

2329
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:11,440
It's not going to come to life.

2330
02:09:11,440 --> 02:09:14,960
And he's just eating this thing's neck from the time you walk into the room.

2331
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:18,480
And then once you get into the room, he turns around and sort of snaps at you,

2332
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:21,040
like bears his teeth at you.

2333
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:25,920
And then I think at some point a second band member comes out and also screams at you.

2334
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:28,320
But that's the entire room.

2335
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:32,080
This was one of the times where someone scared my back.

2336
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:38,560
So I didn't experience it, but I sensed that someone had popped up from behind me,

2337
02:09:39,120 --> 02:09:41,360
but it wasn't effective in any way.

2338
02:09:41,360 --> 02:09:45,360
Zombie, zombie Lou Pearlman jumped out behind you.

2339
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:49,600
Oh, that is scary.

2340
02:09:50,720 --> 02:09:54,800
Tremendous blind spots in this thing, considering how small the rooms are,

2341
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:58,960
where it really is like if you're looking two degrees in the wrong direction,

2342
02:09:58,960 --> 02:09:59,840
you miss the thing.

2343
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:02,880
Or if you're like a second behind, you miss the thing.

2344
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:08,720
It's got to be very precise as far as how they're loading people in and out.

2345
02:10:09,600 --> 02:10:09,920
Yes.

2346
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:17,920
And then this, I think this was the final one band or the final proper room.

2347
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:24,720
The text is I have a recurring nightmare where all the pages remove their human masks

2348
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:27,040
and they're actually bloodthirsty monsters.

2349
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:30,080
There it is.

2350
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:30,720
Okay.

2351
02:10:30,720 --> 02:10:31,120
All right.

2352
02:10:31,120 --> 02:10:32,480
We're thinking in tandem here.

2353
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:36,960
So we're getting back to sort of, oh, the specifics of his job,

2354
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:39,760
the in and outs of the days of working there.

2355
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:45,360
His greatest fear is that the lowest paid people he ever has to come across

2356
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:48,640
are actually trying to kill him.

2357
02:10:50,320 --> 02:10:52,000
They're the actual monsters.

2358
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:56,080
He has nothing but fear of an anger toward them.

2359
02:10:56,720 --> 02:10:59,520
And that's the only reason he refuses to learn their names

2360
02:11:00,160 --> 02:11:04,240
because he's worried that underneath they're actually bloodthirsty monsters

2361
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:08,720
or perhaps people who would speak on background to Rolling Stone reporters.

2362
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:17,040
It just feels like a wild punching down to end the thing on.

2363
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:23,440
And then there's like, yeah, what feels like a little bit of a like talk show set up,

2364
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:26,160
two couches on a room, mass on a wall.

2365
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:29,600
Your tour guide is like, quickly, we got to get out of here.

2366
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:35,200
And then the final stretch of this is just you walking through long curtain hallways.

2367
02:11:35,200 --> 02:11:39,440
It is basically being in the black lodge from Twin Peaks.

2368
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:40,800
That's what it feels like.

2369
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:42,000
The curtains are blue.

2370
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:42,560
Scary.

2371
02:11:43,200 --> 02:11:45,760
Nothing scary happens in the room.

2372
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:48,080
And the room is the smallest one of all.

2373
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:49,200
But then she's like, we got to get out.

2374
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:50,720
We're so close to the end.

2375
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:54,480
And then you walk down this hallway for what feels like maybe 20 seconds.

2376
02:11:54,480 --> 02:11:56,000
It's very narrow.

2377
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,320
And a lot of people jump out at you in the hallway.

2378
02:11:58,880 --> 02:11:59,280
Okay.

2379
02:12:00,160 --> 02:12:00,880
What's a lot?

2380
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:06,400
And I'd say in this hallway, there may be six people in alternation

2381
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:08,880
who are jumping out versus the two in every other room.

2382
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:09,440
Okay.

2383
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:10,400
That is, that's good.

2384
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:12,240
Okay.

2385
02:12:12,240 --> 02:12:16,640
And they just have kind of what feel like all leftover monster masks.

2386
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:20,960
It's not tied to the other stuff in the maze.

2387
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:22,560
Not really.

2388
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:23,520
I mean, I couldn't tell.

2389
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:24,640
It's happening so quickly.

2390
02:12:24,640 --> 02:12:26,960
And there is that feeling of like, come on, guys, we got to get out of here.

2391
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:32,480
The tour guide is really positioning this as, oh, right.

2392
02:12:32,480 --> 02:12:36,560
I think that's part of it is she went like, wait, this isn't part of it.

2393
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:37,600
It's supposed to be over.

2394
02:12:37,680 --> 02:12:41,840
They, at the very last second, do this thing of like, wait, this part isn't

2395
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:45,040
part of tonight, there's something's gone wrong.

2396
02:12:45,680 --> 02:12:49,040
You got to get out of this hallway as quickly as possible.

2397
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,320
And then it's just all these assorted monsters.

2398
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:56,240
But some of them might be reuses of other monster faces we've seen before.

2399
02:12:56,960 --> 02:13:01,440
Some of them might just be like, when you say the pages rip their faces off

2400
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:05,200
and reveal their bloodthirsty monsters, I'm like, okay, what's the take?

2401
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:06,320
You know?

2402
02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:09,360
What do they represent in the sort of annals of monsterdom?

2403
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:12,160
And it's just some different things.

2404
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:18,240
But then you get through this hallway and you walk out and you're back in

2405
02:13:18,240 --> 02:13:22,800
basically the same security clearance area we were in 10 minutes earlier,

2406
02:13:24,240 --> 02:13:26,000
where a guy just goes, hey, thank you.

2407
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:26,960
Survived to nightmares.

2408
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:28,160
Come over here for a picture.

2409
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:31,360
Uh huh.

2410
02:13:31,360 --> 02:13:32,000
Okay.

2411
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:33,280
Uh huh.

2412
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:34,160
Okay.

2413
02:13:34,160 --> 02:13:37,200
They make you take a picture with your entire group.

2414
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:40,720
So we were in a picture with a bunch of strangers and they're like, you guys,

2415
02:13:40,720 --> 02:13:43,120
please stay clear of the sign.

2416
02:13:43,120 --> 02:13:48,080
Make sure there's space for the sign and the photo so everyone can see where you are.

2417
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:48,400
I know where this is going.

2418
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:50,320
They're doing a lot of moving around the sign.

2419
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:52,080
Ben was right next to the sign.

2420
02:13:52,080 --> 02:13:55,280
They push Ben out to stand like three inches away from the sign.

2421
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:58,720
And then right when the guy takes the picture,

2422
02:13:58,720 --> 02:14:01,760
the trap door opens up and someone pops out of the sign and screams.

2423
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:03,920
Okay.

2424
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:04,240
Okay.

2425
02:14:04,240 --> 02:14:05,760
Everyone just really inch it over.

2426
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:06,080
Okay.

2427
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:08,400
You're not going to want to be anywhere near that.

2428
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:10,160
It's going to be a dangerous sign.

2429
02:14:10,160 --> 02:14:12,000
Actually could fall on you.

2430
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,800
It's really for your own safety and not because a guy's going to jump out.

2431
02:14:15,520 --> 02:14:16,320
And what is that?

2432
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:17,760
What does that performer look like?

2433
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:19,120
Great question.

2434
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:21,760
It was the, our guide.

2435
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:27,840
Oh, it was our guide, but done in monster form or were they even transformed?

2436
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:28,880
So there, I don't know.

2437
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:29,280
You're right.

2438
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:35,360
She does something where she's like, she's like, uh, you should probably get out of here

2439
02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:38,400
because I'm going to get you or something like that.

2440
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:42,160
So when you run out, we lose like, yeah.

2441
02:14:42,160 --> 02:14:43,120
More direct light.

2442
02:14:43,120 --> 02:14:43,520
You're right.

2443
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:44,800
It is our guide.

2444
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:48,080
I think we couldn't see it before because all the rooms are so darkly lit.

2445
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:54,000
She does have kind of a general like pale face, dark circles around eyes, spooky makeup.

2446
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:54,320
Yeah.

2447
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:55,920
But it is just the guide.

2448
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:56,640
Yeah.

2449
02:14:56,640 --> 02:15:00,800
But there's some kind of thing where she's not on her side anymore at the end.

2450
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:07,440
And then when we go to take a picture, it's like she, she reappears and she thankfully

2451
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:10,000
screamed right in my ear, which was great.

2452
02:15:10,720 --> 02:15:12,960
So we did get some screaming in the end.

2453
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:13,460
Okay.

2454
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:15,680
That's something.

2455
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:18,080
But that's, that's the end.

2456
02:15:18,080 --> 02:15:21,920
Then you're just out and there's like an iPad with a QR code.

2457
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:24,400
You can scan to get your photos on your phone.

2458
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:26,320
Okay.

2459
02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:27,600
Can I ask?

2460
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:30,880
So there's no quest love in the roots crew?

2461
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:32,320
Zero.

2462
02:15:33,680 --> 02:15:36,000
I would say not even anything that alludes to them.

2463
02:15:37,760 --> 02:15:38,480
Interesting.

2464
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:40,240
Yeah.

2465
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:46,000
I mean, look, unless maybe like some of the roots members did the voiceover for the pre-recorded

2466
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:51,120
tracks, but it's like, I recognize Higgins at the gas station, his voice, there's hashtag.

2467
02:15:51,120 --> 02:15:56,400
There's a tight pants Easter egg.

2468
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:56,880
Sure.

2469
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:59,040
There were a couple of Easter eggs like that.

2470
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:00,240
I'm trying to remember whatever it was.

2471
02:16:00,240 --> 02:16:03,360
I saw in the bedroom that I couldn't get a picture of, but this was the other part of

2472
02:16:03,360 --> 02:16:09,600
it is like, it did feel like there was a little dare I say it, pizza riso party room-esque

2473
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:13,760
theming where it's like, well, if you actually look at the walls, there's some fun details

2474
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:16,160
and they're Jimmy specifics of the show.

2475
02:16:16,160 --> 02:16:20,960
And every time I tried to stop to get a photo of one, I felt like I am fucking up this

2476
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:21,440
whole thing.

2477
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:25,520
So maybe you would have to go to the last one of the night.

2478
02:16:26,320 --> 02:16:30,080
If you could get in the last slot of the night, there would be no pressure.

2479
02:16:30,080 --> 02:16:31,280
No one would be behind you.

2480
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:36,000
And maybe we could, we could tell that real, the real hardcore details that the super fans

2481
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:36,320
might notice.

2482
02:16:36,320 --> 02:16:40,960
I'm sure the, the girl and her dad are represented somewhere in there.

2483
02:16:42,880 --> 02:16:43,520
Oh yeah.

2484
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:44,160
Okay.

2485
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:48,480
You know, but the last one of the night, there'd be the rush for everybody to go the fuck home.

2486
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:51,600
Come on.

2487
02:16:51,600 --> 02:16:51,920
Let's go.

2488
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:52,960
That's true.

2489
02:16:52,960 --> 02:16:56,000
We're really going to turn on you more than all the tour guys.

2490
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:56,800
You might get angry.

2491
02:16:56,800 --> 02:16:59,600
You get angrier screams or something that way.

2492
02:16:59,600 --> 02:17:04,960
People would be mad at you more frustration would come out in the performance.

2493
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:07,680
Is there a season pass option?

2494
02:17:10,480 --> 02:17:12,240
Like that's a great question.

2495
02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:13,840
Frequent fear pass.

2496
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:14,880
I think they call it.

2497
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:15,920
Yeah.

2498
02:17:15,920 --> 02:17:18,160
One of the places does that would be interesting.

2499
02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:22,800
I believe this ended up being about a $45 ticket per person.

2500
02:17:24,800 --> 02:17:30,000
I mean, I added the flex thing, but the flex thing is only I think six or $7 extra.

2501
02:17:30,640 --> 02:17:34,160
There's a service charge for both the ticket and the flex pass.

2502
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:38,880
I do not think the flex pass did anything for us.

2503
02:17:38,880 --> 02:17:43,040
There was at no point where it felt like, cause it gave, there were two different QR codes,

2504
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:45,760
one for the ticket and one for the flex pass.

2505
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:48,480
They never scanned the second one.

2506
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:53,120
What did this experience cost you per minute?

2507
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:56,080
Let's assume, assuming we'll take any cue.

2508
02:17:56,080 --> 02:18:00,320
Certainly there was entertainment value to being scanned TSA style and told,

2509
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:01,680
don't scare the monsters.

2510
02:18:02,240 --> 02:18:03,360
You're paying for that too.

2511
02:18:03,360 --> 02:18:06,320
But if we're going purely off of the 10 minutes of the maze,

2512
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:09,360
what does each minute of To Nightmares cost?

2513
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:11,840
Let me do a final tally here.

2514
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:12,160
Great.

2515
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:15,920
At 10 minutes and 30 seconds, do we round up to 11?

2516
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:17,520
Do we give them that generosity?

2517
02:18:21,360 --> 02:18:22,480
Let's be nice here.

2518
02:18:22,480 --> 02:18:23,440
Like Jimmy.

2519
02:18:23,440 --> 02:18:23,840
Okay.

2520
02:18:24,960 --> 02:18:25,520
Very nice.

2521
02:18:26,240 --> 02:18:27,360
The nicest.

2522
02:18:27,360 --> 02:18:28,320
So nice.

2523
02:18:28,320 --> 02:18:29,280
Midwest nice.

2524
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:29,520
Yeah.

2525
02:18:34,480 --> 02:18:36,320
We're all waiting with bated breath.

2526
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:40,960
I think it costs about $13.50 per minute.

2527
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:45,120
For three of us to do it as a group.

2528
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:45,280
Right.

2529
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:48,320
How does this compare to the going rates for like a phone sex line?

2530
02:18:53,520 --> 02:18:54,400
2024.

2531
02:18:56,320 --> 02:18:58,000
Yes, those in 2024.

2532
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:07,280
Well, Griffin and Ben, I did look up,

2533
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:14,480
I was trying to see if I could find any staffing notice or like backstage for performance.

2534
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:22,240
And the one job that came up a couple of times is a LinkedIn posting

2535
02:19:22,800 --> 02:19:28,880
for CCTV attendant for this attraction.

2536
02:19:30,400 --> 02:19:35,200
Your responsibilities are monitor activity,

2537
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:42,960
observe live CCTV feeds to identify any suspicious or unusual behavior among guests and staff,

2538
02:19:43,520 --> 02:19:49,520
collaborate with security, communicate effectively with onsite security,

2539
02:19:49,520 --> 02:19:55,200
providing detailed intelligence about any concerns or incidents.

2540
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:59,600
This is a $768 a week position.

2541
02:20:00,240 --> 02:20:04,240
That is a six day work week, 3.30 PM to midnight.

2542
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:11,840
So that is roughly $128 a shift.

2543
02:20:14,400 --> 02:20:18,960
I do think that sounds like a more fun experience than going through the attraction.

2544
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:22,480
Like you get a bird's eye view.

2545
02:20:22,480 --> 02:20:26,160
You get to look at a bunch of monitors that have each room in full rotation.

2546
02:20:26,960 --> 02:20:28,880
You're watching multiple groups go through.

2547
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:30,800
You get to see the actors reset.

2548
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:32,160
Appreciate the set design.

2549
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:32,800
Right, right, right.

2550
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:33,300
Yeah.

2551
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:33,800
Yeah.

2552
02:20:33,800 --> 02:20:36,640
You get paid versus paying for it.

2553
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:41,040
This is CCTV room security.

2554
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:45,600
It appears one guest is carrying pepper spray in one hand and a knife in another.

2555
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:47,920
Please investigate in the cornfield room.

2556
02:20:48,480 --> 02:20:49,680
They were both under his hat.

2557
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:50,960
We don't know how he got it through.

2558
02:20:54,720 --> 02:20:56,320
He was wearing a cat in the hat hat.

2559
02:20:58,160 --> 02:20:59,920
We should have made him check it more thoroughly.

2560
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:03,840
See, here's a pitch I throw out to Ben when we are walking out.

2561
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:04,340
Yeah.

2562
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:09,920
That if I get the idea of, oh, do a seasonal Halloween attraction

2563
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:13,680
in this empty retail space in this New York landmark, right?

2564
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:16,560
I get them wanting to make it co-branded in some way.

2565
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:22,720
We go to the gift shop, which is not connected to this, is back in main 30 Rock lobby

2566
02:21:22,720 --> 02:21:24,000
because I want to see what the merch is.

2567
02:21:24,560 --> 02:21:27,360
It's just the fucking lunchbox and the shirt.

2568
02:21:27,360 --> 02:21:30,160
You took a long walk to a gift shop.

2569
02:21:30,160 --> 02:21:31,520
It was not an exit through.

2570
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:32,480
It was a long walk.

2571
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:33,540
No, no, no.

2572
02:21:34,960 --> 02:21:38,080
And the shirt is just the main poster image,

2573
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:41,680
the painting of Jimmy awake in bed with all the monsters around him.

2574
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:44,560
And it's one of those graphic teas where the image is too large,

2575
02:21:45,920 --> 02:21:48,080
where you're like it takes up too much of the chest

2576
02:21:48,080 --> 02:21:51,520
and it also feels like it would actually be kind of rigid to wear.

2577
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:52,160
Oh, yeah.

2578
02:21:52,160 --> 02:21:53,200
I hate that feeling.

2579
02:21:53,200 --> 02:21:53,840
The worst.

2580
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:54,640
Yes.

2581
02:21:54,640 --> 02:21:56,160
So I was like, I can't buy this.

2582
02:21:56,160 --> 02:21:57,280
I'll never wear this.

2583
02:21:57,280 --> 02:21:58,880
I'd only wear it on the zoom.

2584
02:21:58,880 --> 02:22:00,320
It looks uncomfortable.

2585
02:22:00,320 --> 02:22:03,440
All the employees, like especially the security checkpoints and stuff,

2586
02:22:03,440 --> 02:22:07,200
we're wearing these polos that just said to nightmares on them

2587
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:09,600
that I thought were kind of fun.

2588
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:11,200
And I was like, I could wear this.

2589
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:12,240
I will buy this.

2590
02:22:12,240 --> 02:22:14,320
Okay, you get that if you get the job.

2591
02:22:14,320 --> 02:22:17,120
That's why I do the modern job.

2592
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:17,620
Yes.

2593
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:23,360
But we're walking around the gift shop and I'm like,

2594
02:22:23,360 --> 02:22:24,720
where's the to nightmare section?

2595
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:26,320
How can there not be to nightmare stuff?

2596
02:22:26,320 --> 02:22:29,360
And to nightmare is just a little corner of the larger Jimmy section.

2597
02:22:29,360 --> 02:22:32,320
But the rest of this gift shop is Saturday Night Live

2598
02:22:32,320 --> 02:22:35,840
and it's the office and it's law and order SVU

2599
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:37,840
and it's whatever the Kelly Clarkson show.

2600
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:42,320
And I just go like, hey, just like bad pitch.

2601
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:46,960
Isn't the better idea to do like 30 shock?

2602
02:22:48,080 --> 02:22:49,840
30 shock of Feller Plaza.

2603
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:55,440
Do like a synergistic New York scare room thing.

2604
02:22:55,440 --> 02:22:58,800
But it's like across the NBC portfolio.

2605
02:22:58,800 --> 02:23:00,880
And you have a David S. Pumpkins room.

2606
02:23:00,880 --> 02:23:04,480
You let Jimmy conceptualize one room.

2607
02:23:04,480 --> 02:23:05,040
Yes.

2608
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:07,680
You do some haunted today's show.

2609
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:10,080
Oh my God, Al Roker, the weather's so bad.

2610
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:10,880
It's scary.

2611
02:23:10,880 --> 02:23:11,840
Blood rain, whatever.

2612
02:23:12,560 --> 02:23:14,560
You do like fucking 10 rooms.

2613
02:23:14,560 --> 02:23:17,360
You do haunted Dunder Mifflin, whatever the fuck it is.

2614
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:18,560
That's good.

2615
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:21,920
Isn't that more appealing to people?

2616
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:24,080
Don't you think that gets more people through the door?

2617
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:26,080
Yeah, broader.

2618
02:23:26,080 --> 02:23:27,200
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

2619
02:23:28,080 --> 02:23:29,280
Zach Levi is here.

2620
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:30,640
He wants to revive Chuck.

2621
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:35,760
Matt Lauer is trying to get into his old office.

2622
02:23:36,560 --> 02:23:37,600
You're stuck.

2623
02:23:37,600 --> 02:23:38,560
You don't have the button.

2624
02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:39,600
You can't open the door.

2625
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:43,200
There's no, it's a buttonless button room.

2626
02:23:44,080 --> 02:23:49,280
I think your scenario, Griffin, is more people would do it

2627
02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:51,920
and then be able to remember a single detail

2628
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:54,880
to tell their friends about that.

2629
02:23:54,880 --> 02:23:58,080
At the very least, you're doing it.

2630
02:23:58,080 --> 02:23:58,880
You go home and you go.

2631
02:23:58,880 --> 02:24:00,080
There was an Al Roker room.

2632
02:24:00,080 --> 02:24:00,800
There was a this.

2633
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:01,520
There was a that.

2634
02:24:02,080 --> 02:24:03,920
And you're appealing to different audiences.

2635
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:05,040
You're making a big tent.

2636
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:07,520
I mean, the people who are right in front of us in line

2637
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:09,600
when we were at the final security checkpoint.

2638
02:24:10,480 --> 02:24:12,000
I look like a husband and wife.

2639
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:16,000
And the guy I asked the woman,

2640
02:24:16,720 --> 02:24:18,960
so does he do this like every year?

2641
02:24:24,240 --> 02:24:27,520
And like lending credence to Ben's analysis,

2642
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:29,120
it just feels like everyone who was there was like,

2643
02:24:29,120 --> 02:24:30,880
I don't totally know why I'm here.

2644
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:33,840
I don't quite get what this is.

2645
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:36,400
You know, people seem to look side.

2646
02:24:36,400 --> 02:24:39,920
Maybe this is just the best scare option within Manhattan.

2647
02:24:40,320 --> 02:24:44,480
I mean, there's not a lot of competition, right?

2648
02:24:44,480 --> 02:24:46,240
To see Jimmy's nightmares.

2649
02:24:46,240 --> 02:24:49,680
Like it didn't feel like and then the experience itself

2650
02:24:49,680 --> 02:24:51,360
doesn't really make anything out of that.

2651
02:24:52,240 --> 02:24:52,560
Right.

2652
02:24:53,360 --> 02:24:57,120
Look, this used to be the studio for the Steve Wilco show

2653
02:24:57,120 --> 02:24:58,320
and we just build a bunch.

2654
02:24:59,600 --> 02:25:02,400
We just build a bunch of tiny rooms to fill it.

2655
02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:08,480
Yeah, I mean, it sounds like it's maybe not going

2656
02:25:08,480 --> 02:25:10,080
so well for them this year.

2657
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:11,520
I don't think it is.

2658
02:25:12,880 --> 02:25:14,160
Yeah, you saw it on the ground.

2659
02:25:14,160 --> 02:25:15,680
You didn't get good vibes.

2660
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:18,400
What we're hearing about shutting down days and everything.

2661
02:25:18,960 --> 02:25:19,600
Yeah.

2662
02:25:19,600 --> 02:25:22,960
Could this be the end of the road?

2663
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:25,120
I don't sense a lot of power jockeying,

2664
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:27,920
unlike the Tonight Show to try to take over to nightmares.

2665
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:32,320
Well, yeah, they should have had more rooms faster.

2666
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:38,400
Because then it starts to get scary, right?

2667
02:25:38,400 --> 02:25:41,600
If you're like, it's like fucking 20 rooms.

2668
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:42,880
It's like, there's a werewolf.

2669
02:25:42,880 --> 02:25:45,440
I keep going, you know, then it's like overload.

2670
02:25:45,440 --> 02:25:47,360
You kind of get scared from that.

2671
02:25:47,360 --> 02:25:48,080
Right.

2672
02:25:48,080 --> 02:25:49,600
I say triple the rooms.

2673
02:25:50,320 --> 02:25:50,880
Yeah.

2674
02:25:50,880 --> 02:25:51,120
Yeah.

2675
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:51,360
Great.

2676
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:52,240
That seems about right.

2677
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:53,120
That's a good speed.

2678
02:25:53,120 --> 02:25:56,000
I'll say this triple the rooms or just one big room

2679
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:56,960
that you're in the whole time.

2680
02:25:58,080 --> 02:26:01,040
And then have everyone just do their thing at the same time.

2681
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:01,680
Right.

2682
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:03,200
So then it's in intelligible.

2683
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:05,040
You have no idea what's going on.

2684
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:05,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2685
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:08,320
But that exploratory feeling.

2686
02:26:08,320 --> 02:26:11,520
Yes, yes, which maybe is close to the Jimmy Fallon experience.

2687
02:26:13,920 --> 02:26:15,280
Being pushed to the brink.

2688
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:18,400
Did you have other general thoughts, Ben?

2689
02:26:18,400 --> 02:26:22,240
I'm trying to remember some of our unwinding after.

2690
02:26:23,520 --> 02:26:24,640
Yeah, well,

2691
02:26:24,880 --> 02:26:27,360
I think we were just, I think we covered a lot of it.

2692
02:26:27,360 --> 02:26:28,960
We were, I mean, it was just this thing of.

2693
02:26:30,720 --> 02:26:41,440
It was never clear exactly how we related to the experience as the audience.

2694
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:43,040
There was no stakes to it.

2695
02:26:43,920 --> 02:26:50,000
It was just kind of like being given a tour rather than for the experience.

2696
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:50,400
Yeah.

2697
02:26:50,400 --> 02:26:57,120
Kind of like being given a tour rather than feeling like you were immersed in anything.

2698
02:26:58,080 --> 02:26:58,400
Right.

2699
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:02,640
And like they wanted you out as quickly as possible.

2700
02:27:02,640 --> 02:27:03,280
Yes.

2701
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:06,320
Why did you have us here into the nightmares?

2702
02:27:06,320 --> 02:27:06,800
Yes.

2703
02:27:06,800 --> 02:27:08,960
Rushes through there.

2704
02:27:08,960 --> 02:27:13,840
There is a little bit of that feeling of like wanting to be everything for everyone

2705
02:27:13,840 --> 02:27:19,440
needing to like broaden the tent and be so accessible to an extent that it ends up being

2706
02:27:20,240 --> 02:27:20,880
nothingness.

2707
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:28,240
Where we walked out, texted one of our friends who previously worked on The Tonight Show.

2708
02:27:29,440 --> 02:27:30,480
They said, how was it?

2709
02:27:30,480 --> 02:27:31,440
I said, bad.

2710
02:27:32,480 --> 02:27:35,120
And they responded, it wasn't funny at all.

2711
02:27:36,560 --> 02:27:42,000
And I realized they didn't mean like, were you having fun laughing at it?

2712
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:45,120
They were like, were there any successful jokes in it?

2713
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:46,640
Mm-hmm.

2714
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:50,080
And I was like, this thing is not trying to be funny.

2715
02:27:50,080 --> 02:27:56,400
The only part of it that felt like a joke was the gas price crack that the tour guide made.

2716
02:27:57,680 --> 02:27:59,440
And for the first moment, I was like, oh, right.

2717
02:27:59,440 --> 02:28:01,520
This thing could have tried to be funny.

2718
02:28:02,720 --> 02:28:03,120
Right.

2719
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:08,240
In the absence of being terrifying, it could have like, if this thing was the exact same experience

2720
02:28:08,240 --> 02:28:12,960
it was, but it had jokes in every room, I'd be like, well, it's kind of a thing.

2721
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:17,040
You've never been to like a funny haunted maze before to this extent.

2722
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:17,920
Right.

2723
02:28:17,920 --> 02:28:18,400
That's true.

2724
02:28:19,440 --> 02:28:20,560
No, I didn't even think about it.

2725
02:28:20,560 --> 02:28:25,440
I, I, I don't, I mean, it's not, maybe it's because I haven't

2726
02:28:25,440 --> 02:28:29,840
thought of Jimmy Fallon and funny in the same thought lately.

2727
02:28:30,480 --> 02:28:32,000
Not that I've never not thought that.

2728
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:35,040
I'm just saying I didn't realize that even when you were talking about it.

2729
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:36,480
That's not a thought I had.

2730
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:37,760
I didn't say we're out of the jokes.

2731
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:41,440
It's because he's such a good, he's such a good singer.

2732
02:28:41,440 --> 02:28:44,640
You think of him as a cool singer, so much more than.

2733
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:47,360
I think of him as number one, nice.

2734
02:28:47,360 --> 02:28:48,480
Number two, singer.

2735
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:50,000
Number three, cool.

2736
02:28:50,960 --> 02:28:52,240
Number four, entrepreneur.

2737
02:28:52,880 --> 02:28:56,800
The more I send out cover time, great at games.

2738
02:28:56,800 --> 02:28:57,920
Game master.

2739
02:28:57,920 --> 02:28:59,520
Reinventor of glasses.

2740
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:00,400
There were no games.

2741
02:29:00,400 --> 02:29:02,000
We thought glasses could be.

2742
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:02,640
No games.

2743
02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:03,520
No glasses.

2744
02:29:03,520 --> 02:29:03,760
No games.

2745
02:29:03,760 --> 02:29:04,960
There were no games.

2746
02:29:04,960 --> 02:29:06,880
There was no breaking room.

2747
02:29:06,880 --> 02:29:10,240
Like we're like the scare actors just couldn't stop laughing.

2748
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:11,920
Oh, yeah.

2749
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:12,400
Oh, yeah.

2750
02:29:12,400 --> 02:29:13,840
A break that you can't stop.

2751
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:17,440
A break that never ends is a Fallon nightmare.

2752
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:19,520
There's so many he does.

2753
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:24,880
There are a lot that you could tap into legitimately and in a snarky way.

2754
02:29:26,080 --> 02:29:29,040
One of the rooms being a big ring that you get inside

2755
02:29:29,040 --> 02:29:32,240
that keeps tightening and tightening and tightening on you as a group.

2756
02:29:34,240 --> 02:29:39,360
There's one room that's just all wall to wall freshly coiffed presidential candidates.

2757
02:29:40,960 --> 02:29:41,760
So many.

2758
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:42,880
Which do I scruff?

2759
02:29:43,520 --> 02:29:44,480
Don't touch them.

2760
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:49,360
Don't murder your ratings.

2761
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:56,080
The floor could all be hair and you have to walk this narrow pathway to avoid touching the hair.

2762
02:29:58,400 --> 02:30:01,200
You can't touch the hair, so you have to be very careful.

2763
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:03,360
Your ratings go down every time.

2764
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:08,480
And they're like, you see the ratings on the wall and if like you nudge it, it ticks down.

2765
02:30:09,440 --> 02:30:13,280
And you get in Colbert's and you're hearing echoes of Colbert.

2766
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:17,040
Ooh, relevance taking on the powers that be.

2767
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:19,040
What if he's reelected?

2768
02:30:19,840 --> 02:30:22,320
And there's still like kind of this thought in the thought in the

2769
02:30:22,320 --> 02:30:25,120
that they could represent this somehow that like there's still a thought that like

2770
02:30:25,120 --> 02:30:27,120
Jay is still out there to take the show back.

2771
02:30:28,960 --> 02:30:32,480
You could have a jump scared Jay in every room and it would work.

2772
02:30:32,480 --> 02:30:33,360
It would be effective.

2773
02:30:34,320 --> 02:30:37,520
It could be good shape, good numbers on garage.

2774
02:30:38,800 --> 02:30:40,240
Weirdly better than yours.

2775
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:43,520
You do it on antenna TV.

2776
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:49,600
Jay has the files to prove that he would still draw more in the ratings.

2777
02:30:50,160 --> 02:30:52,080
He's still been doing the research like he used to.

2778
02:30:52,880 --> 02:31:00,240
You do have to think that in the blue sky face that there were some self-aware ideas

2779
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:01,840
and they're like, don't pitch that.

2780
02:31:01,920 --> 02:31:06,800
You're going to be it's going to be a shit show if you make that like don't bother.

2781
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:08,560
Well, that's right.

2782
02:31:08,560 --> 02:31:13,440
We're saying like, you know, couldn't they have bothered to try to make this thing funny?

2783
02:31:13,440 --> 02:31:19,200
You think about every night Fallon pulling aside a very qualified writer's room

2784
02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:23,600
of incredible comedians and saying, hey, would you mind staying another hour

2785
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:29,520
to pitch on my haunted house and not encouraging them to come up with comedic ideas?

2786
02:31:30,480 --> 02:31:31,200
Mm hmm.

2787
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:37,760
Like, I don't begrudge what anyone on his writing staff contributed to this event

2788
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:39,920
because this is not part of their job.

2789
02:31:39,920 --> 02:31:41,680
They should have never been asked to do this.

2790
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:46,000
I question if they were paid extra to work on this.

2791
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,880
And if I were in the same position as them, I'd be like, I don't know.

2792
02:31:48,880 --> 02:31:49,840
Fuck it's scarecrows.

2793
02:31:52,880 --> 02:31:54,800
Jimmy's kind of leaning away from like funny.

2794
02:31:54,800 --> 02:31:58,480
He's kind of going for more just like, yeah, I think he just wants to scare people.

2795
02:31:58,560 --> 02:32:02,400
So let's just kind of like next pass less funny, less funny.

2796
02:32:03,360 --> 02:32:08,160
But like to Jason's point, you know, maybe they did start out with funny ideas

2797
02:32:08,160 --> 02:32:13,600
and they just kept being like overanalyzed to the point where it just became like nothingness.

2798
02:32:15,280 --> 02:32:19,840
Look, we got shipped a bunch of masks and set dressing that they're not using

2799
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:21,680
at Horror Nights Orlando.

2800
02:32:21,680 --> 02:32:23,520
And we have to work around that.

2801
02:32:23,520 --> 02:32:30,000
So start coming up with ideas for Werewolf, Corn Maze, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2802
02:32:32,320 --> 02:32:33,600
Boy, boy, bizarre.

2803
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:34,800
Where does this leave you, Ben?

2804
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:37,120
You not knowing the genre at all.

2805
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:44,320
And I don't feel like being the sense that I get in broad strokes is that Griffin turns to us

2806
02:32:44,320 --> 02:32:50,240
and it turned to us initially because he does not really get to talk about theme parks on the show.

2807
02:32:50,240 --> 02:32:52,720
There's not really a blank check interest in theme park.

2808
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:54,320
So where does this leave you?

2809
02:32:54,320 --> 02:32:56,720
Are you just like, this is all stinks.

2810
02:32:57,440 --> 02:33:00,480
Is this the worst possible entry point for you?

2811
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:08,480
Well, it's been a while since I've engaged with any kind of theme park related stuff, I will say.

2812
02:33:08,480 --> 02:33:17,440
So yes, I definitely didn't feel like excited necessarily to want to try and engage with more.

2813
02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:22,480
But I'm not dissuade totally.

2814
02:33:22,480 --> 02:33:28,720
I know that this was a cheap attempt at a cash grab and that it was fucking bad.

2815
02:33:28,720 --> 02:33:35,040
So or or a tax write off of the cash grab doesn't work.

2816
02:33:37,840 --> 02:33:38,800
Very smart.

2817
02:33:38,800 --> 02:33:40,480
There's two sides to every coin.

2818
02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:49,680
We did a Six Flags Great Adventure New Jersey trip and episode, I guess, about five years ago now.

2819
02:33:49,680 --> 02:33:52,560
Yeah, to do all the Batman rides.

2820
02:33:53,840 --> 02:33:58,800
And Ben being a Jersey boy has history with that Six Flags.

2821
02:33:58,800 --> 02:33:59,200
I do.

2822
02:34:00,480 --> 02:34:05,200
But you know, that is a certain level of theming that stops at a very specific point.

2823
02:34:06,560 --> 02:34:09,440
And I know you've spoken very lovingly of Gatorland.

2824
02:34:10,400 --> 02:34:10,880
Oh, yeah.

2825
02:34:10,880 --> 02:34:13,600
Oh, are you familiar with Gatorland in Florida?

2826
02:34:13,600 --> 02:34:14,160
Never been.

2827
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:17,520
Whoa, you're a Gatorland guy.

2828
02:34:18,480 --> 02:34:19,600
Privately owned.

2829
02:34:21,920 --> 02:34:25,920
I wouldn't say it's well maintained.

2830
02:34:26,960 --> 02:34:33,360
But it's it's basically just a really trashy roadside amusement park where you can see

2831
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:40,000
Floridians put their head inside of an old titer alligator's head or mouth rather.

2832
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:42,320
But I loved going.

2833
02:34:42,320 --> 02:34:44,480
It was near where my grandparents lived.

2834
02:34:45,440 --> 02:34:48,640
And I haven't been back since.

2835
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:53,920
But yeah, I'm a big proponent of that institution.

2836
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:57,360
Oh, and well, well, now we know if that is the bar.

2837
02:34:57,360 --> 02:34:58,640
I mean, yeah, yeah.

2838
02:34:58,640 --> 02:35:03,120
Jimmy Fallon's To Nightmares is never going to get anywhere close to a place with live gators.

2839
02:35:03,120 --> 02:35:06,080
Like that place is actually genuinely scary.

2840
02:35:06,080 --> 02:35:12,800
Like, yeah, you could potentially fall into a pit of gators and be in alive.

2841
02:35:14,960 --> 02:35:17,360
Well, that's them.

2842
02:35:17,360 --> 02:35:17,920
OK, OK.

2843
02:35:17,920 --> 02:35:22,720
Well, hey, future episode to bookmark, then potentially Gatorland with Ben Hosley.

2844
02:35:23,680 --> 02:35:29,280
But I guess for now, Fallon has failed to meet the Gatorland standards.

2845
02:35:30,080 --> 02:35:33,120
But I'm so happy we got to hear about it from you guys.

2846
02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:36,800
Griffin Newman and Ben Hosley, you survived haunt cast The Fright.

2847
02:35:37,520 --> 02:35:38,240
What a pleasure.

2848
02:35:38,240 --> 02:35:42,560
Really great to have have the both of you and get a little extra blank check flavor.

2849
02:35:42,560 --> 02:35:45,440
And I hope you don't have any regrets having not only.

2850
02:35:46,080 --> 02:35:46,400
All right.

2851
02:35:46,400 --> 02:35:49,920
So do an unpleasant thing for 10 minutes and then talk about it for over two hours

2852
02:35:53,520 --> 02:35:54,560
on zoom.

2853
02:35:54,560 --> 02:35:56,000
Oh, OK.

2854
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:01,120
But here's what I'm going to do is I will say let's exit through the crypt shop,

2855
02:36:01,120 --> 02:36:03,360
which is oddly disconnected from the main.

2856
02:36:03,360 --> 02:36:06,960
I will let you say anything that you want to say about blank check or anything else

2857
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:09,920
while I go to the door and see if this present is.

2858
02:36:09,920 --> 02:36:10,560
Oh, yeah.

2859
02:36:10,560 --> 02:36:13,200
I will say let's exit through the gift shop or the crypt shop.

2860
02:36:13,200 --> 02:36:14,800
Is there anything you two would like to plug?

2861
02:36:17,680 --> 02:36:20,720
Yeah, listen to blank check if you don't already.

2862
02:36:21,760 --> 02:36:24,480
I sell clothes.

2863
02:36:25,200 --> 02:36:27,920
I have a brand Griffin's wearing one of the shirts of mine.

2864
02:36:28,480 --> 02:36:30,320
It's a pair of my buried jeans.

2865
02:36:30,320 --> 02:36:35,120
I did, in fact, buried jeans in the ground and I'm now selling them for one thousand dollars.

2866
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:36,080
You can go to my website.

2867
02:36:36,160 --> 02:36:41,440
Also, yeah, much more affordably selling shirts with pictures of the buried jeans.

2868
02:36:41,440 --> 02:36:41,920
Yeah.

2869
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:43,440
So you don't have to get the real thing.

2870
02:36:43,440 --> 02:36:45,280
You can get a shirt that has a picture of them.

2871
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:50,800
You can get all of that stuff and plenty more at congratulations.

2872
02:36:50,800 --> 02:36:54,320
That's why you lations dot com.

2873
02:36:55,520 --> 02:36:55,840
Nice.

2874
02:36:57,120 --> 02:36:57,360
Yeah.

2875
02:36:57,360 --> 02:37:01,680
The blank check we're doing David Lynch is taking us through the rest of the year

2876
02:37:02,720 --> 02:37:04,800
covering his movies and Twin Peaks.

2877
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:11,920
Uh, our Patreon blank check special features where we do kind of bonus stuff.

2878
02:37:11,920 --> 02:37:15,840
Earlier this year, we did a Terminator 2 3D episode,

2879
02:37:16,400 --> 02:37:21,200
which was me trying to get Ben and David to understand the majesty of what I believe

2880
02:37:21,200 --> 02:37:27,200
I referred to on my podcast, the right episode with you guys about that same attraction as

2881
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:28,880
my favorite movie of all time.

2882
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:31,760
They did not get it.

2883
02:37:32,400 --> 02:37:34,000
It was a kind of heard it.

2884
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,960
I know I felt it not being appreciated whatsoever.

2885
02:37:36,960 --> 02:37:37,600
Right.

2886
02:37:37,600 --> 02:37:40,400
There's the PTR episode where all four of us are like, yes, we agree.

2887
02:37:40,400 --> 02:37:41,600
High water mark.

2888
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:44,720
And then that episode is just Ben and David being like, what the fuck is this?

2889
02:37:44,720 --> 02:37:45,600
What am I watching?

2890
02:37:47,120 --> 02:37:49,520
This woman is really there in the room.

2891
02:37:49,520 --> 02:37:50,960
That's on a screen.

2892
02:37:50,960 --> 02:37:51,680
The original Megapolis.

2893
02:37:51,680 --> 02:37:53,440
You had to be there.

2894
02:37:53,440 --> 02:37:54,640
Yeah, exactly.

2895
02:37:55,440 --> 02:37:56,480
You had to be there.

2896
02:37:57,360 --> 02:38:03,760
And not to tip our hand too much, but there is another PTR blank check

2897
02:38:03,760 --> 02:38:08,560
crossover episode that I have pitched to you guys for next year

2898
02:38:09,840 --> 02:38:14,560
that would perhaps put to the test even more so Ben and David's

2899
02:38:14,560 --> 02:38:17,920
tolerance of hearing people describe rides they've never been on.

2900
02:38:19,040 --> 02:38:19,840
Oh, right.

2901
02:38:19,840 --> 02:38:21,200
Oh, now I remember it.

2902
02:38:21,200 --> 02:38:22,640
Yes, I do like this idea.

2903
02:38:23,360 --> 02:38:24,160
I'm excited to.

2904
02:38:24,880 --> 02:38:26,320
They don't know Ben doesn't know this bit.

2905
02:38:26,320 --> 02:38:26,880
They don't know.

2906
02:38:26,880 --> 02:38:27,360
They don't know.

2907
02:38:27,360 --> 02:38:30,080
It wouldn't be until it'd be a little while off.

2908
02:38:30,400 --> 02:38:34,160
But some point in 2025, you maybe can see that coming.

2909
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:40,080
Griffin, do you want to plug the Wandering Planet Kickstarter too?

2910
02:38:40,080 --> 02:38:43,280
Yeah, I think they are fully funded now, right?

2911
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:46,480
They are, but I think they're still, I don't know, if they get enough money,

2912
02:38:46,480 --> 02:38:48,800
they can add more stuff, I think, you know.

2913
02:38:48,800 --> 02:38:50,320
I mean, look, what do I want?

2914
02:38:50,320 --> 02:38:51,440
I want Buster Keaton.

2915
02:38:51,440 --> 02:38:56,240
I want Fatty R. Buckle with double-jointed elbows and knees, interchangeable parts.

2916
02:38:56,240 --> 02:38:58,880
I want add-on tiers to be able to put them in.

2917
02:38:58,880 --> 02:39:02,240
There's sort of a baking ephemera.

2918
02:39:05,440 --> 02:39:08,960
I guess Laurel and Hardy were piano movers, right?

2919
02:39:08,960 --> 02:39:13,040
That feels like a glaring hole to not have a piano available as a tier.

2920
02:39:13,040 --> 02:39:13,280
Right.

2921
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,640
Frankenstein, you want a Frankenstein.

2922
02:39:16,640 --> 02:39:18,640
Well, that's Abbott and Costello.

2923
02:39:18,640 --> 02:39:19,520
Oh, shit.

2924
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:23,040
Well, Mr. Old Movie.

2925
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:27,680
Well, as we started talking about Laurel and Hardy,

2926
02:39:27,680 --> 02:39:30,400
I think I've spent more time watching the trailer

2927
02:39:31,040 --> 02:39:36,240
for the Steve Coogan, John C. Reilly biopic.

2928
02:39:36,240 --> 02:39:36,880
Oh, yeah.

2929
02:39:36,880 --> 02:39:37,380
Yes.

2930
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:41,280
Than I have actually watched Laurel and Hardy.

2931
02:39:42,160 --> 02:39:47,040
Also, they have, Jason, they've made, I have a Frankenstein figure on the shelf over here too.

2932
02:39:47,040 --> 02:39:47,520
Oh, sure.

2933
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:51,680
I don't know how quickly you guys are looking to turn around this episode,

2934
02:39:51,680 --> 02:39:55,120
but at the time of this recording, there are four days left

2935
02:39:55,680 --> 02:40:00,240
in the Laurel and Hardy collectible action figure one 12 scale campaign.

2936
02:40:01,360 --> 02:40:07,360
They have raised $87,000 out of a $40,000 goal.

2937
02:40:07,360 --> 02:40:08,720
They've more than doubled.

2938
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:11,680
And how many, I'm always intrigued by this.

2939
02:40:11,680 --> 02:40:16,160
The number of backers is like always going to be lower than you think for that amount of money.

2940
02:40:16,160 --> 02:40:17,680
It's like there's 300 backers.

2941
02:40:17,680 --> 02:40:18,800
802 backers.

2942
02:40:18,800 --> 02:40:21,280
800 backers that want these toys.

2943
02:40:21,360 --> 02:40:23,280
$87,000, yeah.

2944
02:40:23,280 --> 02:40:23,780
Right.

2945
02:40:24,560 --> 02:40:27,360
I feel like maybe Ben is putting it together that whenever

2946
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:36,560
Griffin is talking about things that you and David don't want to hear about, he's doing it with us.

2947
02:40:37,200 --> 02:40:37,700
Right.

2948
02:40:38,320 --> 02:40:39,840
I am making that connection.

2949
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:44,880
We hear the receptacle for the unwanted interest.

2950
02:40:44,960 --> 02:40:45,460
Yep.

2951
02:40:46,560 --> 02:40:52,640
And then the deeper inception tier of Mike and I's solo text thread for something you guys don't want.

2952
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:55,360
There's solo pits too.

2953
02:40:56,400 --> 02:40:56,800
Okay.

2954
02:40:56,800 --> 02:41:00,800
Well, let me pull this up and let's see what we got.

2955
02:41:02,080 --> 02:41:03,760
This is a fake out.

2956
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:06,720
This is another box that I had because that is not here.

2957
02:41:07,920 --> 02:41:09,120
It was a prop box.

2958
02:41:09,520 --> 02:41:15,360
A letdown maybe much like Jimmy Fallon's to nightmares.

2959
02:41:15,360 --> 02:41:20,960
So I will have to amend and post to social media whatever this present is.

2960
02:41:20,960 --> 02:41:26,000
I have my guesses as to the content of it.

2961
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:34,080
I mean, my biggest guess is are there Kingo products developed specifically for newborns?

2962
02:41:34,800 --> 02:41:36,880
But I don't know the answer to that.

2963
02:41:36,880 --> 02:41:38,480
It's an interesting line of thinking.

2964
02:41:38,480 --> 02:41:44,720
And I think you might still be a little surprised by the reality of what you're receiving.

2965
02:41:45,280 --> 02:41:45,840
Oh, boy.

2966
02:41:45,840 --> 02:41:46,320
Oh, boy.

2967
02:41:46,320 --> 02:41:50,640
Well, I'm sorry we can't do it on air, but I thank you for it anyway.

2968
02:41:50,640 --> 02:41:53,200
We'll update the audience with that.

2969
02:41:53,200 --> 02:41:56,960
But thank you both for taking so much time and going to that thing.

2970
02:41:57,520 --> 02:42:03,680
And hopefully we can all do something together not on Zoom for podcast or for fun.

2971
02:42:04,480 --> 02:42:08,800
As for us, for three boonest episodes every month, check out Podcast the Ride the Cemetery Gate

2972
02:42:08,800 --> 02:42:13,200
or get one more boonest episode on our RIP tier Crypt 3.

2973
02:42:13,200 --> 02:42:16,400
You will find all of that at patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

2974
02:42:17,280 --> 02:42:22,000
Also, I just want to say follow us on social media and don't just follow us,

2975
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:27,760
but go in there, get in the comments and have a long drawn out debate about whether or not

2976
02:42:27,760 --> 02:42:29,040
Griffin is good.

2977
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:31,840
I think we love to see it.

2978
02:42:32,560 --> 02:42:34,480
And it's about consistency.

2979
02:42:34,480 --> 02:42:38,480
And that's why we want to see it on every single episode.

2980
02:42:38,480 --> 02:42:39,200
And we do.

2981
02:42:39,200 --> 02:42:43,040
But I'm saying just keep it up because eventually we're going to figure it out.

2982
02:42:43,920 --> 02:42:49,840
I think there's a debate I even prefer witnessing, which is arguing with people

2983
02:42:49,840 --> 02:42:53,120
who say that I am good, that they can't possibly feel that.

2984
02:42:54,720 --> 02:42:57,760
That they're wrong about their assertion that you're good.

2985
02:42:57,760 --> 02:42:59,840
I don't believe you mean that for real.

2986
02:43:02,240 --> 02:43:05,360
It's always a great argument.

2987
02:43:05,360 --> 02:43:08,560
So get in there, hash it out, hashtag it out.

2988
02:43:08,560 --> 02:43:09,600
Hashtag it out.

2989
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:11,040
Hashtag it out.

2990
02:43:11,040 --> 02:43:14,640
And we'll have a grand old discourse.
