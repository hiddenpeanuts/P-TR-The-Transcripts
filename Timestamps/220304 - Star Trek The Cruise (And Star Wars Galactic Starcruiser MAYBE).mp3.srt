1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,240
Warning, the following podcast may be a testament to the hard work and imagination of those

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,420
who dared to dream of a one-of-a-kind adventure.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,700
To take one of the most beloved science fiction universes and bring it to life with an unprecedented

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,920
amount of detail and heart.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,920
This week, the world's eyes are on central Florida as we celebrate the incredible journey

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:50,680
the cruise on podcast the ride.

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,880

Hopefully that'll be that's like really like my he ha name.

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,480
Maybe like oh, we Mike Carlson.

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,880
Oh, we finally got it.

19
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,160
Months after the country bear.

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,480
Yeah, chamber week.

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,160
You got your folksy sound to go with your intros.

22
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,280
Oh, we and we Jason Sheridan as well.

23
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,280
Hi.

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,520
Is that a reference to is that a song?

25
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,280
This was a sea cruise.

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,480
The song by Frankie Ford.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Is this is this the song where I was I think I was trying to determine with Aaron

28
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,600
who the artist of this was, and I really confidently said, yeah, it's Solomon George.

29
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,280
And then she looked it up and like, no, there's no such person as that.

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,800
I was like oddly confident about.

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,000
I think I was you were thinking about what Solomon.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,080
What's his last name?

33
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,040
There's a different guy.

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,840
You passed away in the last decade.

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,080
Solomon Burke.

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,640
I was combining Solomon Burke with George.

37
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,560
Who is no one and nothing.

38
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,600
And then she starts Googling.

39
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,840
I'm like, come on, who is it?

40
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,240
What is it?

41
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,240
Who is he?

42
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,000
I said, yeah, who is he?

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,120
And then she's like, there's no such person as this.

44
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,120
Anyway, that's the song.

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
That's the song. Sea Cruise.

46
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,920
But today we're talking about star cruises because you've been paying attention

47
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,280
to theme park Twitter.

48
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,120
You have probably noticed that suddenly we're kind of off theme parks at the moment.

49
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,720
And everyone is talking about immersive star cruise experiences.

50
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,040
And I think we know why.

51
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,560
It's because of what's happening this week.

52
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,960
And that is, of course, Star Trek, the cruise.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,960
Of course. Yeah.

54
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:54,560
One of the big pop culture properties is out taking the immersing people

55
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,040
in one of their favorite worlds and going on some incredible adventures.

56
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,120
And we're finally going to talk about it.

57
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,200
Yeah. I mean, we've been getting tweets about it.

58
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,360
People are texting me. I'm a little confused.

59
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,480
Sometimes they seem to have like the property wrong.

60
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,560
They're saying maybe they're wrong.

61
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
They don't say Star Trek.

62
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,400
They say a different thing.

63
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,960
But they are asking me what I think about it.

64
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,160
And I'm like, man, everybody's talking about the Star Trek cruise

65
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,120
that is just coming into port now as we do this episode.

66
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,120
You know, yeah, that's I mean, we and you know, I don't I don't want to be like,

67
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,440
just go over basics and things that people know.

68
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,040
But obviously, Star Trek, the cruise is a themed cruise experience

69
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,760
that is out right now.

70
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,120
It's actually going to arrive, I believe, tomorrow.

71
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,880
Tomorrow, I got back into it comes back into port.

72
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,240
It left last Saturday, February 26th,

73
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,720
returns probably tomorrow.

74
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,280
You're hearing this, I think, on March 5th.

75
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,360
And that's when it returns to Port Canaveral, left out of the not far from the Orlando area.

76
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,400
So, again, you know, people have probably been seeing social media about it.

77
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,720
But this for sure is the big star cruise experience in the Orlando, Florida area.

78
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,560
And we've been wanting to cover it for a while.

79
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,760
And this seemed like the week to do it when Star Trek, the cruise five is out.

80
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,600
Yeah. And you know, this time next year,

81
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,400
it's got its inaugural voyage from Los Angeles.

82
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,040
They're switching coasts. Yeah.

83
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
I mean, it's really exciting.

84
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,760
I know people have also been asking, like, when is the star cruise experience

85
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,600
going to make it over to the West Coast?

86
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,800
And the answer is, well, refreshingly soon.

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,480
It's next year. It will be making it to L.A.

88
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,680
The website is out already.

89
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,120
They've announced some of the stuff for twenty twenty three.

90
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,280
We're trying to determine, you know, what's what's in store for twenty

91
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,800
twenty three for Star Trek, the cruise six.

92
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,680
And by the way, if you want to follow along with any of this

93
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,080
and just, you know, see some of the visuals that we're talking about,

94
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,480
please, of course, go to Star Trek, the cruise dot com.

95
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,280
And that might kind of help you, you know, because visually,

96
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,240
that's so much of what you want to out of that.

97
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,840
Like, you know, you can hear about it in ours as an audio medium.

98
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,880
But I think just going to the website tells you so much.

99
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,320
So where you see all the revelry and the partying and and and Klingons

100
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,680
hanging out with Ferengi on the deck.

101
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,480
And you just feel that fan enthusiasm, you know?

102
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,040
Yeah. And JT Waters, the cruise director, leading, you know,

103
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,240
all of the various events that are going on.

104
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,800
It seems like JT is doing a great job.

105
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,240
JT Waters is the star of this show, as far as I'm concerned.

106
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,560
If you look at the Star Trek Cruise website, JT is everywhere.

107
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,240
He seems like a great guy.

108
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,280
He seems like you're like ambassador for fun, I would say.

109
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,280
What JT Waters has done in terms of revolution revolutionizing

110
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,960
the star cruise experience, moving it forward, taking this this genre

111
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,840
that is growing into new directions.

112
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,560
You got it. You got to really credit JT.

113
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,680
We like to highlight individual kind of kind of pioneers,

114
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,840
be it a Tony Baxter or a JT Waters.

115
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,200
Yeah, that's true.

116
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,440
So so, yeah, people are probably now full disclosure, like we actually have not

117
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,800
like a lot of things on the show.

118
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,440
We have not gone on this cruise,

119
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,400
but we've done a lot of looking into YouTube videos,

120
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,800
looking at Star Trek Cruises past,

121
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,720
looking at the different things they've done over the years

122
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,480
and seeing where they're headed in the future. So yeah.

123
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,200
Yeah, absolutely. Well, and we were good.

124
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,640
We would have done 2021.

125
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,040
That was going to be the year.

126
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,320
But of course, you know, all the stuff happened and we didn't get to do it.

127
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,760
You know, there was there were a lot of virtual experiences,

128
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,000
you know, God bless them.

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,240
Yeah, I tried and they they made it feel like Star Trek, the cruise on land.

130
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,000
But there's only so much you can do. Yeah.

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,720
And I think is like, you know, there's a lot of like media

132
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,480
gets invited to Star Trek, the cruise, but we were we weren't

133
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,680
led into that exclusive club.

134
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,560
Yeah. Yeah.

135
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,400
Yet. I mean, maybe next year.

136
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,560
Yeah, no, I'm saying I would love to do it maybe next year.

137
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,840
I'm just saying. So like that's why if you're wondering, like,

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,400
oh, you're mad that these guys don't like didn't get to go.

139
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,680
It was because we weren't invited.

140
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,600
We didn't get a free trip to the Star Trek cruise

141
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,680
because we would have loved to go and sampled all this stuff.

142
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,920
Yeah, of course.

143
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,160
And, you know, and, you know, we'll see if that impacts our review,

144
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,200
if we can be objective and kind of judge it on its own merits.

145
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,880
Or did like, I don't know.

146
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,120
I mean, I almost feel like if we got if we'd been invited to it

147
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,600
and gotten to do it all for free, these things that should cost thousands of dollars,

148
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,320
we might be more apt to just praise it completely.

149
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,600
But you might get like a more even handed review of the star cruise

150
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,400
from us because because we weren't invited.

151
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,520
So, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

152
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,080
So so, yeah, we're giving you the sort of the outsider's perspective right now.

153
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,840
Yeah. But I think, you know, you know, us, we've covered things

154
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,680
that we weren't even alive when they were open.

155
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,200
And that's true. Yeah.

156
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,320
So I think we, you know, we've done our research, we've done our homework.

157
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,160
I think we can delve into this thing.

158
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,960
So we've got a lot to get through in terms of Star Trek, the cruise.

159
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,240
It's an interesting time, I feel like, for Star Trek, the cruise,

160
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,160
because there are other, as I said, I think this genre is getting more popular

161
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,360
and there is this other star cruise that's based on a property

162
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,360
that I know a little bit about a little bit of time to touch on it.

163
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,400
And we'll try to get to it if we can.

164
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,880
OK. But you guys, I mean, you guys came across that.

165
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,720
I is this the what is it?

166
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,480
It's the thing that it's the thing that Disney bought.

167
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,920
And sometimes they treat it like it's a burden that they have these six old movies.

168
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,040
Star Wars, Star Wars. Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

169
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,880
It's the other I always get them mixed up there.

170
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,240
But yeah, the other star thing and which is OK.

171
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,360
So just to keep it straight,

172
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,560
CBS Consumer Products is responsible for Star Trek, the cruise.

173
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,800
But the Walt Disney Company is responsible for the Star Wars.

174
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,160
Star Wars Galactic Star Cruiser. Is that right?

175
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,520
I'm looking that. Yeah, I know you're right.

176
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,960
That's the name of the thing.

177
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,520
But the the I guess we should say the the cruise itself is

178
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,000
is a simulation of many things.

179
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's not just a simulation of like the the world of those movies.

180
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,440
It's simulates not actual crews.

181
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,840
Yeah, that's an interesting thing about it.

182
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,680
And again, so, you know, as we said, like the crazy time for Star Trek, the cruise,

183
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,560
you've got you've got challengers coming in.

184
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,600
It's like this Star Wars thing is like the mad TV to the SNL.

185
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,800
Like the established star crews that's out there.

186
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,000
And I think it is an odd choice to not.

187
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,480
It's almost like mad TV wasn't live and you're missing that component.

188
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,000
That's exciting about SNL.

189
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,840
And similarly, it's not a crew. You don't go anywhere.

190
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,000
So that's a as opposed to Star Trek, the cruise,

191
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,160
which goes different places every year.

192
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,800
But this this year starts in Port Canaveral.

193
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,800
You go to Nassau, you go to St. Thomas, you go to St.

194
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,960
Martin, so you're covering the whole Caribbean Sea.

195
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,560
And now where do you go in the Star Trek?

196
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,480
You see, here's the thing. You don't really go.

197
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,000
Well, you go. Hmm. How to say this.

198
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,520
So it's it's sort of backstage at Disney's Hollywood Studios.

199
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,960
Like you got like you you were you were in a hotel.

200
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,640
It's kind of a whole like the theater of the mind.

201
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,320
Yeah, it's it's that that immersive theater, immersive theater.

202
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,200
Right. And so like you do get an excursion day.

203
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,760
Hmm. Do you think there was a chance in like you might

204
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,920
you might know more about this?

205
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,520
Yeah. When Scott Trowbridge, I mean, I'm not saying Scott Trowbridge

206
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,360
stole the idea of the whole house.

207
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,640
That's what Mike certainly is.

208
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,080
I hope it's from the Star Trek cruise.

209
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,000
But maybe he certainly was influenced.

210
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,400
Well, I got to who's scheduled first.

211
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,240
You know, who who picked this March?

212
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,240
You picked February in March.

213
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,600
Yeah, we picked that first.

214
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,760
I mean, that's the yeah.

215
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,800
Look, that's our trip.

216
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,960
The cruise has been seemingly it's been I guess.

217
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,320
I don't know when they left in 2017, but for the last few years

218
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,920
and next year, that's their territories.

219
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,600
Late February, early March.

220
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,960
So like how does all of a sudden this Star Wars cruise thing?

221
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,360
Yeah. Happened exactly like to steal the thunder.

222
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,160
It's some weird kind of wag the dogs that like, what if we create a distraction

223
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,000
over here and try to get people to not talk about the others?

224
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,000
But it's not working.

225
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,520
We're talking about right.

226
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,440
Star Trek, the cruise. Yeah, no, it's it's look, you know, sometimes,

227
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,560
you know, we love Disney sometimes, and sometimes we think Disney's up to no good.

228
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,360
And I'll be honest, I'll say it.

229
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,400
I think that Disney was just trying to steal the thunder of the Star Trek

230
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,440
cruise, the annual Star Trek cruise.

231
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,720
They saw the opportunity here to usurp the whole stat of the whole big

232
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,640
anybody who's a fan of fiction in the stars.

233
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,360
They're now going to be looking over at Disney,

234
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,960
and they're not going to be looking at JT, right?

235
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,520
That's a guy's name. JT Waters. JT Waters.

236
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,720
Thank you. Waters.

237
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,640
They're not going to be looking at any waters because the thing doesn't go.

238
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,880
That's I think is something that's weird to me and Jason again,

239
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,120
you seem to know more about it.

240
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,600
It's so it's like it's a simulation of space, but it's obviously that it doesn't

241
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,560
go to space because nothing goes to space yet unless you're close.

242
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,480
Well, you know, when is William Shatner? Right.

243
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,760
There you go. From Star Trek. That's right.

244
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So that franchise represented in actual space.

245
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,960
Blue Origin goes to space. Yes. Yeah.

246
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:23,200
So but so it's a so this is a cruise that is meant to evoke the stars and a cruise,

247
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,840
but it doesn't go to sea or space.

248
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:33,000
No, it it goes like a quarter mile to the back entrance,

249
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,080
special back entrance of Disney's Hollywood Studios into the.

250
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,920
So like it connects to the thing that's already that's been there for a while.

251
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,760
Yeah, but there's like

252
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,680
missions you get

253
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,600
I know they gave everyone iPhones when they checked in.

254
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,720
Sure. Yeah. And cables and chargers.

255
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,040
OK, to do that data pad that's built into the Disney Play app.

256
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,320
Apparently, the Disney Play also works, but I think they were trying to get.

257
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,800
OK, let me ask you this. Yeah.

258
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,920
How fast when you're in the Star Wars Hotel,

259
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,040
how fast can you get a martini in your hand?

260
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,720
Well, it there there's a bar.

261
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,960
Right. So I've seen some pictures of that. Yeah.

262
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,760
Yeah. But you've got like a martini as you're entering.

263
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,960
No, right. I don't know.

264
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,040
I think there's little things you have to do when you enter.

265
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,160
I think there's a muster.

266
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,320
What? Like what is a muster?

267
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,680
Well, that's when like the whole gang has to like the captain has to address every.

268
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,880
OK, how do you know that?

269
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,360
Free, you know, you know, at least a thousand more words than I do.

270
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,360
I mean, too, I that was that was in some of the limited media.

271
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,000
Well, there's a muster, too.

272
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,920
I saw the muster of the Star Trek cruise this year was George Takei

273
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,440
greeting everybody sort of in the circle, like main part of the ship.

274
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,120
And he was wanted to make sure everybody had a great cruise.

275
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,320
This is well, we talked about Grandpa Muster for a while, a couple of weeks ago.

276
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,600
Is that what you do with this?

277
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,920
That's not. Oh, that was not silly.

278
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,000
It's not be silly.

279
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,240
Oh, that being said, you could see a scenario where

280
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,040
Al Lewis was using the name Grandpa Muster to get around copyright issues

281
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,480
with Universal.

282
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,800
It's me, Grandpa Muster.

283
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,000
Grandpa Muster.

284
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,600
You got to add a little more. Sorry.

285
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,760
All right. Grandpa Mustard.

286
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,360
Hey, did everyone see the video that's been going around

287
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,360
that people have sent to us where Grandpa Muster and who was it?

288
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,400
The other poor not. Yeah.

289
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,200
Al O'Grover, I believe from like Screw magazine.

290
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,760
Yeah. Yeah. Al Goldstein.

291
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,000
I believe that's right.

292
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,360
Yeah. Yeah.

293
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,240
Grandpa Munster is yelling at us to not put them on pedestals.

294
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,360
I know I always put the creator of Screw magazine on pedestal for one thing.

295
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,840
Well, yeah, him we have.

296
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,320
But we literally did put Al Lewis on that.

297
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,600
Now, if I'd known we were going against his wishes,

298
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,000
maybe we wouldn't have done a whole episode about him and his restaurant.

299
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,280
But I feel like that was guaranteed to happen

300
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,720
because we cover what is big and relevant and people are talking about.

301
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,200
And that's grandpa and that's Star Trek, the cruise. Exactly.

302
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,280
So you were saying, all right, so there's a muster.

303
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,360
I saw a video that you do get handed some like grapefruit colored drink,

304
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,840
but I bet not alcoholic.

305
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,880
I bet. Yeah. I don't think they're just passing out.

306
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,440
It's it's more. Yeah. I mean, look, this is also the thing.

307
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,280
Like the Star Wars stuff is a little more all ages

308
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,880
as far as the Star Trek.

309
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,680
So so I understand there's there's limitations to that,

310
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,880
because Star Trek is a little more of a party, a little more of a.

311
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,000
It's really a party.

312
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,640
And I got to say, one of my main takeaways from the Star Trek cruise,

313
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,640
not just compared to this Star Wars on land cruise experience,

314
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,040
Star Trek crew seems much hornier,

315
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,680
much more than a lot of entertainment.

316
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,880
I think you are 100 percent correct.

317
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,320
If you see just any YouTube video of a bunch of group of people

318
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,680
or a group of people on, you know, in one of the parties or on the decks,

319
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,880
everyone, there's an energy to the videos.

320
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,600
Oh, that's all I'll say. I'll keep it clean.

321
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,800
There's an energy that is definitely lacking from the Star Wars Hotel.

322
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,720
It's kind of a like a maybe a divorcee energy,

323
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,040
maybe a swinger energy.

324
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,640
Could be that both of those energies are swingers and big time nerds,

325
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,680
which folks, I was a big time nerd growing up.

326
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,440
When you give them an opportunity to cut loose. Yeah.

327
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:34,440
I mean, yeah, batten down the hatches and band, band kid, theater kid energy.

328
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,080
Dangerous, dangerous, which yeah, is power is city is almost worse than like

329
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,080
football player corny energy in a way because it's like 10 times worse.

330
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,040
So pent up. It's released less often.

331
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,040
It's pent up and it's overthought.

332
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,120
So imagine this combination.

333
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,360
So imagine that energy.

334
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,760
It hasn't been it hasn't been expressed anywhere in 40 years.

335
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,800
And a person boards the Star Trek cruise and they see fucking Will Wheaton

336
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,840
in his street clothes and they go absolutely nuts.

337
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,880
That's the that's the energy you're getting when you watch these videos.

338
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,400
Or the other thing, the sense that I got about the Star Wars thing

339
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,440
is that it's pretty rigid and there's a ton to do.

340
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,120
Right. You barely have a minute to breathe like you get on this trajectory.

341
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,520
So I mean, it's not lacking in activities.

342
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,000
There's a lot to do.

343
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,120
But I'd say it looks like a ton of activities on Star Trek, the cruise.

344
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,200
Yes. And activities that are a little looser in their

345
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,800
in their definition structure.

346
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,320
Exactly. So, you know, like maybe you fit in a little bit of,

347
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,280
you know, let's just say canoodling.

348
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,360
Let's let's leave the language a little lighter.

349
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,720
It seems like if you hook up at the Star Wars hotel

350
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,400
that you're going to miss big chunks of narrative.

351
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,480
It feels like if all of a sudden you like me, if there's singles on the on the

352
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,200
at the hotel or at the Star Trek bar, excuse me, Star Wars bar,

353
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,000
and you go off somewhere, you're going to miss.

354
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,440
You're not even going to understand what's going on once you come back.

355
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,720
Yeah. I mean, there's not a lot of opportunity for naps, seemingly.

356
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,000
I did see which is of a concern.

357
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,400
Well, you know, that's a little joke about me.

358
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,360
But when you're on vacation, nice nap goes a long way.

359
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,480
It brings you back to life, you know, and especially on on cruises and stuff

360
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,520
that that sun, that sea air can be a little draining.

361
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,640
So you might need a nap because that's true.

362
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,600
You know, the one of the benefits of being on a cruise

363
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,360
while some stuff is scheduled for you, a lot of them have 24 hour room service.

364
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,080
A lot of places, you know, open 24 hours a day. Right.

365
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,200
That's true. Yeah. Are you a cruise guy? Can I ask?

366
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,200
Well, you know, I went on one cruise when I was like 12 with my family.

367
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,040
Big thing that stuck out in my mind is as soon as we boarded the ship,

368
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,520
I noticed my middle school computer teacher and her husband were also on this cruise.

369
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,760
And we would occasionally run into each other and just go, Hi, how are you?

370
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,760
Hi, how are you? That was very weird.

371
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,800
I mean, it's already weird enough running into your teacher at the mall,

372
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,800
let alone on a Norwegian cruise line missile.

373
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,120
Oh, your computer teacher, like typing teacher.

374
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,800
Like, yeah, sixth grade typing and, you know, here's how to use

375
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,760
the Microsoft Word program.

376
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,880
Were you was it like she was like acting different?

377
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,200
Was she acting any different or was like, no, she was always pretty reserved.

378
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,480
And she was she seemed like she was having fun.

379
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,320
But she wasn't she wasn't cutting loose.

380
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,640
And again, I was 12 years old.

381
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,720
So while I was the appropriate age where I was allowed to wander the cruise ship alone,

382
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,680
I think I hit the cutoff.

383
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,120
I think 12 you're allowed to like there was a little thing on your name tag

384
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,280
or your lanyard or whatever.

385
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,000
But you had to keep that on.

386
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,720
There was something, yeah, the kids had to keep on.

387
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,520
I think the same.

388
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,240
That's the line with Star Trek.

389
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,880
The cruise is you got to be 13 at least.

390
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,320
And 13 to 18 have got to be with adult with a shepherd.

391
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,160
Yeah. Yeah. Whereas the Star Wars thing is all ages.

392
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,760
And seems like maybe like maybe even more geared to kids as we were saying.

393
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,680
Yeah. Do we know on the Star Wars Hotel, can you be like two 12 year olds alone?

394
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,920
I don't think so. Right.

395
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,840
That's a lot. Yeah.

396
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,360
It is. You think it is a lot. Yeah.

397
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,920
OK. There's a lot of really typical rules.

398
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,360
They seem to have paired it off as like probably two adults in a room

399
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,920
or three adults in one child, which is an odd or three children.

400
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,320
Three and what scenario are there?

401
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,240
I guess maybe if you're going with like a grandparent or an uncle or aunt

402
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,160
or a stepparent is going with the biological parents.

403
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,360
But that seems like a strange and wants to sleep out on the fold out bench.

404
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,080
You got a but that's making that choice is to well, you can't look.

405
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,760
If it's a divorced couple, they're not they're not going to be in the bed together.

406
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,800
Or at least maybe, I don't know, that's a role playing scenario, I guess,

407
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,600
within the Galactic Star Cruiser.

408
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,640
You get say, Scott, you and your wife and your child and Jason goes.

409
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,360
Obviously, we're going to stay in the same room.

410
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,160
He's going to be on an ice saw in Star Wars.

411
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,040
So it's just like a there's a piece of the wall that just pulls out

412
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,720
like some sort of a prison cot.

413
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,920
Yeah, Jason, you'll be sleeping in on that.

414
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,800
And that's next to the is, quote unquote, escape pod.

415
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,240
I saw the emergency exit.

416
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:24,280
Yes, I apparently is so that if you call nine one one,

417
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,920
they have a way to go to you.

418
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,200
This is real.

419
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,520
Yeah, that I saw a video that explained it.

420
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,440
You watch the thing before the story starts where.

421
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:41,160
All right. If if that explains if something scary is happening

422
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,920
and all the lights are red, that is a dramatic story point.

423
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,200
But if all the lights are on, if it's just like end of concert lighting,

424
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,040
then you know there's been an actual emergency and you need to listen.

425
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,560
Stop. Don't start yelling about, hey, first order.

426
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,040
We'll get you.

427
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,320
No, no, no. Those are the real paramedics.

428
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,520
Someone is having a cardiac event.

429
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,520
This is not a Kylo Ren situation.

430
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,160
So every joking was real.

431
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,640
There wasn't a slightly out of the room.

432
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,120
Kylo, the paramedics do not want to take the thematic simulator.

433
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,960
That is a practical elevator.

434
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,960
They want to use a back door and come directly to the room.

435
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,680
Pin and these weird long gloves.

436
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,320
OK, now you may enter now your character's name.

437
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,440
It choose a path.

438
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,640
So so and there's also the thing in rooms are just like

439
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,960
panic rooms, essentially.

440
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,680
There's kind of a yeah kind of a panic room.

441
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,720
I I people were once again bringing up my mention of people making love.

442
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,640
Oh, in the emergency.

443
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,440
But I said rendezvous in the panic room because it doesn't seem like it would fit to.

444
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,880
What media did you say this?

445
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,040
What is Twitter? OK.

446
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,200
What tagged me and a guy Selgo post where he he, you know,

447
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,480
congratulated all the initial cruisers breaking in the mattresses.

448
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,640
Oh, that their ship is called the Halcyon.

449
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,200
The Star Trek cruise is called the Navigator of the Sea.

450
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,440
Yes. Yeah.

451
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,440
Can we talk about the emergency rules on the Star Trek cruise,

452
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,560
which I believe is just type basic Titanic rules.

453
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,240
Get to the lifeboat. Get to lifeboat first.

454
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

455
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,760
I used to know someone.

456
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,680
I used to work with someone who had worked in entertainment on a cruise ship.

457
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,640
They were right out of college.

458
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,960
And they told me they had been trained to captain the lifeboats.

459
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,080
They trained all the entertainment people because entertainment people

460
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,440
have experienced talking to crowds and being, you know, charismatic.

461
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,920
They also told me that one of the other entertainment people on that lifeboat

462
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,960
was trained how to use the handgun that's on every lifeboat. Right.

463
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,040
Because maritime law being what it is,

464
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,840
you have to obey the orders of the crew of a vessel,

465
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,680
even if it's a cruise ship lifeboat.

466
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,680
I think this is a fact you've said to me once a year.

467
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,120
This is something that you have said. There's a gun on each lifeboat.

468
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,760
I don't know if it's still the case, but it was in the early to mid 2000s.

469
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,000
Well, is it international?

470
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,160
Are they technically international waters?

471
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,320
It would be an international water scenario.

472
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,440
I mean, depending how close you are to the coast,

473
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,240
it might fall to local jurisdiction if you're like right off the coast.

474
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,080
OK, so let's say if we're comparing Star Trek crews to Star Wars crews,

475
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,600
there are actual guns on the Star Trek crews.

476
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,960
There is a chance there are actual handguns in the lifeboats.

477
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,240
Probably flare guns that flare guns, right?

478
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,760
Flare guns. Right. Yeah.

479
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:41,000
And maybe possibly slightly less regulated if you were to bring as a guest,

480
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,760
if you were to bring an actual firearm on, probably they're they're checking

481
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,960
But like, you know, like Disney is going to button down on that more than.

482
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,320
Yeah, you would think.

483
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,840
But like once in a while, stuff sneaks by in Florida.

484
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,640
Oh, yeah, they don't really check baggage going into hotels.

485
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,920
You know, they don't really get scanned and stuff.

486
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,240
You might end up with some some real, huh?

487
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,840
I mean, so that kind of that ups the excitement.

488
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,200
It makes it that's a more real world.

489
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,400
Like this little story that you go on in Star Wars is interesting.

490
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,320
But the fact that you that the ship could crash,

491
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,240
technically, in Star Trek, the cruise.

492
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,200
Yeah, there's a more of a risk factor.

493
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,160
That's I guess that's why it's adults, because, you know, it's a little bit more.

494
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:25,680
Not that it's any more at risk of crashing than any cruise, but just, you know,

495
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,760
but more than Galactic Star Cruiser, which is stationary.

496
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,040
Right. I would say, I mean, it would be fun if they had like phasers

497
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:37,120
aboard the Star Trek cruise, because that's sort of the weapon.

498
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,840
Like they have, you know, lightsabers on the on the Star Wars hotel.

499
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,120
Well, I saw some video and now I'm sorry, I can't remember which one it was,

500
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,600
but I saw a video where like one of the character,

501
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,640
it was a female character from one of the star movies, and they hold up

502
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,120
a very realistic looking right.

503
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:59,920
And now it's not coming to me if it's a phaser or a light saber, lightsaber.

504
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,720
You remember, like it's because it looks very realistic,

505
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,720
but just for a second and then they put it down, put it down and then pick up.

506
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,560
And then they really pick up the other. Yeah.

507
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,000
That's I think that's a lightsaber.

508
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,680
I think that was the Star Wars. Not OK. OK. Yeah.

509
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,360
That's not a phaser. I get them mixed up.

510
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,720
So I wasn't sure. That's OK.

511
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,320
You're not a big fan of either the properties.

512
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,400
So I really am, which again, sort of frees me up, I think,

513
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:26,440
to judge it just on the merits of the sure the stuff that that happens,

514
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:32,080
which I mean, on that level, like, do we want to bring up some specific

515
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,480
oh, yeah, like amenities stuff about and now we're still learning about crew

516
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,440
because there's been sort of an embargo.

517
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,200
And but, you know, a lot has come out recently about the other

518
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,240
about the Star Wars when Star Trek, the cruise, you're sort of going off of like,

519
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,440
well, if people even had the time to post YouTube videos,

520
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,080
they're trying to relax and enjoy the we'll probably get a glut

521
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,600
of Star Trek, the cruise, five content post Saturday.

522
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,480
So it puts us in a tough position to to do the episode.

523
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,720
But we wanted it to be current and relevant. Yeah.

524
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,320
Yeah. Because people are going to be mad if we don't address Star Trek,

525
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,640
the cruise, five. Yeah. That's the big deal. Yeah. Yeah.

526
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,920
But we're we're doing what we can.

527
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,960
And, you know, so and we're going off of like, again, we haven't we haven't done

528
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,240
it yet. Oh, wait.

529
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,720
I mean, I know we all haven't done Star Trek.

530
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,080
You guys haven't done the Star Wars one, right? No, no.

531
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,760
And yeah, we we were not invited to media stuff for that either.

532
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,080
And no, which is that's fine.

533
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,520
Yeah. Your pill to swallow.

534
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,040
And I have to say, you know, if we want to discuss

535
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,760
pros and cons, the Star Trek cruise has any, you know, a number of different levels

536
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,360
of room prices and a lot more.

537
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,960
A lot of variety. Absolutely.

538
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
A lot of variety.

539
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,160
If you want a suite, if you want an ocean view or an interior view,

540
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,120
the Star Wars, I would describe as prohibitively expensive.

541
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,640
Yeah. Yeah, that seems correct.

542
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,200
I mean, I think the other one, the Star Trek one could be when you're like

543
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,960
you're seeing, you know, the high end of it, maybe you're getting into into five

544
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,680
figures, but these are everything's in the thousands range.

545
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:14,000
Keep in mind that Star Trek is eight days, seven nights, as opposed to

546
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,880
I couldn't believe when I saw it, it's only two days and two nights.

547
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,280
So you got to accept you got to do that math and figure out like how

548
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,920
if you're going to be spending thousands of dollars, what are you getting more

549
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,440
vacation out of? I it's great because like that Star Trek cruise is just one day

550
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,920
more than that Harrison Ford and Haysh movie.

551
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,280
Six days, seven nights, which is just like you're getting an extra day there.

552
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,040
If you were kind of imagining that's your normal long vacation.

553
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,080
Yeah, that's how I I measure all my vacations by the Harrison Ford and Haysh

554
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,840
movie. Six days, seven nights.

555
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,360
Yeah. And good vacation.

556
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,360
The actual runtime of that movie closer to Star Wars Galactic Star Cruiser.

557
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,720
Right. Because just because it's yeah, it's closer.

558
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,800
It doesn't go over.

559
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,600
Yeah, it makes sense, too, because Harrison Ford's in Star Trek.

560
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,840
You're you've got it wrong.

561
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,680
Yeah, he's in hottest the second time.

562
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:04,960
He's in Star Wars, but his character is only kind of passingly involved in this.

563
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,560
Yeah, kind of a big character, kind of a beloved character.

564
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,160
But he's one of the big oh, I'm sorry.

565
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,600
Oh, Han Solo is Han Solo.

566
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,520
Yeah, Han Solo and Princess Leia in story on this Star Wars hotel

567
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,160
stayed on this. Oh, I heard about this.

568
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,320
So OK, so Han and Leia.

569
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,400
Fornicated at the hotel seems like there were hunting, hunting,

570
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,000
honeymooning on the cruise after the Battle of Endor.

571
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,120
Does it say in that do we know because is it in a piece of literature?

572
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,520
Is it like because they do a lot of these books?

573
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,400
Whenever what's happened with the Star Wars stuff now is that whenever they

574
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,840
do a new land or something or with a new location, they have a book or a comic

575
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,680
that like fleshes out sort of the backstory.

576
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:49,000
You know, it's come out that Han and Leia honeymooned on this

577
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,400
pleasure cruise, essentially.

578
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,320
They didn't go to like a like a place.

579
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,960
They didn't go to like a like I feel like I was just saying, you know,

580
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,600
where the Italy, the fake Italy in Attack of the Clones can't bite.

581
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
Yeah. Can't bite is where you want to.

582
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,240
That's like a pretty they just they were on a cruise.

583
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,080
Well, there's ports of call and what do we know?

584
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,040
Does it say that you don't want a vacation in Batu?

585
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
Yeah, but that's right.

586
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,520
Do they all does this only go to Batu?

587
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,240
How long has it been going and have they changed places?

588
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,280
Because there's definitely like Cloud City is lovely.

589
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,240
I would say Canto Bight. Lovely.

590
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,640
There's a multiple like even just Cori.

591
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,680
I mean, Coruscant, I guess they've been there more.

592
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,560
But there's got to be Naboo.

593
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,320
There Naboo has beautiful sites. You go underwater.

594
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,240
I'm sure there's like a luxury resort underwater with the Gungans.

595
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,920
Oh, that'd be really cool.

596
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,040
Living a little pod down there. Yeah.

597
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,600
So they made it. So so Han and Leia, I mean, Han,

598
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,080
can you imagine him rolling his eyes when they got to Batu?

599
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,160
Like, oh, it looks like a slightly better tattooing.

600
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,240
Thank good, good choice, Leia, darling.

601
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,400
The missus wants to go on a cruise.

602
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,240
I mean, they had to go back to work like the Empire was falling apart.

603
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,040
They probably were like, well, let's do a long weekend thing.

604
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,720
We'll do something longer in a couple of years.

605
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,280
And I guess I'll just do a mini moon then.

606
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,120
Yes, probably like that.

607
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,120
Yeah. Got to go to the Ogas Cantina with that loud ass music.

608
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,840
Oh, it's fucking droid.

609
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,920
DJ won't shut the hell up.

610
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,840
Oh, you 40 minutes.

611
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,040
I love I love seeing Han and Leia's viral Halloween costumes.

612
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,000
It is fun. And they always bring a couple of nice bottles of wine.

613
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,960
They bring the party with them.

614
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,400
He's holding to deal.

615
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,320
He's definitely got some joints on him.

616
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,680
Do you like my costume?

617
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,040
Doc on our.

618
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,120
I'm Fred Flintstone this year.

619
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,440
They still have Flintstones Halloween costumes.

620
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,680
And right. I'm Fred.

621
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,080
We went a little crazy last year.

622
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,640
She was a president from Air Force One and I was Ali McBeal.

623
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,240
David Blaine is with them one year.

624
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,760
He's the dancing baby.

625
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,040
David Blaine is the dancing baby.

626
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,760
I mean, wardrobe costumes are a big part of both of these.

627
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,640
That's something that Star Wars kind of.

628
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,360
Yeah, well, kind of borrow.

629
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,520
It'll be nice and say borrowed from Star Trek.

630
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,600
Here's what I just think I'd hate to go real quick.

631
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,080
Go back to this. So so they've added some backstory to to Star Wars.

632
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,320
And that's good. Yes. We like those characters.

633
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,640
This is where Kylo Ren was conceit.

634
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,040
Well, you can be in a room and you can book that room and accident

635
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,560
and like not know it and like, oh, this is I'm in the room.

636
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,160
This is where Kylo.

637
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:54,640
Yeah, there's a blaster shots on the wall where Han shot his gun accidentally.

638
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,000
Woohoo. Yeah.

639
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,400
Daddy's making a baby tonight.

640
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,160
Here we go. I knew that one was good one.

641
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,400
I knew that one got through.

642
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,880
I'm pretty positive about it.

643
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,040
I shot first.

644
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,720
My one is I want to say.

645
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,280
I want to say Kevin Smith's made that joke somewhere before,

646
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,240
but I don't know that to be.

647
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,360
I know not to be a fact.

648
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,560
Did he say that is that he pretty probably didn't get to that.

649
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,280
He yelled out McClunky.

650
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,360
McClunky.

651
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,800
But I'll say this, you know, that sometimes sometimes having that much

652
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,280
backstory is a little rigid as far as your imagination, you know, because like

653
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,000
if we just know all those are the characters, now we sort of we are limited

654
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,720
in what we're imagining actually happened.

655
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,480
So like the Star Trek crews, like, you know, this is a place where

656
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,080
Walter Koenig made love in one of the bathrooms.

657
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,520
We don't know.

658
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,080
You're not going character, you're going to him.

659
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,480
I'm just saying we don't know.

660
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,880
We can let our imaginations run wild.

661
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,640
Yeah, that is true.

662
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,040
Yes. Robert Duncan McNeil from Voyager.

663
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,720
Who knows what he was up to in one of these cabinets and our imagination.

664
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,720
Well, you could say he's Tom Paris, his character, Tom Paris,

665
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,960
or the man himself, we don't know.

666
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,400
And you can just play, have fun.

667
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,840
Yeah, some of them.

668
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,840
That's a big thing about the Star Trek crews.

669
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,920
They the performers are there.

670
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,920
They're there with you, you know.

671
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,320
Yes, exactly. The actors are there.

672
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,880
Yeah, that's something we have.

673
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,960
We haven't talked that up.

674
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,680
And now this is no it's not a convention.

675
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,800
In fact, they make a point famously in their catchphrase saying

676
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,840
it's an unconventional cruise.

677
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,640
It was kind of a way to shake up the Star Trek convention that was

678
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,720
that was becoming a bit conventional.

679
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,200
But it's it still does that have that element where every year

680
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,000
there is a big lineup of different Star Trek actors.

681
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,960
Yeah, it does not seem like Star Wars.

682
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,320
The crews can boast that.

683
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,320
No, it doesn't seem like that at all.

684
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,680
And I don't think there's any plans at the moment because like.

685
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,080
Well, there there was a one minute video.

686
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,800
Oscar Isaac took a tour, took a tour.

687
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,960
They got the message loud and clear.

688
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,760
Maybe somebody from Star Wars, not some guy from the Goldbergs.

689
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,800
That that is right.

690
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,080
Maybe it'd be better to have not somebody

691
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,680
or other remotely associated with the franchise.

692
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,600
But hear me out.

693
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,400
And I know I don't want to be negative, but these are just these are ideas.

694
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,080
And this, you know, the Star Wars hotel can change.

695
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:35,040
So just like what if like the guy who played quark on Deep Space Nine

696
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,320
Arm and Shimmerman is just wandering around the hotel for the weekends.

697
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,680
And while you're doing it like or, you know, like,

698
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,600
like a guy like that for Star Wars.

699
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,200
So so who would you want?

700
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,880
What actor would you want to have wandering around in the Halcyon?

701
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,080
Who's what's the what's J.J.'s bud?

702
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,120
Greg Greg.

703
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,640
Yeah, he plays he plays Snap Wexley, I believe, Scott.

704
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,320
Oh, yeah. Greg Grumburg.

705
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,880
Oh, even I knew that one.

706
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,680
You knew Snap Wexley. Yeah.

707
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,720
So Greg Grumburg, is that his last name?

708
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,040
Am I saying it right?

709
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,520
He's Grumburg.

710
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,720
He's just wandering around.

711
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,280
You can meet you can hang with him

712
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,600
while the narrative is going on.

713
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,000
Yeah. And it seems like the people who've committed to doing this,

714
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,760
they're either going to be good sports about it or they're setting up their

715
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,720
cruising with the the cruise director, whoever runs the events of like,

716
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,960
hey, I'm not super, you know, I'd like a private thing.

717
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,160
You know, I'll do one or two things, but I don't want to do everything.

718
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,120
You know. Yeah.

719
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,760
So so I just think I understand they're trying to go for realism

720
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,440
and immersion with the Star Wars.

721
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,400
But as a kid, I always liked going to see

722
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,720
when I would be at a convention, you would see and you probably have seen this

723
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,240
before, the Men Behind the Masks tour.

724
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,880
Now, a lot of those guys were Star Wars actors and a lot of them

725
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,840
have passed away at this point.

726
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,520
It would be Peter Mayhew.

727
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,320
It would be Kenny Baker, who played R2D2, Peter Mayhew played Chewbacca.

728
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,560
It would be I'm trying to think David Prowse,

729
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,080
who was in the Darth Vader costume, and Jeremy Bullock, who played Boba Fett.

730
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,040
I think all four of these men have passed away.

731
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,360
Sadly, Jeremy Bullock, I did meet at one of the early Star Wars

732
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,600
weekends and got a signed headshot.

733
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,680
If you know, if you if you both let me, I will be able to say,

734
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,800
I think all the names I've ever known in my head at this moment.

735
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,440
I mean, right now, right now, I'll keep I'll keep rattling through the cast

736
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,360
of Voyager cast, Steve Space.

737
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,040
I love that.

738
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,920
Me go because I was never great with names, but the last couple of years

739
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,160
have made me very bad with names, not just actors names, like people

740
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,360
I know and realize names.

741
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,720
Sure. Yeah.

742
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,720
But I will not forget David Prowse.

743
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,400
That is not a name I will forget.

744
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,440
One of those names you just mentioned, he wasn't available, I don't think, in 2022.

745
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,960
But 2023, Star Trek, the cruise.

746
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,240
Look who's showing up.

747
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,560
It's Armand Shimmerman.

748
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,560
He's got a beer.

749
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,320
Not to mention you.

750
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,360
If I just give you the initials of the other, it's a frangy, right?

751
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,920
Max G.

752
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,520
Oh, he played a nag, right?

753
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,520
What's the full name, though?

754
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,920
Oh, shoot. Yes, I do.

755
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,120
Oh, I'm so sorry.

756
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,280
Oh, no.

757
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,960
Sorry. I mean, I'm going to put you on the spot.

758
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,640
You can make it up.

759
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,600
If you know the other there's another here's somebody named

760
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,960
it's it's like a name you'd call a grandma.

761
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,280
And then it's and then V is the initial Nana visitor.

762
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,200
Yeah, there you go.

763
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,560
She was on Deep Space Nine.

764
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,920
She's there too. Next year.

765
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,560
That's great. She's great.

766
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,520
I will say this, Scott, to bring back something you really like

767
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:32,400
when I talk about in the show, I watched the Wallachian play

768
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,160
sitting in a row in front of Armand Shimmerman.

769
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,880
That's he was part of that.

770
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,920
He was part of that.

771
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,000
We're back there because yes, fabled night.

772
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,600
Andre Gregory, of course, from My Dinner with Andre directed a play.

773
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,760
Wallachian wrote and we saw it.

774
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,240
And Armand played a Ferengi on Deep Space Nine.

775
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,480
Wallachian was a guest star as a Ferengi and Deep Space Nine.

776
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,480
So two Ferengi's he was there were supporting each other.

777
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,960
It was lovely.

778
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,200
And I was like, oh, my God, Andre Gregory's right behind me.

779
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,560
And Armand Shimmerman is right behind me.

780
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,720
Was it was a little bit exciting there to Brent Spiner was not there.

781
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,120
But I thank you for bringing Brent Spiner up, because if you ever wanted

782
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:16,240
to see Brent Spiner, croon a Star Trek cruise is the place to do it.

783
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,760
Well, next year, they admit that was a big announcement.

784
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,760
We're covering all the big announcements for next year's on the cruise.

785
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,680
This year, they said he's not here this year.

786
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,720
But 2023, Brent Spiner is going to be there.

787
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,080
Do you think he's crooning?

788
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:32,120
Well, I have I saw a highlight reel of 2019 screws and he was crooning.

789
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,080
Wow. Brent Spiner was crooning.

790
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,920
I'm a huge Brent Spiner fan.

791
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,280
Brent Spiner and this is the thing I've been wanting to bring up

792
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,400
on this podcast for months now.

793
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,840
Brent Spiner has an old standards album that he made 25 years ago

794
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,880
called Old Yellow Eyes is Back, which is a joke about data.

795
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,920
I think you send me the cover to Old Yellow Eyes is Back once a year.

796
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,000
That is incorrect.

797
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,720
It feels familiar.

798
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,120
It does, because I sent it to you guys once.

799
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,920
This has only happened once at least.

800
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,680
But yes, there's a cover of, I guess, like some of the same songs

801
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,720
like Seth MacFarlane is sung on.

802
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,160
Only so many of these there was like I'm we all know there were only 24 songs

803
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,480
written before 1949.

804
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,720
There's only so many that everybody has to work from.

805
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,480
If you're into this music, yeah.

806
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,240
And you want to sing, you sing the same 40, 20 to 40 songs.

807
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,320
Now, Jason knows at least half of these.

808
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,720
I feel like you eventually will come out with a crooning album.

809
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,760
I mean, you have to see, you know, you're going to sing the old ones.

810
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,160
Yeah, you know that Sheridan will sing the old ones.

811
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,440
But but Brent Spiner seems to be crooning on this cruise.

812
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,080
And we've talked a lot about my different favorite Brent Spiner things,

813
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,920
including his character in Out to Sea, the Walter Neth.

814
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,920
I think so. You've on this show talked about Brent Spiner's character

815
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,840
in Out to Sea. I think I have.

816
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,240
I guess I was out to see you when you were saying it.

817
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,280
I mean, what's funny about when you got upset about the Wallace Shaw

818
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,960
anecdote is that there's some things that I think I've repeated before

819
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,720
that you haven't reacted angrily to.

820
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,640
And then there was that anecdote, which I go, Oh, did I say that a lot?

821
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,680
So now I never know.

822
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,160
I think I just relistened to the episode like several days prior.

823
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,600
So I was like, we're back in this.

824
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,760
We're telling the Ryan Perez, telling a story of a two nice men saying,

825
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,040
Oh, nice, good, nice, fringy and nice.

826
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,440
So I assume I brought up Brent Spiner's character

827
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,840
on Out to Sea because he plays a snooty cruise director.

828
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,480
And I brought him up when I watch Master of Disguise

829
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,720
because he's the bad guy in that.

830
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,040
Exactly. He's a bad guy in both of those movies.

831
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,120
And he gets the goof around with Walter Mather

832
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,960
and Jack Lemmon in one of their last bad movies.

833
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,640
But it's enjoyable.

834
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,160
I don't I don't mean to even put it down that much, but, you know,

835
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,640
it's not maybe as good as the odd couple.

836
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,720
Well, I think this as opposed to other stories where I have

837
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,040
reacted to their repetition, I think you could keep mentioning

838
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,560
Brent Spiner on out to sea as much as you want, because I think

839
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,160
I'll probably forget about this one immediately.

840
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,080
Or you'll go. What else about him?

841
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,360
What else? What is he doing out to sea?

842
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,680
He's like he's kind of doing like an English accent.

843
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,480
He's like, he doesn't like these older men and their antics on the cruise.

844
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,880
Like that's the whole vibe.

845
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,120
And he croons in that movie as well. He sings as well.

846
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,440
But it is a funny scene.

847
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,000
He's like being he's he's being funny on purpose.

848
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,960
But he does get to sing in that movie, too.

849
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:22,480
So I always I do legitimately like it when an actor is like becomes famous.

850
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,480
And then they go, oh, now is the now's my chance.

851
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,880
And you would like to imagine that maybe they read a script and go,

852
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,040
we'd like you to do the script.

853
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,760
And they go, can I sing? Am I allowed to sing?

854
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,440
And I don't know that that's what happened.

855
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,440
But but out to sea, he just gives a very like

856
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,600
old school, like cartoonish snooty guy performance.

857
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:47,080
Like an old movie, like somebody react into the Marx brothers or something.

858
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:51,600
Exactly. And, you know, it's especially when especially when I was a kid.

859
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,080
And because like I as a kid was data my favorite character.

860
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,720
Yes, for sure.

861
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,280
So I mean, I like the X-Men, too.

862
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,160
But like I was fascinated with data.

863
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,520
I love data. I don't know exactly why.

864
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,640
America loved data. I'm not special, but because he was.

865
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,560
He was like the fish out of water.

866
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,960
The fish out of water. He's funny.

867
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,000
But also he like cool.

868
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,760
He could get like he could like take a beating.

869
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,320
You could take it. You could shoot him and it wouldn't matter.

870
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,200
He's like Superman.

871
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,280
Like any head his head could like half of it could come off.

872
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,280
And he was like a cyborg underneath.

873
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,000
And like I was obsessed with that.

874
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,400
Did he teach you how to date?

875
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,400
Remember when he gets a girlfriend briefly?

876
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,840
Well, he has he has sex with Denise Crosby in the second season.

877
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,760
Also a guest on next year's Star Trek.

878
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,640
She's on a lot. I think she's there this year.

879
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,680
She's always. Yeah, she's great.

880
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,280
There's a video on the main Star Trek cruise

881
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,720
website where she is talking about how great the cruise is.

882
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,880
And she's in like an empty dining cabin.

883
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,960
She's got a giant martini.

884
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,280
And it's just like this looks like the best vibe.

885
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,240
The vibes are very good.

886
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,480
They're very good. Very good on this.

887
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,320
And I may have turned around my opinion on cruises

888
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,200
because I was like, oh, cruises are a little much.

889
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,120
Oh, gross. If whoever is running this cruise, if they catch wind of this,

890
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,240
we want to go. Well, we want to go.

891
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,040
It is, of course, the people running it.

892
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,160
Entertainment cruise productions, of course.

893
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,760
Yeah. As opposed to the other one, which is the was kind of put together

894
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,640
by the Walt Disney Imagineering is the name of that company.

895
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,560
So two titans in the industry. Right. Right.

896
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,680
And just trying to do the best they can.

897
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:33,040
But I think we, you know, we know who's winning, but they've been at it for longer.

898
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,240
They've been doing it since 2017.

899
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,360
The Star Trek Hotel, again, room to grow.

900
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,360
OK, so like they'll they'll maybe get there in three or four or five years.

901
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,480
Yeah. As far as like getting exactly what we want.

902
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,920
If we're if we're being we're not being negative, we're just saying.

903
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,240
Yeah, because I saw like like, you know, touring plans covers like everything.

904
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,240
And so they were there.

905
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,640
You know, they were there the first day, you know, paying guests were there.

906
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,840
And one of the things they said, it's like, all right,

907
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,320
you're starting to get a little tired doing all this stuff.

908
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,840
Also notice that are there are some, you know, obviously some Star Wars super fans here.

909
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,480
And then there are the, you know, people with the Star Wars super fans.

910
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,200
They've kind of banded together.

911
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,600
Like they're they're not as as into this.

912
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,760
So it might not be as rewarding for them.

913
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,920
Compare that to the Star Trek crews.

914
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,640
You're on the Royal Caribbean navigator to the sea.

915
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,960
Of course, any number of

916
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,240
vacation options, you know, right.

917
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,120
Restaurants, bars, there's a splash pad and pool, of course.

918
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,080
Do you think we could get to a land test ahead of touring plans

919
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:35,040
to send one of us on the ship to like count the amount of people

920
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,440
that come out of a like, I don't know, James Doohan's son

921
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,760
photo op or something?

922
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,280
Well, they've got to have a dedicated Star Trek, the cruise guy already.

923
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,360
Right. I mean, you would not be happy to take it.

924
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,640
But well, we're going to be fight me for it if you want.

925
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,880
If you want to be the official touring plan, Star Trek, the cruise guy,

926
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,160
because that's a sought after job.

927
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,280
I guess we are off.

928
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,520
Well, let's all just let's all go there and let's see who gets to that

929
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,920
on cruise gun first.

930
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:09,840
Can run the fast.

931
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:14,080
At the on cruise Ben and Jerry's additional payments may apply.

932
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,040
I mean, there are there.

933
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,880
The nice thing about the Star Trek screws is you can kind of customize

934
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,640
like you like all cruises, breakfast, lunch and dinner in a dining room,

935
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,400
you know, and then there's different snack bars and stuff.

936
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,000
The main dining room. Yeah.

937
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,560
Yeah. Well, that's kind of that's the situation I'd say with.

938
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,160
Yeah, let's let's talk about food as an area.

939
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,040
That's a big area in a cruise.

940
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:39,520
You want that that all to be good in in in the Star Wars cruise.

941
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,600
There's also like a main dining room called Crown of Cordelia.

942
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,320
And then there's a there's a bar called the Sublight Lounge.

943
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,000
So you get like fun space cocktails there.

944
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,560
That's so that's cool.

945
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,200
Now you go to the other side of things.

946
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,520
You go to Star Trek, the cruise, you got your main dining room, of course.

947
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,360
So they're matched there.

948
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,280
But then it keeps going and going because they've got the wind

949
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,560
jammer marketplace and your options there are unlimited.

950
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,280
They're running the gamut from crispy buttermilk fried chicken

951
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,400
to Vietnamese braised pork.

952
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,520
And the other one, the sense that I got from Star Wars is that they made up the food.

953
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,200
It's all this yippie kind of stuff.

954
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,640
Yeah, this is like I know what fried chicken is.

955
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,880
I know what Vietnamese braised pork is like.

956
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,280
And it seems like that doesn't even cover two percent of it.

957
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,760
Yeah, there's a lot of effort on the Star Wars one to be like,

958
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,120
this is some strange food.

959
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,880
But it's like really when you're tired at the end of a day,

960
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,600
don't you just want something, you know, don't you want something you're familiar with?

961
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,320
Yeah, or if you're fresh on the boat, excited for a cruise,

962
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,160
don't you want something, you know, at any hour of the day?

963
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,600
I think this I think this with this lineup of classics

964
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,960
from all around the world, you can't miss.

965
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,400
Well, yeah, maybe you just want to go to the Johnny Rockets Express,

966
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,920
which is in between Chop's Grill and a splash pad.

967
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,560
You know, sometimes you just want something reliable.

968
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,160
Wait, right next to the splash pad.

969
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,160
What's a splash pad?

970
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,320
It's like a water play area for children.

971
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,600
Oh, wow. That's fun.

972
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,720
I mean, 12, 12 and up for this cruise for this cruise, I guess.

973
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,880
Yeah. But would it be open for the adults?

974
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,480
Well, in this case, it's the getting sloshed pad.

975
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:15,880
Yeah.

976
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,720
I mean, you can feel like you could feel like a kid.

977
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:24,640
On a cruise ship or you can feel like adult and you can go to the Casino Royale.

978
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,080
And, you know, that was that at my attention because the Star Wars.

979
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,200
Classy phrase.

980
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,560
I yeah. I mean, point against the Star Wars Hotel.

981
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,320
There is no casino gambling.

982
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,560
And like, look, say what you will.

983
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,880
I I could make the argument maybe that casino gambling more ethical

984
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,560
than the stock market and cryptocurrency combined.

985
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,760
So there's nothing more honest than lady luck.

986
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,200
Even if the house always wins.

987
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,920
Amen. And you know, and it gives you an opportunity to maybe come out ahead.

988
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,560
Maybe you leave the cruise with money in your pocket, as opposed to the Star

989
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:06,240
Wars thing, which people seem to be not happy with the cost on.

990
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:10,320
If they gave you that that chance, they do seem to have some games and stuff.

991
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,640
But you're not there's no money.

992
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,800
It's maybe a credit or something.

993
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,800
So that's a decent, decent idea for a plus up.

994
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,960
If there was a way to win your money back on the Star Wars Hotel experience.

995
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,520
If like, yes, if maybe you yeah, let's see.

996
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,160
Because there's like the lightsaber training I've seen and like there's

997
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:30,680
a control room, it's like maybe if you do something, you can win your six grand back.

998
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,400
Like you can double or nothing it, I guess.

999
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,320
That would be good. Yeah.

1000
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:37,280
I mean, if you had that opportunity, let's even take it out of the cruise.

1001
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,640
And if the Millennium Falcon, if you could make money this,

1002
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,360
I've complained about like not what is up with the

1003
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:50,840
you know, the coaxium just make if you just tell me it's dollars.

1004
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,360
Now we're in. We're going after a big crate of dollars.

1005
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,080
You get to keep it if you do a good job.

1006
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,960
Suddenly, I'm way more motivated to do well.

1007
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,080
Oh, wow. Flying that day.

1008
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,880
I'm going to be the best engineer you ever seen.

1009
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,560
If you do well and you got six thousand dollars from the Millennium Falcon ride.

1010
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,880
I think that's I don't even need another level.

1011
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,200
Can you imagine how much more fun it would be?

1012
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,760
I mean, it'd be more stressful, I guess.

1013
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,880
But it would be you would be really yelling it like a grandma

1014
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,480
who didn't know how to fly.

1015
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,120
Oh, you got a group of five and then there's one person and you're nice at first.

1016
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,280
Like, oh, you should we should let you do the jump to light speed

1017
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,360
because you never OK. Have fun.

1018
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,520
Come on, grandma. Hit it. Hit it.

1019
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,680
Punch it.

1020
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,280
This is my last I used all my last money on this vacation.

1021
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,120
I need it back.

1022
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,440
You don't have to worry about that.

1023
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,680
If you're just chilling at the lime and coconut on the now, which one's that?

1024
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,720
Huh? That's the navigator in the sea.

1025
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,400
Oh, that's the stuff that's like an island theme bar.

1026
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,440
Oh, that sounds really nice. Yeah.

1027
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,040
Well, and you got Jamie's Italian from Jamie Oliver.

1028
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,800
And wait, Jamie Oliver has a place on the.

1029
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,400
Yeah, there's a celebrity restaurant like the, you know, restaurant.

1030
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,040
Oh, and it's full like a full it's got everything.

1031
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,200
Or is it just is it a specific type of food?

1032
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,600
It's Italian. OK.

1033
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,760
Yeah, Jamie's Italian.

1034
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,840
Jamie Oliver brings his unique flavor sensibility to the seas.

1035
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:16,000
I thought it was maybe Italian ice, but I think I just have my gambus.

1036
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,880
Oh, you got a booze on the mind.

1037
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,800
Yeah, that's what I was confused about.

1038
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,360
For some reason, when I hear Italian, I don't think Italian food,

1039
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:26,000
which is the most common way to refer to a bunch of food.

1040
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,480
I thought Italian ice.

1041
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,000
That's what the Italians now they make food now, too.

1042
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,960
I thought I just knew them for their ice.

1043
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,520
Somebody's like, oh, what do you do?

1044
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,200
You want to get Italian?

1045
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,400
And I go, Italian ice for dinner?

1046
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,040
What? It doesn't make any sense.

1047
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,800
Hey, and Jason, this is this vessel makes history

1048
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,720
because they have the first ever food truck at sea for gourmet hot dogs.

1049
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,720
That's the dog gourmet hot dogs. I

1050
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,800
take my between two and five thousand dollars

1051
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,920
depending on the size of the stateroom now.

1052
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,880
And those rooms, by the way, my sense is that you have a choice

1053
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,000
of that, you know, you got to pay more on a ship.

1054
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,560
Most often you're not really getting a window if you're if you're going

1055
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,240
a little cheaper, but you pay a little more.

1056
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,240
Maybe you go in with some people and maybe are getting a window.

1057
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:21,120
It is positive or even like even a deck if you really spring for it.

1058
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,040
Is there such an option on Star Wars, Galactic Star Cruiser?

1059
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,200
You know, I don't know, because there are different sized rooms.

1060
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,360
The majority of the rooms appear to be the one with just the bed

1061
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:35,000
with the two bunk beds and then with the prison cot that folds out.

1062
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,120
Yeah. But I think there is a bigger room, but I haven't seen a video.

1063
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,520
There are bigger rooms. I haven't seen.

1064
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,400
Yeah, I haven't seen any. But I don't think it's much, much better.

1065
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,240
I don't think it's much bigger.

1066
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,000
It seems like a miss on their part that they're like, this is a galactic

1067
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,800
cruise, the luxury cruise ship.

1068
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,880
Yeah, a lot of it seems very utilitarian, like replicating places

1069
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,400
that George Lucas and production designers were like.

1070
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,560
It's unfortunate that these characters have to live and work in these spaces

1071
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,840
during a time of galactic strife.

1072
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,760
But like but like the luxury, the luxury suite should be like

1073
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:14,960
Padme's room in the prequels or something like this big expansive room,

1074
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,160
the one where Anakin jumps out.

1075
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,880
I think it's on Coruscant where they're like a little spy drone

1076
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,760
and Anakin jumps out the window at it and they're flying through the streets.

1077
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,640
You know what I'm talking about?

1078
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,960
Well, I guess it wouldn't fit with the story because you're like in theory.

1079
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,520
You poke outside. Yeah.

1080
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,400
You're just right in space. You're in the suction.

1081
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,960
Well, right. Yeah, I guess.

1082
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,960
Yeah, you wouldn't see the sights and sounds of Coruscant, but it might be

1083
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,920
the it might be the size and it might be the like window size, you know.

1084
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,200
I mean, yeah.

1085
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,480
When you when you free yourself of all this and when you're on a cruise

1086
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,200
where the story is, you're on a cruise. Yeah.

1087
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,480
And you get to just breathe in the sea air.

1088
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,520
Here's a missed opportunity, I feel.

1089
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,440
And this is this is as serious as I can be.

1090
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,120
There should be a piece of cruise entertainment that is similar

1091
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:04,200
to the piece of like whatever you would call it entertainment that that

1092
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,720
Sidious and Anakin are watching when he gives him the Darth Plagueis speech.

1093
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,280
The opera kind of thing. Yeah, the opera thing.

1094
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:15,200
When he tells him about his master who who taught him

1095
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,320
basically everything he knew and then he killed him.

1096
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,520
There's no blobs. There's no blob fun.

1097
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,320
There's no blob entertainment on the Halcyon.

1098
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,680
Yeah, I mean, there's an original character.

1099
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:28,480
There's like a DJ kind of character and it seems like a very elaborate suit

1100
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,560
where the like the mouth and the ear kind of things wiggle.

1101
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,360
Yeah. But there should be like 20 of those like there.

1102
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1103
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:41,680
There's like five characters, five kind of alien characters. Right.

1104
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:46,400
Whereas the amount of aliens present on Star Trek, the cruise is dependent

1105
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:51,720
on the guests and how elaborate do you want your costumes to be?

1106
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,400
So it's really up to you.

1107
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,200
You get out of it what you put into it.

1108
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,960
And with that crew, I think you're getting tons of creatures.

1109
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,120
I think you're looking out at a party that's like nothing

1110
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:07,160
but rubber masks and weird, multiple eyes and scales.

1111
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,440
It is hard to tell.

1112
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,400
And I mean this in the best way.

1113
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,760
It is hard to tell who is paid to be in an outfit and who is not on the Star Trek

1114
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,840
cruise there. If you look at all the videos, you so many times.

1115
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,560
So there's a fairly famous character, the Gorn, for instance,

1116
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,320
that was in the original Star Trek, which is a big green, dumb looking

1117
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,920
rubber outfit, some character Kirk fights.

1118
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,800
It was like a lizard.

1119
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,760
One of the few Star Trek toys I had as a child.

1120
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,320
Really? An unposable PVC.

1121
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:38,120
Oh, the Gorn. The reinstalled Gorn, probably from King's Dominion.

1122
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,400
OK, cool.

1123
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,240
That's the one that they have that really dopey slow rock fight, right?

1124
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,840
Yes, exactly. Askez rocks.

1125
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,040
Yes, it's really funny.

1126
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,120
It's really I mean that in the best way. Yeah.

1127
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,880
Yeah. So the Gorn.

1128
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,360
Now, the Gorn, you look at all the videos.

1129
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,680
I swear the Gorn is in every other shot.

1130
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,360
And I don't know if it's a person dressed up as the Gorn

1131
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:04,000
or some official Star Trek cruise person wearing an official Gorn outfit.

1132
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,680
It doesn't matter to me.

1133
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,920
I love the idea that the costumes are on equal footing from the

1134
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:15,280
official cruise maker to just some guy who has it like founded at a costume shop.

1135
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,800
There is so much Gorn representation.

1136
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,200
You think he was the assistant cruise director,

1137
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,000
and he seems like he's having a ball.

1138
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,200
Gorn. Every shot.

1139
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,920
Yeah, he's working the camera.

1140
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,000
In a Hawaiian shirt sometimes.

1141
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,280
He wears different outfits.

1142
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,560
There's Gorn in a toga.

1143
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,400
There's Gorn in a Hawaiian shirt.

1144
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,400
It may be the same Gorn. It may be different.

1145
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,040
I do not know, but I love it that you can be completely

1146
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,440
confused as to who actually works for the cruise and who doesn't.

1147
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,000
Gorn's toga party is like one of the big thematic event.

1148
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,440
Like that is one of the big.

1149
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,200
I think a Z one, right?

1150
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,840
There's a whole section on the website of theme nights,

1151
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,840
and you got to think they're saving the best for less because the visual

1152
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,560
and we'll post this, but the visual of Gorn's toga party

1153
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:05,160
where he is in Rome, he's in a toga and he's got a big barrel of beer.

1154
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:09,520
Most bubbly beer, most like Simpson's cartoon beer.

1155
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,800
And he is having a blast.

1156
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,680
The the the literature, the copy on this, it's well, you know,

1157
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,920
the Gorn is a staple of Star Trek, the cruise.

1158
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,600
Yeah, exactly what you're saying.

1159
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,600
And we pretty much let him do whatever he wants, as long as none of us

1160
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,080
want to recreate the infamous arena battle.

1161
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,720
He hosts parties, formal nights, DJ sets.

1162
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,200
And this time this is for twenty twenty two.

1163
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:35,600
He's taking us to a Pollux four style world for Gorn's toga party.

1164
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:40,600
All species are invited from Vulcan Zeus to Andorian Aphrodite

1165
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:45,240
or even Ferengi Apollo sporting a lat sporting a Latinam Laurel crown.

1166
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,360
This whether you want to make a custom

1167
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,800
Federation style toga and science officer blue or simply turn your sheets into

1168
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,640
chic, this party will please gods and mortals alike.

1169
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,040
So I mean, one sounds great.

1170
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,400
And this is we've talked about this before, you know, in Disney bought Star Wars.

1171
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,320
You know, it was the end of something that at least Jason and I really like.

1172
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,120
The hyperspace hoopla.

1173
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:08,000
Yes. Where you would get like Darth Maul twerking.

1174
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:12,000
Now, Darth Maul is not going to twerk on the Halcyon.

1175
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,800
But I'll tell you this, the Gorn will twerk.

1176
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,960
Twenty four fucking seven.

1177
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,040
That is that it doesn't matter.

1178
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,000
No one's going to come around and say, you know what?

1179
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,920
In the Star Trek guidebook, Gorn does not twerk.

1180
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,040
This is off story. Yeah, no, no, no.

1181
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,120
You can get Gorn will do whatever you want.

1182
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,040
Whatever you want.

1183
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:33,560
Just don't talk to him before he's had a coffee and a mimosa

1184
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,400
and the dog and something to wake you up.

1185
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,080
Whoever's in the Gorn suit does not break character for those five days.

1186
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,080
I think you are Gorn for five.

1187
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,400
Incredible amount of immersion in these actors.

1188
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,560
You have to really give them credit because the Gorn is committed

1189
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,960
to being the Gorn for eight days.

1190
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,000
And that's a long time.

1191
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,440
So my salute to the perhaps multiple actors playing the Gorn.

1192
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,000
And I like that they encourage you to just take your own bedsheets

1193
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,120
and just then that's your costume for this thing.

1194
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,720
They don't. It's not all about who spent the most money

1195
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,680
to look the best in this thing.

1196
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,240
Yeah, because it's my Jason.

1197
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,280
You were sending us some stuff that implies that if you want to really

1198
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:19,440
toe the party line and like go the get Disney's full idea

1199
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,920
of what a costume would be, you're spending even more.

1200
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,200
You're spending hundreds more dollars as opposed to just like

1201
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,320
we gave you a costume. It's in your room.

1202
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,120
It's called the sheets.

1203
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:32,560
I yeah, that's a big jump from like, OK, go to shop, Disney.

1204
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,760
And you can you so you can buy exclusive apparel.

1205
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:41,720
Now you have to show you have a room reservation for this event before

1206
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,840
you can buy. You book. Yes, that's right.

1207
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,720
The privilege with 30 minutes within.

1208
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:51,320
And it goes all the way down to like, I believe I sent short gloves

1209
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,600
and long gloves.

1210
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:56,040
There's a few dollar fluctuation there, but I'm like, you can buy gloves

1211
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,880
with a tiny little ship logo on them.

1212
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:03,040
And then I found a cosplay website where 250 bucks.

1213
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,560
First off, everything was on sale on the Star Wars page of the cosplay website.

1214
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:10,880
So I have to think they were like, I'm like, the thing's open.

1215
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:17,240
You for 250 bucks, you could have a full po dameron or a full

1216
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:22,880
Cassian on door get up like jacket shirt, pants, belt, shoes,

1217
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:27,120
like stirrups, like the whole kit and caboodle stirrups.

1218
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:29,560
You say stirrups.

1219
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:34,640
Yeah, I I that that would be my recommendation is make your own

1220
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:39,440
or support your local cosplay company because they're they're probably

1221
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,880
giving you a better deal and using better materials

1222
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,600
and put in love in those costumes, you know? Yeah, yeah.

1223
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:50,880
There are a lot of yes, Star Trek Twitter people I see who just have

1224
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,280
I think what look to be homemade Star Trek costumes already.

1225
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,080
They were in their day to day life.

1226
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,000
So whoever they're to work, they might wear it to work.

1227
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,240
I think I was just talking about, you know, like the start,

1228
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,600
like you see video of like the Star Trek dentist who made his whole

1229
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,960
like office look like the bridge of one of the ships.

1230
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,040
And he's wearing that outfit to work.

1231
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,080
I mean, he has multiple outfits.

1232
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,640
He has the dress uniform.

1233
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,480
He has the sort of relaxed sort of captain's outfit.

1234
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,040
You know, there's many different outfits that the captains wear.

1235
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,320
Yeah, he's got to have a few.

1236
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,720
We might get gum blood on his inside.

1237
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,800
What gum?

1238
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:28,240
Yeah, you know, blood from the gums spurts out of a gun.

1239
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,000
Which I'm trying to know.

1240
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,200
Hold on. Let's think real quick.

1241
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,800
What outfit is the best?

1242
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:37,000
Which captain's outfit is the best for blood so it doesn't show up?

1243
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:41,120
I guess maybe like the first contact Star Trek, the next generation outfits,

1244
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,760
which are sort of darker with a gray at the top.

1245
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,280
Or do you just want red so blends in?

1246
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,320
Or do you want to maybe?

1247
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:50,840
Yeah, the classic uniforms or or the first

1248
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:55,440
the next generation outfits like with because the captain is wears red

1249
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,800
on next generation kind of a maroon.

1250
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,120
But then also, you know, yeah.

1251
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,520
But also, of course, there's a joke of the red shirts.

1252
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,560
Yes. And the original Star Trek's got to know if you're familiar with this.

1253
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,480
This is basically like if you're watching an old Star Trek,

1254
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,920
there would be like, you know, Kirk Spock and McCoy are going down on the ship

1255
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,840
and they're joined by two guys you've never seen before wearing red shirts.

1256
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,160
They always die.

1257
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,440
They're they're always going to get killed.

1258
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,720
So probably don't want to wear those shirts on the cruise.

1259
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,400
You might bring the vibes down.

1260
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,000
Or they're the craziest ones on the cruise.

1261
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:29,640
Because, oh, they don't have they have nothing to lose.

1262
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:32,600
Yeah, I might not come back on shore from Mazatlan.

1263
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,680
That joke, Jason, if you if you got like a red shirt

1264
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,240
and like it was like battle damage or something, you would be the hit of the party

1265
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,520
because people would be like, this joke is fucking funny.

1266
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:46,240
Well, he might win Q's costume party, one of the other events.

1267
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:50,880
And this is not like I take it that it seems like it's not Daisy Ridley

1268
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:55,840
and Adam Driver doing the show every day on Electric Star Cruiser.

1269
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,320
I think it's other actors.

1270
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:02,560
But in this case, it's John Delancey, who I assume is the real Q.

1271
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,080
Yes, that not real and on Q.

1272
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,400
No, not Q and on Q.

1273
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,520
Oh, maybe that'd be a great way to discuss you'd never expect that.

1274
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,400
There's no way he'd be both Q's.

1275
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,680
You would be very surprised, I think, to learn that.

1276
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:17,080
It's John Delancey.

1277
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:21,280
But Q, as you can tell me what Q is, obviously.

1278
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:25,120
But this says he's appeared to us as everything from a Franciscan monk,

1279
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:30,480
an interstellar judge, a 16th century sea captain and an Aldebaran serpent.

1280
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,040
So he's the only choice to host this costume party.

1281
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:35,600
He's a shapeshifter.

1282
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,120
He basically he's like,

1283
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,320
I'm trying to think of a good parallel character

1284
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,640
where you can do almost anything, really.

1285
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,200
He's a he's a troublemaker.

1286
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,400
He's almost like a Loki type, I would say.

1287
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:49,360
Yeah. If you've ever seen, he shows up

1288
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,960
a couple of times, maybe only like once a season on Next Generation.

1289
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,560
But yeah, he's he's he's, you know, he's got a twinkle in his eye

1290
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,800
and he's always up to antics.

1291
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,120
So then, yeah, you get to in one of the videos, John Delancey,

1292
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,160
who plays Q is talk, he's a lot.

1293
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,640
He's you watch the same video.

1294
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,640
He's in the like promo video a lot.

1295
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,880
He's a very like kind of gregarious person in real life, it feels like.

1296
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,440
So he's talking about how the party has grown over the years.

1297
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,680
So now he's now because he's done this a couple of years.

1298
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,240
And now he says it's like full.

1299
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,320
It used to not be full.

1300
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:24,960
But apparently the Star Trek cruise only grows in popularity every year.

1301
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:28,800
So he's now saying he's basically standing there as a king,

1302
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:34,320
a king among among regular people at this Q costume party.

1303
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:39,320
So, you know, I assume that you're seeing truly the

1304
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,720
widest range of costumes possible, probably in Star Trek inspired.

1305
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,320
But maybe even not maybe just like the scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz.

1306
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,880
No, that would be fun.

1307
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,600
Although it wouldn't be out of the question that there would be a Star

1308
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:56,000
Trek Next Generation episode where they all dress as the Wizard of Oz characters.

1309
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,280
That's the type of fun you have on Star Trek.

1310
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,120
Yeah, because there's like holodeck night.

1311
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,200
There's mirror universe.

1312
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,760
There is all sorts of nights.

1313
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,840
There's the roaring holodeck night.

1314
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:08,880
The roaring. So it was in pinstripe suits like gangsters and flappers.

1315
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,840
Get your Tommy guns oiled.

1316
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,000
Yeah, there are pictures.

1317
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:14,840
Says that on the website.

1318
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,880
There's the pictures.

1319
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,800
And I'm man, everyone's going to be mad at me.

1320
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,080
I'm blanking on the name of the episode.

1321
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,440
It's a very famous episode of the original Star Trek, where they're

1322
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:27,440
they go back in time to gangster times and Kirk and Spock are in pinstripes.

1323
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,520
And like mirror or shattered something there.

1324
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,440
I'll look it up.

1325
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,360
I should just edit this out to make myself sound smarter.

1326
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,560
But they're using that photo.

1327
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:40,960
First of all, by the way, is this cruise licensed officially?

1328
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,000
Do we know?

1329
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,640
Well, it seems like it is.

1330
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:44,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1331
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:49,480
I think so. So but I don't think they're exactly running it through the filter.

1332
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:53,520
That's really my they aren't like sending this to the Roddenberry family,

1333
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:58,360
you know, as opposed to like the, you know, the Lucasfilm.

1334
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,640
Yeah. Story people.

1335
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:05,720
Yes, I think that's absolutely right, because there's there are gatekeepers

1336
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,240
with any of these IP things.

1337
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,920
And recently, in the last couple of years, there was all the talk of, you know,

1338
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:14,440
Quentin Tarantino is doing Star Trek or what he's he's got an idea for Star Trek.

1339
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:18,400
And the guy who wrote The Revenant was going to write or script or maybe did already.

1340
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,760
But then that's not happening.

1341
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,400
And I was looking at some quotes and it's like Rod Roddenberry

1342
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:28,200
was like, you know, I'm I think I'm a traditionalist when it comes to Star Trek.

1343
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,120
So I don't know if that really would have worked or not.

1344
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,400
And you're like, oh, shut up.

1345
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,240
Like, why can't we get a fun? Yeah.

1346
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,440
I was I didn't mind hearing that because of if like if Tarantino

1347
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:41,720
is only doing a few more movies that kind of don't well one of them to be a star.

1348
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,040
I hear I agree with that.

1349
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,720
But I'm just saying like, have some fun.

1350
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,680
Like, come on. Yeah, it's better for them than it is for.

1351
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,240
Yeah. Yeah.

1352
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,120
A little bit of Tarantino flavor.

1353
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,920
I mean, Tarantino has directed TV.

1354
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,240
He's directing some justified episodes coming so he can work within.

1355
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:01,640
You know, he can cheat the tenor or whatever a little bit like, well, this is IP or whatever.

1356
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:05,480
But my point is, I do think there's still like even like we know Star

1357
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,520
Star Wars is very, very careful about everything.

1358
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,920
Star Trek two has like people that are like worried.

1359
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,560
Sure. That something's going to fall off.

1360
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:17,160
But that is not Rod is asleep when it comes to the programming on the Star Trek.

1361
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:25,400
He's not looking at this art with the with the Spock in with a Tommy gun and then like two

1362
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:30,720
great Gatsby babes colored blue and green.

1363
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,600
Yeah. Yeah. Not approving this.

1364
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,720
This looks cheap and fake in the best way.

1365
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,960
Yes. Well, like they put up a sign that I guess it's the casino royale,

1366
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,880
but they put up a sign that quarks casino like was hand scrawled and stuff.

1367
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,280
Right. Yeah. Handwritten done with love.

1368
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:49,120
And that's what we like about this experience.

1369
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:54,640
And you got to imagine that's also the case for Rice's Festival of the Moon Party.

1370
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:56,680
Yes. Did I say the name right?

1371
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,560
I believe so. Yeah. Yeah.

1372
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,680
Well, it's you know, it's the tribute to the twin sun pleasure planet.

1373
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:06,600
And it's it's a party with cool rhythms and good vibes and casual dress.

1374
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,640
And they're all swingers parties.

1375
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:12,120
Every single one of these is a swingers party.

1376
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:15,960
It's also involves it seems to involve a lot of Marty, Marty, Rob beads.

1377
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:21,200
And then like I've I actually went down a rabbit hole during deep quarantine of

1378
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,280
like that theme cruises were trying to stay afloat

1379
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,560
with YouTube channels and virtual events.

1380
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:32,120
So I was going through a bunch of like, you know, what is the what is this?

1381
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,160
You know, this music cruise or what?

1382
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:39,480
They all do 70s night no matter what, with the broadest, just like

1383
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,560
big Afro wig and John Travolta suit.

1384
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:48,480
Like everybody, if you're going on a cruise of any kind, even if it even if it's

1385
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:51,920
Star Trek, even if it was like a sea pack at sea,

1386
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:56,520
it was like some scary conservative white nationalist thing.

1387
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:59,320
It would still be like, and it's 70s night.

1388
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,720
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.

1389
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:07,160
Only the most obvious songs from the 70s will play all six and then repeat them.

1390
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,800
And and it's so popular every time.

1391
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:11,720
And people are so happy.

1392
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:15,520
It's the great they're all so much happier at it than I am complaining about it.

1393
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,960
Yes, that is it.

1394
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,040
Look, it just works. Some things work.

1395
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,240
Yeah. And that works every time.

1396
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,400
But I like combining.

1397
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:26,360
I like that it's roaring 20s via Star Trek.

1398
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:31,400
I like that it's 70s boogie oogie via Star Trek.

1399
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:32,680
This is great.

1400
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:36,640
We got as many premises as possible as opposed to Galactic Star Cruiser,

1401
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,920
which only stays with the one stays with the one.

1402
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,440
And they have the song themselves, you know?

1403
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:47,440
Yeah. I mean, it's just yeah, it should be it should be different themes every night.

1404
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:50,120
That's what I think. And obviously, it's only a short stay.

1405
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,160
So two different themes.

1406
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,520
Yeah, it's a short stay.

1407
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:58,960
I mean, the the the cast members seemed like the cast members in the act.

1408
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,280
Everyone seems to be getting like high marks for what they're doing.

1409
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,600
Everybody seems great.

1410
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,480
They hired really great actors in Orlando.

1411
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:09,680
Yeah. But like if you if you

1412
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:12,360
sit at the captain's table at the Star Trek cruise,

1413
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:16,760
you're sitting at the table with a captain of a giant cruise ship.

1414
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,880
JT. Huh?

1415
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,160
No, he's the cruise director.

1416
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,160
Don't be ridiculous.

1417
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,520
Sorry, sorry. Yeah, but I mean,

1418
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,360
there is a captain's table add on for the Star Wars Galactic Star Cruiser.

1419
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:32,680
And, you know, it's well, you're sitting at the table with an improv actor

1420
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:35,400
in grease paint, you know, kind of different.

1421
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,040
This is a seafaring. Right.

1422
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,000
You're saying you're saying, honestly,

1423
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,200
you'd rather sit and learn from a real cruise captain.

1424
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:47,280
I I've already had enough meals with improv actors

1425
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,440
and still agree to pay them on them.

1426
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,760
Yeah. Or I've been the improv actor in grease.

1427
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,480
But you know, you want to learn from like an ex-Navy man, finally,

1428
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,000
because you get to break out your sailor suit.

1429
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,440
I well, yeah.

1430
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:02,480
And I think you could do I'm sure you could wear a sailor suit

1431
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:04,880
to any one of these theme nights.

1432
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,480
And it would be, you know, on.

1433
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:09,280
I'm surprised you weren't more of a Star Trek little boy.

1434
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:12,040
You know, I just I caught it.

1435
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:15,840
You know, I watched the original series in syndication a lot.

1436
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,360
And then I would catch Next Generation every now and then.

1437
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,000
I had a couple of toys.

1438
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,160
But yeah, no, I was only at a passing interest in Star Trek.

1439
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:29,360
But there's like so much like dumb old timey stuff on there.

1440
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:32,560
I know. Like in Star Trek, shocking Star Trek nine.

1441
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:35,520
They like break data out of like a evil spell he's under

1442
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,440
by singing some Gilbert and Sullivan song.

1443
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:41,640
Oh, well, you know, it's a major motion picture in the year,

1444
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:46,320
like 2000 or 99 or something like you say, well, then it is typical.

1445
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,760
Well, I've been ready for a knockdown blow.

1446
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,720
Like this is the first 10 minutes of like a major movie.

1447
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,040
Major release in the late 90s.

1448
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,520
Yeah. And I'm watching this going, this is awesome.

1449
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:01,080
Hey, don't forget about that one where Wharf joins the Dorsey Brothers.

1450
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,080
He's a boogie woogie bugle boy from company B.

1451
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,240
They do that in Star Trek Generations.

1452
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:13,400
They are they're a wharf gets a promotion essentially.

1453
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:14,880
Well learned.

1454
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,000
So how they do it is they go on the holodeck and they all put on like

1455
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:22,080
Horatio Hornblower outfits and they're on the like a real old time ship.

1456
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,840
Wow. And they do the ceremony like they're all like an old olden days.

1457
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:29,360
Basically, we're all like, you know,

1458
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,440
olden days, basically.

1459
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,080
It's some of the funniest, greatest, lamest stuff.

1460
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,280
And I mean, that in the best way.

1461
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:40,120
No wonder that they actual seafaring has always been a part of Star Trek.

1462
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,120
And so no wonder they kept it right.

1463
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:46,040
Alive with this with, you know, and with great destinations.

1464
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:48,880
That's the other thing. Look, you go to Batuu.

1465
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,760
We know Batuu. We've been to Batuu.

1466
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:54,120
You go you get on this boat, you go to St. Thomas.

1467
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,280
You go to Blackbeard's Castle.

1468
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,520
You go snorkeling.

1469
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:58,680
Blackbeard's Castle.

1470
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:01,760
Yeah. Imagine what treasures await in Blackbeard's Castle.

1471
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,760
There's certain stops where you can go zip lining.

1472
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:10,440
I mean, these these just aren't, you know, you go to you get off at Batuu

1473
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:13,760
and you get a meal voucher and you go get in line at Docking Bay 7.

1474
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:17,600
Go get some yip yip and then a back in the boat that doesn't go anywhere.

1475
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,480
Now, that's a fun thing I discovered.

1476
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:22,920
So because there's always a buffet breakfast and lunch on the boat.

1477
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:26,040
You do get a meal voucher that can be used at Docking Bay 7

1478
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:31,320
or any quick service location at Tizzy's Hollywood Studios.

1479
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,320
So you can you can jump ship.

1480
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:37,120
You can go off planet, go to Pizzeria, go to Woody's lunch box.

1481
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,440
Is that confirmed? They'll let you out.

1482
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:39,600
That is confirmed.

1483
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,360
That is confirmed that it works at any quick service.

1484
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,560
You can go to Fairfax Ferry, get a big greasy hot dog.

1485
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,560
That feels like it breaks the reality.

1486
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,600
It does. But what are they going to do?

1487
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,760
Put a collar on you.

1488
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,400
And if you go outside of the confines, they shock you.

1489
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,920
Then you're like a you're like a shopping cart.

1490
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:58,360
They shut you down if you try to go out of the lot.

1491
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,560
I think, yeah, they should.

1492
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:02,360
They should have something where they shut your phone down or

1493
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,560
like the shoes they gave you don't work.

1494
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:08,680
They give you all special shoes when you get onto the hotel floor.

1495
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:12,560
Like Viper, they like they make your feet go numb so you can't walk anymore.

1496
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,760
That's a possibility.

1497
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,920
Maybe they release a fluid, a numbing agent.

1498
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,880
That could be I would just think like spikes in the shoe

1499
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,920
that shoot into the ground and like that, like you get stuck there.

1500
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:24,640
Oh, sure. Yeah.

1501
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,480
Yeah. Yeah.

1502
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:28,840
And they well, you know, Michael Jackson did the smooth criminal illusion

1503
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,040
be via little pegs in the floor.

1504
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,560
All right. Right. Would detect.

1505
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:35,400
So maybe if they've they could have thought of this, an outfitted

1506
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,000
Galaxy's Edge with spikes and rods everywhere

1507
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:42,240
they can suddenly spring up to stop anybody who's

1508
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:45,920
trying to go to Woody's Munchbox or whatever.

1509
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,160
Woody's Munchbox.

1510
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:48,400
Yeah, I did. What's it called?

1511
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,760
Woody's Lunchbox. Like it's like an actual lunchbox.

1512
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,640
I see. Oh, it is a big lunchbox.

1513
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,760
So the other my big question, which I did finally get answered.

1514
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,720
Where can you smoke a cigarette?

1515
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:03,360
And the answer is you have to take the elevator back on in the Star Wars.

1516
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:04,880
So you go back to Earth.

1517
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,680
You have to go back to Earth.

1518
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:11,360
You take a theme thematic elevator to go blast a vape plume.

1519
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,360
You have to go. You have to go all the way back there.

1520
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,120
There's not just a smoking area.

1521
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:20,920
So there's a climate simulator that simulates the climate of Batu, right?

1522
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:26,640
Which is, hang on, which is a room that is outside, a little patio outside,

1523
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,120
a little terrace outside.

1524
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,520
It's a little mini. It looks like a little garden.

1525
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,200
Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

1526
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,840
It looks like where my dog pees at LAX.

1527
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,440
Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

1528
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,680
So you can't smoke in there.

1529
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:38,800
It's too close to any of the entrances and stuff.

1530
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,880
So you have to go back to the port coche to, you know, hit your mango

1531
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,520
mango faith.

1532
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:50,160
But also, like, it's like, well, nicotine addiction doesn't really work that.

1533
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,560
Like, you can't just put it on hold for two days.

1534
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:58,320
Does the like narrative siren go off if you try to vape in one of the rooms?

1535
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,800
That's a good question. Yeah.

1536
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,720
You probably could get away with a little bit.

1537
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:05,000
I'm not saying because a lot of hotels have changed.

1538
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,120
There are no smoking little placards to no smoking, no vaping. Right.

1539
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:12,560
No marijuana. Like some of the Vegas hotels of all three.

1540
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,200
Can you vape in the little panic room?

1541
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:18,560
Ah, hotbox, the panic room might be healthy.

1542
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:22,040
But the the Earth's fire department will come

1543
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:24,800
and you will get charged for it.

1544
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,320
It's a division of the rebellion called the Reedy Creek Hook and Ladder.

1545
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:36,720
For lower level crises, they do make the fire department stay in character.

1546
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,320
It's a major thing. Yeah, they're the fire department.

1547
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,400
But they will stay in character for like a low for a trashcan fire,

1548
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,040
for trashcan fire.

1549
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,280
They all have characters.

1550
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:49,240
Oh, Kylo Ren said this.

1551
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:52,080
Curse that first order. Oh, yeah.

1552
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,600
He said it with his mind.

1553
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,920
Hey, that's the bed where his parents made him.

1554
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:03,120
Do you think he got a weird force sensation when he came back on the Halcyon?

1555
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,400
It's like I've been here before in a way.

1556
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,560
I've been here before.

1557
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,440
I can sense it.

1558
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,720
Where my spark of life first sparked.

1559
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:14,760
Spark of life first happened here.

1560
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,960
I was I was here once, but just a spooge.

1561
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:23,840
Dialogue that was cut from the end of the finale.

1562
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,280
Here's a compare contrast area that I would like to hit,

1563
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:32,760
and that is the range of musical entertainment on board.

1564
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:35,040
Yes, both vessels,

1565
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:38,640
because this is something we got a preview of very early on in the video

1566
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,360
with the Goldberg's guy.

1567
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:45,040
We got to meet Gaia in one of the strangest scenes ever filmed,

1568
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,600
where a woman is like, and you're going to meet this singer.

1569
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,400
And then she walks away and trails off and she gets quieter and quieter

1570
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,880
as she's explaining the thing that's behind the door that she's walking away from.

1571
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,960
And then the guy, the actor just walks in.

1572
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:03,240
There's a specific detail like and suddenly a singer appears out of nowhere.

1573
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,760
And that's something I'm curious about.

1574
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,320
If that's an important aspect of it, do they actually?

1575
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,720
Does Gaia appear out of nowhere?

1576
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:12,520
Or does that mean that a spotlight turns on?

1577
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:16,640
No. OK, so in storyline, I believe Gaia missed the boat

1578
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,120
and they have to go pick her up.

1579
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:22,200
And then but I don't think it's like a rise out of the floor.

1580
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,360
I think they walk through the crowd. OK.

1581
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:26,720
So she still by appears out of nowhere.

1582
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,240
It's like if the performer comes from the audience instead of the

1583
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,520
it's like if Rodney Dangerfield shakes hands from the back.

1584
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:38,120
They may first appear out of nowhere, like when they're like in the atrium,

1585
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,160
the main area or something.

1586
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:43,640
All right. Well, if Gaia appears out of nowhere, then that sounds cool.

1587
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,920
And then the initial video was accurate.

1588
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:49,560
But the point is, there's this yeah, there's the singer Gaia

1589
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:51,920
with a DJ.

1590
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:56,520
The DJ's name is Oyo, Oyo, Owani, Owani.

1591
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:01,000
Yeah. Yeah. Who is a a lizard of some kind

1592
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,600
who speaks Huttese.

1593
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,520
And now this this seems fun from quick videos I've seen.

1594
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,520
I don't really know the ins and outs of the show,

1595
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,200
but, you know, seems like some fun dinner entertainment, whatever.

1596
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:21,200
But does it can can Gaia compare

1597
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:24,440
to the Star Trek, the crew's in-house band,

1598
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,920
band 47.

1599
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,640
Forty seven is a big that's a big thing in Star Trek.

1600
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,760
Like that that numbers in Star Trek a lot.

1601
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,080
Does that sound familiar?

1602
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:37,000
Honestly, that's search.

1603
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,640
Yeah, I don't know.

1604
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,240
Remember that a department or something on the show?

1605
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:44,360
There's multiple references to it.

1606
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,840
It seems to be some sort of Easter egg thing that 47 in there a lot.

1607
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:53,040
Anyway, band 47's masterful mix of rock pop, R&B, funk and Klingon opera.

1608
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,200
OK, not really.

1609
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:57,520
Keeps everyone on the dance floor spinning like positive ions

1610
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,720
in a dilithium powered intermixed chamber.

1611
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:04,920
So band 47 is bringing the heat every night.

1612
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:07,480
And I've heard a little bit of the Gaia music and it seems all right.

1613
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,560
But I don't know if it compares to

1614
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:16,080
band 47's original song, which seems to be called Star Trek Cruise.

1615
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,560
Little princess.

1616
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:35,920
Yeah, great.

1617
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:38,760
Yeah, great.

1618
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:41,800
And then it's and this is over footage of the most revelry.

1619
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,520
And then again, you know, in disco wigs and everything.

1620
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,640
It's a heck of a song.

1621
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,080
I love it.

1622
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:51,320
There's a part in the video, one of the video you can see on the website

1623
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:54,560
where John Delancey is talking about his favorite things also on the ship.

1624
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:59,160
And he said his favorite things are seeing Star Trek actors get to do other stuff.

1625
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:03,000
And they flash to like I don't think they flash to Brent Spiner singing,

1626
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,760
but they flash to the guy who played to Valk on Star Trek Voyager

1627
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:09,000
with his own band, Tim Russ.

1628
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,040
So he gets the play.

1629
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:13,320
So like the music like there's such a wide variety of music.

1630
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:17,120
You have that band and then you have maybe like whoever's musical on Star Trek.

1631
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:21,200
They show up and do songs, too, because I even saw Ethan Phillips

1632
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:22,280
and some of the other act.

1633
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,440
Ethan Phillips was a neelix on Voyager.

1634
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:27,520
They're like doing like a four man a cappella group.

1635
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:29,960
And Dapper Dan. Exactly.

1636
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:34,120
So like the range, the variety is is there.

1637
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:36,440
You get to whatever your flavor is.

1638
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:41,840
Well, and look, I hope you didn't get your fill of crooning

1639
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:46,240
from Star Trek cast members before, because I found out something now.

1640
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:49,040
Regrettably, I don't know if this is ever going to happen again.

1641
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:53,920
This was a thing from the first voyage from the 2017 cruise.

1642
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:58,680
But there was a very special performance from somebody who

1643
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:03,520
only made one appearance, but made their mark and is still a part of the Star Trek family.

1644
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:07,720
They were on a season two episode of Star Trek, The Next Generation,

1645
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:09,720
playing a character called the comic.

1646
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,080
Do you know who I'm talking about? Mike, you're talking about Mr.

1647
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:17,360
Joe Piscopo. Joe Piscopo did a full

1648
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:21,960
I think multiple sets a night with his swinging big band

1649
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,920
on the maiden voyage and start on Star Trek.

1650
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,800
The Cruise one. Yes.

1651
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:29,480
With his band, The Pearls.

1652
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:31,760
It's a it's a hell of a set.

1653
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,480
And the entire thing, I'm making my way.

1654
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,720
I got about halfway through.

1655
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,640
I'm making my way through it.

1656
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:42,280
The one part that was pulled out specifically, I think, is worth

1657
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:47,920
playing and I think should I say, what's the funny way to reveal this?

1658
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:50,320
I see he's kind of like,

1659
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,720
well, first of all, he does like a little bit of like Trump material

1660
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:55,320
that could work for anybody, of course, which is like,

1661
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:56,880
we like Trump here.

1662
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:57,920
Yeah, I think so.

1663
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,240
You know, they look the guys.

1664
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,240
It's wild having him as president, right?

1665
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,920
You know, you got, you know, the guys you see in F-15 with his face

1666
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,000
on the side, you know, is dropping bombs.

1667
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,160
You know, they're made out of gold and gold bombs anyway.

1668
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:09,960
But you got to have it.

1669
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:12,080
You got to have Trump. And it's great.

1670
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:12,880
And you know what?

1671
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,240
My father was a member of the military, actually.

1672
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,760
And oh, great.

1673
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,160
Big applause for that.

1674
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,680
Can I have all the members of the military stand up here?

1675
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:21,560
All right. Great.

1676
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:24,360
So he gets this like military heartstrings pulled

1677
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:28,360
and then he's talking about his love for this country and for America.

1678
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:31,280
You know, I love America, but that sometimes that that Star

1679
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:34,240
Spangled Banner, you know, that doesn't always have like the kick

1680
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:35,000
that you want to.

1681
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Oh, no. Imagine if, uh,

1682
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,440
imagine if anyone want to guess where this is going.

1683
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:44,480
I'm going to guess instead of, oh, say, can you see?

1684
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:47,840
He says, oh, ring a ding ding.

1685
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,680
That's a pretty good guess.

1686
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,280
No, it's just the regular.

1687
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:54,640
What if the Star Spangled Banner was sung by old blue eyes

1688
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:57,160
by Frank Sinatra?

1689
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,960
Oh, say, can you see

1690
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,240
dawn's early light?

1691
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:10,880
What so proudly we hail at that?

1692
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:16,760
Hold on, hold on.

1693
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:20,120
Isn't there probably actual footage of Frank Sinatra singing

1694
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:21,880
the Star Spangled Banner?

1695
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:22,640
I don't wonder.

1696
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,600
I know it's like an event that happened.

1697
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,480
Yeah, you think he could.

1698
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:30,440
Yeah, I guess that's not the that isn't like some premise of like,

1699
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:33,280
what if Frank Sinatra sang gin and juice?

1700
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:36,080
That's not like it never have happened.

1701
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:39,480
Like, it's very possible he may have sung the Star Spangled.

1702
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,680
That's not the most outer space premise.

1703
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,080
Anyway, that being said, I love this.

1704
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,080
I love this, obviously.

1705
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,720
And I love every bit of the start start.

1706
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,880
Like the cruise.

1707
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:52,560
Uh, then he does a big medley of Johnny Cash songs.

1708
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:57,120
It walked the line, turns into Folsom Prison Blues,

1709
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:00,360
which then at some point turns into Cotton Eye Joe.

1710
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,240
What? I'm not sure.

1711
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,200
This is just his hat.

1712
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,480
He didn't like Taylor made a start.

1713
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:06,600
There's a little bit of this.

1714
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,520
Well, you know what he does is a lot of play.

1715
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,840
I mean, he he like talks about his experience being on set like,

1716
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,200
oh, it's crazy. You know, you look over and there's Whoopi

1717
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:17,680
and then you look and there's LeVar and he's wearing the the ting over his eyes.

1718
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,440
And boy, it's always great, though.

1719
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:22,440
And, you know, next generation, it's tough to replace the original cast.

1720
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,640
You know, that's what I had to do on Saturday Night Live,

1721
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,960
because, you know, those people, you know, think about Gilda Radner.

1722
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:30,000
How well let's hear it for Gilda Radner.

1723
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,600
So he's every five minutes applauded for the military, applauded for Gilda

1724
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,560
Radner, applauded for Trump and Hillary.

1725
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,800
Go every what will you applaud for?

1726
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,840
Because it won't be this music really quick.

1727
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:45,000
One more thing. And I swear this is the Piscopo part will be over.

1728
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,400
This is part of his medley of

1729
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,120
Johnny Cash songs, and he's imagining if what if other

1730
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,760
people sing Johnny Cash songs?

1731
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:55,320
Oh, yeah.

1732
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:59,680
Please guess who if this is loud enough, guess who he is doing

1733
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,680
an impression of right now.

1734
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:18,880
No idea.

1735
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:23,800
No, nothing.

1736
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:24,800
No, I don't have anything.

1737
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,480
I I can't even begin to guess.

1738
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:30,240
That is his impression of Michael Jackson.

1739
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:35,160
That was the only artist that came into my mind.

1740
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:36,160
Did it somehow?

1741
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:39,840
The feeling of like, well, if he was on another planet, maybe Michael Jackson.

1742
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,360
But like, Michael Jackson didn't sing like that.

1743
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:43,360
I he doesn't.

1744
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:48,360
He basically is doing a gay voice like a outdated stereotype.

1745
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,360
That was what I thought.

1746
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:52,680
Stereotype. That was what I did.

1747
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:53,680
This test on Aaron.

1748
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:57,760
And she said out loud, well, it can't be Michael Jackson because it can't.

1749
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,080
But no, but it can.

1750
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:04,600
But if you it's through Joe Pisco pose like Johnny Walker, red colored memory.

1751
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,080
It probably is coming up as Michael Jackson.

1752
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:14,200
Like, anyway, I mean, so this is this is great.

1753
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:15,840
Right. You've got.

1754
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,240
Yeah, right. Right. This is great.

1755
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:19,080
Yes. So good is what it is.

1756
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:22,840
And it's because you don't know where he's going to go with these impressions.

1757
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,880
And these are things that we know from our world, not outer space things.

1758
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:31,400
And that's what I think is great about Joe Pisco pose appearance on Star Trek.

1759
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:35,800
The crew needs to figure out where can we see this Joe Pisco show tonight?

1760
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,560
Gosh, I don't know.

1761
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,840
I went to a wedding in Staten Island a few years ago.

1762
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,480
And it was like a hotel complex where there was like a Hampton Inn

1763
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,000
next to a Hilton and stuff.

1764
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,520
And after the wedding, we went to the bar at the Hilton

1765
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:52,200
and it was a very, very tiny bar, but it had a very small stage.

1766
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:56,880
And it said, coming next week, Joe Pisco sold out.

1767
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:01,840
So Supper Club at a Staten Island Hilton Garden.

1768
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:05,880
Wow. First of all, that's going to be the hottest crowd for Joe Pisco.

1769
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:09,240
It feels like Pisco should be playing the Tello's over here.

1770
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,240
Yeah, that has to come out, right?

1771
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:15,160
If you think L.A. is not going to be friendly to if you're scared of this

1772
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:19,280
blue state, you're going to find the warmest welcome at the place

1773
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:22,440
where Robert Blake started the process of killing his wife.

1774
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:23,520
Yeah. Yeah.

1775
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:26,880
Frank Stallone has played the Tello's before a number of times.

1776
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:32,120
And Frank Frank is down in Mar-a-Lago with Joe, I think all the time.

1777
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:34,840
I'm looking at I clicked on the events

1778
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:39,280
website or the part of Joe Pisco, Pico dot org.

1779
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:43,560
And there is the on Saturday, September 11th.

1780
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,920
It just says September 11th. Never forget.

1781
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:48,200
Buy tickets to what?

1782
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:52,720
Is it you doing what jazz music or is it a what am I?

1783
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,800
Explain what I'm buying a ticket to, please.

1784
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,800
I there's no comedy. There is no impressions.

1785
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:03,240
There's no crooning. It's just him going like, and it's severe in the military.

1786
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:06,960
Stand up. Like it's just that portion of his act stretched to 90 minutes.

1787
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:10,120
You know, we never would have forgotten 9-11 Chairman of the Board.

1788
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:12,240
How about a hand for it?

1789
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:15,080
And then he sings Paul McCartney's Freedom as Frank Sinatra

1790
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:22,040
talking about freedom, talking about freedom.

1791
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:25,720
What if Frank led a prayer for everyone affected by 9-11?

1792
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,840
What would that have sounded like?

1793
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:34,840
You know, you know, Frank, you know, Frank and JFK were real tight.

1794
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:38,600
But did he give some information to certain some people who killed?

1795
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:40,120
You know, you never know.

1796
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:42,680
Lots of people were talking to each other back then.

1797
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:46,040
The mafia, the Cubans, everyone was pals in Vegas.

1798
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:50,080
I got you under my skin.

1799
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:54,120
And what if Michael Jackson had sung?

1800
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:56,840
Phil Harmon's impression was too mean spirited.

1801
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:59,600
Old Blue Eyes loved mine. The family didn't like it.

1802
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:00,520
They didn't like it.

1803
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,080
I knew the Irishmen.

1804
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:05,280
We did used to say he painted houses, but we knew what that meant.

1805
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:11,600
And what if Frank Sinatra had done a three way with Kylo Ren and

1806
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,680
no way with Leia Han?

1807
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:18,000
What would that have been like?

1808
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:21,600
I can't think of a good.

1809
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,440
So, yeah, look, how are you going to top that?

1810
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:26,080
This is the great this is what an event this is here.

1811
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:29,760
Look, OK, if we haven't sold the Star Trek cruise enough, one of the years,

1812
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:32,960
Gates McFadden, who played Beverly Crusher on the show,

1813
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,160
came out to introduce the whole cruise.

1814
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:36,520
She came up there.

1815
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:38,720
She had a sling and she said, I broke my arm.

1816
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,960
I fell down five concrete stairs.

1817
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:43,240
That was the start of the cruise.

1818
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:45,200
That was the start. That was the muster.

1819
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,080
That was the man.

1820
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,480
They fell down the stairs,

1821
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:51,240
Jason McFadden, she said she was feeling better, but she had broken her arm.

1822
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,600
And that's how they started the weekend for the week.

1823
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,920
All right. Off we go.

1824
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:59,120
And then there's I took a screenshot of it because there's

1825
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:01,040
sure she is with I don't know if you can see this.

1826
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:02,120
Sure, she's with the sling.

1827
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:05,880
And you can see one dancing shirtless man in the foreground.

1828
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:10,480
Already shirtless somehow.

1829
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,080
Yeah, the start of the cruise.

1830
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:15,600
I mean, I think a lot happens at that central pool area.

1831
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:19,840
Right. So, yeah, there's a lot of people show up ready to go.

1832
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:21,200
People are right.

1833
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:24,440
And if you can't bring liquor on board, then you got to.

1834
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,160
What are you going to do? But start before.

1835
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:29,400
I think some cruises you can prepay for alcohol.

1836
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,040
Oh, I see. So it's ready.

1837
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:33,760
Well, I think you just said that you could bring two bottles of

1838
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:37,200
your own wine or champagne, which also notches them above

1839
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:41,440
Star Wars Galactic Star Cruiser, which has lost a lot of points

1840
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,880
over the course of this episode.

1841
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,120
Yeah, I think so.

1842
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:48,960
But, you know, from their lack of your brain, your own wine to their lack of Piscopo,

1843
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:53,200
you know, Hollywood Squares based entertainment either.

1844
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:55,840
They don't have their own version of Hollywood.

1845
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:59,560
Star Trek has Star Trek, Star Trek Squares, where they put

1846
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:02,840
cast members in a Hollywood Square game show on stage.

1847
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:05,360
That is why you say that so defeated.

1848
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:09,000
No, not defeated. I'm trying to contain my glee at it.

1849
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,840
I'm trying to contain how much I want to see that.

1850
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:15,000
I'm trying to I'm actually imagining what are my nine

1851
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,720
most wanted cast members in the squares?

1852
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,000
It's a good question.

1853
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,600
Joe Piscopo is center, obviously.

1854
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:25,040
Joe Piscopo, Wallace Shawn.

1855
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:28,200
I'm going to give points to the Star Trek crews, too, because

1856
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,720
it just happened and it didn't cause

1857
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:35,960
a lot of people to turn into language experts

1858
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,760
and discuss the concept of the word worth.

1859
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:43,640
And what does this term really mean in the way that the Star Wars Hotel

1860
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:47,640
had a real semiotic effect that I did not see coming?

1861
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:49,080
How can you afford it?

1862
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:52,280
Well, can you afford to not have afforded it?

1863
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:57,800
Hoops Among Us has not considered worth and earthly dollars

1864
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:01,280
credits, as it's called in the galaxy far, far away.

1865
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:05,240
What was worth to the gods in the

1866
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:10,080
Odyssey, what was worth in our great fiction?

1867
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,640
It's hard. It's hard. It's changed over time.

1868
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:15,880
Meanwhile, the Star Trek cruise reviews like, yeah, I got drunk

1869
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:18,880
and sex with a woman who's just as a betasoid.

1870
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:21,240
Yeah, you should do it, too.

1871
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:23,080
Hell, yeah.

1872
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:26,040
Oh, yeah. Look, Cruz critic dot coms are great things.

1873
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:28,280
They're very complimentary.

1874
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:29,760
They're a tough audience.

1875
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:33,680
And look, with twenty twenty three with Star Trek, the cruise six coming up.

1876
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,360
Kate Mulgrew's joining the crew.

1877
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:39,160
She's going to be there. They're going to Cabo San Lucas.

1878
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:42,000
They're going to Puerto Vallarta.

1879
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,680
You know, who knows what old blue eye impersonators

1880
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,320
they might pick up along the way.

1881
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:50,440
And we know old yellow eyes is going to be there.

1882
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:52,200
We got tons of crooning.

1883
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:54,400
We're seeing tropical locales.

1884
01:33:54,400 --> 01:34:00,000
I mean, as opposed to one that's, you know, that doesn't go on the ocean at all.

1885
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:01,920
Yeah, no, it's true.

1886
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:05,800
I think as far as right now, I'm not going to put down the Star Wars thing.

1887
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:07,320
I haven't done it and I haven't done the Star Trek.

1888
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:12,400
But for my preference, I think right now I'm going to give the edge

1889
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:15,880
the big edge to Star Trek, the cruise.

1890
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:17,560
That's interesting, huh?

1891
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,440
So you would give it to Star Trek, the cruise.

1892
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:23,120
Well, as I look over kind of my opinions throughout this thing,

1893
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:27,040
I'd have to say, yeah, I think it is Star Trek, the cruise.

1894
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,680
Yeah, I don't. Huh.

1895
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:30,600
I wasn't sure where I was going to land. Right.

1896
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:31,920
I wasn't sure where you were going to land either.

1897
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:35,800
But I think I, you know, with with my apologies to Star Wars, the cruise,

1898
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:38,720
I think I have to give it to Star Trek, the cruise. Jason.

1899
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:43,720
Yeah, you know, I'd like to see the Star Wars thing myself.

1900
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:50,320
It's a lot of money to put down for a two day experience.

1901
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:55,160
And I have other expenses and other travel plan, both show and social plan

1902
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:57,800
coming up. So what a what a brag.

1903
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:00,320
You have things on your calendar.

1904
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:03,480
I have things on my calendar, you know, so, you know, you got to judge this stuff

1905
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:05,120
if you're an adult.

1906
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:09,640
So, yeah, I'm curious to see what happens with the Star Trek cruise.

1907
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:12,960
If they scale back the price point or extend the number of days

1908
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:16,200
as time goes on, because like, oh, you mean beyond the eight?

1909
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:18,520
I agree. I would. Star Wars, the cruise.

1910
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,440
No, no, no. I think you said it right the first time.

1911
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:22,960
I think they should take it up to like 17 days.

1912
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:24,600
I am sure that would be great.

1913
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:27,760
And I'm sure they could get even more activities and theme nights

1914
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,600
and cast members in there.

1915
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:32,000
In terms of the way I like to go on vacation,

1916
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:36,600
I heard the Star Wars thing is good for extroverts who like to play games.

1917
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:39,960
I would not particularly call myself either of those things.

1918
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:46,440
So I think the Star Trek cruise is closer to the way that I prefer to vacation.

1919
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:52,040
The option of doing something like, you know, thematic, something, you know,

1920
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:56,280
and then just taking naps and going to the pool, going to bars, relaxing,

1921
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:59,200
seeing the sights, seeing exotic ports of call.

1922
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:02,440
You know, I've never been to Mexico or the Bahamas.

1923
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:05,440
So points, points.

1924
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:08,800
Star Trek, I have to say, I might have to do Star Trek cruise.

1925
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:11,040
Might have to do a little research, watch some more of the shows

1926
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:12,600
so I know what I'm getting into.

1927
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,280
You know, make sure you can speak the language and play, you know.

1928
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:17,800
I know there's ample languages.

1929
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:21,000
There's no shortage of languages in the Star Trek universes.

1930
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:25,680
Yes. Can you can you say, do you want to swing in Klingon?

1931
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:28,120
That's the that's what you can right now.

1932
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:29,880
I cannot write out.

1933
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:32,680
But hopefully by next February, you can.

1934
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:37,200
You know, this has been fascinating to deep dive into the world

1935
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:39,720
of immersive star experiences.

1936
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:41,840
And I think we know our preference.

1937
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:45,720
But hey, it's up to you out there to go on your own star

1938
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:48,840
cruise adventure and see what you think, although I think we're pretty sure

1939
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:50,360
what you're going to think.

1940
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:51,160
Yeah, we agree.

1941
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:53,800
But yeah, obviously, like, you know, we have our preference

1942
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:55,120
and you probably will say Star Trek.

1943
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:58,160
Yes, better. But yeah, go do both and enjoy yourself.

1944
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:01,160
Just to say you did, just to say you covered all your bases

1945
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:04,880
in kind of the way that we said, well, I guess we should name

1946
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:06,680
check the Star Wars thing. Yeah.

1947
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:11,760
Briefly in an episode that's otherwise about the utter dominance of Star Trek,

1948
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:17,080
the cruise, you survived podcast, the ride Star Cruises edition.

1949
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:21,640
When we and I, you know, we should wrap it up and we probably don't have time

1950
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:25,440
to get into that other star cruise you found, Mike, which is in Branson.

1951
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:28,600
Well, there was a Branson had a star cruise in 2014.

1952
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,720
Apparently it ended then that beat all of them.

1953
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:31,880
Oh, my God. Yeah.

1954
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:33,320
And we don't have time to talk about.

1955
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:34,280
Oh, we can. Oh, yeah.

1956
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:36,760
That Jerry Springer was doing the prices right on it.

1957
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:42,440
Well, there's more game shows with that don't attach to the person doing them.

1958
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:44,080
This is incredible. Right. Yeah.

1959
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:45,560
There was we can't talk about that.

1960
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:48,400
We can't talk about country star McGillie

1961
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:51,040
and the fact that he was driving the boat for some reason.

1962
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:53,120
We can't talk about that.

1963
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:57,320
Oh, my gosh. The captain is like the characters they invented in Star Wars.

1964
01:37:57,320 --> 01:38:00,360
It's so fun. But it wasn't it wasn't also the musician.

1965
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:02,760
Yeah. But we know we don't have time to talk about it.

1966
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,560
We don't have time to talk about the down.

1967
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,160
This is also a day cruise, by the way.

1968
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:07,720
So you just be on there for a couple hours.

1969
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:10,560
We don't have time to talk about the fact that on one of the days

1970
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:14,240
you could see legends in concert, people doing lookalikes of

1971
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:17,640
of the Blues Brothers.

1972
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:20,440
Wow. Wow. Yeah. Yeah.

1973
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:21,880
You can meet them.

1974
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:26,000
People dressing up fake, fake blues guys.

1975
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,880
We don't have time to talk about the fact that Paul Harris

1976
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:33,840
and the Cleverleys would be doing the Gangnam style in a country music version.

1977
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:38,120
Wait for it.

1978
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:41,560
You know where it's coming, Jason.

1979
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:42,520
I know.

1980
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:47,920
I don't recognize this yet. Here we go.

1981
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:57,760
Oh, my gosh. We don't.

1982
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,400
Oh, we don't have time to hear all the time.

1983
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:02,080
We don't have time to hear every verse of this country.

1984
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:04,280
Gangnam style. Oh, shoot.

1985
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:05,640
Did we mess up this whole episode?

1986
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:07,000
We may have screwed this episode up.

1987
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:07,400
Oh, you know what?

1988
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:11,120
Also, we don't have time to talk about is the the acapella group six

1989
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:15,240
who was on this cruise to in 2014 and they have a video here.

1990
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:21,720
Oh, an acapella barber and we don't have time.

1991
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:22,760
Wow.

1992
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:25,960
Barbara and the official anthem of France and Missouri.

1993
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,800
We can't talk about it.

1994
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:32,800
We don't have time.

1995
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:33,960
We really don't have time.

1996
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:34,800
We don't have time.

1997
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,280
We've got to wind this down.

1998
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:40,040
Oh, there were probably people in this episode saying

1999
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:42,680
they're going to get which star cruise is the best wrong.

2000
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:44,680
And we did. We really got it wrong.

2001
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:47,600
It's this Branson 2014 that is no longer.

2002
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:51,680
It isn't operational and it was only a few hours one summer.

2003
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:59,160
I'm sorry. I it's killing me.

2004
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:01,240
But we don't have time. We really don't have time.

2005
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:04,200
Are they just reading the ports of call for the Star Trek?

2006
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:08,520
Oh, baby, why don't we go to Kokomo?

2007
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:10,360
Why don't we go? Oh, boy.
