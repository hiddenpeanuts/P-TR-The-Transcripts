00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
["The Cemetery Gate Theme"]

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,080
Welcome to Hauntcast, The Fright, The Cemetery Gate,

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,800
where you may come face to face with your ultimate fear,

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,320
explaining to your significant other why you pay money

5
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,880
to hear analysis of Daniel Roebuck films.

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,240
We'll figure out the names later,

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,360
I'm Scott Gardner,

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,520
any spooky names to come.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,440
I'm trying to explain how the podcast that started

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,160
as a theme park podcast got here too.

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,200
I thought though it was a theme park podcast,

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,800
and now it's a more Daniel Roebuck.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,580
More Daniel Roebuck.

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,440
Yeah, I'm like Carl, somebody you probably,

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,860
if you're paying us, you know, I think at this point.

16
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,480
Jason Sheridan is here.

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,360
Yeah, now I'm wondering about his filmography.

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,840
Like what else is, what am I forgetting?

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,920
Daniel Roebuck, of course, if you're just tuning in,

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,160
if this is your first second gate,

21
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,680
if this is the first episode of Podcast The Fright,

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,520
which would be very weird, but if it's popular.

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,720
Or if you heard it and you just don't remember that

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,400
kind of unremarkable name. Oh yes, if for some reason

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,960
you don't know the name Daniel Roebuck,

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,620
that is the man who played Jay Leno in the HBO movie,

27
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,760
The Late Shift, which is a topic we've done two and a half

28
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,680
hours on. A very long episode.

29
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,200
On Patreon. About.

30
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,640
And he comes up in today's episode as he takes the mantle

31
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,320
of the count.

32
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,680
Don't even get me started.

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,520
The convergence.

34
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,560
We'll get each other, we'll all get started

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,400
a little later.

36
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,280
Yes, so if you're wondering, I think there's two,

37
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,160
you can justify that we're doing this episode

38
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,120
for two reasons.

39
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,360
That it's Daniel Roebuck, somebody we've discussed

40
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,040
at length, and then we were talking about the Munsters

41
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,280
a lot, and then all of a sudden, around that same time,

42
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,600
this was announced that Daniel Roebuck was playing

43
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,800
Grandpa Munster.

44
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,240
It was suspiciously close.

45
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,600
It was crazy. I don't remember the timeline,

46
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,240
but yes, we got very fixated on Daniel Roebuck,

47
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,000
fake Leno, and then we talked about Grandpa,

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,480
separate from the other Munsters for a long time.

49
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,320
Yes, and the actor.

50
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,400
It's been a lot of Munsters discussion,

51
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,340
but then these two intro, fake Leno becomes fake Grandpa,

52
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,600
or fake Grand Poe, as I like to say.

53
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,440
Of course. Based off of one ad he did,

54
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,240
where he said, hey, it's me, Grandpa,

55
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,920
which may have been avoiding copyright.

56
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,600
Well, no, they're not avoiding copyright

57
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,760
by calling him the Count.

58
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,200
It's just a weird choice they made.

59
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,040
I don't know.

60
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,880
We got a lot of them.

61
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,600
Yeah, it's hard to...

62
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,000
Anyway, I enjoyed, I saw Daniel Roebuck

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,880
in an episode of The Parkers, the old UPN show,

64
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,640
with Monique and Countess Vaughn,

65
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,560
which is on Netflix, and it's a lot of fun.

66
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,720
Pretty reliable, yeah.

67
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,600
Genuine, very funny shit in that show.

68
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,720
And Daniel, I saw Daniel Roebuck in Gassed.

69
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,200
I gotta collect all the Roebuck performances.

70
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,800
He's in some bigger, I was trying to remember,

71
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,200
oh, I think he's agent Cody Banks' dad.

72
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,040
Oh, he is?

73
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,080
Wow. Wow, that's great.

74
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,480
Yep, yep, yep.

75
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,320
That's pretty big.

76
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,400
That's almost a title role.

77
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,120
Yeah, and he's been at it forever.

78
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,760
I know you said he had done some religious movies,

79
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,600
I believe.

80
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,160
Maybe lately in the...

81
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh, The Fugitive, that's the one.

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,640
And US Marshals, so that's a recurring role

83
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,840
in The Fugitiveiverse.

84
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,680
Oh, wow. Wow.

85
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,440
Okay, is he like on the team?

86
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,120
Fugitiveverse?

87
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,320
Yeah. That's more confusing.

88
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,320
I like it with extra bullshit.

89
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,280
Fugitiveiverse.

90
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,120
That's good, yeah.

91
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,160
Is he on Tommy Lee Jones' team, do we know?

92
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,000
Not sure.

93
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,120
He's a deputy marshal, that sounds like he's on the team.

94
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,720
Oh, I was gonna say US Marshals then.

95
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,560
Yeah, yeah.

96
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,800
Because US, yeah.

97
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,320
So yeah, he's in the...

98
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,560
But he's in a bunch of Rob Zombie movies.

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,800
Right, he's a player.

100
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,040
As is everyone who plays the primary monsters,

101
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,200
because it was baffling casting to me,

102
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,000
a person who does not pay a lot of attention

103
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,800
to the filmography of Rob Zombie.

104
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,640
Right.

105
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,600
But then like, oh, I see.

106
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,240
It is a lot of people who are in all of his things.

107
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,200
Those are his players, yeah.

108
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,640
We will dive into The Munsters,

109
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,240
a film released in this year, 2022,

110
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,120
but I'm told that Jason has a little bit of business.

111
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,960
Sure, yeah.

112
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,480
In the spirit of the season,

113
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,480
I have some treats before we get into the trick

114
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,440
of this movie. Oh, boy.

115
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,960
The trick being that this is even called a movie.

116
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,200
So I brought you guys some little treats back

117
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,520
for your children.

118
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,840
This is Mr. Taffy.

119
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,680
Oh, wow.

120
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,880
The mascot of Shriver's saltwater taffy

121
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,080
in Ocean City, New Jersey, St. Paul.

122
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,880
It's a little taffy, you boy.

123
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,600
Yeah, you each get a taffy.

124
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,440
I'm gonna toss it.

125
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,280
I'm gonna catch it.

126
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,120
Toss it, yeah.

127
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,960
Oh, boy.

128
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,280
Oh, I like seeing him come at me.

129
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,120
Mr. Taffy from Shriver's.

130
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,960
Yes.

131
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,280
Wow, thank you.

132
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,120
He's great.

133
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,160
He's a well-made for being a local.

134
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,080
This little, this is not extra figure.

135
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,800
This plush is only available at this taffy place.

136
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,720
It's very well done.

137
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,800
They have a bigger one too,

138
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,080
but the little ones are more tasteful.

139
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,920
Did you get us?

140
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,320
Scott and I, you gotta each get the bigger one too, right?

141
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,720
This is for the baby and this is for.

142
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,880
I bought three of them, two for your children

143
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,680
and one for my adult girlfriend.

144
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
Thank you.

145
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,120
And now I also have a real treat

146
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
because we didn't get the first iteration

147
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,840
of this on microphone.

148
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,040
I've got a can here, Scott,

149
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,320
for you to try of Coca-Cola Dream World

150
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,600
that if you wanna try that on here.

151
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,440
Is it cold at least?

152
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,480
It is cold.

153
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,600
Mikey, there's, just to be courteous,

154
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,440
here's one for you as well.

155
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,360
Oh, thank you, yeah.

156
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,440
Wait, now why, does this have anything to do with anything

157
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,400
or you just want me to have this shit?

158
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,720
Well, you had, so it's the second,

159
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,040
it's the new Coca-Cola Creations

160
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,040
is they've been doing these mysterious flavors

161
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,960
where they don't say what it is

162
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,240
and they just give it a fun name.

163
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,080
No.

164
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,000
And you had the Cosmos one, is that what it's called?

165
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,840
Starlight.

166
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,760
Starlight, okay.

167
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,520
And you had that and hated it

168
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,640
and now Jason wants you to try this

169
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,400
and see if you'll hate this equally, I think.

170
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,240
Okay, okay.

171
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,060
That's what I'm guessing is.

172
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,900
I'm curious.

173
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,720
The impetus.

174
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,560
I'm curious on this.

175
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,520
Some people like the can.

176
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,760
The can is cool.

177
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,280
Is this, I'm sorry, is this the one you were drinking

178
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,860
when you broke the news of your daughter?

179
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,200
Is this the type, you were,

180
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,240
there was a soda being discussed, you did a fake out.

181
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,080
You're like a little bundle of joy.

182
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,920
Yes, oh, it was, yeah, yeah, it was, it was.

183
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,760
Okay, okay, great.

184
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,600
This is the Zero Sugar

185
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,320
which I think is not as good as the regular.

186
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,480
In this instance, I thought that the Starlight

187
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,000
was actually better or at least the same.

188
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,840
So. All right.

189
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,920
I'm gonna try to sip off Mike.

190
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,760
I think you're gonna hate this is what I'm gonna say.

191
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,880
But it's, you're gonna hear the opening of the can.

192
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,720
All right.

193
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,540
I mean that's sad.

194
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,380
I hope you're not a problem with that.

195
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,220
Yeah, that's a good.

196
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,040
Everyone likes that sound.

197
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,880
That's a good noise, yeah.

198
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,720
That's refreshing.

199
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,200
That was me talking about the sound,

200
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,400
not the taste which I haven't had yet.

201
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,280
Okay, let's see.

202
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,760
It's, I would say again,

203
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,320
this is the flavor of dream.

204
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,920
I'm, this is dream flavor.

205
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,760
Dream world.

206
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,580
Dream.

207
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,880
This is my same feeling about the previous thing.

208
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,800
The previous flavor that is an idea.

209
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,840
Flavors are ideas now.

210
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,420
And that is that, I think the taste is okay,

211
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,720
but the after, it just like,

212
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,800
it's just like. That's the Zero.

213
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,160
Chemical swirl.

214
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,200
That's the Zero, yeah.

215
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,040
Yeah, yeah.

216
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,560
That's why you should have gotten the other.

217
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,480
Well, what's in a Zero?

218
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,600
How can it be called Zero and then whatever is in it.

219
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,440
Well, it's probably like. Wingers.

220
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,240
Aspartame, I assume.

221
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,680
It's probably the Aspartame.

222
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,000
But I think Cherry Coke Zero, I think is pretty good.

223
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,200
Yeah, but they all, look, I like Zeroes too,

224
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
but they do have a strange little,

225
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,040
yeah, it's Aspartame.

226
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,640
It's the little aftertaste.

227
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,680
And that's what that is.

228
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,960
It's the artificial sweetener.

229
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,000
I admittedly didn't like this one as much as Starlight.

230
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,800
I'm more of a Starlight fan, but I like.

231
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,040
So you like the flavor of Starlight

232
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,520
more than you like the flavor of dream world.

233
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,200
Yes, but I think Starlight Zero,

234
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,400
I liked better than Dream World Zero.

235
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,560
But I think Dream World Regular

236
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,280
is better than Dream World Zero.

237
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,120
Fair enough.

238
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,240
It just kind of tastes like apricots to me.

239
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,480
Sure. A little bit.

240
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,720
Like the hint of.

241
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,280
I'm baffled by these.

242
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,880
I mean, I like that, but it's like, where do we go from here?

243
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,320
Like this soda's, it's responsibility flavored.

244
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,040
It's Liberty flavored.

245
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,520
Well, I guess it could be like Mario.

246
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,280
It's consent flavored.

247
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,120
Now that's good.

248
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,040
I'm glad we're getting that idea into a flavor.

249
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,000
I agree.

250
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,760
It could be just like Mario Galaxy worlds.

251
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,400
It's like space and there's a dream world with clouds.

252
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,600
And then we go to like a sand world or something.

253
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,200
Or then there's a big, everything's big, big world.

254
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,840
So it could be like that.

255
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,480
I like the abstraction

256
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,320
because none of these flavors are like a real item anyway.

257
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,120
Why not get crazy with it?

258
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,880
Well, at least you got a Mr. Taffy out of the bar.

259
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,000
Sure did.

260
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,400
That's a one out of two.

261
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,220
I think you're right.

262
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,020
Aspartame, I don't know what's going on with that.

263
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,860
Let's see aspartame, yeah.

264
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,620
I don't, yeah, I'm gonna keep that.

265
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,260
If you drink, I mean, don't drink diet soda,

266
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,980
but if you drink diet soda, you get used to it

267
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,460
or you hate it, yeah.

268
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,980
Yeah.

269
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,220
Okay, so well, thank you for this.

270
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,820
And I will cherish Mr. Taffy.

271
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,340
He really is, he looks like, he's like gray.

272
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,420
So he's like unflavored Taffy.

273
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,260
Yeah.

274
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,340
I guess, well, it's not always colored.

275
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,140
Yeah, it usually is.

276
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,940
Yeah, usually the color is just to like trick your mind.

277
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,900
The color doesn't, all the flavor in me.

278
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,740
That's a different.

279
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,900
Could be white, but it's usually just to differentiate, yeah.

280
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,340
Uh-huh.

281
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,820
And is there a big Mr. Taffy wandering around?

282
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,940
There is a walk around Mr. Taffy.

283
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,060
Wow, oh boy.

284
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,980
I don't think I've previously familiar with a Taffy,

285
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,300
with a walk around Taffy.

286
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,820
I don't know if it's the only one.

287
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,020
That's the first I'm aware of.

288
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,820
So it sets the bar and I approve of Mr. Taffy.

289
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,940
I just wanna let the listener know,

290
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,380
he's an anthropomorphic piece of Taffy.

291
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,700
He's got little blue foot, like footies or shoes.

292
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,740
He's got two blue wristbands.

293
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,020
He's got a blue vest and no pants and a bow tie.

294
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,940
And I'm looking at him like he's like walking up

295
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,940
to my laptop, looking right at a picture of Daniel Roebuck.

296
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,940
Like he wants to be friends with him.

297
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,260
Slightly different coloring and he could be Mr. Sausage.

298
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,100
Yep.

299
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,940
With the way that the top of his head goes.

300
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,180
Oh yeah, true, and then the little tie off at the top.

301
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,300
Yeah, that could be Sausage casing, absolutely.

302
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,780
Well, thank you for this, Jason.

303
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:14,780
And I think we need the positivity going in today.

304
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,900
I'm trying something different.

305
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,060
I'm trying to inject some positivity.

306
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,420
We are kicking off HOTCAST The Fright season,

307
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,020
which I am excited about.

308
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,980
And we are doing it with this,

309
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,020
with the newest, biggest horror film.

310
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,460
By saying that, I'm ignoring a couple of these ones

311
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,780
that people like a lot, with Smile and.

312
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,860
Oh yeah, yeah.

313
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,700
What's the other one?

314
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,540
Barbarian and Pearl.

315
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,100
Yeah, which I need to see all these films.

316
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,020
Instead, we took some time to watch The Munsters

317
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,860
as made by Rob Zombie.

318
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,460
So again, we know why we're here.

319
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,380
This was a real triangulation of.

320
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,260
We had to do it.

321
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,940
Of HOTCAST The Fright interests.

322
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:02,180
And yeah, I mean, well, what's some stuff to say about it

323
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,420
at the top?

324
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,300
I mean, this has been building for a little while

325
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,340
and people might've expected us to do an episode about it.

326
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,100
I saw a lot of chatter, kind of internet wide,

327
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,780
not even in our little bubble,

328
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,140
but about the trailer,

329
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,860
because the trailer really set the tone.

330
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,140
The trailer was a pretty jaw-dropping trailer.

331
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,540
Well, I hate to, okay, so there was a first trailer

332
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,540
that was a teaser that was just the intro,

333
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,500
like the old school black and white intro.

334
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,860
Then the second trailer is the one

335
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,220
I think you're talking about, right?

336
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,340
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

337
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,180
Yeah, essentially the opening sequence of the show

338
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,780
where Herman bursts through a door.

339
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,100
Again, and here's the big,

340
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,140
if you don't intend on watching any of this,

341
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,020
the monsters, of course, this family,

342
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,300
this all-American family of monsters,

343
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,620
and the show was just a sitcom about their misadventures,

344
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,060
but the movie turned out to be a prequel

345
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,220
showing how the family came together.

346
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,460
Yeah, and that made me pretty mad.

347
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,100
I wasn't really pleased with that choice.

348
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,500
Yeah, meaning A, because in the trailer,

349
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,100
that is maybe the big reveal of the trailer,

350
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,820
is that they call it a love story,

351
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,820
they couch it in some further terminology,

352
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,820
but it is about, so it's a prequel

353
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,140
to a really silly 60s sitcom,

354
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,540
where you find out how the silly characters got together

355
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,180
and the in-law obstacles

356
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,940
that were in the way of them getting together.

357
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,860
So therefore, it is Viva Rock Vegas.

358
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,140
That is what we're watching.

359
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,820
It is the Viva Rock Vegas of the monsters.

360
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,780
Though in this case, it is just called the monsters,

361
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,980
which really confuses it.

362
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,740
It's not becoming the monsters.

363
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,580
The monsters begins.

364
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,420
It's not the pre-monsters.

365
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,260
Monsters' origins, the beginning.

366
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,580
Monsters rising.

367
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,380
Will you be my monster?

368
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,660
Will you take this woman to be your awfully wedded monster?

369
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,220
It is none of those things.

370
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,060
That's true.

371
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,980
That's the majority of it,

372
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,300
but it's also like there's three other plots going on

373
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,100
that just sort of, they don't end concisely.

374
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,660
They just kind of are lingering,

375
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,660
and then nothing comes of it.

376
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,860
I think the same. Meandering, you might call.

377
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,740
Pretty quickly watching this, I was like,

378
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,620
you know what I think I like about the monsters?

379
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,900
That it is a family of cartoonish monsters

380
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,220
and their normal looking niece,

381
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,700
and they just do kind of stock sitcom plots.

382
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,540
Yes.

383
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,460
And they think they're normal.

384
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,580
They think they're an average,

385
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,660
they were the average American family

386
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,140
at the end of the block.

387
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,460
I think you're correct about that.

388
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,020
I think you're right.

389
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,700
That's all the prem, yeah, that's all good stuff

390
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,820
that makes it fun and special.

391
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,780
The hijinks. Fun and specific.

392
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,020
That's the backbone,

393
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,860
and obviously they get into hijinks.

394
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,820
I saw a couple of few months ago where one,

395
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,700
they go camping, and of course one of them gets hammered

396
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,980
into the ground.

397
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,500
I believe it's Herman, so he's like a totem pole.

398
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,380
One, Herman goes to try to sort something out

399
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,740
at Maryland's college,

400
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,980
and they think he's their new football prospect,

401
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,860
so he does a bunch of football practices.

402
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,460
Okay, I watched one today where Herman is recruited

403
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,180
by the Dodgers to play baseball.

404
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,180
I mean, that's great.

405
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,300
Are there real Dodgers in it?

406
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,140
Yes, yes.

407
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,700
Whoa, do you know who?

408
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,540
Do you know who in your brain is?

409
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,380
Shoot, DeRosha?

410
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,220
DeRosha?

411
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,060
DeRosha?

412
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,940
Did they get Sandy Kovacs?

413
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,980
No, I don't think so.

414
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,820
Okay.

415
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,420
What's the guy's name?

416
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,260
I, Leo DeRosha.

417
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,100
Okay.

418
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,780
He plays himself, he recruits Herman for the Dodgers.

419
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,620
Okay.

420
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,900
I've said this before on the show.

421
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,260
The main thrust of the show is that they put Herman,

422
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,060
played by a guy named Fred Gwynn, who was very tall,

423
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,860
they put Herman, who's dressed like a Frankenstein,

424
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,140
in a lot of silly outfits.

425
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,460
That's the main comedy of the show,

426
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,340
and I mean that in a fun, a good way.

427
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,260
Yeah, yeah.

428
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,820
We might, maybe I said exactly this before,

429
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,260
but you know, you talk about,

430
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,700
there's that comedy phrase, hat on a hat,

431
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,420
and that is all that the show is.

432
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,260
Yes, yes.

433
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,140
It is a family of monsters who then have to dress

434
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,980
as other stuff on top of their monster look.

435
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,580
There's like a single joke that they run into the ground

436
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,220
every episode, is that the monsters think

437
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,860
scary things are good, and think normal things are weird.

438
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,460
This is a joke that is overused on each episode

439
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,980
a million times, some of them funny, most of them you go,

440
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,100
well, you kinda heard that joke in the last episode.

441
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,580
But the other thing is that Herman,

442
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,820
like Homer Simpson in many times,

443
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,180
gets like a new job every episode.

444
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,020
Yeah.

445
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,300
And does something silly.

446
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,500
Ends up in some scenario where people find it unusual,

447
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,700
but are not like, oh my God, you're a monster,

448
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,780
I should run.

449
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,620
Right.

450
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,980
It's just people are like a little quizzical at most,

451
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,380
but they allow him to do the job,

452
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,100
often be very good at the job,

453
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,620
but then it just kind of ends of its own accord.

454
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,660
Now, I would also say, I guess I simplified too much.

455
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,700
The show also is lives and dies because Fred Gwyn

456
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,220
and Al Lewis are funny.

457
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,060
Yes.

458
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,300
The two of them are funny.

459
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,900
Fred Gwyn is very funny at playing like a little boy man,

460
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,860
who's very selfish and insecure and conceited.

461
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,860
Waves his arms around in a mildly disturbing,

462
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,460
he does like, ah, ah, ah, ah.

463
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,700
He like a toddler, it's very strange.

464
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,700
He's legit really funny.

465
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,020
There's an episode today I also watched

466
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,500
because I had to get the taste out of my mouth.

467
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,300
I know what you're talking about, getting taste saved.

468
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,140
Yeah, yeah.

469
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,260
The aspartame of the fakeness of the new monsters.

470
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,420
Yes, all that's, vurver, it's a metaphor.

471
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,660
What if the whole movie was aspartame?

472
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,500
There's a whole,

473
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,580
Herman is, two guys are trying to run an insurance scam,

474
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,700
so they fool Herman into thinking he's a movie star.

475
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,300
And they keep like setting up shots

476
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,820
so he can get hurt accidentally,

477
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,780
so they can collect money.

478
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,740
And it's like these character actors like,

479
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,620
yeah, here's what we gotta do, yeah.

480
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,380
And then they fool Herman into thinking he's a movie star.

481
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,900
So by the end, he's wearing like a beret

482
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,900
and he's smoking a long cigar and he's very conceited.

483
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,740
And he like, now he won't do the lines as is.

484
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,940
And it's really funny.

485
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,020
It's funny, it's a big cartoon and Fred Gwynn,

486
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,260
very funny in it.

487
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,740
The makeup is like so entrancing to watch.

488
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,500
Yes, there's the look also.

489
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,220
Like we talked about Garfield being just like,

490
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,460
mostly the look is why you like Garfield.

491
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,300
Yeah.

492
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,580
Because the drawings, it's similar to here.

493
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,740
It's very fun to look at him and El Lou.

494
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,980
Like it's those two characters, and Eddie,

495
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,340
and his wife.

496
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,180
Well, I can't think of his wife.

497
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,140
Lily. Lily.

498
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,980
Thank you.

499
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,820
Oh yeah.

500
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,500
Garfield gets a lot of mileage.

501
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,180
I forgot whether I said this on the episode,

502
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,740
but the various ways he finds to utilize

503
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,860
his little rectangular bed.

504
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,940
The little purple bed with the blue blanket.

505
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,860
It's fun to look at the drawings, yes.

506
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,700
He scrunches up like a cat.

507
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,980
Sometimes he's laying sprawled out on it.

508
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,500
And it's satisfying.

509
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,700
All the ways he finds to be lazy,

510
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,020
like a real cat that they lie crazy sometimes.

511
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,140
Okay, so I think we've,

512
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,420
okay, the monsters didn't run forever.

513
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,620
There wasn't maybe the most legs for this concept.

514
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,260
It went, it's a bizarre,

515
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:24,260
the numbers are like 37 episodes a season.

516
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,660
Two seasons.

517
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,260
Yes, there was like 70 episodes.

518
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,260
Yeah, a ton.

519
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,620
But all on Peacock, you guys might've discovered.

520
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,860
So yes, we've broken down what's funny

521
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,340
about the monsters here.

522
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,100
I don't know that Rob's happy knows

523
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,140
what's funny about them.

524
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,300
He puts Herman in outfits, I'll give him that.

525
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,380
So he knows that's funny.

526
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,260
But other than that.

527
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,820
Now, let's say this.

528
00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:00,060
In his defense, he is for sure a big monsters fan.

529
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,220
A huge monsters fan for decades.

530
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,180
I've heard this, yes, for years.

531
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,020
He has this song.

532
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,940
In the most, yes, there's the song,

533
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,660
Dracula, which is where some of the confusion is.

534
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,740
What was it again?

535
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,820
The Dracula is grandpa's car, not the monster's car,

536
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,980
which is the monster's coach.

537
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,780
But the monster's coach is in the video for Dracula.

538
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,620
Yes, I think.

539
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,740
It's confusing the entire.

540
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,580
Yes.

541
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,220
Well, doesn't that tell you a little bit

542
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,980
that he's clearly a fan.

543
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,820
Yes.

544
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,620
And the fandom is further proven by his cribs,

545
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,460
which I watched today.

546
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:41,460
Then the cribs, there's so much monster in his house.

547
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,220
He mentions them a lot.

548
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,460
The movie is called here.

549
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,940
No, Here Come the Monsters was a later.

550
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,900
That was like a 90s Fox.

551
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,860
Monsters Go Home, is that the name of?

552
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,140
Monsters Go Home is the original casting.

553
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:54,980
Yeah.

554
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,380
He does not only a poster in his house.

555
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,020
He apparently does a commentary on the DVD for this film.

556
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,860
Okay.

557
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,740
So he's been versed in monsters fan.

558
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,300
Yeah, yeah, really associated.

559
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,540
Maybe like is the reason he's even like

560
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,300
his scary guy persona.

561
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,420
You know, like I like.

562
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,260
Could be, yeah.

563
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,540
There's a chance that without the monsters,

564
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,740
he's not like doesn't model his whole band

565
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,860
and his whole life after like horror and.

566
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,340
And the fact that he like, I don't know much about the guy,

567
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,820
but you know, you compare to a Marilyn Manson

568
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,420
who seems like a horrible man.

569
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,260
Yes.

570
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,180
The Rob Zombie seems like, well, he's got this like,

571
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,780
he's like married forever and she's in the movie

572
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,220
and she's in all the movies and they get along great.

573
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,060
Yes.

574
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,260
And like even the house seemed nice.

575
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,980
I felt like the house was a crazy monster house,

576
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,780
but there was just a regular kitchen and like,

577
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,020
and people seem to have respect for these films

578
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,740
that he makes, which I've never seen one of them,

579
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,340
but people enjoy them and he like, I don't know.

580
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,020
I, I get, I don't, I maybe I'm missing some bad stuff.

581
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,860
No, I think you're.

582
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,700
Like he's kind of a normal guy.

583
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,540
Yes.

584
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,940
Monster garb, much like the monsters.

585
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,780
Yes, I agree.

586
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,380
I'm glad you said that up top on this episode

587
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,140
to make sure before we start talking about the movie.

588
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,220
I do think I like, this is the whole thing I have with it

589
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,820
is that as though I'm watching it and not enjoying it,

590
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:16,060
spoiler, I am like, you know, do your thing, Rob.

591
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,060
Like his little industry, which I've never checked out,

592
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,220
but I love a good little bubble of media

593
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,660
that is not hurting anybody.

594
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,780
Seems like people like Rob Zombie's movie,

595
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,460
cool, have at it.

596
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,460
This doesn't ruin me watching the monster, the old monster.

597
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,780
No, no, no, nothing like that.

598
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,140
And I will also say, what if we,

599
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,340
what, what if we played the monsters more straight?

600
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,460
I guess not even straight.

601
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,220
What if we focused on the horror elements a little

602
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,140
was also the thinking I think behind the Brian Fuller,

603
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,900
Brian Singer pilot mocking.

604
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,740
For sure.

605
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,900
Where it's like, let's take it a little more seriously.

606
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,500
This, I think trying to be a little more comedic.

607
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,580
A little more.

608
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,220
Yeah, but.

609
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,500
Speaking of director monsters.

610
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,340
We got to one.

611
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,340
Yeah.

612
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,260
I was gonna say the movie is full of comedy music.

613
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,100
Yeah.

614
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,940
Yeah.

615
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,900
Yes.

616
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,180
Which is, do you guys have any sense

617
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,900
of the previous Rob Zombie movies?

618
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,700
Are they gory and not like this in any way?

619
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,740
Devil's Rejects, very gory.

620
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,780
Yeah, there are rated horror movies.

621
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,620
Yeah.

622
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,540
Yeah, and nothing he's done is a bit of PG comedy.

623
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,700
For sure that, but I wanted,

624
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,140
this movie made me wonder if they're all a little campy.

625
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,980
Oh.

626
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,940
And maybe perhaps not even crazy bloody.

627
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,100
If like his style is just more like pulp,

628
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,340
kind of silly even in its horror.

629
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,140
But it sounds like they are like.

630
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,980
Grindhousey.

631
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,820
Sort of hardcore.

632
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,660
Okay, okay.

633
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,500
Yeah.

634
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,940
Yeah, I mean he did one of those fake grindhouse trailers

635
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,420
for the movie Grindhouse.

636
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,260
Yes.

637
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,100
Oh yeah.

638
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,100
And Devil's Rejects is I think a year or two before that.

639
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,180
That was very big in the 2000s there for a while.

640
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,020
Kind of grindhousey.

641
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,660
I'm not steeped in Mr. Zombie's work.

642
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,060
I've seen the Devil's Rejects.

643
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,820
And I'm trying to remember.

644
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,420
That's like gross I think.

645
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,660
It's kind of gross.

646
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,500
Okay.

647
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,320
Okay.

648
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,900
But obviously he has a love for, yeah, campy.

649
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,940
The amount of like Dutch angle,

650
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,540
like Batman, 60s Batman angles in this movie.

651
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,980
I could be wrong, but I bet he's a fan of that too.

652
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,820
Yeah, yeah, I bet.

653
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,640
Yeah, yeah.

654
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,540
Which all made me want to root for it, but you know.

655
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,060
I wanted to, okay, I wanted to root for it too.

656
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:30,540
And even in the first 20 minutes, I remember,

657
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,700
I go, okay, I don't.

658
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,340
Because a lot of the chatter around the trailer

659
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:40,340
was like very digitally, the audio felt unfinished.

660
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,900
Yes, yeah.

661
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,540
And you're like, well, this is other movies

662
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,900
didn't look like this.

663
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,340
This looks like a sketch or something.

664
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,180
Like this looks like a iPhone sketch or something.

665
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,660
It kind of looks like an episode

666
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,800
of like the Goosebumps TV show.

667
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,640
Yes.

668
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,620
Yeah.

669
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,980
But all that to say, I'm watching it and I go,

670
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,980
you know what, I actually don't hate how this looks.

671
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,820
I don't hate it.

672
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,660
This is exactly where I was at.

673
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,380
We're very in tandem.

674
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,900
First 10 minutes, 20 minutes,

675
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,420
because there's a big clunky looking robot.

676
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,060
There's some pretty interesting makeup,

677
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,900
but it's very lo-fi, but it's fun.

678
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,620
And aesthetically, and you're like,

679
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,060
okay, I guess it's cheap, but he's throwing this

680
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,980
green light on everything.

681
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,100
But I don't hate the look of this.

682
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,000
You could make a fun movie, a fun, really low budget movie

683
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,660
with the sets and the lighting and the costumes.

684
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,500
Sure.

685
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,820
Basically how I just decorated my front yard

686
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,180
is green and purple lights.

687
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:38,620
I used the visual language of the monster.

688
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,460
So it works as Halloween decorations, for sure.

689
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,100
That is the lighting, the holo,

690
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,420
it is like good Halloween colored lighting,

691
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,500
or like a Fangoria magazine photo spread.

692
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,340
Sure.

693
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,460
The other elements, I think Jane and I

694
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,700
both came to the conclusion of like,

695
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,420
some of this feels like a student film.

696
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:07,220
And then I had it all, I went up to with a student film

697
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,860
where one very rich alumni gave them a donation

698
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,340
and they spent it all on lighting package, like all on.

699
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,260
We have the best, these student films

700
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,100
are gonna look amazing.

701
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,340
We have the best lights you can check out from the cage.

702
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,860
But cameras, not so much.

703
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,220
No, you're just gonna shoot on your iPhone anyway.

704
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,500
480 or 720 or something.

705
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,420
Yeah, yeah.

706
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,340
Well, so some of this is because,

707
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,380
there was certainly the question of why not black and white?

708
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,980
And the original teaser was black and white,

709
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,780
that looks like the opening of the show.

710
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,540
And they were, and like photos from the set

711
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,940
were black and white, so people were thinking,

712
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,900
you know what I thought the whole time

713
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,340
was that the movie was about the making of the show.

714
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,780
I thought it was a behind the scenes

715
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,700
of the monsters or something.

716
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,620
Or that I pictured like a much darker,

717
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,060
I thought it was gonna be like a fucked up monsters.

718
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,860
Oh, well, when somebody said it was PG,

719
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,860
I was like, oh, he's just gonna do it, huh?

720
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,860
Yeah, yeah.

721
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,220
So I thought maybe initially that was something like that.

722
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,500
But yeah, once it was like, oh, this is a PG movie,

723
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,900
I'm like, oh, I think he's just gonna try to do it.

724
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,660
And make it for families and stuff.

725
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,140
Yeah, yeah, well, so it's not black and white

726
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,620
at the studios insistence.

727
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,660
That was the one thing they thought that would limit

728
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,380
the audience for it.

729
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:24,060
So this technicolor green purple thing

730
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,500
we're talking about was his attempts to make it

731
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,060
not just kind of a blah looking thing.

732
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,900
Right.

733
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,020
So I'm exactly with you, 15, 20 minutes.

734
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,460
I'm like, I think maybe this was an interesting choice.

735
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,580
And then why did we turn?

736
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,940
Was there just too much of it?

737
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,100
Do you just get tired of?

738
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:47,100
Well, I think where I really turned was,

739
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:52,220
Herman shows up, it takes 30 minutes for Herman to show up.

740
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,180
And I think I checked the time and I went,

741
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,580
well, hold on a second here.

742
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,260
This movie's two hours long.

743
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,980
Herman is showing up 30 minutes in.

744
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,820
What are we doing?

745
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,060
Like, what are we doing here?

746
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:07,020
That was a big, you know, I know this is not a horror film,

747
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,340
but when I checked the runtime at the beginning

748
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,460
and saw an hour 50, it gave me quite a fright.

749
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,580
Uh-huh, yeah, so I was like, too,

750
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,180
that's a kind of a long, whatever.

751
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,700
I'm not anti long movie, but I went, okay.

752
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,620
And then Herman, it takes 30 minutes and you're like,

753
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,820
okay, this is really slow.

754
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,580
I'm really this kind of, it's like,

755
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,140
there's a fatigue that set in for me around that time

756
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,060
that I think that's probably when most people,

757
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,780
if they had an optimistic feeling of like,

758
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,020
well, it looks kind of interesting for a low budget movie

759
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,900
and okay, like there's some supporting actors,

760
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,420
I feel like they're doing some interesting stuff

761
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,740
for making a meal of things and you could kind of like,

762
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,140
oh, okay, that looks so, okay.

763
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:54,900
The Nosferatu guy is, Lily goes on a date with,

764
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,900
I will say that he's already kind of fundamentally blows

765
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,020
the joke of the monsters there,

766
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:03,660
cause it's like, Lily would like the weird vampire man.

767
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,700
She would, like the joke,

768
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,380
Lily goes on a date with a Nosferatu guy,

769
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,140
she's not with Herman yet and she's like,

770
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,860
disgusted by, so weird and she doesn't like him.

771
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,140
And I was like, but the joke of the monsters is

772
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,740
she should be out with like a handsome man

773
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,140
who makes a lot of money, who looks normal.

774
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:18,980
Yeah.

775
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,820
That's already, he's already-

776
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,220
Yes, and that would just go like the guys out there,

777
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,500
they're monsters. Yeah, right.

778
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,820
And they should all be handsome men.

779
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,940
He's already blown the main joke of the monsters.

780
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,660
That's the joke of every episode

781
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,660
and it's already out the window.

782
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,860
The rules are kind of wobbly, I would say.

783
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,860
Very wobbly.

784
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,700
Because- The logic,

785
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,260
internal logic of the movie,

786
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,500
skipping to the end, but-

787
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,340
Yeah.

788
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,420
You see humans throughout the whole movie

789
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,020
and then the end of the movie is Herman seeing humans

790
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,220
when they move to America and him freaking out.

791
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,780
And I, well, Lindsay was watching the movie with me

792
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,500
at this point, she goes, he saw-

793
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,980
Yeah, they were in a cafe in Paris.

794
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,220
Yes, they saw humans in Paris and they didn't flip out

795
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,940
and now he sees humans and he's flipping out

796
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,780
and he thinks they're weird.

797
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,740
Like if they had established the whole movie,

798
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,820
like they'd never, they only saw monsters before,

799
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,900
that's one, but like they'd been with humans already.

800
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,740
Yeah.

801
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,820
You're like, what, huh?

802
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,380
I have two notes back to back.

803
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,620
One says 30 minutes in, this is brutal.

804
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,860
And then one says, there's still 40 minutes left.

805
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,100
Yeah. Yeah.

806
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,580
And then what's funny is we're watching it

807
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:23,180
and they have this whole like subplot of going to America

808
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,780
and then it just, like just started and we clicked

809
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,820
and I go, there's only 10 minutes left.

810
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:32,820
Yes, the last bit of the movie feels like a backdoor pilot.

811
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,060
It feels like they're setting up the status quo

812
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,580
of the monsters.

813
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,460
Right, but nothing is like resolved.

814
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,020
There's nothing feeling like resolved feeling.

815
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,060
It's just- The stories don't really.

816
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,180
Nothing has a resolution.

817
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,660
It's really strange.

818
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,860
It's like on top of just like certain elements not working,

819
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,420
none of the stories feel like they've been resolved

820
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,380
at the end.

821
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,700
They just sort of, the plots are left dangling.

822
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,820
I guess so like, oh, now you see the monsters TV show

823
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,820
to see what happens, but it's, imagine a movie

824
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,620
where nothing, I mean, I guess it's sort of like Marvel,

825
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:09,220
but even Marvel and their worst outings,

826
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,740
they try to give you like some feeling of resolution,

827
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,140
even though they want you to watch the next 10 things.

828
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,220
Well, and it's a bold move to not be conclusive

829
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,300
when the movie you're talking about has all of the promise

830
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,660
of the monsters 2022 as opposed to,

831
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,580
I guess the first Marvel we did not know

832
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,060
there would be 50 Marvels,

833
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,820
but I don't think there will be 50 monsters.

834
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,340
I don't know.

835
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,380
I think it was watched a lot, maybe the first week.

836
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,620
It was in the top 10 of-

837
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,460
Is that, that's good.

838
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,180
At a top 10 on Netflix.

839
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,020
Yeah.

840
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,860
It's good.

841
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,100
And they still, they cancel shit in the top 10.

842
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,940
That's true.

843
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,620
All the time, but so it's not that good.

844
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,980
Good point.

845
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,220
But it's still like, you're kidding, really?

846
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,060
Yeah.

847
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,620
Is that just, is it his fandom?

848
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,020
Is it, it's a name?

849
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,420
I don't want to, I, I, I'd like to think

850
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,860
that it's all big monster heads out there,

851
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,140
but how many of those are still alive?

852
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,180
There is some buzz though.

853
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,620
I will say to just the, oh, there's a new monsters.

854
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,580
Like I've seen people that aren't like people

855
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,220
I know a little bit on Twitter and everyone's like,

856
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,540
I'm watching the new monsters.

857
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,260
And I'm like, oh, I guess everyone is watching this.

858
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,700
People were intrigued by zombie X monsters.

859
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,940
It is, it makes a lot of sense on paper.

860
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,300
And then you just, but then you're,

861
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,700
you maybe feel like you're not getting enough.

862
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,300
Maybe you're not getting enough of either side, you know?

863
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,380
It's not the, like the grittiness that seemingly

864
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,220
is in the zombie for the Rob Zombie films.

865
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:37,220
And then it's not like, it's, it's not not funny.

866
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,140
It's not like, not everything fails, but then it's not like,

867
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,780
but it was like joke professionals doing the monsters.

868
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,020
And it was tight.

869
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,340
There was a new thing every 10 seconds,

870
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,340
which this is not.

871
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,300
No, I said, I was like, there's no,

872
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,700
there's like a joke every five minutes.

873
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,780
That doesn't necessarily land.

874
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,620
Yeah.

875
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,420
It's joke islands.

876
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:04,420
I think struggling, I mean, a big thing in like

877
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:08,420
comedy classes is like, okay, this is the like,

878
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,500
not fun part, but you have to establish a base reality.

879
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,340
What's called a base reality of like, okay,

880
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,180
this is a world, this is a normal world.

881
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,220
So if people are walking around wearing like, you know,

882
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,380
shoes on their heads, it's weird.

883
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:27,100
If it's a world where everyone wears the shoe on their head,

884
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,300
that's normal then, okay?

885
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:33,380
And this movie, most of it takes place

886
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,460
in a cartoony Transylvania,

887
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,580
and then eventually ends up in a cartoony,

888
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:43,140
like modern 50s America.

889
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:48,140
Like so, but it's hard to go, like, it's not playing,

890
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,700
it's playing by its own rules,

891
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,420
but the rules are so confusing.

892
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,740
Like Mike said about like Lily dating a Nosferatu,

893
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,660
you know?

894
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,020
Well, that's just, I'm not even,

895
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,180
that's not even necessarily a rule.

896
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,460
Like here's what I would say,

897
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,020
putting too many rules on the monsters seems foolhardy.

898
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,780
I would say that perhaps the reality of the monsters

899
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:11,380
doesn't need to be questioned too hard in this movie.

900
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,020
No, but I think this movie

901
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,420
may have like thrown too much stuff out.

902
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,260
Yeah.

903
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,860
Where it's in just like a weird, surreal world,

904
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,500
and you don't get any of the basic dynamic

905
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,340
that is what we need.

906
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,380
Right, but it's not even necessarily embracing

907
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,380
the surrealness, you know?

908
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,060
Yeah, it's, yes, you're right.

909
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,940
It's trying to do too much,

910
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,180
and you are losing some of, yeah, the basic,

911
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,980
the basic, the tenants of like, okay,

912
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,220
if you were a Kevin Feige, a Kathleen Kennedy,

913
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,220
you know, you would have a list,

914
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,540
the tenants of what a monster property is,

915
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,340
what an IP, when you were using the beloved IP

916
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,780
of the monsters, here are the four, the pillars.

917
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,020
It's these things, these documents

918
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,460
that make our favorite films so great.

919
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,300
Yeah, exactly, because they all have the,

920
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,180
all these big franchises have these now.

921
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,060
Now, if people want us to be the Kennedy Feiges

922
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,900
of the monster verse, I think we could do it,

923
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,820
the three of us.

924
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,420
I pitch us for a lot of jobs, and I think this is a,

925
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,660
this is maybe going forward, maybe the best chance we have

926
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,220
as far as something I'm pitching us for is to be

927
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,300
sort of the godfathers of the monster verse,

928
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,980
to really expand the franchise,

929
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,420
because we know the core tenants.

930
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,940
We know what makes the monsters monsters.

931
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,620
With my episode and a half that I've watched

932
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:34,780
in the last two years, and my sort of paying attention

933
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,580
to the show when I was eight and sick from school,

934
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,860
watching it on the tiniest TV in our house,

935
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:46,100
I think based on that, I understand the property.

936
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,220
I know what they are.

937
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:53,220
But yeah, he explains how Herman is created,

938
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:58,020
how they get to get, it's just too much,

939
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,540
and it doesn't hang together.

940
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,820
It doesn't follow that logic.

941
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,980
And yes, it's missing, the monsters is like,

942
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,820
it's fun, like, yeah, it's schemes.

943
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,060
The whole thing is just schemes,

944
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,340
which is what old television was.

945
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,260
Lucy just had schemes every week.

946
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,100
Yeah.

947
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,920
A new scheme.

948
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,260
Seemingly a lot of just him trying to be like,

949
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,460
in the media, this one, Herman is a rock star.

950
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,340
This one, he is a movie star.

951
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,340
Now he's writing for the paper.

952
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,340
Now he's on the sports team.

953
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,180
Now he's the vice president of America.

954
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,540
I don't know if that one happened,

955
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,260
but he can only assume.

956
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,420
I mean, it should.

957
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,180
Herman must have run for office at some point.

958
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,020
Yeah.

959
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,940
Here, I don't know, maybe I'm jumping all over the place.

960
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,100
Here's something that bothers me about the movie.

961
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,420
And this is not necessarily a performance.

962
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,260
Here's something that really,

963
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,700
this is one of my top things that has bothered.

964
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,940
Grandpa Monster doesn't hate Herman.

965
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,260
He doesn't loathe him for real.

966
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,700
He's annoyed by him regularly on the show.

967
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,540
You're saying in the show.

968
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,380
Yes, in the show.

969
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,340
Everybody gets along.

970
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,180
They get along.

971
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,620
Grandpa is annoyed at Herman.

972
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,980
He says, look what you did, you big dummy, sometimes.

973
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,900
And that's who he thinks Herman's stupid.

974
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,500
But he likes Herman, and they get in the hijinks together.

975
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,820
In the movie, Grandpa hates Herman,

976
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,180
and it's never resolved.

977
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,980
He hates him the whole time.

978
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,820
Yeah, you really need, well, it has to be like,

979
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,900
you know,

980
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,860
we do a prequel like Monsters University.

981
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,700
Yeah.

982
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,540
It's weird.

983
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,380
Wait, we know these characters are best friends.

984
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,220
Right.

985
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,460
Now this film has started and they hate each other.

986
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,060
How this journey surely must take us to a point

987
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,900
where they are best friends by the end.

988
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,820
That's what I thought.

989
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,660
Oh, well, there'll be a point when Grandpa goes,

990
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,180
oh, great, you know what,

991
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,100
Herman's not such a bad guy or whatever.

992
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,940
And then they like shake hands.

993
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,460
After what we've been through,

994
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,500
this adventure through Paris and out of Transylvania

995
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,700
and what have you. No.

996
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,980
Now, I don't think you're such a dummy.

997
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:50,180
This is why I said something very insulting,

998
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,380
where I said, I don't know if anyone knows

999
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,860
what's good about or funny about the Monsters.

1000
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,660
It's like, that's not the relationship of the character.

1001
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,380
Like, he doesn't hate him.

1002
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,620
So it makes it not that fun.

1003
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,740
It makes it not fun for him the whole time to be like,

1004
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,740
I gotta get rid of this lousy Herman Munster.

1005
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:09,460
And then it never resolved, never changes.

1006
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,300
Yeah.

1007
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:15,300
I mean, we are one summer out from the Space Jam sequel.

1008
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,140
Well.

1009
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,980
With very, which.

1010
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,820
You could forget.

1011
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:23,420
Kind of similar, like, do you like the Looney Tunes?

1012
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,820
It seems like you all hate the Looney Tunes.

1013
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,100
I don't know that you got what was fun about the Looney Tunes.

1014
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,500
I don't know that you got what was fun about Space Jam 1.

1015
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,340
Like. 1000%, yes, yeah.

1016
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,900
I, God, we just wanna make,

1017
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,780
LeBron has a lot of contractual obligations

1018
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,820
to advertise different products.

1019
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,820
And we are trying to launch a streaming service

1020
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,060
that we will completely pull back a year and a half later.

1021
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,900
So if they would just let us do these tasks

1022
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,580
and not make us have a coyote and a road runner

1023
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,700
and all this shit, we could, you know,

1024
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,140
we could make a fine piece of content.

1025
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,180
Can't this be about LeBron and the characters

1026
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,780
from A Clockwork Orange?

1027
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,620
Can't we?

1028
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,460
Yeah.

1029
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,260
Can we showcase our other IPs?

1030
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,260
A basketball player in a digital world

1031
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,780
while the, what are they called?

1032
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,140
The Druigs or the.

1033
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,980
Oh, I don't remember.

1034
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,820
What's that term?

1035
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,660
I'm gonna get that right.

1036
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,180
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1037
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,340
Well, you know, while the Clockwork Orange guys

1038
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,660
clap silently, while this group of rapists

1039
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,700
all cheer the basketball game,

1040
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,980
and then while the Danny DeVito penguin,

1041
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,620
not played by Danny DeVito.

1042
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,900
And the Burgess Meredith penguin,

1043
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,740
not played by Burgess Meredith.

1044
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,980
And the different penguin.

1045
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,980
Multiple penguins.

1046
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,420
What we need to do is enter the Penguivers,

1047
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,820
but then have neither member of the Penguivers do anything.

1048
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,660
Right.

1049
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,140
They need to clap at basketball.

1050
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:45,980
Yeah.

1051
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,100
That is, boy, you know what?

1052
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,660
It remains a film I'm much angrier at than The Monsters.

1053
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,580
The Monsters was just deflating and frustrating.

1054
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,420
Yes, I agree.

1055
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,420
But boy, that was a space sham.

1056
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,420
That was pretty bad.

1057
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,180
But imagine this, like, I know, I've got the title.

1058
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,220
I've got it.

1059
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,060
A new legacy.

1060
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,340
Can you imagine if a sequel to something

1061
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,820
that came back years later had the word legacy in it?

1062
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,820
Has anything ever done that before?

1063
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,140
Intern checks, yes.

1064
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,980
49 films.

1065
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,340
Shut up, shut the fuck up.

1066
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,100
A new legacy.

1067
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,500
The most inventive title there could ever be.

1068
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,340
Yeah.

1069
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,460
Look, to get a movie made, you have to convince

1070
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:29,820
some of the dumbest people alive, executives, to make it.

1071
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,740
And then, unfortunately, a little of their panache

1072
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:36,180
makes it into a lot of modern movies.

1073
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,180
That is true, yeah.

1074
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,300
Which is why, get rid of that.

1075
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,780
What we need is Kathy Kennedy and her rules.

1076
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,380
This is what makes films great.

1077
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,220
Well, OK, you mentioned that.

1078
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,980
This is a thing that irked me.

1079
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,980
The creation of Herman Munster, the naming of Herman Munster,

1080
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,540
is the same as a Han Solo.

1081
00:39:55,540 --> 00:40:00,660
Oh, Han, you're alone, Solo, like Herman.

1082
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,500
Which now we know was not.

1083
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,980
Maybe not an idea from Eiger, but an idea encouraged by Eiger.

1084
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,980
He loved it, yeah.

1085
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,420
That's why he wanted to make it.

1086
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,980
Yes, yes, yes.

1087
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,740
No one will snark about that.

1088
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,460
Yes, yes.

1089
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,260
We're talking about the man who titled his book

1090
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,980
The Ride of a Lifetime while he was the head of a company

1091
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,740
that actively does not call their attractions rides.

1092
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,420
That is true.

1093
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,020
So, yes.

1094
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,180
What a fuck up.

1095
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,980
Well, OK, can we also say that the origin of Herman Munster,

1096
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,980
can someone remind me that there's

1097
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:35,140
a mad scientist who's trying to make a very smart Frankenstein's

1098
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:39,140
monster and he puts like there's two twins that both die.

1099
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,420
One is smart and one is a standup comedian.

1100
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:41,780
Yeah.

1101
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:45,060
And he puts the he accidentally puts the standup comedian's brain

1102
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,860
inside the Frankenstein's monster and not the smart guy's brain.

1103
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,780
Am I right about that?

1104
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,460
That is correct.

1105
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,180
OK, this is 20 minutes of the movie.

1106
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:53,500
Yeah.

1107
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,020
Or more.

1108
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:59,780
That might be the 30 minutes of this other character making Herman.

1109
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,060
The Herman slowdown.

1110
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:01,860
Yeah.

1111
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,620
And I should be where things really kick into gear.

1112
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,060
Yes.

1113
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:11,140
So there's a whole origin there leading up to the naming of Herman,

1114
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,100
which, yes, is very yes by her.

1115
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,380
What's the man's name who plays early or hey, or hey, Gershian?

1116
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,180
Yeah.

1117
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:17,780
And he's good.

1118
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,220
He's I liked him.

1119
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,820
Yeah.

1120
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,340
So, yes, there's a lot of that.

1121
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:23,860
Yeah.

1122
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:28,740
A quarter of the movie is this while Lily is going on dates

1123
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,780
and trying to find a husband.

1124
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:36,980
The whole thing is like a little thought exercise of like if we if this movie

1125
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:42,380
existed exactly as is and with the same look and maybe for my thought exercise,

1126
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,500
you have to change the characters names, but otherwise it's the same length

1127
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,380
and the same actors and the same director.

1128
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,260
But the movie was called like the monster Ellie's.

1129
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,700
This is an original film about a monster family and how a monster

1130
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,580
husband and wife got together.

1131
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,260
But they're the count.

1132
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:05,100
The father in law was a little upset, but also three other things are happening.

1133
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,580
Like what?

1134
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,980
This is no way we would be here.

1135
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,620
We would not be talking about it.

1136
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,140
No, no one would be.

1137
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,860
No one would have told us to watch it.

1138
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,460
I don't think we would have done it if Robuck wasn't in this.

1139
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,220
Yeah, I don't think we necessarily owe this to the audience

1140
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,980
unless Robuck is in it and he is.

1141
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,260
Well, let's talk Robuck.

1142
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,380
What do we what do we think?

1143
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:27,700
Does he does he explode off the screen the same way he does

1144
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,660
when he shatters his photo with Helen Kushnick?

1145
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,780
You are a ragged.

1146
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,940
You're right.

1147
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,180
I think Rogan, I can't I have to quote it.

1148
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:42,940
I said the thing about Grandpa earlier because I think it it's it's hamster.

1149
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,340
It gets him stuck.

1150
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:50,060
I think he is not able to embody the Al Lewis character

1151
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,740
because he's stuck kind of really being upset the whole movie.

1152
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,700
And he's I don't know if that's his choice.

1153
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,900
It feels like it's the script.

1154
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,660
The script is like you hate Herman the whole time.

1155
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,900
And he's sort of stuck.

1156
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:05,700
He gets to do a little antics when he like mixes up a potion,

1157
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,740
which is a very another common thing on the monsters is Grandpa

1158
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,020
turning things into things accidentally.

1159
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,060
He gets things like turns himself into a wolf man.

1160
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,820
I think he turns somebody else into a wolf,

1161
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,780
like a wolf man in monster go home.

1162
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,300
Maybe like it's a lot of money to there's an army base

1163
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,140
and he turns all the soldiers in a wolf man.

1164
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,380
Yeah. So I don't know.

1165
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:34,860
I think he does a good job, but I don't think he has a lot to work with

1166
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,860
when it comes to the dialogue.

1167
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,980
Mm hmm. He's got that.

1168
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,660
He's like you.

1169
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,140
You sense that he is a guy who likes

1170
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,420
old old stuff and old hokey.

1171
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:51,740
And you could tell he's got a joy for the it's good casting.

1172
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:56,180
Yeah, I would say, but there's not not a lot to to work with.

1173
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:01,260
There's a yeah, like the Al Lewis is the great performance of Al Lewis.

1174
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,660
One of the performances of our time.

1175
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,300
He's got this twinkle in his eye.

1176
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:09,580
It's fun to see him. He gets schemes to it's fun to watch him and Herman

1177
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,700
like do stupid shit.

1178
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,060
I don't know. There's just there's something like it's just like a grandpa was upset.

1179
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,100
Like I think it was a character.

1180
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,180
I mean, he was a character and he was a huckster.

1181
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:24,140
And like he just started living the gimmick later in his life.

1182
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,220
He just never stopped being grandpa.

1183
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,940
Al Lewis was. Yeah, Al Lewis is a lunatic.

1184
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,260
Yeah, vaudeville lunatic.

1185
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,980
Yeah, who had developed a crazy persona on stage

1186
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:40,660
and was a very funny natural performer and just put makeup on him.

1187
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,740
And he was fun to watch.

1188
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,900
He was very fun to watch in that role.

1189
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,660
You know how there's that there's the thing of that I'm sure we've stepped into

1190
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,740
and a lot of people, there's audience members who get upset,

1191
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,940
who may who maybe liked the new Star Wars movies

1192
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:58,500
and they get upset when podcasters snark on the new Star Wars movies.

1193
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,980
And I'm just flushing charm to life that

1194
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:07,020
if if that syndrome happened for the if there's people listening

1195
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:11,220
who are like, yeah, Al Lewis was your grandpa.

1196
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:14,100
OK, but maybe it's time to pass the torch to a net.

1197
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,260
Maybe there's these kids out there who love Daniel Roebuck.

1198
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:21,140
And that's their the count is their grandpa.

1199
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,260
And Al Lewis, he's gone.

1200
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,060
OK, he can't be in them anymore.

1201
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:28,460
And his restaurant owned by the mob or something

1202
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:31,260
where he sat and read a newspaper in the front of the lobby.

1203
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,860
It's closed. OK, get over it.

1204
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,500
You're an adult.

1205
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:39,140
I'm sorry, Grandpa can't be like you remembered him when you were a kid.

1206
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,140
This is telling a different story with the character of Grandpa.

1207
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:45,740
Some of us grew up with Jerry O'Connell. OK.

1208
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:51,180
Some of us grew up with Edward Herman playing Herman.

1209
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,500
Oh, wow. Which is in the 90s.

1210
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,580
Yes. Gilmore. Yeah.

1211
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:59,940
Yes. You know, there's little girls out there who they're growing up now.

1212
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,820
And to them, their Maryland is no Maryland.

1213
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:10,340
That they love that my daughter is going to be a vacant void for Halloween.

1214
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,260
But then there was also well, I guess I could say there's going to be people

1215
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,500
that were talking about the pilot of the monsters,

1216
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,860
but they probably did not see that until years later.

1217
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,180
Oh, no, it aired. It probably aired.

1218
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,500
Which one do you mean? You mean the one with Happy Dermen

1219
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,260
instead of Butch Patrick is what I'm talking about.

1220
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:29,300
You waved your arms wildly to tell me Happy Dermen.

1221
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,980
Mary Happy Dermen.

1222
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:35,620
Maryland also changed actors to what's a Darren situation.

1223
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,180
Yes, that's true.

1224
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:39,540
Well, that was these names are all nonsense.

1225
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:43,380
Cloppy Glonk Glonk was chirpy chick check.

1226
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:50,020
Happy Dermen was my Eddie Munster when it was a darker show.

1227
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:54,540
That was aggravating to me that Eddie and Marilyn were not in it.

1228
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:58,580
How did the movie also not end with Herman? I'm pregnant. Yeah. Yeah.

1229
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,860
All these obvious things you would think that they're pregnant.

1230
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:06,180
Tummy's going like, oh, it's like monster sounds. Yeah.

1231
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:11,500
Yeah. Also, for a guy who made a music video about the Dragula,

1232
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,060
but starring the Munsters coach, no crazy car.

1233
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:16,300
Right. That is also why you're right.

1234
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,740
You're 100 percent correct.

1235
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:21,460
How was there not a Dragula fan?

1236
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:25,580
I think he's I think he got very optimistic that this is one of many

1237
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,940
monsters that he's still going to do.

1238
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:28,660
And maybe he's right.

1239
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:32,140
Maybe it was such a big hit on Netflix and the budget was so low

1240
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,300
that we are in for more.

1241
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,460
It could be.

1242
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:39,420
Let me take this conversation in this direction, which is

1243
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,380
one thing we haven't discussed in terms of behind the scenes,

1244
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,780
how it came together, which is the company.

1245
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,060
This is made by Universal.

1246
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:50,820
Yes, but more specifically, Universal 1440.

1247
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,220
Yeah, something that was pointed out.

1248
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:54,580
Our friend Van Roveshow pointed this out when people were kind of dunking

1249
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,780
on the trailer. He was a little like, OK, but remember,

1250
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:02,340
maybe what you might not realize is this is made by this low budget

1251
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,220
crank amount division.

1252
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:08,860
So if you're commenting on this looks so cheap, like they just cranked it out.

1253
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,860
That is probably what happened because that is the mission

1254
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,780
of the company. Right.

1255
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,740
And what I bring this up now to say that

1256
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:22,580
being a weird sheep disaster does not necessarily mean they won't make more

1257
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:25,500
because it's the entire that they say.

1258
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:29,260
They make a lot of sequels to movies that aren't where you don't even like

1259
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:30,980
the first movie.

1260
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,500
Let me go through there.

1261
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,300
The proud filmography of Universal 1440.

1262
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,540
They're the ones who made that weird Woody Woodpecker

1263
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:43,660
that they like shady Woody Woodpecker movie in 2017.

1264
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:46,020
OK, why is there this now?

1265
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:49,420
But mostly it's sequels from their kindergarten cop to with Dolph Lundgren.

1266
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:53,860
Right, right. I believe I've watched the they got the ownership of the

1267
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:58,100
the long, long storied Land Before Time franchise.

1268
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:58,980
Yeah, yeah.

1269
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,580
They did the most recent with Land Before Time 14.

1270
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,380
Journey of the Brave.

1271
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,700
We're now in X1V where then that they're probably cursing

1272
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,620
that they chose Roman numerals when they started doing these.

1273
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:14,740
Is it the same is it the same dinas as Little Foot, still the star

1274
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,380
of the Land Before Time 14?

1275
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:19,380
I think so, because they just get new kids every time.

1276
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,860
It's like, right. Right.

1277
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:21,700
Wait, what's the kid?

1278
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:26,540
Oh, well, like the the peanuts, I say, as Jason is dressed exactly like Linus.

1279
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:29,620
Yeah, we should discuss that.

1280
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,860
I think, yeah, I think we're still a little so it's just like, all right.

1281
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:38,300
We just need to find a new five year old, pay their pay him six hundred dollars

1282
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,860
maybe. Yeah, look at it.

1283
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,700
Yeah. Little Foot, Chomper.

1284
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,900
All my friends are still are still having adventures.

1285
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,900
We're the first movie I saw in a theater.

1286
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,300
Yeah. To and there's some of course, Petri Stor.

1287
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:55,180
So they're forever children, but we know death is inevitable for them

1288
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:57,340
due to the extinction and level events.

1289
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,140
Yes. Yeah. But we get a lot of time with them.

1290
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,980
Wow. Rob Paulson still in the mix.

1291
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:04,020
Hey, OK. Reba in the mix.

1292
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,220
Who? Reba Reba.

1293
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,380
McIntyre is a dinosaur.

1294
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,500
I don't know. She's at a Barry Bostwick is in it.

1295
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:16,300
Barry Bostwick is in like the majority of these.

1296
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,580
Barry Bostwick is the king of these straight to video.

1297
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,180
I'm surprised he's not the monster.

1298
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,700
I'm surprised he didn't play Herman.

1299
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,860
I don't know which of these exactly he's in, but I'm fairly confident

1300
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,020
he's in Granddaddy Daycare.

1301
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,060
Wow. Really?

1302
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,940
Daycare. And he is definitely

1303
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:35,660
don't quote me on that just in case.

1304
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:39,620
I'm pretty sure he's the Paul Giamatti equivalent in Bigger Fatter Liar.

1305
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,980
Is that? Wow. Really?

1306
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:44,140
Bigger. I did not know that one.

1307
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,700
I liked that. I liked Big Fat Liar.

1308
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,620
I have two notes, two areas.

1309
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,900
I would plus it up.

1310
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,780
The keynote. No, no, no. Liar.

1311
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,060
I like keep him a liar.

1312
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:55,940
Definitely keep him alive.

1313
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,540
Twenty seventeens, bigger fatter liar.

1314
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,820
And I believe you are.

1315
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:02,940
Yep. Barry Bostwick is Larry Wolf.

1316
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,340
If. Oh, that's right. He's a wolf.

1317
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:07,340
Wolf is the name of the guy and this must be his dad or his

1318
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,380
wow.

1319
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,180
I don't look. I don't want to.

1320
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,260
I don't mean to.

1321
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,980
Barry Bostwick is not fatter than Paul Giamatti.

1322
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,660
No, at least at the time.

1323
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:19,540
They're not saying it necessarily.

1324
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,980
They're using it in the line.

1325
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:23,460
The lying is what is fat lies.

1326
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:24,820
OK, got it. Yeah.

1327
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,620
Jarhead three, the siege three, whatever to

1328
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,740
Scorpion King five Book of Souls.

1329
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,900
Oh, I didn't know that one.

1330
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,940
Five. Who's the Scorpion King and Scorpion King five?

1331
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:39,140
I don't know, but Lou Ferrigno was starting to be in a

1332
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,900
who's there's a wrestler I'm not coming up with a way to know.

1333
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,460
Not really. Kimbo Slice.

1334
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,380
Oh, yeah.

1335
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,420
But I don't know if any of them are the Scorpion King.

1336
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,220
Scorpion King Book of Souls.

1337
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,180
I'm sorry. I pulled up the list.

1338
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,940
There's one on here that has no pun intended.

1339
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,260
Taken my breath away.

1340
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:58,380
Yes. Yeah, let's hear it.

1341
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,060
Hi. How high to.

1342
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,660
Oh, that's great.

1343
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:05,340
With it's like one kind of relevant rapper.

1344
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,500
Oh, Lil Yachty's in it. Yeah.

1345
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,700
All right. Uh huh.

1346
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,460
Oh, wow. Lou.

1347
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,620
Yeah, Lou Ferrigno is in Scorpion King four Quest for Power.

1348
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:16,060
Rudger Hauer also in there.

1349
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:17,380
One of his last roles, I believe.

1350
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,100
Wow. God. Yeah.

1351
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,860
He died in 2019. I.

1352
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,060
It's I don't know where to even start with that.

1353
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:27,580
Let me go in the weirdest from here.

1354
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,180
Bench warmers to breaking balls.

1355
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,220
Starring John Lovett.

1356
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,220
Wow. Really?

1357
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:40,220
That's that he's that he now is like the B team of Rob Schneider.

1358
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:46,180
Cop and a half new recruit with Lou Diamond.

1359
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:48,340
Wow. Cop and a half.

1360
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:51,100
There's probably listeners who do not know what cop and a half is.

1361
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,340
I do. I'm listening.

1362
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:57,380
They know, you know, it's Bert Reynolds teamed up with a precocious little kid.

1363
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:01,420
Directed by Henry Winkler, the source of the Joey Lawrence song.

1364
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:04,460
Nothing My Love Won't Fix Can't Fix, one of them.

1365
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:10,020
The this one cannot believe.

1366
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,220
And then this never came across any of our desks.

1367
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:14,860
All right, PD to really all right.

1368
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,820
PD got a sequel.

1369
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,980
Right, PD. No one like that for one.

1370
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:23,660
Wow. And then the funniest one, not the fight, but I like it.

1371
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:26,980
Dragonheart Battle for the Heartfire.

1372
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,900
The Heartfire. Yeah, heart fire.

1373
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,660
We got heart in the title twice.

1374
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:33,500
Dragonheart to how that's years after the first one.

1375
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:38,420
Oh, no, no, no, it's not to it's for that's another.

1376
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,540
Where the other ones go.

1377
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:42,940
Dragonheart 2 is Dragonheart, a new beginning from 2000.

1378
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,100
That was old. Yeah.

1379
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,620
Yeah, that one they jumped on.

1380
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:49,380
But then they were like, when are we going to make some sequels to Dragonheart 2?

1381
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,500
Dragonheart 3, the sorcerer's curse.

1382
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:54,420
No, I'm going to sorcerer would do.

1383
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,900
That was more. That was 2015.

1384
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,180
So that's a 15 year break between Dragonhearts.

1385
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:03,860
I think at some point it stopped being Drago, the Sean Connery dragon,

1386
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,420
though I'm not totally sure. I don't.

1387
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:10,220
I'm not sure the dragon voice has shifted.

1388
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,660
But the most recent one is Patrick Stewart.

1389
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:16,300
Patrick Stewart is doing these straight to video, which I know, you know,

1390
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,420
he probably doesn't have to go for room. Yeah.

1391
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:21,380
I'm sorry. Did you already mention Inside Man?

1392
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:24,300
Call it Inside Man, call in most want it.

1393
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:27,100
The sequel to Spike Lee's Inside Man.

1394
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,180
What? Weird.

1395
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,420
Like some of them are good.

1396
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,620
And so like, that's a quietly good little move.

1397
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:34,620
Like, yes. Yeah.

1398
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,140
Some of them are like notorious.

1399
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:40,060
Does that like RIPD for sure was a heema.

1400
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:43,500
I mean, I don't know what the people who make some of these movies,

1401
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,580
everyone probably has a different philosophy about making a sequel

1402
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:49,020
to a cop and a half, a cop and a half, for instance.

1403
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:52,180
But I assume Rob was using this as a way.

1404
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,980
OK, I can do a low budget and I can.

1405
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:55,860
Because that's his dream to do this.

1406
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:58,300
But this must have been the only way Universal was like,

1407
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:01,220
we'll give you money to do this, as if we give you very little money.

1408
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,460
I think so. Yeah.

1409
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,420
This might be the this might be the only way they're going to make Bros 2.

1410
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:08,420
I think you're sure. Sure.

1411
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,620
Let's do a new beginning. Right.

1412
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:14,460
And it'll be to Bros 3 battle for the heart fire.

1413
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,860
You get two hundred and fifty thousand to make it.

1414
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,220
Two hundred fifty K.

1415
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:23,820
Yeah. So Rob must have been like sort of covertly look like he was like,

1416
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,380
we got to figure out a way to get me Munsters. Yeah.

1417
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:29,980
Because this must I guess the studio doesn't see it as a high priority

1418
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:33,260
to make Munsters or they had maybe they needed somebody with they had more faith

1419
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:37,940
because I think Rob has a very hardcore audience, smallish audience.

1420
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,060
So it seems like it should.

1421
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:42,940
I don't know. Maybe just lined up this way kind of in like

1422
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:48,300
stream averse post covid like let's let's align this with this

1423
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:51,580
end of the company and it makes more sense like this.

1424
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:55,660
I don't think there's a way Rob Zombie's Munsters goes into theaters in this year.

1425
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:58,820
Like maybe yeah, maybe 10 years ago. Right.

1426
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,740
But I think the economics are to maybe they're like,

1427
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:05,900
maybe we can build a weird little culty thing on video and maybe they are.

1428
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:08,020
Are they not all the reviews? Yeah.

1429
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:12,340
And I could totally that was my big takeaway is like this. I could.

1430
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:17,700
You know, I had a lot more specific stuff to shit on with

1431
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:20,420
Pinocchio was the Mecha's Pinocchio. Yeah.

1432
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:25,860
We talked about that on Blink Check and that feels like such a failure

1433
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:28,060
in what it's trying to be.

1434
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,300
And this is a failure to the Munsters.

1435
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:34,980
But in terms of being like a kooky, low fight, the horror comedy,

1436
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,900
I think it does get that.

1437
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,140
I just have no interest in that.

1438
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,420
I don't want to see that.

1439
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:44,500
Like I think it succeeds in being the weird merc

1440
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,460
that it is. Does that make any sense? Yeah.

1441
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,300
But it's not it's not.

1442
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,180
I wouldn't call it like campy.

1443
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:55,460
Well, it is. I mean, it is trying to be campy.

1444
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,780
It's trying to be campy. Yeah.

1445
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,460
But it's I don't think it's.

1446
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,260
Well, it's not.

1447
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:05,020
I mean, Pinocchio, Pinoc, Disney, Pinocchio is is, you know,

1448
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:09,260
a concerted effort by a corporation to

1449
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:12,660
resell you nostalgia.

1450
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:16,500
And this you can I do feel like there's like he

1451
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,180
I know that Rob loves this.

1452
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,140
I bet there wasn't a ton of studio interference.

1453
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:24,180
I think he probably got close to making the movie he wanted to make.

1454
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:27,740
It doesn't feel so cynical or anything.

1455
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,740
Pinocchio feels a bit cynical.

1456
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:32,500
I think you might say stream and all of these.

1457
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:35,980
The moment in the most cynical film, the reamed all the Disney remakes

1458
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:38,820
are cynical in a lot of ways where I've said, I think I said on Blank Check,

1459
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,940
or it's just these are these are savings bond.

1460
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:46,340
These are just a corporation knowing that their bottom line will be padded.

1461
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:50,060
X amount of money because it's a name and it's basically the same thing

1462
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:51,140
you saw when you were little.

1463
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,060
And now you're going to let your kids see it.

1464
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:56,300
And your kids want to see a shiny CGI Pinocchio face.

1465
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:00,780
So but yeah, this is not that this is not the cynical

1466
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:03,460
cash in of the Munsters brand.

1467
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:06,540
We're like, yeah, like it was passion fueling it.

1468
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:10,540
And there was passion for the way that it is, the way that it was made.

1469
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:12,420
I just don't vibe with.

1470
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:15,380
Yeah. He wanted to take.

1471
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:20,260
I think he was just interested in the very surface level elements of the Munsters.

1472
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,180
Like the way they look, they think that's it.

1473
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:23,820
They're monsters.

1474
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:27,300
I agree that that is why we understand dress who's in his other movies.

1475
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,340
Dress up like Herman.

1476
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:33,420
It's like when I was a kid and I was really into the Ghostbusters cartoon,

1477
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:37,540
I got really into like, yes, they fight ghosts.

1478
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,180
They're Ghostbusters.

1479
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,660
The comedy was a secondary concern.

1480
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,100
What a kid it is.

1481
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,780
It's like he got fed the kid information.

1482
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:50,180
The stuff you like as a kid is the is permanent in the outfits.

1483
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:55,020
It's like some zany angles, zany stuff like he all the sort of superficial

1484
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,580
stuff is there and the look of it is there.

1485
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,580
He does have a specific look for it.

1486
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:01,260
So but it's like,

1487
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:06,140
if you want a comedy movie, it's got to have the jokes have to come faster.

1488
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:10,500
It's kind of isn't it crazy also when you compare it that this is like

1489
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,940
there's been TV movies, right?

1490
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:17,020
But like the first like after the fact monsters movie

1491
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:22,300
really is this and then you compare it to the kinds of movies

1492
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,260
that the Adams family got.

1493
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:29,300
Well, which are great masterpieces, gothic, beautifully shot,

1494
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,900
immaculatly incredible performances.

1495
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,380
Second one, funnier, better.

1496
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:38,300
Yes, I mean, it's like I think they were nominated for Oscars for like set.

1497
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:42,420
I mean, like filmically, I mean, I don't need to make the argument

1498
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:46,780
that those are great, but like how unfair that the Adams family got this

1499
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:49,420
like like a true film.

1500
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:52,140
And then this got a lot of shot on a phone.

1501
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:55,860
It didn't wasn't the biggest hit, but a Broadway musical based on Adams family.

1502
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,900
There's a new Tim Burton produced.

1503
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,740
I mean, the show, it's like they have they're running a marathon

1504
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:04,820
and they have like a 15 mile head start.

1505
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:08,980
And the Adams family was a cartoon, a comic strip first. Yes.

1506
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:12,660
But I think the Munsters is a better show than the Adams family.

1507
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,340
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I agree.

1508
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:17,300
Yeah, because I've tried to watch both of them and like this fun stuff

1509
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:20,660
about Adams family and it's fun to watch most of those performers.

1510
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:24,100
But Munsters is an energy and I don't know.

1511
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,420
I think I don't want to look.

1512
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:28,060
I'm not shitting at John Astin.

1513
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:29,260
I like John Astin a lot.

1514
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:33,220
But Herman and Grandpa are a little more fun than any of the Adams family.

1515
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,540
Absolutely. Yeah.

1516
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:38,980
But I think I mean, I, Scott, I think you mentioned it earlier,

1517
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:42,620
but like the absence of like a room full of Joe Crider

1518
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:47,180
like ringers is you can kind of feel it in this.

1519
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:50,140
And I'm sure they didn't have like

1520
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:54,180
fucking budget to put together a punch up room, you know.

1521
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:55,380
Yeah, yeah.

1522
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:58,620
It made me there's not a lot of like things I'd like to take a shot at,

1523
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:01,180
but it made me kind of want to take a shot at the Munsters.

1524
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:03,540
I'll be honest. I thought it like who cares about it.

1525
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:07,180
But I was watching and I was like, I could take I could write this Munster script.

1526
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:09,660
I was like, I never thought that I don't I don't.

1527
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:12,780
This thought will leave me, by the way, I think very quickly.

1528
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:14,980
Yeah, but there's other things to do with your life.

1529
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,140
Other things to do with my life.

1530
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,580
But I definitely was like, give me a shot at the Munsters.

1531
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:21,700
Maybe I think that would be a wacky, kooky

1532
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:26,340
Munsters TV show would probably be the hardest sell right now.

1533
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:31,260
And I think someone will hit on like a more wacky,

1534
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:35,860
like kind of sitcom, traditional sitcom.

1535
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:39,620
And then it'll be like the new hot thing, like Kooky.

1536
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:41,620
Munsters are just a sitcom in general.

1537
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:42,820
Sitcom in general.

1538
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:44,820
But I think for 20 years, my friend.

1539
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,020
Yeah, that's true.

1540
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:48,100
So but there's a little there's a little.

1541
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:48,980
Chalk.

1542
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:51,060
You need to bring back the Munsters.

1543
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:52,380
That's what I figured out.

1544
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:55,140
It could be that could be the truth.

1545
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:57,020
That could be the formula.

1546
01:01:57,020 --> 01:02:01,220
Yeah. If somebody was really determined, we need our magic shows.

1547
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:04,300
Back. That's confusing because there's magic shows.

1548
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:06,940
I mean, shows with magic in them and monsters.

1549
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:11,580
Yeah. Genies and witches, which is what we all grew up like.

1550
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:14,460
Yes, the show is I feel like we grew up watching them because of Nick at Night.

1551
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:17,780
And our our parents were all the most excited to show us those.

1552
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:19,620
Yes. Stuff they grew up with.

1553
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:20,740
Oh, you got to see this one.

1554
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:23,060
You got to see the witch show in the gene.

1555
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:25,420
There's a witch show and a genie show.

1556
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:27,100
They're basically kind of the same gimmick.

1557
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:30,060
Yeah. But by the way, they're not the monster show.

1558
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:31,820
Yeah, there's two monster shows.

1559
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:32,980
There's two.

1560
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:35,420
My lady, your marriage to a powers woman.

1561
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:36,740
They were into our reuse.

1562
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,460
She was not married to Major Nelson.

1563
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,300
He was she wanted to get married to her.

1564
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,940
OK, she was just like they eventually did get married.

1565
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:46,180
OK, OK. But she wanted to marry Major Nelson, but he was against it.

1566
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:49,620
And I dream of Jeannie, which we need to talk about.

1567
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,740
I dream of Jeannie more on the show, I guess.

1568
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:53,460
It might be somehow the first time.

1569
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:54,340
That's pretty incredible.

1570
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:57,060
Have I not said the name Barbara Eden on the show before?

1571
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:57,940
I feel like I have.

1572
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,020
If you know Jeannie from I dream of Jeannie.

1573
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:02,500
Still alive, although I shouldn't have said that.

1574
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:03,580
Not going to worry.

1575
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:07,620
I know we're going to be I can't believe I'm going to do it again.

1576
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:10,500
Well, look, he's lived a great couple of months since then.

1577
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,860
I can't believe we didn't cause Buzz Aldrin's death.

1578
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:15,820
Oh, yeah, I know. I was sure we were.

1579
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,020
I just saw the

1580
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:23,620
one of those this day in Disney history accounts I follow.

1581
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:28,300
In 2009, there was like a ticker tape parade

1582
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:31,420
for a Buzz Lightyear toy that had come back from space.

1583
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:33,580
It was either on the space

1584
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:38,100
and then Buzz Aldrin was also there and like took a picture holding it.

1585
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:41,420
And I'm like, oh, yeah, OK.

1586
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:44,780
Fall of the recession, fall of 2009.

1587
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,500
I was like, recession.

1588
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:49,460
Yeah, pretty, pretty cost effective.

1589
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,940
Limited time of magic.

1590
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:52,860
That's good.

1591
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,900
You know, I'll say the credits are great.

1592
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,860
The credits is a fun little animated sequence.

1593
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:00,980
They got a fun little song playing there.

1594
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:02,940
It's like a Monster Mash ripoff.

1595
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,500
I go, well, this is good like this.

1596
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:05,620
I like these credits a lot.

1597
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:08,380
Yeah, the one trailer was just the end of the movie.

1598
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:09,820
It's that's yeah, right.

1599
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:13,260
They show that little the recreation of the opening.

1600
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,060
Yeah, original opening.

1601
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,660
Well, this might be the time where I'm backed into a corner.

1602
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:19,740
How long have we been going a little over an hour about that?

1603
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:21,220
Something like that.

1604
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:24,780
I wanted to see how far I could get through the episode without saying

1605
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:27,620
I did not finish this film.

1606
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:29,220
I was like, I thought about it.

1607
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:30,500
I thought about it.

1608
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,380
I thought about it.

1609
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:32,900
You all thought we all thought about it.

1610
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:35,940
I was I was kind of hoping maybe we all did.

1611
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:36,820
Wouldn't that have been funny?

1612
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:37,980
And we didn't want to tell each other.

1613
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:38,620
I'll say this.

1614
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:43,580
I watched 10 minutes of it and I was mad because the first or second line

1615
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,500
was like, gee, you think?

1616
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:45,940
Yeah.

1617
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:46,660
Oh, yeah.

1618
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:47,180
Yeah.

1619
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,220
And then Grandpa goes, oh, my back.

1620
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:51,580
And I was like, all right, I'm back on board.

1621
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:54,500
And then I watched half an hour and I.

1622
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:55,420
How far did you get?

1623
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:56,140
Did you get what kids say?

1624
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:58,020
Andrew Peterson, where a virus show?

1625
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,220
You didn't even get there.

1626
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:02,380
You were I almost admitted it because you were talking about the half hour point.

1627
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:03,980
I made it to 38 minutes.

1628
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:07,460
That's all. That's how I said I missed most of the movie.

1629
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:08,580
Yeah, yes.

1630
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:09,180
I hate it.

1631
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:12,180
It sounded like I was doing Herman's voice from this movie.

1632
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:13,620
Thirty eight minutes.

1633
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:14,620
Thirty eight minutes.

1634
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:17,500
I got that where I even have no no.

1635
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,340
I got to where

1636
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:23,620
Herman was like playing in a band.

1637
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:24,420
He's in a club.

1638
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:27,340
He's like a real aggressive punk song.

1639
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:31,780
And that's sort of based on one of the episodes when Herman is is like a drag

1640
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:32,980
kind of racing guy.

1641
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:34,500
And yes.

1642
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,380
And that's kind of I'm sorry you stop there because at least that's a montage

1643
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:38,700
and there's some energy to that.

1644
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:42,500
I just like I don't know what it was about that in particular.

1645
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:45,580
I just like the music choice.

1646
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:47,180
No, the song is fine.

1647
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:50,340
I just you know, I think it's it's around where I wrote down one of my last notes

1648
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:52,860
was it's not bad enough.

1649
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:53,860
Well, that's true.

1650
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:54,700
That's true.

1651
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:55,580
You're right.

1652
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:58,460
Pinocchio was so wretched like that.

1653
01:05:58,460 --> 01:05:59,780
Truly, that is an F.

1654
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:01,340
That is one of the worst movies ever.

1655
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:05,260
I still like Honest John from Pinocchio better than any character in this movie.

1656
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:10,340
I yeah, I so I watched the first few minutes and then I had to go out.

1657
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:14,620
And then I started like I like watched a little more.

1658
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:18,820
And then I started jumping around the streaming services and like on Peacock.

1659
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:20,220
They're like leaving soon.

1660
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:21,780
The Brendan Fraser mummy.

1661
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:23,700
And I'm like, first off, you own this.

1662
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,300
How is it leaving soon?

1663
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:30,300
But I was like, what if I just showed up and it did the same as you did?

1664
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,020
Just got away with it for as long as I could.

1665
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:37,700
I was like, guys, I just watched the Brendan Fraser mummy for the millionth time again.

1666
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,220
Yeah, I was going to say, you're here.

1667
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:43,140
Two movies are the Brendan Fraser mummy and born identity.

1668
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:46,020
And now you see, I would put the Now You See Me series.

1669
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,580
Yeah. So wait, really?

1670
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:50,020
I didn't think I don't think I knew that.

1671
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:54,700
Oh, for like in in they're ridiculous.

1672
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:58,940
But if they're on cable and I'm flipping channels, it's like, I'll stop and watch this.

1673
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:01,780
I would too. No, I know what bad enough.

1674
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,860
That's what's up with those movies.

1675
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:06,860
Yeah, pretty bad, but pretty watchably bad.

1676
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:12,900
I but so then like the lay I had like 30 one night.

1677
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,100
I had like 30 minutes in the movie left.

1678
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:18,500
And I was like, all right, I'm going to take a weed gummy.

1679
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:23,540
And this is the kind I'm taking it late at night and it'll make me sleepy.

1680
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:25,660
And I'm going to erase my weed gummy.

1681
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:27,540
I'm going to try to finish this movie.

1682
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:29,180
And I fucked up. And I didn't.

1683
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:32,340
I fell asleep with like 15 minutes left.

1684
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,580
I was so mad that I had to go back and do it.

1685
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:38,940
I was the last 15 minutes, which is when like the last 20, 30 minutes,

1686
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:43,460
they start to get somewhere like when they get to America, literally get somewhere.

1687
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:46,020
But they don't get anywhere.

1688
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,980
There's kind of going back in my mind when I was talking about the end,

1689
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:50,460
it's got was just nodding along.

1690
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:52,340
Yeah. Yeah. See about it.

1691
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:54,540
30. I didn't say anything.

1692
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:56,900
I just kind of like I stayed silent.

1693
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:59,780
You said something and I agree. You're saying something you were. Yeah.

1694
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:01,700
So they real quick, I was just like, yeah.

1695
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:04,540
So the last 20 minutes, all of a sudden, it's like there's a they think

1696
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:08,100
there's a problem and they have to go to America and they have a Halloween party

1697
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:11,220
and they meet Cassandra Peterson, the liar who plays.

1698
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:14,940
Everyone's really cool because I'm not saying it to sell you on the move.

1699
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:18,780
Oh, no, no. I shall not be going back. So boring.

1700
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:20,780
Yeah, that's the issue.

1701
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:25,540
The boring is the killer of, you know, it's why.

1702
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:29,940
Look, you people maybe know I have this affinity in connection with the room,

1703
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:32,980
which is the gold standard of crazy bad movies.

1704
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:34,820
It's not boring.

1705
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:39,220
It's boring once when there's a sex scene you don't need way deep into it.

1706
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:40,900
And we call that the seventh inning stretch.

1707
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:42,900
And you just that's your chance to like go to the bathroom.

1708
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:46,100
So it's it's, you know, calculated, not calculated, but it's

1709
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:48,220
be selectively boring. Yeah.

1710
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:51,140
Just but you can't be so mushy.

1711
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:53,020
Yeah. For so long.

1712
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:54,260
I almost didn't. Yeah.

1713
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:57,580
I had to talk myself out of stopping it.

1714
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:59,420
I said, no, you should. Well, you have to finish it.

1715
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:04,460
Finish it. You have to finish it because I saw 40 minutes left and I went, oh, OK.

1716
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:09,700
And then it's that there is starting to get towards more hijinks.

1717
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:15,620
Like she's dressed the real estate agent is dressed like a witch.

1718
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:20,140
OK, but here's another here's another just bizarre thing.

1719
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:25,220
OK, Cassandra Peterson is a real estate agent that's going to sell the mocking

1720
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:28,700
1313 Mockingbird Lane, which is the Munster's house, and it is the Munster's house.

1721
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:31,540
And she's like, well, by the way, next time you see me,

1722
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:33,500
I'm going to be dressed up for a Halloween party.

1723
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,580
So don't get scared because it's Halloween.

1724
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:39,380
Yeah. So she opens the door and sees them.

1725
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:40,940
And she passes out.

1726
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:42,300
I go, well, I start yelling.

1727
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,700
I go, I go, no, no, no, no.

1728
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,660
It's Halloween. Why would she?

1729
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:48,500
She's supposed to say, oh, great costumes.

1730
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:51,060
And then they say no when she passes out.

1731
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:52,420
And I'm just like yelling to Lindsey.

1732
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:55,620
She goes, I know it's what is she met them already.

1733
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:57,180
No, she's on the phone with them.

1734
01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:59,180
OK, but still, it's Halloween.

1735
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:00,700
She's established. It's Halloween.

1736
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:03,180
The joke is she passes out afterward.

1737
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:08,460
So she passes out and then she gets up and goes, oh, those are good costumes.

1738
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:10,620
And I go, what? Who wrote this?

1739
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,100
I know who wrote it. Rob Zombie did.

1740
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,020
But I go, I don't understand.

1741
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:16,700
These are the basic tenets of the monsters.

1742
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:21,820
This gag is in every episode where they go great costume and they go, what cost?

1743
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,180
Like, it's the same thing.

1744
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:25,900
Every episode. I drove me to driving nuts.

1745
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:27,820
Easy. It's just missing layups.

1746
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:30,260
It's a little layups are being missed left and right.

1747
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:31,620
The bar is very low.

1748
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:34,820
I even went in the section of it because this all happened quick.

1749
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:36,980
Because remember, I was saying I was first 15 minutes.

1750
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:38,260
I was like, yeah, not so bad.

1751
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:39,620
And then, boy, did I just.

1752
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:42,340
Yeah, it didn't even turn as I said, it's not F.

1753
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:43,460
It just turned into C.

1754
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:45,500
And I'm like, yeah, I've written no notes.

1755
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:47,820
My Pinocchio notes were thorough.

1756
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:51,540
It is a thing every 10 seconds to shit on in that movie.

1757
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,940
I just realized I don't have anything to say.

1758
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:54,940
You know what I'm going to do?

1759
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:57,980
I'm going to come in with this list of universal 14, 40 movies.

1760
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:59,460
You're going to contribute.

1761
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:04,100
And I look at listeners, I'm sorry, but the agreement is not necessarily that.

1762
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:07,540
Well, I we never said we're all going to watch.

1763
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,020
No, I don't want this to be the bar.

1764
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:11,140
It's better.

1765
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:14,140
Sure. I know I'm like I wasn't fulfilling my end of the bargain.

1766
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:16,260
I did. Did I not entertain you?

1767
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:18,700
Were you not entertained?

1768
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:21,740
Check out Cardi Gladiator five star.

1769
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:26,500
Hook the hook me to the lie detector test.

1770
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,340
I don't care that you didn't watch it.

1771
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:30,540
I didn't think this felt like the one.

1772
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:33,220
And it wouldn't even you know, I think it would have been more of a betrayal

1773
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:35,780
with something worse that we watched. Father of the Pride.

1774
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:38,380
Remember that where we cut deals even.

1775
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:40,180
That's true. We discussed it.

1776
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:44,260
Can are we allowed to escape one episode and do something else?

1777
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:47,060
And Jason didn't take the deal because I think you kind of liked the show.

1778
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:49,580
You chose to go back in and watch more.

1779
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:54,620
Oh, did. Well, I just wanted to know what the whole idea.

1780
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:57,300
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You want more.

1781
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:58,260
The tolerance was high.

1782
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:59,620
There are very famous breaks.

1783
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:02,180
There are very famous breaks in our viewing.

1784
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:05,660
I mean, it's I don't do not really do not relitigate any of this.

1785
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:08,420
There's of course the Country Bears fiasco.

1786
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:10,300
There's the Clifford.

1787
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:14,060
I think there's a times when you're on one side and Scott and I are on the other

1788
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:16,500
as far as viewing is concerned. Yeah, sure.

1789
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,300
But I think we're all one of those.

1790
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:21,740
I don't mind. I still came to play.

1791
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:23,940
Yeah. And you know what?

1792
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:26,980
I basically had two days where I was supposed to use some of the time

1793
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:29,260
to watch the remaining what?

1794
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:32,140
Still hour and 10 of the monsters.

1795
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:34,100
You know what I did instead?

1796
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:38,060
I went and had a magical afternoon with my son and my sister.

1797
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:39,220
They got to bond.

1798
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:39,900
Oh, that's nice.

1799
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:41,540
Side of the family bonding.

1800
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:46,060
I set up a delightful skeleton display in that nice front yard.

1801
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:47,660
I had a blast doing that.

1802
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:50,100
I went to a kid's birthday party.

1803
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:53,020
I saw a lot of friends and sure they're wonderful children.

1804
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:56,980
And there were walk around pandas and zebras in a magical garden environment.

1805
01:12:56,980 --> 01:12:59,100
That's great. That was a lovely time.

1806
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:02,100
I raised a birthday toast to one of the greats, Mike Mitchell.

1807
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:03,540
Happy birthday, Mike.

1808
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:04,100
Happy birthday.

1809
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:07,220
I hope you get everything that's coming to you, especially because you got me away

1810
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:09,540
from watching more of this movie.

1811
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:10,620
It's all lovely.

1812
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:11,460
A great pizza.

1813
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:13,660
I had fantastic bagels.

1814
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:15,020
Food tasted better.

1815
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,220
Colors were more vibrant.

1816
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:19,180
Well, I don't know about that one.

1817
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:20,220
More vibrant.

1818
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:22,980
More vibrant than the monster colors.

1819
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:27,100
You can believe I learned to appreciate the regular boring color of the sky

1820
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:31,860
ahead of the electric green that colors most of the monsters by Rob Zombie.

1821
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:35,260
I mean, colors, I got to give them high marks on the colors,

1822
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:36,820
on the colored lighting.

1823
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:38,220
But I got to see those.

1824
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:41,820
Those weren't anywhere except for the very end where it turned black and white.

1825
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:43,860
But I already saw that in the teaser.

1826
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:47,740
I guess what I'm saying is, you know, if the idea is that you

1827
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:50,500
we don't really like recommend the movies or not.

1828
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:56,460
But if you're on the fence about it, you know, I all I can say is that I had

1829
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:00,660
a wonderful 48 hours when I made the choice to not watch it

1830
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,820
or to just watch a little bit of it.

1831
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:06,500
And if my attitude now tells you anything about how you'll feel

1832
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:10,220
when you choose to only watch part of the monsters by Rob Zombie.

1833
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:12,460
I don't know. Take take that as you will.

1834
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:16,020
You somehow got a better recommendation, two recommendations in there.

1835
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:19,020
Forty eight hours and another 48 hours.

1836
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:23,940
And Universal's 48 hours three.

1837
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:25,980
Is that? Oh, yes.

1838
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:28,900
Oh, yeah. There is another.

1839
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:33,860
There is a sequel prequel remake coming to 48 hours.

1840
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:35,460
I think. Yeah, I bet.

1841
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:37,700
I was going to say, here's what I think you should do.

1842
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:41,460
Listeners, instead of watching this, I would I would go back and watch

1843
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:46,420
go through all the descriptions of monster episodes, figure out what outfit

1844
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:48,420
sounds like it's the funniest for Herman aware.

1845
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:51,700
Watch that and then watch the movie The Late Shift on HBO.

1846
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:54,900
Oh, and just like jumble it all up in your head.

1847
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,260
You'll feel like you watch this.

1848
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:58,740
So that's a movie with a fun outfit.

1849
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:01,620
Where I was like a big crazy monster man.

1850
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:02,820
Yeah, yeah.

1851
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:07,820
Jay should have been in this movie.

1852
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:09,700
He was Herman or so now.

1853
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:10,940
Yeah, boy. Oh, God.

1854
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:13,820
There should have been there's

1855
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:17,820
there have there in the last couple of years, there have been this portrayal

1856
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:21,540
of Herman and there's another portrayal of Herman very briefly in a movie

1857
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:25,100
that makes me want to see a full movie with this person playing him.

1858
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:25,980
You know, I'm talking about.

1859
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:28,140
No, Jason, you know what I'm talking about?

1860
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,740
Liquors pizza. Correct.

1861
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:33,860
Yes. There is a Jason spoiler alert. Thanks.

1862
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:35,740
Sorry. I'll get around to this.

1863
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,940
It's nothing. It's not.

1864
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:41,540
But there's a there's a scene at the politics that they shot at the palladium.

1865
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:46,060
Spoiler alert where it's like all like it's a trade show, but also has like

1866
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:49,380
actors from the time because it takes place in the 70s.

1867
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:53,660
And there's a guy dressed as Herman Munster in the background.

1868
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:55,020
And it's clearly John C.

1869
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:57,100
Riley as Herman.

1870
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:59,820
And I'm like, that would be a really that'd be awesome.

1871
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:00,980
Kind of like you.

1872
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:05,500
It doesn't click until right after he leaves the camera goes past him.

1873
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,780
And then you're like, oh, wait.

1874
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:08,820
Yes. But in the theater, you can't go backwards.

1875
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:11,900
So the audience is all everybody's like looking at each other like, was it?

1876
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:12,780
I think. Yes.

1877
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:15,260
And is that his only appearance in the movie? Oh, yeah.

1878
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:17,580
It's not very close to him either.

1879
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,220
And I missed it.

1880
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:20,700
I was like, whoa, is that John C.

1881
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:22,380
Riley's Herman Munster? Yeah.

1882
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:24,300
Oh, that's right. That's the way.

1883
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:26,740
And that's where I was like, that's even where I was like, oh, I'm like,

1884
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,620
maybe somebody could do the monsters.

1885
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:31,700
And then you think of Adam's family and you go, oh, I guess they did make a much

1886
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:33,620
better version. Like, yeah.

1887
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:35,220
Well, Julie, that's one of the greatest.

1888
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:37,100
So I saw some fucking good.

1889
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,220
He's so good.

1890
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:40,300
There is a great

1891
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:44,540
horror comedy TV show on right now, and it's called What We Do in the Shadows.

1892
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:46,660
It just gets better every season.

1893
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:47,860
Uh huh. Uh huh.

1894
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:50,700
With a lot of great comedic performers. Buzz.

1895
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:53,140
Buzz. Sure. Yeah.

1896
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:56,300
I mean, also, somebody can make a good argument for like doing new stuff.

1897
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:57,860
I suppose.

1898
01:16:57,860 --> 01:16:59,940
But why would we want that?

1899
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:03,220
You know, we do in the shadows is based on a movie that is.

1900
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:05,420
At least it's a newer movie. Yes.

1901
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:06,060
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1902
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:06,580
It's a newer movie.

1903
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:10,700
And it's all a new bunch of characters with like cameos from older characters.

1904
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:15,500
Uh huh. So I did want to contribute a little something,

1905
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:18,260
which is this is something I had a faint memory of.

1906
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:20,420
Of one thing we haven't really talked about.

1907
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:24,340
We've talked about briefly mentioned the Fox movie with Bernard Herman.

1908
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:25,580
That's weird. It's Herman.

1909
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:27,860
Herman is Herman. Is Edward Herman is the guy's name?

1910
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:28,940
Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah.

1911
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:30,620
And that might be right.

1912
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:36,300
Apologies. The I think we didn't really, though, talk about the Munsters today,

1913
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:40,060
which is one that I remember strongly.

1914
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:42,260
I was going to say sort of strong.

1915
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:45,700
This was like this was a syndicated show in the late 80s

1916
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:50,700
that was made with like small wonder production value, you know,

1917
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:54,180
like syndicated multicam where it's a little cheap.

1918
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:56,380
I mean, so not, you know, it's like the Munsters.

1919
01:17:56,380 --> 01:18:00,460
The budget has stepped down through the decades to where we made it to this.

1920
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:02,060
Yeah. Croatia film.

1921
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:03,940
I don't know if we said that part. Oh, yeah, right.

1922
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:08,500
I believe so. That may be another thing about this movie due to whatever tax

1923
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,860
benefits or like filming benefits.

1924
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:14,340
They might have actually made money on this movie

1925
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:19,860
just by the sheer nature of shooting it in Croatia in a way that like,

1926
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:23,900
well, they didn't make money on Pinocchio just by creating it.

1927
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:28,940
But this they're like, if we do this movie, we somehow end up ahead.

1928
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:31,300
Yeah, you know. Yeah, I bet.

1929
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:34,580
I think Universal 1440 might be the most savvy.

1930
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:37,580
Yeah, they know what they're doing. Part of the entire entertainment industry.

1931
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:39,900
Have you ever asked like your agent or something like, you know what?

1932
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:41,540
Give me a meeting with them.

1933
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:43,700
No, no. Show me the list.

1934
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:46,420
Oh, because that's actually got to just to get the list.

1935
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:48,420
A bad idea to at least to take a look at the low.

1936
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:51,700
Yeah. What are the universal bottom feeders?

1937
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:54,500
I what's the

1938
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,540
this movie called the Frighteners?

1939
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:58,780
Michael J. Fox. Oh, yeah.

1940
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:00,100
Yeah. Yeah. Frighteners.

1941
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:02,220
I want to do Frightener's too. Like, why not?

1942
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:04,220
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just trying to remember any.

1943
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:07,740
The budget is $50,000 to do the Frightener's too.

1944
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:10,780
Or like, I think a similar title, Sneakers.

1945
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:15,260
Yeah. Do a new sneakers with Barry Bostwick and Lou Diamond Phillips.

1946
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:18,300
We got a hot new cast to be the new sneakers.

1947
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:21,780
I did read every now and then there's an interesting

1948
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:24,500
like diamond in the rough in the straight streaming.

1949
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:28,900
I read an essay a while back about like the career of Scott Atkins.

1950
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:32,780
And it's like he makes a lot of great direct to streaming action movies.

1951
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:35,220
Check out Universal Soldier four.

1952
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:39,380
The writers like, I sound crazy.

1953
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:43,420
Watch this movie, because it's one of the best action movies of the odds.

1954
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:46,940
There's a thing I say to any time I the few times,

1955
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:50,020
but any time I have a meeting of some kind, I end up talking about this

1956
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:52,180
and no one ever likes it as an idea.

1957
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:56,100
But I always am like, show me the list and then let's team up

1958
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:59,940
the two things on the bottom of the list as far as like what properties

1959
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:01,860
they have to reboot. Yeah.

1960
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:06,380
Because like I was like, let's just let's just roll in the slop, you know, for here.

1961
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:09,220
Let's just do it. I go, let's team like Mr.

1962
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:13,460
Belvedere meets like air wolf or Belvedere and like like

1963
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:16,380
small world wonder and Belvedere.

1964
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:18,700
Like what is the like, what's the role like?

1965
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:21,540
So sneakers versus frighteners.

1966
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:22,580
Here, let's try to do one.

1967
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:27,260
I'm here just I'm going to skim down the list of universal movies from the 90s.

1968
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:30,100
Yeah. And just tell me to stop. Sure.

1969
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:31,820
Stop.

1970
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:35,180
Cool as ice.

1971
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:37,140
Oh, great. And I'll tell you. Great.

1972
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:39,700
OK, Jason, call the next one.

1973
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:40,580
Stop.

1974
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,380
Carlito's way.

1975
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:44,900
Oh, yeah.

1976
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,980
Carlito's way versus cool as I.

1977
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,860
Yeah, this is what I'm saying.

1978
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:51,740
What's cool is ice.

1979
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:53,820
That's a vanilla ice movie. OK.

1980
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:55,380
I've seen that movie a lot of it.

1981
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:57,140
Now, that's a good band.

1982
01:20:57,140 --> 01:20:58,180
Not all of it. There is boy.

1983
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:00,980
There's some slogs, but you can you get a good like you can

1984
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:03,740
shake a good 45 minutes out of cool as ice.

1985
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:07,140
I know. Does anyone know anything about Carlito's way?

1986
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:10,020
Is that the the prequel?

1987
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:14,060
OK, there's a bar in the valley opening soon called Carlito's Way.

1988
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:17,980
And I believe that is the prequel to Scarface.

1989
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:20,340
Is that right? Oh, is it?

1990
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:23,420
Carl, I it's got a you know, but I don't I don't know if it's

1991
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:28,020
no, because I think no, because he plays Carlito Brigante.

1992
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:32,180
Yeah, it's finally going to cross paths with Johnny Van Owen.

1993
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:34,820
OK, I believe Drifter rapper.

1994
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:38,780
I believe it was released style on DVD

1995
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:43,940
in the 2000s, and they did a lot of like from the producer of Scarface

1996
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:46,140
where I mushed it up in my brain.

1997
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:49,580
Films based mainly on after hours, but use the title of the first novel

1998
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:52,580
to avoid it being confused with Martin Scorsese's 1985 film.

1999
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:54,580
OK, OK. So it's yeah.

2000
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:58,420
So I tell you, anytime I've ever been in a meeting with anyone

2001
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:00,540
who's sort of important, I say anything like this.

2002
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:04,500
The the nothing face that has greeted me every time.

2003
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:07,700
No one ever, ever entertained by this idea.

2004
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:10,380
What do you know? They we love only IP.

2005
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:11,940
All we ever want is IP. All right.

2006
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:15,140
Here's a fun new IP idea. Never dare you.

2007
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:19,260
Let me can we show you the rule book that we have for Carlito's way?

2008
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:22,540
I sneak this into the last five minutes of like a meeting or a general meeting.

2009
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:25,060
It's always a matter of nothing.

2010
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:27,780
Not even like, oh, that is really funny to do like Mr.

2011
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:31,500
Belvedere or something shitty or well, they're going to that that's true.

2012
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:35,420
They're going to eat turds when in the smash success, by which I mean,

2013
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:40,660
like via tax loops, the smash success of cool as Carlito's way.

2014
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:44,060
Or is it Carlito's way as ice?

2015
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:46,300
I like cool as Carlito's way.

2016
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:48,460
I think that's good.

2017
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:52,380
I don't know much about Carlito, but I feel like they'll feel like they'll get a lot.

2018
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:53,420
You know, he's all right.

2019
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:56,380
So he's just released from prison.

2020
01:22:56,380 --> 01:23:00,540
And like Johnny Van Owen is a wrong side of the tracks.

2021
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:02,900
You know, he's like a bad kid.

2022
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:05,540
That's why the Winslow family doesn't want their daughter

2023
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:10,540
Kathy to be spending time with him and running around an empty construction site

2024
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:13,580
with him and her father.

2025
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:17,060
And that I remember in cool as ice as Gordon Winslow,

2026
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:20,100
whose spoiler alert is on the lam from the mafia.

2027
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:23,460
Holy shit. It ties right into organized crime and Carly.

2028
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:24,940
Oh, my God. All right.

2029
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:26,260
It's actually perfect.

2030
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:30,500
And this character is played by Michael Gross of Family Ties fame.

2031
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:34,940
Who's in a lot of the Universal 1440 movies.

2032
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,700
So Michael's ready.

2033
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:39,220
He's ready to reprise his role as Gordon Winslow.

2034
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:41,700
I love it. Will they get Deezer D back?

2035
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:45,220
Who knows? Will they get Sean Penn back?

2036
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:47,860
I will make an offer.

2037
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:50,500
Yeah, we'll see if he's around.

2038
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:55,780
Well, look, when the gang from Deadly Games reaches out for help to manable.

2039
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:58,900
Yes, what I. That's a great one.

2040
01:23:59,060 --> 01:24:00,900
Yeah, that's a piece.

2041
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:04,180
There's only half my interest in neither onto something I keep.

2042
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:08,740
You would think I'm insane the way people talk to me or like when I say this to them.

2043
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:12,420
One person, at least, I think maybe said like, oh, that is kind of funny,

2044
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:13,940
but I don't know about sustainability.

2045
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:16,580
I go, well, no, these shows aren't lasting anyway.

2046
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:20,380
These like mad about you is one season and it's out and it cost way more than it.

2047
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:21,380
Like this word.

2048
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:25,140
That's true. And you have to pay all these people who do care about who can command.

2049
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:26,420
Helen Hunt's relevant.

2050
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:27,900
Sure. A big salary.

2051
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:32,180
But when you when you're paying these are D to come back as jazz.

2052
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:35,620
Cool is Carlito Belvedere's dead.

2053
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:38,140
So we got to recast him and he can get an unknown.

2054
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:39,900
We can get Jason Sheridan to play Belvedere.

2055
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:42,380
I would gladly play Belvedere.

2056
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:46,860
Come on. Jason Sheridan is young Belvedere and then it Belvedere verse TJ Hooker.

2057
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:49,020
And we recast or we have Shatner.

2058
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:50,420
Shatner will do it for cheap.

2059
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:52,340
You know, we can he does he needs to work.

2060
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:54,020
Mm hmm. He loves to work.

2061
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:57,740
There's all this garbage with him that you never heard of because he just does anything.

2062
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:02,580
You know, it's funny. Producer friend of mine just gave me the literal price for Christopher Lloyd.

2063
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:04,340
Just if you're curious, I now know the no.

2064
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:08,620
Wow, really? Not going to say it now, but it's not it's not not doable.

2065
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:11,860
Sure. I believe a guy likes to work.

2066
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:14,940
But it's also respected, but he's not like, you know, he's not a temp.

2067
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:17,380
Sure. But anyway, it was fascinating to learn the number.

2068
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:19,940
I love his Instagram. Christopher Lloyd's Instagram.

2069
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:21,540
I know he's on Instagram. He's on Instagram.

2070
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:25,500
And it's just kind of like like handsome looking pictures of him, like in a nice shirt.

2071
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:27,660
Wow. That's nice.

2072
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:29,420
I think his wife is in charge of it.

2073
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:33,340
Oh, but it'll be like, oh, yeah, like share some of your favorite memories of my films.

2074
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:35,540
And I'm like, he's not writing this.

2075
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:39,660
I mean, pairing just getting just take Christopher Lloyd characters

2076
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:43,860
like the bottom rung and put them together, which we know Sebastian Jackal.

2077
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:48,740
But then with like, is he does he play Mr. Payback and Mr. Payback?

2078
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:51,780
No, I don't think he does. He plays.

2079
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:53,980
I don't know.

2080
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:55,780
OK. Ed Jarvis.

2081
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:59,420
So Ed Jarvis versus we're so deep in the women.

2082
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:00,500
Nobody knows. Yeah.

2083
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,140
Everyone's turned this episode off.

2084
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:02,860
A lot of Cliff Notes.

2085
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:05,180
I'm going to print some money right now.

2086
01:26:05,180 --> 01:26:07,460
Hudson Hawk versus Ford Fairley.

2087
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:09,940
Yeah, sure.

2088
01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:16,500
I think Bruce Willis just sold him his likeness to a deep fake company.

2089
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:20,340
I think it's fake. I think the story itself might be.

2090
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:22,940
I only have heard it anyway. So perfect.

2091
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:24,380
I think so. Yeah. But why?

2092
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:27,580
But people it's going to give a lot of people a lot of ideas.

2093
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:31,140
Yeah, maybe he doesn't do it, but maybe a chess voluntary does it.

2094
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:35,860
It just feels like raking in residuals from themselves.

2095
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:40,420
Well, all right. We got a plan.

2096
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:42,380
I think I mean, we can wind it down.

2097
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:45,380
Unless there's unless I missed something incredible,

2098
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:50,420
someone out there is going to be like, he didn't even finish the bit like using

2099
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:54,980
logic and yeah, inferring.

2100
01:26:55,740 --> 01:27:03,300
I don't. There is a kind of strange sequence where they find the spot.

2101
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:06,020
Spot is the monster who lives under the stairs.

2102
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:09,140
They he's like a little dragon guy.

2103
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:10,420
He should have been in it more.

2104
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:11,700
They should. He should have been around.

2105
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:13,940
Yeah, they find him in the sewers in Paris.

2106
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:19,260
I'll say the gag I think I like the best was the at the Halloween party.

2107
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:23,900
Herman meets a group of undertakers who are just kind of like sinister,

2108
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:28,100
kind of weird ghouls, and they want him to work, work for them.

2109
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:30,300
I don't remember that.

2110
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:32,620
Neither do I.

2111
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:35,100
I'm looking at my phone or dealing with the baby. I don't know.

2112
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:36,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2113
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:39,020
Well, you know, it's the perfect kind of shit for you to do.

2114
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:41,380
And you're like, sit around, stay awake forever.

2115
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:44,740
You had a baby before the monsters had Eddie.

2116
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:47,140
That's a good point. In the new monsters.

2117
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:49,500
Good point. Wait, what do you mean?

2118
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:50,620
There's no Eddie.

2119
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:51,780
He has a baby. Oh, right.

2120
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:53,700
Oh, yes. Oh, I see.

2121
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:55,260
Right. Right. Insane.

2122
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:58,500
Yeah. At least you got to show us a baby with a widow's peak. Right.

2123
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,780
That's the main like easy.

2124
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:03,100
How do they not do that? It's the easiest thing ever.

2125
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:05,980
That's another thing where you're like, OK, Herman and grandpa are going to get along

2126
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:08,380
by the end of this. By the end of this, they're going to have Eddie.

2127
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:10,740
By the end, like none of it happens. Yeah.

2128
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:14,220
So strange. At least I guess the house is the closest thing.

2129
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:16,420
But still, that wasn't even something I was looking for.

2130
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:18,940
I was like, oh, it needs to have the house at the end.

2131
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:21,100
The other two, I was like, for sure, that's going to happen.

2132
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:23,340
Because there's even a scene where he's like, Lily, though.

2133
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:27,380
Well, like he's in the hotel room and they're going to like fornicate.

2134
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:32,620
Yeah. But I even talked about Lester, the werewolf deadbeat brother.

2135
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:34,300
Yeah, we haven't talked about Zombo.

2136
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:35,380
And I will say this.

2137
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:37,940
I have a Zombo toy from the movie that I bought.

2138
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:40,820
I had a friend buy me from Comic Con.

2139
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:43,020
You own a toy of this movie.

2140
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:44,660
Yeah, I do. Oh, my God.

2141
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:46,820
I have to sell it, I think.

2142
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:49,140
Let me ask you a question. Yes, go ahead.

2143
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:52,860
I got toys made Zombo and they're making toys from this movie.

2144
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:54,500
All right. I like the name Zombo.

2145
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:55,980
Zombo is great. And the design is cool.

2146
01:28:55,980 --> 01:28:57,060
So I may keep it. But.

2147
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:00,100
OK, just real quick. Tell me who is Zombo.

2148
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:02,220
Zombo is like a children.

2149
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:03,900
It's from the original show.

2150
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,980
He's like a TV character.

2151
01:29:05,980 --> 01:29:09,660
He's dressed like that when Ivan Ooze is like

2152
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:14,540
like advertising the Ooze with the little hat, the wizard's hat.

2153
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:17,180
He's like Zombo is like a children's character.

2154
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:18,420
Who is he in the movie?

2155
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,580
He's on TV. He's like a show. It's a show.

2156
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:22,220
Oh, OK. Zombo is doing a show.

2157
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:25,460
OK, I remember his Bozo.

2158
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:26,980
Exactly. Yes. OK.

2159
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:29,420
He's like Zombie Bozo. Yes. Yeah. OK. Interesting.

2160
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:33,740
So, yes, I got too excited and said, yeah, pick me up a Zombo.

2161
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:35,820
Griffin Newman may have also picked up a Zombo.

2162
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:37,300
I forget. I don't know.

2163
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:38,780
You might have two Zombo's.

2164
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:39,940
I don't know. Well, not for me.

2165
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:41,420
He bought it for himself.

2166
01:29:41,420 --> 01:29:43,140
I don't know if he has a Zombo or not,

2167
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:46,540
but I think he mentioned he may need a Zombo before Comic Con.

2168
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:50,660
He does use that phrase need for things like that.

2169
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:55,180
This is how all the I will say this is all the toy guys I know talk.

2170
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:57,460
I'm going to need one of those.

2171
01:29:57,460 --> 01:30:00,660
Yeah. Kind of like with a little regret, the little bit.

2172
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:03,220
Yeah. You know, you're aware of how it sounds.

2173
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:07,020
It's a justification in your own mind of like, can't turn this one down.

2174
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:09,540
Yeah. Shit. Oh, oh.

2175
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:12,660
All right. And so you're maybe not

2176
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:16,500
going to need to watch more than 38 minutes of the movie, but you are need to get

2177
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:18,980
you are going to need to get a Zombo.

2178
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:20,060
That's to the listeners.

2179
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:21,580
Yeah. For the listener. Yeah. Yeah.

2180
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:23,500
Well, I do like your Zombo.

2181
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,940
I do. I mean, he's in the box still.

2182
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:27,780
The box is cool.

2183
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:32,180
It will probably be the last zombie monster's toy I get because they're making

2184
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:36,980
this is in the eight inch doll line, which is different than the seven inch.

2185
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:39,580
Like the back to the future figures I've gotten, you are the seven inch

2186
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:40,860
ultimate line.

2187
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:42,460
Zombo is kind of more of like a doll.

2188
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:43,500
He's a little bit bigger.

2189
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,620
He's not a plush, but he's a little bit more.

2190
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:48,500
He's a little taller and he's a little bit more like, I don't know,

2191
01:30:48,620 --> 01:30:49,980
the clothes are a little looser.

2192
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:52,660
They're not like molded onto the figure.

2193
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:55,900
Well, speaking of pairing up obscure properties,

2194
01:30:56,380 --> 01:30:59,500
now you get to go home and Zombo can face off against Mr.

2195
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:01,460
Taffy. Yes.

2196
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:04,420
Oh, Zombo meets Taffy.

2197
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:07,340
It's funny you say that because I am

2198
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:11,420
I'm very big on making sure the scale is right when I'm displaying things.

2199
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:12,460
Ah, yeah.

2200
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:15,260
So I'll have to see how it lines up is what I'm saying.

2201
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:19,740
Well, it's hard to know how big Zombo or well, Zombo,

2202
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:21,660
more so Mr. Taffy.

2203
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:27,300
We don't you know, we only Jason can affirm that from his travels to New Jersey.

2204
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:30,180
Well, he's certainly taller than me.

2205
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:31,180
So

2206
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:34,380
I'd say he's a little tall.

2207
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:37,940
I think through pictures, I think I have a picture with Mr.

2208
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:39,140
Taffy. Oh, great.

2209
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:42,340
Well, there used to be a time on the board was your live time in the boardwalk.

2210
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:43,620
You could walk.

2211
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:46,860
You get a picture with this staffy, walk down the block,

2212
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:47,820
get a picture with Mr.

2213
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:49,220
Peanut, you know.

2214
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:50,540
Mm hmm. This seems a boy.

2215
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:52,100
So this is a sad New Jersey.

2216
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:54,140
Yeah, this is a really I know.

2217
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:58,660
Well, the calli after many decades, the peanut shop finally shut down.

2218
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:00,460
So blew up the peanut.

2219
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:02,380
They blew up the peanut.

2220
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:05,380
Last night blew up the peanut, man.

2221
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:08,660
All right. Well, it seems like we're done.

2222
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:14,580
So let me do the the little post show plugs and and then one more little thing.

2223
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:18,420
So you survived haunt cast the fright.

2224
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:22,380
And I hope you listen for I do hope you listen to more than 38 minutes of it.

2225
01:32:23,420 --> 01:32:25,460
Thank you for subscribing to the cemetery gate.

2226
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:29,140
If you want to dig like Grave, dig even deeper.

2227
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:33,380
Join us on our new Patreon tier club three, which has a spooky name coming.

2228
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:34,980
We'll have to discuss it.

2229
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:38,220
And that's where you get one more bonus episode every month

2230
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:41,460
and our regular episodes ad free for this month.

2231
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:45,220
We have landed on by audience demand in a squeaker.

2232
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:46,660
It's real squeak.

2233
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:47,580
I was incredible.

2234
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:51,700
I Island Under Siege, which is the 2002

2235
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:55,500
Marvel scare zone at Islands of Adventure,

2236
01:32:55,740 --> 01:32:59,580
where the superheroes are dead and the villains have run rampant.

2237
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:01,700
Yeah. And superhero Island.

2238
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:03,340
Yeah, that's a premise.

2239
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:05,420
I don't know about it.

2240
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:07,460
I'm excited to check it out.

2241
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:10,300
Thrilled. See, and see, it's sort of in league.

2242
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:14,060
It's as inventive as Mike's idea of pairing up the obscure.

2243
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:15,860
Yeah. Yeah.

2244
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:18,940
Which seems like then the Marvel rulebook came out.

2245
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:21,220
And that was the end of that.

2246
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:22,460
But we'll deal with that on Club Three.

2247
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:24,460
Check that out on Club Three for now.

2248
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:25,260
Just quick clip.

2249
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:28,980
This is from I was starting to say the Munsters today, the 80s show,

2250
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:30,100
when it's in the late 80s.

2251
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:33,180
So you know what you have to have your

2252
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:34,980
fish out of water characters do?

2253
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:36,100
They got a rap.

2254
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:41,580
And this is from the premise here is that the Munsters are

2255
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:44,180
they have gone to visit.

2256
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:46,820
So a rock band was living in their house.

2257
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:51,140
The rock band is called the Lizards and then grandpa turned them into actual lizards.

2258
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:57,060
So they they're going to be late for their heavily

2259
01:33:58,580 --> 01:34:01,180
hyped up appearance on the show Rock Fever.

2260
01:34:01,820 --> 01:34:04,780
So and the audience is psyched.

2261
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:07,780
They cannot wait to see the lizards.

2262
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:10,620
So the Munsters have to bring the lizards and hope that something

2263
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:12,900
happened or that they at least can apologize or whatever.

2264
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:15,260
But instead, oh, you guys must be the lizards.

2265
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:16,940
Shove them onto the stage.

2266
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:18,740
And now they're with the lizards instruments.

2267
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:19,860
What are we going to do?

2268
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:20,900
The audience is waiting.

2269
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:23,460
The audience doesn't seem to care that they aren't the band.

2270
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:25,340
They're so excited.

2271
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:27,020
They don't know what they look like.

2272
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:28,860
They just like the name the lizards.

2273
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:30,100
Anyway, what do we do?

2274
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:31,340
We got to improvise.

2275
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:35,420
And Herman improvises a rap about how much she loves Lily.

2276
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:39,020
So that's that this thanks for listening.

2277
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:41,980
And so we'll see how much of this we can we can get through.

2278
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:44,620
Take it away, Herman.

2279
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:49,060
Ready, one, two, one, two, three, four.

2280
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:58,100
I saw her across the swamp one night and knew it was love at first sight.

2281
01:34:58,260 --> 01:35:00,660
And tones and snakes slithered by.

2282
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:03,140
I hope that I would catch her eye.

2283
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:05,460
So he gives the monster rap.

2284
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:07,860
So he gives the monster rap.

2285
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:10,340
When she spoke, wolves howled and howled.

2286
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:12,060
Let's do it.

2287
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:15,140
I knew that I would love her so.

2288
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:17,100
She came right out and growled.

2289
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:21,780
He shakes the ground when he stalks him.
