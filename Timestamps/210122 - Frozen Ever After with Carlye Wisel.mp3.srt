1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,380
Oh, we're going up to Elsa's ice palace to argue about a slow moving boat ride.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,120
With you and you and you and Carly Weisel.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,200
Strap in.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,880
It's Frozen Ever After on Podcast the Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:44,880
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three guys who used to ride

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,320
the Frozen ride, but now pray the Zoom screen doesn't get frozen.

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,360
My name is Mike Carlson.

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,920
Joining me as always, Scott Gerdner.

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,240
You said make funny if we didn't like it, but I liked it.

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,240
So all right.

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,240
Well, thank you.

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,240
Yeah.

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,320
Jason Sheridan here.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,800
Do you like it?

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,200
I feel like I'd be getting twice as much grief as you are going to get.

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,120
They came out with that shit.

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
Well give it to me.

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,120
Come on.

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,120
You want it?

22
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,120
It's going to forever.

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,080
Let me have it.

24
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:22,800
It does sound a little like the like a youth pastor or something.

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Yeah.

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
Like, come on, let me have it.

27
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
Let me have it.

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Like, yeah.

29
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Call me a youth pastor.

30
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,360
Millennials are always on their iPhones, but what they should be saying is I accept Jesus

31
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,360
Christ as my Lord and Savior.

32
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,360
That sort of cumbersome.

33
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
You're right.

34
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
You're right.

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
That is OK.

36
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,360
I have been I have been owned.

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,840
I think I think Jason just owned me.

38
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,200
Just saying you're bringing that youth pastor energy to to a podcast.

39
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,120
And I think that's a compliment because he's saying that you're youthful.

40
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,440
You have a youthful appeal.

41
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,320
Anything with youth in it than the word to describe me.

42
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
I don't care.

43
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,000
I think you'd be like youthful killer, I guess.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,440
And I'd be like, well, thank you for calling me young.

45
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,720
Convicted youth counselor Mike Carlson.

46
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,160
Oh, well, thank you very much.

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,480
I very much appreciate it.

48
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,120
I've ignored the rest of the sentence.

49
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,920
The youth center strangler.

50
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,760
Oh, thank you for the nickname.

51
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
I appreciate it.

52
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
You did work at the youth center.

53
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
I do.

54
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,480
I do look young, right?

55
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,440
So that's how I'm doing.

56
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,400
Let's bring our guest in, right?

57
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,520
She wants to get in on the fun.

58
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,920
And I want to know if she liked that joke.

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,400
I loved the joke.

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,400
I'm just going to use Serp any introduction just to let everyone know

61
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,520
before they knew who I am that I love the joke that they will.

62
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,640
Thank you. That is, of course, the voice of podcast host, theme park journalist,

63
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,200
foamfluencer Carly Weisel.

64
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,080
She's here. She's back.

65
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,520
Thank you for being here.

66
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,480
Yeah, those titles are maybe why my college has never invited me back to speak.

67
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,800
But either way, I stand behind it.

68
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,520
Hello. Thank you for having me on.

69
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,400
Doesn't look impressive on a poster.

70
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,440
Yeah, I want to be invited back to my college, but

71
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,240
I want like the red carpet rolled out.

72
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,400
So I'm OK.

73
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,760
I think I got like I got like a crumb.

74
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,720
I think the trail has begun because they had me write a welcome letter for freshmen.

75
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,840
So I'm just putting it out there like, yeah, fly me in once.

76
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,680
That's a normal thing to do.

77
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,920
And I'll go to Southern Illinois and stand outside an experimental crop field

78
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,560
and be like, I went here.

79
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,800
That's all I want.

80
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,400
That's yeah. No, I hear that.

81
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,800
I never went to Southern.

82
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,280
I went to Illinois State, which is like midway.

83
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,960
And I went to Western to visit and I went to U of I to visit.

84
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,720
That's my way. Never Southern.

85
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,200
Well, because it's you know, I'm speaking for those of us.

86
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,920
Oh, I don't know. I see.

87
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,160
So you went to U of I. OK.

88
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,480
I saw Wilco at U of I.

89
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,080
I put that show on.

90
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,880
Is that true?

91
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,640
Yes. Really?

92
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,600
Yes. Wow. Really?

93
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,840
I went backstage at the Wilco show at U of I.

94
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,720
I probably was the person telling you you couldn't because I was in charge of security.

95
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,080
Well, the drummer Glenn has one of his students

96
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,280
I knew when I was playing in a band with him at the time.

97
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,520
We got to go backstage and I met Jeff Tweedy and Glenn Cochie.

98
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,880
I was like it was either me or my best friend who like escorted you backstage.

99
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Wow. This is great. Yeah.

100
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,760
I remember that show. Four minutes and then you're out.

101
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,040
Yeah. Wow. It was a good show.

102
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,160
Yeah, it's great. Wow.

103
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,880
I have a photo. I have photos of I have photos of it, too.

104
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,440
So we'll see if you're in the background.

105
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,560
I might have been in there.

106
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,960
I mean, Green Room is really a stretch when you're playing a campus show.

107
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,920
But I would have been I would have been there. Wow.

108
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,320
I know. What if we have some like weird foreign old version of us being friends?

109
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,480
Well, that's very possible.

110
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,960
Obviously, also, we have we said on the show our mothers were friends in high school.

111
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,840
Yes. So there's that one.

112
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,480
Well, yeah, it's a fair like once you hit a certain age, you're like, oh, God,

113
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,280
like everyone knows everyone.

114
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,200
You can't you can't just fuck around and like make fun of people publicly.

115
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,320
Like everything comes back to you.

116
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,160
Yeah, no, you should.

117
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,320
Everyone just scrub their history every couple of weeks, just in case you said

118
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,400
something mildly insulting about someone, just in case.

119
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,720
Well, anyway, we'll catch up about you if I guess later.

120
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,040
I could talk about the Wilco show.

121
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,800
I remember they covered Thunder Clap Newman in the encore,

122
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,200
but we don't need to talk about that on podcast the ride.

123
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,520
Save that for a different podcast.

124
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,120
We're talking frozen ever after today.

125
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
And we're going to get there because I think this is

126
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,360
this is part of the continuity from the podcast.

127
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,120
Because last time you were on, we talked a little bit about frozen

128
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,040
in the middle of living with the land, which is very controversial in general.

129
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,760
So I felt like we needed to keep the controversy

130
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,040
going with another very controversial episode.

131
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,920
But I think we should probably discuss

132
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,200
a controversial news story that just emerged from a few days ago.

133
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,680
Does anyone want to state what this is?

134
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,840
And we don't get to go to Disneyland anymore.

135
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,000
That's what's happening.

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,880
There is it.

137
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,280
Yeah, sure.

138
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,960
We do. We just have to set aside

139
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,000
a portion of our Patreon, but actually all of our Patreon money

140
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,960
to for one visit, go with the rate we were going. Yeah.

141
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,040
So the annual passholder program is no more.

142
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,120
It's going to be gone for what, at least a year

143
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,240
before they replace it with something.

144
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,440
Oh, I'm just going to let you know straight out of the gate.

145
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,120
I'm not making any assumptions. Yeah.

146
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,000
The point of view that I have is that looking at the language

147
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,400
of the statement that Ken Potrock put out, who I believe he's the president

148
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,480
of Disneyland Resort, it they keep saying the word membership,

149
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,640
which scares me.

150
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,480
That's not a word that we've like included in the bizarro Disney lexicon.

151
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,520
So I'm just going to I'm just going to sit this one out and wait

152
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,240
to see what happens, because I get the feeling I'm not even going to be able

153
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,120
to guess what happens. Interesting.

154
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,760
So you're thinking that some type of program emerges

155
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:08,040
that is so mind boggling or perhaps like vacation club

156
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
ask could emerge.

157
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,280
I mean, I don't want to be real galaxy brain about it.

158
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,520
I haven't been out of my house in a long, long time,

159
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,840
so I'm starting to lose it like a weird old recluse celebrity.

160
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,720
But regardless, like the wording, sunsetting membership,

161
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,960
like it all felt like red flags to me.

162
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,720
And so I know the general consensus online is like,

163
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,080
it's going to be a flex pass for everybody.

164
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,000
But I don't know.

165
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,560
That word membership just sticks out to me so strongly that I don't know

166
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,840
what it could mean.

167
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,760
That's what they use that word for country clubs, which are expensive.

168
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,800
Bingo. Yeah. Or opera operas,

169
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,320
symphonies, the membership of the symphony or a place

170
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,360
that's going to do like a four hour production of August O.C.

171
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,840
County. Like that's where you get memberships to.

172
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:01,080
I also is sunsetting is kind of not in the vibe of their usual lexicon

173
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,720
of like wishes, dreams, enchantment.

174
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,920
I kept saying sundowning,

175
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,720
I forgot, which I think he has more negative connotations, but sunsetting.

176
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,480
I was like, I have heard that used as a term of like we're retiring something.

177
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,400
But that that felt very targeted.

178
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,960
It felt like every news story made sure to use the term.

179
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,520
Yeah, I felt like the least upsetting phrase for

180
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,320
your whole life as you visited Disneyland has ended for now.

181
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,440
Yeah. Well, let me I have.

182
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,840
Yeah, I was thinking like it's going to come back.

183
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,680
Yeah. But what what monster will it emerge as?

184
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,200
Because we started when I moved to Los Angeles over 10 years ago.

185
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,480
I'm still young, but I moved here 10 years ago.

186
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,920
It was cheap as hell to go get an annual pass to Disneyland.

187
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,880
So they sort of got an adjacent cat at that.

188
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,600
I'm sure Scott had it then like they got us used to a lifestyle

189
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,160
with their cheap ticket.

190
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,720
And then slowly they've increased the price, increased the price.

191
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,640
And because we're suckers,

192
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,760
we've been paying it.

193
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,440
We've been we've been like forgoing other necessities, probably in our lives,

194
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,920
to make sure we allocate enough for a Disneyland annual pass when it used to be

195
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,760
like 200 bucks and you could go 200 days a year.

196
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,800
And it did feel like it was breaking because I think they really they long

197
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,880
gamed. I mean, I know they've had it for a while, but they long gamed like a

198
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,640
million people in Southern California and around the area.

199
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,560
So it was something that was going to break because so many people had gotten

200
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,520
used to popping into Disneyland for five hours here and there.

201
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,520
But it's not testing us. Like how much will you pay?

202
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,880
Will you do this? Will you do this? And the answer is always yes.

203
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,000
And so what are they going to do?

204
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,320
How do they clear out these parks that are getting too full and too full?

205
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,320
And now that there is a like state government mandated reason to make them

206
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,440
less full, now is the time to pull the carpet out.

207
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,760
Yeah. So it is it.

208
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,520
It does feel like we should brace ourselves if we want to.

209
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,240
Ever have the lifestyle of like 250 days a year going into Disneyland to get,

210
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,200
you know, a glass of wine and ride Big Thunder and leave.

211
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,000
We probably will have to pay about $15,000 a year.

212
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,440
That's a guess.

213
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,680
I don't know if it's unreasonable.

214
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,480
I really don't.

215
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,960
And well, I think the the other thing that, you know, I considered in the past

216
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,320
and I don't think this has been an option for a while now, but sometimes if my

217
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,960
family went down just for like a long weekend and we knew we would come back the

218
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:44,280
next summer, my dad would get like a seven day park hopper and just keep it in his

219
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,640
wallet for a year because for a time those days never expired.

220
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,280
And I think they've stopped selling those kinds of park hoppers on both coasts at

221
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,880
this point. But that was an option, too, because once you start adding on days,

222
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,440
the price per day starts to drop.

223
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,280
You buy anything in quantity, the price starts to drop.

224
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,480
You know, so it's I don't know, prepare for the worst, I think, is really what I'm

225
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
trying to say.

226
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,720
I understand the reasons that they're doing it and it'll probably make it a more

227
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,800
pleasant experience to be around there when you get to go there.

228
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,240
Like the rationale all totally makes sense to me.

229
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,800
But then on the flip side, I'm like, but I want to go.

230
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,400
I used to be able to go and this thing sucked and it's never ending.

231
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,560
And now when it's over, I don't get to go to Disneyland all the time or I have to

232
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,840
order, they'll be insanely cost prohibitive.

233
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,600
Yeah, I am feeling that way, too.

234
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,240
I was thinking, could it be could it be something crazier like, you know, how the

235
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,280
vacation club is some sort of very large amount of money and you like technically

236
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,640
own a room in a hotel?

237
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,400
Could they be like annexing like pieces of the park now?

238
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,240
And I technically own like a room on the Haunted Mansion if I pay fifty thousand

239
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,640
dollars and then I get to go into the park fairly regularly.

240
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,960
Is that possible?

241
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,960
I think it is. One way to do it.

242
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,040
I'm definitely in denial of this.

243
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,640
Yeah, I think it's not.

244
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,840
Well, and you had you were posting about because you have a premiere.

245
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,240
I'm going to get that's even more complicated.

246
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,200
Yeah.

247
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,600
And I'm like just waiting to see what money they gave me back because I got a

248
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,160
premiere pass like a genius two weeks before a pandemic.

249
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,080
Sorry, premiere is the one that gets you into Disneyland and Disney.

250
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,800
Yeah, this is going to sound like like I'm a living fossil, but it gets you into

251
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,040
any Disney park in America any day of the week and all year round, which like

252
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,880
these are no blackouts, no blackouts at either resort any day of the year.

253
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,640
OK, OK.

254
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,520
So that's that's gone.

255
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,840
Oh, I'm seeing here they've just announced that pass now costs five

256
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,600
hundred thousand dollars a year.

257
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:06,280
Oh, yeah, I look, I am happy because I'm not really happy, but I like for the

258
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,000
person who comes in for their once a year trip, is it going to be less filled

259
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,720
with people like us who are just like roaming and mulling about and like

260
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,680
commenting on like, oh, there's some chipped pain up here in New Orleans

261
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,760
Square. Like they won't have to see that horribleness.

262
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,000
But yes, I still am going to miss commenting on that chipped paint.

263
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,960
This is where I feel maybe unself aware.

264
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,600
I'm like, you know, I see all this stuff grumbling about annual pass holders and

265
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,000
how exactly what you're saying, like they're never happy and they come in and

266
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,160
don't even spend any money and just clog the place up.

267
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,920
But now but then I'm going like, yeah, but that's not me, though, right?

268
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,720
I'm not part of the problem.

269
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,680
I was even saying to Aaron the night that it happened like that's like not

270
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,240
like I think I help the vibe at Disney.

271
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,280
I'm like I'm like the guy who starts the wave at the baseball game.

272
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,920
I'm helping with the spirit and the morale.

273
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,800
I'm not a drag. I'm not not walking around complaining, right?

274
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,400
I'm one of the good ones, right?

275
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,680
I oh, I can't confidently say that I'm the one I bring a backpack.

276
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:20,160
I my own reusable water bottle, a bag of Clif bars, my own sunscreen.

277
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,320
Like I have gone down and not spent any money, you know, besides parking.

278
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,520
And then, yeah, you don't have your wagons.

279
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,720
You don't have your wagons of ice and.

280
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,520
They are playing with fire.

281
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,960
They already banned the wagons and the massive coolers.

282
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,320
So like the low, I mean, the locals are going to want to go when this

283
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,640
when Disneyland always back up, they're going to have to figure something out.

284
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,400
I have to say it's a shame, though,

285
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,160
where it's probably helpful that flex pass

286
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,640
reservations worked pretty well the year or so I had it.

287
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,480
And so I'm assuming whatever comes back would probably be something along those lines.

288
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,040
Yeah, I would guess.

289
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,080
But yeah, membership is it's a good point that Carly makes that membership is an interesting word.

290
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,240
And we'll see what that means.

291
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,040
Mike, you should do a deep dive.

292
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,960
You should research the vacation club point system,

293
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,320
because that that would be right up your alley.

294
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,640
I do know a little bit about it.

295
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,200
Bank the bank a certain amount of points for the size of the room

296
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,920
or the number of days you go.

297
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,760
And it's yes, there's equations and it's incredibly.

298
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,480
What makes you say that's a Mike's alley and not Scott's alley?

299
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,600
Huh? Well, Mike famously loves point.

300
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,040
I mean, he's got a whole system with the point.

301
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,920
You're saying that I don't want to solve math equations to go to a theme park.

302
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,960
I think I explained like five minutes of the vacation club to Scott like a year ago,

303
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,200
and I think he shouted at me to stop.

304
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,640
I don't mind.

305
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:58,360
Probably that'll be a if you ever want to do a Scott free episode,

306
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,960
if you want to getting off Scott free, you could call it.

307
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,240
Feel free to just do the dry vacation club point rundown episode.

308
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,080
So then and I will step away from it so that I will bear no responsibility

309
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,000
for the for what I listen to the content, the roof, when our numbers explode

310
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,480
and the podcast takes over, my favorite murder is the top podcast in the world.

311
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,360
That's what will happen.

312
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,520
Finally, we always wanted to always wanted.

313
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,120
All right. So, Carly, any last thoughts about this?

314
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,280
Any other?

315
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,480
I mean, the things that I'm thinking about now is just that it's

316
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,640
even if things do go slightly back to normal where you have some sort of

317
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,480
past membership, whatever, where you can visit the parks,

318
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,240
it's going to be really hard to coordinate with your friends the way we used to.

319
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,960
Because I had friends who had every type of pass

320
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,120
and we were still able to find those pockets where we would all line up

321
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,280
and be able to go.

322
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,720
And depending on what happens, that's probably not going to be as easy.

323
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,120
Right. That's something I thought about.

324
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,560
They were our Scott, Mike and Jason to be able to go to the park again.

325
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,600
Like the thing that we did all the time that spurred this show.

326
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,880
Can we not do it anymore?

327
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,440
I don't know. It's it's possible.

328
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,480
Yeah, it's possible that like one of us will have to win the lottery

329
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,520
to get the actual good pass and then somebody else.

330
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,320
Like I'll have a pass that just gets me into California Adventure

331
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,920
from like noon to four on Wednesdays.

332
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,240
And I can only go on the like I can only go on Soren and Grizzly River Rapids.

333
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,320
And that's it.

334
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,760
And that can pass costs $10,000 a year.

335
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,920
There's always Costco tickets, Costco tickets.

336
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,080
Yeah. And we look, we could also just go hard at nots.

337
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,440
You know, we could just go hard and say, you know what?

338
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,440
F Disneyland.

339
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,880
Nots is the place we live.

340
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,040
I mean, even Universal was sending some shady tweets.

341
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,120
So I mean, they're they're ready for pass holders.

342
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,160
Were they saying like, yeah, we're considering how our annual pass program

343
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,920
is going to work?

344
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,320
Oh, they tweeted something that was just like, oh, well, love you.

345
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,920
Our annual pass holders like just very sassy towards Disney.

346
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,560
OK, I mean, I know they can win me over.

347
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,880
And certainly I've heard a rumor that, you know, next year is when Nintendo Land

348
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,480
might open and I certainly will want to spend a lot of time in Nintendo Land.

349
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,960
So they can certainly win me or they can get me.

350
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm get a bull by Universal at this point.

351
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,720
So we'll see. We'll see what happens.

352
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,800
There's a lot of things that still have to play out in our real world logistically

353
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,680
to even get to the point where we're talking about what the past system looks like.

354
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,320
Yeah, it is. It is a bit hard to mourn like, oh, I can't hang out

355
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,480
with my friends at Disneyland when I haven't truly seen a living soul

356
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,520
like many, many weeks.

357
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,240
Mm hmm. I yeah, I just hope that Six Flags doesn't follow suit

358
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,320
and they get rid of their by a churro, get an annual pass for free deal

359
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,200
that they don't.

360
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,120
They need to keep incentives like that going for me to want to go back to Six Flags.

361
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,640
I'm just going to go all in on the Santa Monica Pier.

362
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,120
That's my move. I've bought a pass there before.

363
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,400
It was like 100 bucks.

364
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,880
They have a decent coaster. It does the trick.

365
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,680
But they're never going to have a membership situation.

366
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
So why not? Yeah, we should just all.

367
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,320
You know, baby, you're popping off a POP.

368
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,640
This podcast is all about the Santa Monica Pier from now on.

369
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,760
Yeah, we're in protest.

370
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,160
We're going to get rid of the old Disneyland episodes on our feed

371
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,680
and replace them retroactively with Santa Monica Pier episodes.

372
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,960
Just not a whole.

373
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,360
All right. We're covering the rotating school bus again.

374
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,480
All right. The coffee bean, the coffee bean for

375
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,160
Taco Bell booth.

376
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,400
Taco Bell slash KFC.

377
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,440
Yeah. Episode five.

378
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,640
I do. I don't know if this is in your lineup for notes,

379
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,880
but I think we do need to discuss that quiet Disneyland announcement today

380
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,960
that they're kind of turning the Rainforest Cafe into a Star Wars store.

381
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah, I miss this.

382
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,800
I know this is breaking to me.

383
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,720
Yeah, it was very subdued.

384
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,920
It was kind of like, oh, like we're going to open a spaceport in a former jungle.

385
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,080
Really? Yeah.

386
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,480
I mean, that's right up your alley.

387
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,840
Yeah. Yeah.

388
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,960
Thanks. Thank God they're using the building for something.

389
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,840
It's it's been so creepy every time you walk by it

390
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,600
because it's just a husk of something.

391
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,640
It's it's somebody pointed out, it might have been Freddy.

392
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,160
It might have been Freddy from Batuu

393
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,520
that it looks the building kind of looks like, you know, a base,

394
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,840
like a rebel base or a resistance base already.

395
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,960
So it may be if they could actually do something cool with the theming.

396
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,640
I don't know if they're going to, but I hope so.

397
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,760
Yeah. Well, they're still dusty vines.

398
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,520
They're still dusty rainforest vines, I guess, in there.

399
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,120
Seem to be the only that.

400
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,760
So you think it's all still everything inside has not been taken out.

401
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,080
I I think I would I would have thought it was taken out.

402
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,160
But then when they were like, it's a junk reclaimed jungle base, I was like,

403
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,160
oh, I guess there's maybe some of it still in there

404
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,000
or maybe some of the walls were painted that they could just continue to use

405
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,200
or just do a fresh coat of paint or they have to sweep out like me

406
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,920
a knee deep amount of old chicken tender breading.

407
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,760
It's been sitting there for four years.

408
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,960
They got a fumigate.

409
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,240
Yeah, that's there.

410
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,600
Well, if there's like animatronic animals still there,

411
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,240
they can't use those right, because those are owned by Tillman for Tita.

412
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,800
I don't I have to think those are I would pray I would love

413
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,320
I would love for there to be like barely concealed rainforest cafe stuff.

414
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,360
To me, that would add to the story so much more.

415
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,480
Yes, I agree.

416
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,000
I mean, it would be in keeping with what they've done lately.

417
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,080
Like the old what was that's the thing called the premier store?

418
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,760
What is the the store that they opened that's like a spirit Halloween?

419
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,040
The warehouse, the store in the like in the in the wants to be a millionaire

420
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,120
play it where it's where the play it sign is still there.

421
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,680
Yeah. Stage 17, I believe.

422
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,520
OK. Yes.

423
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,640
Scott's got to tour that.

424
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,960
Yeah, that was that was something.

425
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,840
Yeah, I described it on the podcast as the single most depressing thing

426
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,840
Disney's ever put together.

427
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,600
It's the saddest story.

428
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,440
After this episode, I might have to disagree with you on that.

429
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,120
Oh, my gosh. Oh, boy.

430
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,440
Well, that's a preview.

431
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,000
I've been this up.

432
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,160
They had moved.

433
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,880
Correct me if I'm wrong.

434
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,080
They what do they they like got rid of the Wonder Ground Gallery, right?

435
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,240
And they put like Star Wars stuff in there for now.

436
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,520
Yeah. And I think this is a move to be able to bring artwork back.

437
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,920
OK, that's good. That's basically what's my question, because I like that gallery.

438
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,800
That was always a nice, fun little browse.

439
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,560
Yeah. I have I bought a ton of small things there.

440
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,880
Yeah. You could get postcards, coasters or like

441
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,800
$10,000 paintings of like sexy Cinderella

442
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,560
by comic book artist J. Scott Campbell.

443
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,000
Which is a comic book artist that Jason and I read is or looked at as

444
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,760
huge, hugely popular and still very popular.

445
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,080
And he does. Yeah.

446
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,600
He does princess artwork anyway.

447
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So that's good that that's coming back is what I'm saying.

448
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,640
I believe so. I truly glanced at this as I was getting into the car.

449
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,360
So, yeah, I will.

450
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,720
I kind of did the same, but I also saw footage from downtown

451
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,560
today and was a little surprised to see.

452
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,840
I guess it is Sunday afternoon as we record.

453
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,120
It was crowded.

454
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,440
It was why?

455
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,280
Nothing to do.

456
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,280
I'm not like, I don't know.

457
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,520
I I guess I went in somewhere,

458
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,160
went to a window and got coffee the other day.

459
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,360
But like I couldn't I don't think I could handle that right now.

460
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,760
Well, there was a seven a seven hour line for Gideon's Bakery yesterday

461
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,040
at Disney Springs, am I right? Yeah.

462
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,960
I mean, now this is currently

463
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,680
this is if I had a beat, it was the chocolate cookie beat.

464
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,360
I mean, I've been obsessed with Gideon's for years since they.

465
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,360
So for anyone who doesn't know,

466
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,080
Gideon's Bakehouse is this very, very small local Orlando bakery

467
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,400
that basically went from I think it's like a 280 square foot stall

468
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,440
at a food hall, like a small, not like a New York City food hall,

469
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,720
like a small market food hall.

470
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,640
And then now has a flagship at Disney Springs that had full day long waits

471
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,800
on opening day.

472
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,280
So it's like a wonderful small business story.

473
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,360
But this cookie was sold at the polite pig at Disney Springs for eight bucks,

474
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,280
which is like a huge upsell.

475
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,320
And so people like me who were like, I got to get this cookie

476
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,040
would drive to the bakery and then drive back like I fully drove away

477
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,840
from everyone's vacation destination to go buy a cookie.

478
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,240
And I'm completely obsessed with it.

479
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,360
I usually have at least one in my freezer because I need it.

480
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,040
It's like my life source.

481
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,920
But it's so good.

482
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,320
It's like it's a wonderful story.

483
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,240
I'm so for it because it's like a small business and a quality product.

484
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,560
And it's run by one guy who never took any investment,

485
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,640
which is the opposite of Tillman.

486
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,200
So it's just it's real nice that he's just there in the middle

487
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,640
of this cluster of all these big brands.

488
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,000
Well, that's good.

489
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,520
And the Disney Springs one is themed like an occult store,

490
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,840
which I think is so why like I'm so into that.

491
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,480
Yeah, I am excited by these long lines.

492
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,840
This is this is my number one list.

493
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,720
When I when I get back to Florida, this might be my most

494
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,520
anticipated attraction is the New Gideon's cookies.

495
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,520
Yeah. And they have cake, too, and crazy ice coffees on tap like

496
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,920
and bookshelves that turn in.

497
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,200
They spent a year sourcing the antiques for the store.

498
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,600
It's just great.

499
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,800
Well, what's the phone situation there?

500
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,760
They have no phone, but I'm not going to hold it against them

501
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,640
because there's Starbucks like a few steps away.

502
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,280
And that's Starbucks has fantastic phone. Sure.

503
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,520
So what what would be the amount of time?

504
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,480
This is for everybody that you would spend

505
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,680
because I want to go to this place.

506
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,400
It looks cool. The food looks the treats look good.

507
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,640
What is the amount of time you would feel comfortable waiting in line

508
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,160
to get to get there? OK.

509
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,760
So to clarify, the Disney Springs location had a virtual queue.

510
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,080
So it's kind of just like your your tap, your tied into it.

511
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,840
So I would wait probably either four hours or 11.

512
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,040
Like I would put my name in and then come back at the end of the day.

513
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,080
But I've waited in the line at the because the actual place

514
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,800
used to have a line before Covid.

515
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,160
I think I waited 45 minutes.

516
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,800
OK, that's reasonable. Yeah, that's fun.

517
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,160
I mean, Mike and I have waited like two hours for

518
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,160
hot chicken, Hal and Ray's hot chicken.

519
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,640
Yeah, I love waiting in a long line to eat.

520
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,600
I don't know why.

521
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,800
Do you what do you think our line waiting tolerance is going to be like after this?

522
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,920
You think it'll be higher or lower?

523
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,240
I think I think mine will be at the ground.

524
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,000
Really? Standing around waiting to do something.

525
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,560
Hmm. I will.

526
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,240
Scott, we go just we've all had to do it for the grocery store.

527
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,960
And yeah, now we've all had like a lot of does that make us more

528
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,760
like ready for lines or?

529
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,320
I don't know. I mean, you know, I'm in line for the

530
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,600
the the pop figurines on Hollywood Boulevard.

531
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,720
Several days. You paid like

532
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,960
you paid a fiver user.

533
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,120
You're technically in line right now.

534
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,920
You have to when this is done, you have to go back.

535
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,360
Yeah, yeah. So we're going to have to.

536
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,360
Are we OK with this episode being about 35 minutes?

537
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,040
We're going to have to be able to show them. They usually are.

538
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,040
Scott's got to get that Khaleesi pop that has different shoes than the normal pop.

539
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,600
I got to get the double pop of the Duffer Brothers.

540
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,880
I need both Duffer Brothers as pop figures.

541
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,200
I won't be happy to have a two pack of David

542
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,680
of David Duchovny and Sean William Scott from Evolution.

543
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,960
You know, that's a big deal.

544
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,840
You can only get them together. You can't get them.

545
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,280
I have them both from separate from Dude, Where's My Car and from X-Files,

546
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,800
but I need them from the same from the same film and franchise.

547
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,480
That makes a lot of sense. Yeah.

548
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,080
I can't really gauge what I think people's tolerance overall,

549
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,120
because I have a very high tolerance for Waiting In Line.

550
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,360
And Jason, I think also has a similar.

551
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,240
Jason, I waited no problem, like five hours for Guardians of the Galaxy

552
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,120
the first time.

553
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,960
Something like that, kind of a precursor, kind of a prologue to this podcast.

554
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,680
We had just started like rough, like sketching it out at the time.

555
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,200
They just started talking about it.

556
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,680
I think we knew we knew it was taking forever,

557
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,920
but we like split a whole donut and it was fine.

558
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,520
You know, like one of those giant donuts.

559
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,200
So I think people will just be happy to be out of the house, honestly.

560
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,480
I think people will just be thrilled to be standing somewhere else

561
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,800
close by other humans.

562
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,240
I think they'll be like they'll be like a six month grace,

563
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,480
like six month honeymoon period with lines for people.

564
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,000
You know, I thought I'd be like dancing through the streets.

565
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,320
And now the more I think about it and the longer I sit inside,

566
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,800
I feel like I'm just going to be permanently panicked about where to pee,

567
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,120
because I've had toilet access right by me for a whole year.

568
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,000
And now, like if I wait in line for 90 minutes, what am I going to do?

569
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,720
Yeah, that's a good point.

570
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,520
I have thought about that because when we drove down to like Anaheim

571
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,880
and went to like grab portillas and stuff, I was like, all right,

572
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,320
I can't drink any water before I have to make sure.

573
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,840
Yeah, I don't want to stop in.

574
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,640
We all read the article about Covid coming up through the toilet.

575
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,520
I don't want to get toilet Covid, the worst kind.

576
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,680
So there are certainly those things are going to remain, I think,

577
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,680
even if you kind of like logistically know, OK, it seems like the it's

578
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,800
this isn't a route like you will still feel an anxiety about a lot of things,

579
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,000
I assume. But just feel like I mean, I already had a real out of body moment.

580
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,880
The first time I see a family playing that heads up game,

581
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,880
that like Ellen iPhone game, I'm just going to be like,

582
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,320
for the last two years, real.

583
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,920
Yeah, well, that's yeah, I was imagining, honestly, we were doing the episode.

584
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,880
I went back and listened to our last episode just to make sure

585
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,440
I remembered what everyone said.

586
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,080
And I was remembering people just being in this apartment.

587
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,200
And I was like, this does it feels like it happened two weeks ago.

588
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,600
So our brains are going to block out.

589
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,640
It's really going to be bizarre when we come on the other side of it,

590
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,480
because it'll feel like I did like your brain or just be like, nope, didn't happen.

591
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,000
Go on. And you'd be like, I thought like it'll be a movie

592
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,800
like where somebody has like thoughts that they don't know what they mean.

593
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,040
And you'll be like, but I swear we were inside for 18 months.

594
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,680
And you'll be like, I don't know what you're talking about.

595
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,800
Brian, get a hold of yourself.

596
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:15,240
Or simply eternal sunshine ourselves like we'll do the best we can to just.

597
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,440
And it helps that it's all been incredibly forgettable.

598
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,480
So there'll be some natural forgetfulness

599
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,160
about all of this, but yeah, it's yes.

600
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,080
Yes, simultaneously.

601
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,600
Yeah, it felt like a week and a year and a half or whatever the hell.

602
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,160
There's no. Yeah, my memory is just totally shocked.

603
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:43,080
Jane and I were rewatched the last two because Riverdale comes back this week

604
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,280
and Jane and I watched the last two episodes of season four.

605
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,040
And I was like, oh, my God, I forgot all of this.

606
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,920
I forgot all of this stuff happened.

607
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,240
Like we spent the first two weeks of quarantine, just binging Riverdale.

608
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,280
And I was like, do you remember that?

609
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,280
Do you remember when we did that?

610
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,640
I forgot. I mean, it's also a show where it's like, oh, I forgot about the Tickle Club.

611
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,000
I forgot about the tickle where they got their arrival tickle video sites. What?

612
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,440
Yeah, it's that I mean, this is after the cult and after the inset.

613
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,680
Like it's it's you know, it goes a lot of places.

614
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,760
Quick, because we got to start on the actual right.

615
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,240
But what is the tickle club? Yeah.

616
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,200
Well, like that movie, that documentary tickled about the guy

617
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,800
who would make the tickle websites and he was a real like nut job.

618
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,000
They incorporated that into a season of.

619
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,320
Oh, I didn't. OK, I didn't know this was a Riverdale.

620
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,920
I thought you were saying you shifted focus to an entirely other world.

621
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,640
I didn't know there was tickling in Riverdale world.

622
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,160
Scott, you thought he was talking about his own life.

623
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,800
And he said, yeah, after the inset. Oh, yeah. After the.

624
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,880
Well, the tickle club.

625
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,360
Yeah, obviously the tickle club, you know, live comedy.

626
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,200
Shut down pretty quickly. Theme parks, tickle clubs.

627
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,160
You know, they were number three.

628
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:59,360
Newsome keeps issuing new tickle clubs must be at 40 percent capacity.

629
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,840
Commodon Oldsum canceled the news.

630
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,040
Oh, well, we found out he was at a tickle club last week.

631
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,640
The fanciest tickle club. Yeah.

632
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,080
That son of a bitch

633
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,520
getting tickled when we can't.

634
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,480
Unbelievable.

635
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,280
This is just you're just describing the Bohemian Grove.

636
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,920
How is the Bohemian Grove complex fair during all of this question?

637
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,040
All right. We got to get into it.

638
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,160
Yeah, we have. You just you just relistened.

639
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,640
You just relistened to living with the land, and I'm glad that you did,

640
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,560
because I'm not going to.

641
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,200
I don't want to go back to the scene of the crime.

642
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,800
I have never.

643
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,280
I've never felt so audience despised as when I said my thoughts about

644
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,360
living with the land, I was I was worried that there would be some kind of

645
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,960
podcast, 25th Amendment invoked by the audience and that encouraging

646
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,720
Mike and Jason to replace me with Carly.

647
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,240
That was my fear in the days following that.

648
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,280
I feel like the energy would quickly shift very negative

649
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,760
if I was just given a platform to yell along with people.

650
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,640
Oh, boy.

651
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,160
I will say Nancy Pelosi urged Jason and I to replace Scott.

652
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,840
But right now, we don't feel it's the appropriate thing

653
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,080
because we don't we want to sow unity.

654
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,560
We need to unite.

655
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,360
And we don't want to get.

656
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,960
And what else is Scott going to do?

657
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,760
We don't want to get Scott's followers riled up is what we're saying.

658
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,520
God has a certain core audience that we just don't want to upset right now.

659
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,760
So. Esenon.

660
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,160
And they love they love going to a

661
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,320
catall restaurants.

662
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,360
That's their Ike.

663
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,760
Well, that's that's where Scott does this.

664
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,320
Estra. New Estra.

665
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,360
New Estra. Yeah, that's right.

666
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,000
Yeah, I kind of give the messages to the to the es shaman

667
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:03,440
who who will store in various places with a giant wine glass on a staff.

668
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,920
They were they were all no launch queens, but then they were a little confused,

669
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,760
though, when you actually went on a launch coaster.

670
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,520
So what does it mean?

671
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,640
The message changed. Yeah.

672
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,840
What's the mission now?

673
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,840
He's betrayed us. Clone is clone.

674
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,160
They do some retconning to explain some of your character development

675
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,960
and your choices.

676
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,800
They'll work it out. Yeah.

677
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,840
But so, yes, when we discussed

678
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,080
living with the land, the slow moving one slow moving Epcot boat ride

679
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,080
as opposed to the one we're talking about today, there was a little bit

680
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:44,560
of compare contrast going on with with frozen ever after.

681
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,040
And I remember some of the points, but maybe not all.

682
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,440
But I was surprised to hear the the the negative feelings

683
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,600
about frozen ever after and to see it like painted as sort of the

684
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,680
somehow like an antithesis to living with the land.

685
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,280
I'm not sure if that's exactly how you feel.

686
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,120
If one is the opposite of the other.

687
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,160
I don't want to go putting your opinions in your mouth.

688
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,480
I'm just trying to remember some of what happened long ago in January.

689
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,440
But frozen ever after Carly thoughts.

690
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,600
Feel free to take it away.

691
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,800
I mean, I'm not going to lie.

692
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,680
My brain is so mush now that I didn't realize they were both boat rides

693
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,440
until a minute ago. And you said it.

694
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,560
And I was like, oh, they are both boat rides.

695
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:31,520
So I have not I've not thought of them in any like linear way, I suppose.

696
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,080
But frozen, I have I have some issues with it.

697
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,200
I have some praise for it.

698
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,560
I will say from the get go, you're not going to hear any Maelstrom

699
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,440
discussion from me because I have no attachment to it.

700
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,560
I came in fresh, just all frozen.

701
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,160
So a lot of times people's Maelstrom love colors their perception of frozen

702
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,640
ever after, but not me.

703
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,840
This is true.

704
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:00,120
And I was wondering that with myself, because I will say I'm a person

705
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,200
with very strong Maelstrom love very much.

706
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:09,040
I tell that to Eson on be sure to pay proper homage to the Maelstrom,

707
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,440
to the three headed the three headed troll will return.

708
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,400
But yeah, love loved Maelstrom.

709
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,600
And I you could tell when the announcement was made that they were going to shift

710
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,160
it to frozen, there was that there was going to be that that was that was

711
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,720
big trouble for Disney theme partners.

712
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,600
They were they were messing with it with a big way.

713
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,680
I feel like that's people are fond of it, for sure.

714
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,600
Yeah, I'm going to put my marker down on this.

715
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,400
This is my like you motherfuckers.

716
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,840
I can't believe you took that.

717
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,960
I would like and I know it was.

718
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,360
Yeah, I know it's weird and I know it was odd.

719
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,720
And that's why I love it. Yeah.

720
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,120
That's why I love Maelstrom. My whole family loved it.

721
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,320
I don't I don't say that's a lot that I'm putting my my marker down on.

722
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,360
Like I I was not happy.

723
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,000
I thought they did in a really like like they announced

724
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
it in September, I think of 2014.

725
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,080
Yeah. And then by October 2014, Maelstrom was closed.

726
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,760
Geez. Nobody had to say goodbye.

727
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,600
I mean, I think.

728
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,320
I think the the Mr.

729
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,120
Toad to poo was probably worse in the 90s,

730
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,400
but at least you can find Mr.

731
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,800
Toad other places.

732
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,320
Maelstrom was one of was one of a kind.

733
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,800
Yeah, I can't pretend.

734
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,560
Yeah, here we are.

735
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,600
No, Carly, what you just said.

736
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,440
Now we're letting it color the discussion.

737
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,640
But I think it is important context.

738
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,560
Oh, I'm also coloring the discussion.

739
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,760
I just personally I won't be bringing that energy, but we got one already.

740
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,440
So we're good.

741
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,400
Yeah. No, it's it's me.

742
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,400
I I you know, I think it the.

743
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,600
Obviously, like I'll come out and like it

744
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,840
it goes it goes against the original Epcot

745
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,920
theory of like, all right, no characters in this part.

746
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,640
We're going to do different stuff.

747
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,120
And then like, OK, we cut we cut the different thing.

748
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:09,800
We cut the interesting, unique ride, and we're shoving in some characters in here.

749
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,280
And then also, I was surprised this was addressed so directly

750
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,000
because I was like, that's kind of weird.

751
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,440
You switch from like a country's history and heritage to like this fictional world.

752
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,680
And at the time, Tom Staggs, who was the

753
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,480
I believe the chief operating officer

754
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,640
and then the chief operator, yes, he was asked,

755
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,320
is that appropriate for World Showcase and said,

756
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,600
if the goal is to give people a taste of something like Scandinavia

757
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:45,240
with the Norway Pavilion, then Frozen would only increase the extent to which

758
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,800
people would be drawn to it.

759
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,520
To me, it doesn't seem out of character at all.

760
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,040
And I'm like, I I don't know if that's right.

761
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,080
Like if you were like, Morocco is now Agrabah.

762
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,360
I think everyone would be like, whoa, what the hell, man?

763
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,680
What? Maybe, maybe.

764
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,000
Yeah, here's just the very Cliff Notes thing is that this is an attraction

765
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,960
in World Showcase in Epcot.

766
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,160
Every pavilion in that area represents a different country.

767
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,040
This is the Norway Pavilion that we're talking about.

768
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,360
There is a boat ride that is the centerpiece of the Norway Pavilion.

769
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,280
For a long time, it was the Maelstrom, which was this crazy adventure

770
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,840
with trolls and warriors and inexplicable oil barracks

771
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,480
shooting fire that I'm very fond of.

772
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,000
And yes, they switched it out to be about Frozen.

773
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,120
Frozen is not set in Norway.

774
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,680
If you haven't seen Frozen, Frozen is set in Arendelle, correct?

775
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,400
Yes. So, yeah, it's a straight.

776
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:49,400
There is a vibe to the film that is like it can hold hands with Norway

777
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,760
and with the vibe of the pavilion that was there already and with the exterior.

778
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,160
But it's yeah, it's it's a little odd.

779
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,760
It is definitely not a movie set in Norway.

780
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,440
Yeah, it's they're both snowy places,

781
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,760
which I guess is maybe the justification.

782
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,240
I mean, obviously, the justification is put the movie stuff in

783
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,840
because people are going to come and want to go on a movie ride.

784
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,920
And they loosely lose like I guess Ratatouille works better

785
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,160
because that actually happened in France.

786
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,320
But still, yes, it was Jason was saying it's away from the original up.

787
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,760
But this is are we sure?

788
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,520
Wait, are we sure that Arendelle is not in Norway?

789
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,440
Isn't Arendelle made up?

790
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,720
Because I think you can make up a city.

791
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,280
I mean, because all I'm thinking of is like all the stuff I've written about

792
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,360
when they reopened that and they reopened like the Royal Summer Hoos,

793
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,680
which I think is what they call the meet and greet.

794
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,280
They like they they went on like trips to Norway to source inspiration.

795
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,280
And I'm kind of like if they sourced it directly from Norway

796
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,680
and it inspires also and matches what the film is, then is Arendelle?

797
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,680
Well, it's I'm seeing it says it's Norwegian inspired.

798
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,920
OK, Dale. So there's a town called Arendelle, apparently.

799
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,640
OK, OK. So, yes, close to that.

800
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,800
It's close. Yeah.

801
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,280
That justifies it a little better, I would say this.

802
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,680
So, yeah, I think so.

803
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,920
But yes, it's going to be hard for Maelstrom not to come into this conversation.

804
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,560
But we've been doing a few things recently, classic Epcot stuff.

805
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,960
And Epcot is not this anymore.

806
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,800
We have to let it we have to let it go.

807
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,120
I didn't mean to say I swear to God.

808
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,280
I'm so sorry. Fuck off.

809
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,840
So sorry. Let me have it, Jason. Come on.

810
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,840
No, I. Youth pastor.

811
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,720
I'm a cool, youthful youth pastor.

812
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,720
But like that's like the deal is like it's just going to be movies and TV now at Epcot.

813
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,080
And I don't love it. It's not my choice.

814
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,040
I wish all these rides were like original.

815
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,280
I wish they they can replace

816
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,000
Universe of Energy with a roller coaster.

817
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,840
I wish it was some original nonsense, scary IP

818
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,600
that children would be terrified of and it would confuse people.

819
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,000
That's what I would prefer than Guardians of the Galaxy.

820
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,400
But that's not the world we're living in.

821
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,400
So I'm going to try I'm trying to just judge frozen based on like,

822
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,960
this is the reality.

823
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,120
How good of a job did they do?

824
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,840
And I think they did a great job.

825
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,080
I honestly, this is one of my favorite.

826
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,120
There we have it.

827
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,920
Favorite new rides. I love Guardians.

828
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,160
I love this and that's I don't love every new thing.

829
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,240
I even think there's some aspects of this.

830
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,720
I like more than Rise of the Resistance.

831
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,920
I'll be honest with everyone here.

832
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,400
I'll lay it out real. Oh, that's pretty.

833
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,520
Yeah. How about that?

834
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,920
How about that is it take?

835
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,800
Why is my name being associated with this episode?

836
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,960
We think you don't think like as we were.

837
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,200
This came up before.

838
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,600
I'm going to before we get into it, I'm I'm on Team Mike

839
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,080
and I'm so glad I'm not going it alone here.

840
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,400
Yeah, I'm with I really like it.

841
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,480
I think we were just we were surprised to hear the

842
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,200
the counterpoint when it came up within the Living with the Land.

843
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,960
So I don't but I think you got some support in Jason, seemingly.

844
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,040
I'm not sure.

845
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,560
I think it's two and two.

846
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,840
Yeah, I think that's the reason.

847
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,680
Are you going to get ready?

848
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,880
One of your famous catchphrases about disagreeing with me.

849
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,680
Any different points that are counter to other points?

850
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,320
I, you know, I just you're not.

851
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,560
I think I just I just.

852
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,160
Wild up enough to yell at me today. Come on.

853
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,080
I I'm a little sleep.

854
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:31,320
I've been drinking strong black tea to try and get angry or get myself up a little.

855
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,080
Get angry. Counterpoint here.

856
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:38,640
No, I just think it continues the tradition of inserting characters

857
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,640
into Epcot in a way that is kind of cheap, like the seas

858
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,200
with Nemo and friends like that little Lion King environmental movie.

859
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,040
Oh, but that's a movie.

860
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,400
That's like a let's have the TV studio crank out a thing.

861
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,160
I think this is a more successful grander thing.

862
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,600
But that was the first that was the first.

863
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,600
Yeah, it was more successful than that, but that was the very first like, all right.

864
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:09,400
Let's get the movie characters into and like that's cited as the first.

865
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,720
So I think I it doesn't.

866
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:19,840
I think a lot of stuff in this ride doesn't make sense with their own concept.

867
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,480
Of the storyline of the ride doesn't make sense of like it's it.

868
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,680
Hey, everyone, it's a festival celebrating the anniversary of like

869
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,960
the events of the movie summer festival.

870
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,560
And when we say, yes, it's a summer festival that takes place

871
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,960
at the dark of night, three o'clock in the morning.

872
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,000
It's pitch black out.

873
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,160
When we say festival, there's no one celebrate.

874
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,240
There's two princesses.

875
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:51,960
There's a hunky dumb guy and there's this nasty little creep snowman hanging out.

876
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,920
And that's kind of it.

877
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,040
There's not really any villagers around

878
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,960
and they just kind of stand around.

879
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,000
There's something called Snogies.

880
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,400
I don't want to. I don't know.

881
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,840
I don't know how to touch that one.

882
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:08,040
That sounds weird to me.

883
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,000
It's just strange.

884
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,680
It's very much you can tell it's just crammed into the track of Maelstrom.

885
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,120
It's very short.

886
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,200
And it's just like we're just trying to shove the movie.

887
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,920
I feel short to me. I don't think it's a little bit. Yeah.

888
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,360
And that would be then you could just say then Maelstrom's even shorter,

889
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,720
if that's the argument.

890
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,800
Yes. And five minutes saying if you think it's short and it's five minutes,

891
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,880
which I think is a decent amount of time for a dark ride,

892
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,520
I think that speaks to how nicely it moves through.

893
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,360
But frankly.

894
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,600
OK, the one thing this ride does not do is move nicely.

895
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,320
I think that's that's pretty proven.

896
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,440
I have never not hurt my back at the switch track.

897
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,360
So, I mean, I'm just going to start there.

898
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,840
That is not a comfortable ride.

899
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,360
This is that's isn't that a Maelstrom problem, too?

900
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,960
Although you're so you I think you do have to pin that one on the bones

901
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,120
that are there.

902
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,680
Because if you're taking the time and the money to redo a ride

903
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,080
and if you don't fix that, that's on you.

904
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,120
That's interesting. That came up last year as well.

905
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,680
And I had never really found that it's obviously very jerky.

906
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,600
It's not like you can tell it's not a new system they installed.

907
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,800
Oh, my God. But it never I mean, like,

908
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,800
I get much more rattle on Space Mountain in Florida

909
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,360
than I do on that boat for whatever reason.

910
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,080
So I had actually never noticed.

911
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,000
It's like a bumper car.

912
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,360
You're like hitting a wall and then moving and then backing up.

913
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,520
And it's like, oh, like it's just never stop.

914
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,480
It's so uncomfortable.

915
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,120
It's interesting.

916
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,080
I mean, that's one of those like accidental thrills

917
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,520
that happen on older rides like Space Mountain.

918
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:48,320
Florida is rattling you around like you're in the middle of an earthquake.

919
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:53,120
And like pirates now have bumpers on each side of the boats in at least here.

920
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:57,120
I can't remember in Florida, like where you just smash into other boats,

921
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,800
which is not part of the ride, but now has become a part of the ride

922
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,840
where you're having bumper cars now on the way.

923
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,120
So these are like accidental thrills.

924
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,160
I guess that is that a good way?

925
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,240
Is there a better way we can phrase?

926
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,840
Thrills is a little strong.

927
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,960
I don't know if I'm thrilled, which I think is I think that's so optimistic

928
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:21,320
because for me, I'm like, this is where in 10 years I will injure myself. Huh?

929
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:27,880
Yeah, like surprise, surprise bump, surprise, accidental trauma.

930
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,680
I don't know. We'll have to work on.

931
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,800
We'll have to workshop this.

932
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,440
Carly, let me get your philosophy.

933
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,560
Do you care that Epcot is moving away from its complicated

934
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,240
bizarreness to just being characters from?

935
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,840
OK, so I might be on a team of my own,

936
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:51,920
but I feel like for the thing I love to continue to exist, this must happen.

937
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,480
Yeah, because I love Epcot.

938
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,960
But like you can't run on this stuff

939
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,600
for this long when Disney is the company it is.

940
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,320
Like it's just inevitable.

941
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,760
And it breaks my heart every single time.

942
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,160
It's like everything, you know, is now changed and gone.

943
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,640
But I think it's necessary.

944
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,760
And I think that there are good ways of introducing IP.

945
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,720
And I think there are bad ways.

946
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:20,160
And with Frozen, I actually think that they deserved their own ride.

947
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,800
I don't think it should have been overlaid on this boat ride.

948
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,200
I think they should have built an entirely newly constructed attraction.

949
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:30,160
And I'm frankly shocked they did it because like it

950
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,640
there was so much time between the first and second movie anyway.

951
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,880
But I just think there should have been more for them.

952
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,000
And Epcot, a very pro IP.

953
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
OK, good. OK.

954
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,280
Yeah, I think we probably all agree.

955
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,760
Our preference would have been different, like fresh new ride.

956
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,360
Not a real. Yeah.

957
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:52,040
And I do. I will say, though I like Frozen after a lot.

958
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,800
I think it is strange the idea that they would clone this.

959
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:00,680
Because the plan, I think this is going into kind of everywhere.

960
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,560
Hong Kong, not Hong Kong.

961
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,640
So Hong Kong, if they have two attractions, it is.

962
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,280
I can't remember, but they have a Matterhorn style bobsled coaster.

963
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,200
Oh, gee. Yeah.

964
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,360
And I saw a model of it when I was on

965
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,440
an Adventures by Disney trip as like a regular citizen.

966
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,960
I was reporting on it, but it was in a group of regular people.

967
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,320
And so they showed us this model because people on vacation wouldn't be like

968
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,880
trying to memorize every detail.

969
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,160
And it's like a full blown mountain coaster. It looks incredible.

970
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,920
And so like we we could have in some world had that,

971
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,080
which would have been amazing.

972
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,800
Yeah. Yeah. Does does sound better.

973
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:41,840
Definitely sounds better.

974
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:45,360
I would say. So where is getting a Paris, Tokyo, I believe,

975
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,960
which I feel like, yeah.

976
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,040
Well, now that you've done the one with the blueprint of the old attraction,

977
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,920
now you got some time to actually get it right.

978
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,720
I though I like what they did here.

979
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,720
I would not say do Frozen Ever After again.

980
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:04,520
Yeah. People can will be able to get their backs destroyed

981
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,360
by the bobsled Esk-Matterhorn track, as opposed to the

982
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,920
aging Frozen Ever After.

983
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,640
Did you feel the back thing, too?

984
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,760
Or are you applying that? No, Carly has said it.

985
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,560
Were you on that ride last year and like, oh, my back.

986
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,080
The matter of the frozen.

987
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,840
Did Frozen hurt your back?

988
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,240
I don't I don't remember.

989
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,360
I do remember the switch feeling rougher than it used to,

990
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:39,120
which might have been because the it feels like they walled off.

991
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,120
I believe they did. They wall off.

992
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,840
Am I misremembering this?

993
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:46,960
Because you used to be able to see the boat from outside of Maelstrom.

994
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,360
That's correct. Yeah, it is fully indoors now.

995
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,320
Yeah, it's fully indoors.

996
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:55,440
So that was likely maybe some adjustments there to shorten

997
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,120
the backing up and the switching.

998
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,160
I remember that part being very jarring.

999
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:05,240
OK, Matterhorn is on that list, too, of accidental trauma or surprise trauma.

1000
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,760
Yeah, I mean, that one hurts me, but at least it's worth it.

1001
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,320
Like, you know, you're like on a thrill ride.

1002
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,400
It fits the theme.

1003
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:17,240
This is like I'm pulling up to a poorly contoured princess singing to me.

1004
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,600
Like, I shouldn't be in pain right now.

1005
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,560
Hmm. I feel like you were already upset and then just that was like

1006
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,880
insult to injury on the switch. Yes.

1007
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,120
That's sort of what it's more about.

1008
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,760
Because I've been wrecked on the Matterhorn,

1009
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,400
depending on what seat and which track.

1010
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,880
One track is rougher than the other, and I forget which one is.

1011
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,240
You know what's a rough one also?

1012
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,000
I don't know if you talked about the very end of the Incredicoaster.

1013
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,840
That like when you skid into the station.

1014
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,600
I'm not sure why that's so.

1015
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,760
I would say that it hurts me, but every time I'm like, I really have to brace for it.

1016
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,240
Like that's like more of a thing now to brace for than anything that happens.

1017
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,240
I can't believe college age people are going to listen to this and be like,

1018
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,480
how old are these old people?

1019
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,960
There's no college age people listening. Don't worry.

1020
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,600
The well, the worst I got when we were in Florida

1021
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,640
was I went on test track and they started to

1022
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,400
move the car about like three feet forward.

1023
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,080
And they realized someone's seatbelt wasn't done all the way.

1024
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,600
And they slammed the brake.

1025
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:30,240
And I just got like, it felt like I hit a wall.

1026
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,480
And I was still like a whole ride going like, oh, my God. Yeah.

1027
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,760
We weren't going to start going full speed.

1028
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,440
Why did they stop that? So then again.

1029
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,600
And then that ride has not gotten smoother with time.

1030
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,840
That does fit the theme.

1031
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,280
That does fit the theme. Yeah.

1032
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,400
But it was startling to break that,

1033
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,440
break that hard in the span of like five.

1034
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,960
Yeah, it's we have some we have some upkeep concerns. Yes.

1035
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,280
But yeah, I think it is.

1036
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,240
How do you feel going into this?

1037
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,040
How do you were you like, were you were was your was your mind?

1038
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:10,120
Were you open to frozen before going on at the first time?

1039
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,280
Well, I think that the best place to start is at the queue

1040
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,600
because I'm actually a huge fan of the queue.

1041
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,000
I think they did a fantastic job.

1042
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:22,040
I think that they made a very pleasant indoor space.

1043
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:26,720
And unlike some other queues, it doesn't feel long.

1044
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,760
Like they constructed it with the switchbacks

1045
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:32,160
so you don't feel like you're waiting as long as you actually are,

1046
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,400
which I'm a fan of.

1047
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,880
I love the wandering oak and sauna part.

1048
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,400
I think that's adorable.

1049
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,680
I think they they killed it in that respect.

1050
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,840
It's a line that I would maybe not hate to wait in.

1051
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,360
Hmm. Yeah, I like that, especially I don't know what you call it.

1052
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,600
That is, did you the big area right before you get on the ride

1053
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,320
where it's like is that the switch where there's like eight different rows

1054
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,800
and you keep going back in and out, then you go in the little cabin. Yeah.

1055
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,640
Then I was going to meeting the meeting point.

1056
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,200
I should I should really know this.

1057
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,280
I apologize to any meeting point fans out there.

1058
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:09,280
Or any of us into frozen or any of us particular fans of the franchise?

1059
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,920
Yeah, really.

1060
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,280
I think I saw it around when it came out.

1061
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,000
Maybe like these go to movies like the last screening

1062
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,800
at the Arclight on Black Friday's.

1063
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,720
And I think that was that year is like Thanksgiving release.

1064
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:28,120
And I saw it and thought about it for like a week

1065
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,240
and then didn't really think about it again for a while.

1066
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:36,400
It certainly became ubiquitous very quickly, but it was it was kind of

1067
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:41,640
like I said in the previous episode, like Finding Nemo, like, OK, yeah.

1068
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,280
Got it. Yeah.

1069
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,080
The Nemo much more visually beautiful.

1070
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,680
Yeah, I mean, I saw Frozen.

1071
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,640
I liked it fine, which is why I think I really like when I got off this ride.

1072
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,040
I was like, oh, that was really good. I really, really like that.

1073
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:59,240
Why I felt like it was really because I had no strong affection for the actual movie.

1074
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,760
It felt like so it felt like earned to you

1075
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,960
because it wasn't just inherently I'm going to see these characters

1076
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:10,080
and then I'm going to feel something like it was the ride doing it.

1077
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,160
The ride did it. Yes, exactly.

1078
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,600
Because like Little Mermaid, I think we talked about this on the last episode.

1079
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:18,240
Little Mermaid, which I think we have all have some problems with this movie.

1080
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,080
I like a lot better.

1081
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,480
I like the songs better, obviously, and it's also been with me

1082
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,000
for like 30 years or so.

1083
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,800
And I don't know, I don't necessarily need to go on that ride a lot.

1084
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,440
But I love if I was I would go at go on this ride like every time.

1085
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,680
I would tell anybody you got to go on this and I would not say like,

1086
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,520
oh, my God, you miss Little Mermaid. Oh.

1087
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:40,040
Like a big I would not be upset for them missing Little Mermaid, right?

1088
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,520
I'd agree with that.

1089
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:46,080
Though Mermaid, we didn't mention, I think just uses the clamshells

1090
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,960
from the Nemo and friends, just the same rights really.

1091
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,400
Is it just the same clamshell vehicle?

1092
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,440
So if you got a clam shape for now, any mover might as well.

1093
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:01,720
You know, I were we're going orderly here and I don't want to jump a rep,

1094
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,680
but just on the topic of like the ride or and this might tell you

1095
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,480
this might tell you where I'm at with the whole thing.

1096
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,840
Yeah, I don't know whatever characters Jason mentioned.

1097
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:13,680
I don't know what they are. The the the the spoogees.

1098
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,920
I don't know what I don't know what you said.

1099
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,040
That was not what he said.

1100
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,440
I don't think it was the spoogees, but I don't know who anybody

1101
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,880
I'm passing by characters on this like whatever.

1102
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,840
Who would like tell me the story again?

1103
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,240
I don't know who those are.

1104
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,800
I literally have not seen frozen at all.

1105
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,240
So let me have not seen.

1106
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,480
I don't know anything about it.

1107
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:36,560
So there's nothing inherently in the IP going for me.

1108
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,400
Then and I'm enjoying the ride.

1109
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:44,440
And then you get to Elsa and you do the first of the switchbacks.

1110
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:49,320
You're going forward and then you kind of rotate while watching her.

1111
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:52,440
And then right at the chorus of Let It Go, you're released backwards.

1112
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,520
The backwards drop that is retained from the maelstrom.

1113
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,160
Guys, I teared up.

1114
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,280
I teared up at this point in the ride.

1115
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,200
I think it is so beautiful soaring backwards

1116
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,720
while these like while like magic dust flies over your head, it's beautiful

1117
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,800
screens that I don't I've never even thought to myself I like the song.

1118
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,560
I've probably been annoyed by the song.

1119
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:20,480
And yet just in this context, I think this is a triumph of a room.

1120
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,120
I think it's a fantastic sequence in a right.

1121
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,640
Thank you, Mike. Yes, I could not agree more.

1122
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,760
I that's I like do you want to build a snowman?

1123
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,920
That might not even be the name of it.

1124
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,600
I like that. I like in the first time forever.

1125
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,160
Froze Let It Go.

1126
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,040
I get the people like it and I like hearing people sing it if they're excited

1127
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,080
about it, but that's why I was always like, that's kind of like

1128
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:43,600
boring, very easy chord progression, not nothing that happens.

1129
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,560
And I go, this is a magical this is a magical moment.

1130
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,800
I totally agree.

1131
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,280
Yeah, I I was really swept up in it.

1132
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,680
Can you guys not relate to this in any regard?

1133
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,800
Do you feel nothing at that sequence of the ride?

1134
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,360
They're they're silence, they're stunned.

1135
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,720
Yeah, I know they're glaring at us, Mike.

1136
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,880
They're mad. They're upset.

1137
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:10,080
He is like getting pushed backwards in a closed best

1138
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,840
by where all the TVs are on the sampling.

1139
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,480
What are you talking about?

1140
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,240
This is the same food as you grinch.

1141
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,440
You grouch. It's just screens.

1142
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,080
It's just screens with like just no.

1143
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:27,080
Like it's all it's just screens with this like snowflake

1144
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:30,960
and half of them have the walls are not decorated.

1145
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,520
You like things with screens and you wouldn't you wouldn't say

1146
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,480
just screens about rise the resistance.

1147
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,360
You wouldn't say just screens about guardians.

1148
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,840
That's the basis are these.

1149
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,080
That's not what we're talking about.

1150
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:40,920
We're not talking about that.

1151
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,400
We'll deal with the faces later.

1152
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,320
We're talking about the backwards drop room,

1153
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:49,280
which you've compared to a Black Friday trip to Best Buy.

1154
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,960
No, I said it closed like it's closed like the lights

1155
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,760
are mostly off of the Best Buy,

1156
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,520
but the TVs are on their sampling loop.

1157
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:02,000
So you can see the circa 2015 2016 Jason.

1158
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,080
We were all there together in October.

1159
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,960
I don't remember any of this energy.

1160
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,760
I feel like you I mean, I don't know that you were jumping

1161
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,880
for joy, but I don't recall you being like her room.

1162
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,160
This right is a I think I.

1163
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,800
I think I wrote it and then I went and ate dinner.

1164
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,840
I don't think I thought about it a lot like right after it.

1165
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,560
Like you sit with this stuff for a little while

1166
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,920
and like I watched the ride throughs a couple of times.

1167
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:28,760
Carly, what are you?

1168
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:29,600
What is your opinion?

1169
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:33,840
I mean, I said before I came on this episode

1170
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:39,320
that I didn't want it to turn into a me versus Scott situation.

1171
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,040
I know we're back there again.

1172
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,440
How it's reversed now.

1173
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,400
The dynamic is reversed.

1174
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,680
Well, which is I'm wondering if the audience will be on my side

1175
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,120
or will they just inherently not be on my side because of me somehow?

1176
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:58,240
I would go as far as to say that there are there are some portions

1177
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,000
of the ride that I think are fabulous.

1178
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,600
I think they rendered Olaf so well.

1179
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:05,880
They couldn't have done a better job like Olaf looks so real.

1180
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:09,640
I think that the opening and closing scene of the attraction is very nice.

1181
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:13,520
But the exact scene you're describing, I would say,

1182
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:18,040
is the worst scene of any Disney ride in existence.

1183
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,360
No, what are you talking about?

1184
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,440
I have said this before.

1185
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,800
I have never yelled this.

1186
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,480
That is impossible.

1187
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:30,240
That is the worst sequence in Disney ride history ever.

1188
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:30,960
Yes. Let me explain.

1189
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,560
What do you mean?

1190
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,720
Have you been on Armageddon in Paris?

1191
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:35,440
I have been.

1192
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,160
I would rather be on Armageddon than in that one scene.

1193
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,640
What do you mean?

1194
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,960
A scene that I tear.

1195
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,480
Boy, we just view the world differently.

1196
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:50,920
Apparently, the problem is, is not once you no longer see Elsa,

1197
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,440
then just shit is over.

1198
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:58,840
You can see the the lack of budget around you.

1199
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:03,440
And like even if you painted cardboard, I'd be happy, truly.

1200
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:08,520
But once you're passing through that scene, it is like it is nothingness.

1201
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,320
And then there's like a bloop of fog.

1202
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,440
And then there is a black hallway and a black hallway.

1203
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,560
This came up. We discussed this.

1204
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,840
It is literally no theming.

1205
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,520
There's no there's no there's no theming.

1206
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,760
It's not like it's themed poorly.

1207
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,240
There is no theming.

1208
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,840
They didn't even put anything there.

1209
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,600
They didn't put a snowflake.

1210
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,880
They didn't put a little icicle. There's nothing.

1211
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:33,040
And so it is so egregious to me to be like, here is the most advanced

1212
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,960
at the time on you animatronic we've ever made.

1213
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:39,520
As you pull away to nothingness.

1214
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,440
Now, you yeah, you mentioned this in the Living of the Land episode.

1215
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:48,480
I was not I didn't even clock that there was this unthemed room.

1216
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,160
Now I watch the the the writers and I can't unsee it.

1217
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,560
And yeah, you're in black first.

1218
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,800
But I swear to God, you're in there for three seconds.

1219
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:56,880
I'm not excusing it.

1220
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:02,320
But also I honestly was wrapped up in the emotion of what came before enough

1221
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,440
that it did not occur to me.

1222
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:09,640
It just I did not even register this room, which I guess just indicates

1223
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:12,360
that it didn't sweep you up the same way.

1224
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:13,880
I think it's like a cave.

1225
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,840
It's like pirates on the way down.

1226
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,560
You're in some sort of a cave. It's spooky.

1227
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:18,880
There's messed.

1228
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,880
It doesn't need to have like something there.

1229
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,800
That's my feeling about it.

1230
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:26,200
I don't think it is the only undressed.

1231
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:31,200
It's not the only like room of blackness like Indiana Jones has,

1232
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:35,960
you know, and that's not to say that, you know, like they should probably fill in

1233
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,080
the Indiana Jones blacknesses.

1234
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:41,520
So Indiana Jones has like the dull light bulb problem

1235
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,920
that a lot of movie theaters do, too.

1236
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:46,000
Some of those projection things would be served by switching out

1237
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,240
the bulbs a little more in Indiana Jones.

1238
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:53,440
But I just this doesn't I'm just now I'm just trying to think of counter examples.

1239
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,760
There's not one part of Ellen's energy adventure

1240
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,920
that is worse to you than the backwards drop on on frozen ever after.

1241
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:06,760
I just to me, like when you really look at it, it's like this is a proof

1242
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,000
like this is a proven franchise.

1243
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,440
This is a movie that everyone who's like the target age of children

1244
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,680
and families when it came out, like this is the Disney audience.

1245
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,800
This is who they need to sell this ride to.

1246
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:22,440
And the fact that there is a scene where there is nothing like

1247
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:25,760
notably nothing to me infuriates me.

1248
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,120
I can't even enjoy it.

1249
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:31,480
It just upsets me so much that there's just nothing.

1250
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,400
There's there's just nothing.

1251
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,200
But it erases what comes before it erases.

1252
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:40,320
If we're taking just the drop, like like let's let's let's just

1253
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,800
and maybe you can't because it's one big sequence.

1254
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,640
But like the drop is no avoid to you

1255
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:50,120
because there's darkness for four or five seconds.

1256
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,560
OK, I think I will add this.

1257
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:55,040
I realized in thinking about this ride today, I think

1258
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:59,280
I don't like to go backwards on a non coaster.

1259
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,960
OK, I think that's part of it is that like you

1260
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,200
you want your eyes to be leading you.

1261
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:09,480
And when you move backwards, it's not the same experience

1262
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,760
and you can't take it in the same way.

1263
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,880
Mm hmm.

1264
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,600
I mean, yeah, I mean, yeah, if you have an issue with with just backwards

1265
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:22,080
moments, then yeah, this isn't going to score for you.

1266
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:23,600
I think it's cool.

1267
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,440
I hear what you're saying.

1268
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,840
And once you're past, once you can't see the Elsa animatronic,

1269
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,280
then you're kind of looking at screens playing animation.

1270
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,080
But I really like just the way she like trails up

1271
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,600
into the background for a while.

1272
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:40,560
I like having like I can't picture a sequence like that where you are

1273
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,040
focused on something and it gets smaller and smaller.

1274
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,560
And I feel like most drop rides, there isn't really a thing to focus on.

1275
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,840
I think that's just an interesting POV and perspective,

1276
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:54,200
like kind of a cool like camera angle.

1277
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,560
It's like a big like, you know, jib out or something.

1278
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:59,400
I mean, I'll clarify that part.

1279
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:00,320
I think is fine.

1280
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:03,240
It's the second she's gone game over.

1281
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,680
Sure. OK, OK.

1282
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,240
I still I feel like I got to get you on.

1283
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:13,240
What is the there's got to be a worse sequence in a in a traction.

1284
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:16,360
Nemo subs like this is a very big fan.

1285
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,800
The whole thing is like sort of boring to me.

1286
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,760
You have to say something on that is worse than this.

1287
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,960
I mean, I'm just, you know, choking on my fear when I'm on that,

1288
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,440
because I'm like, what is the fire escape situation?

1289
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:33,040
Oh, sure. It's just like the reason I say that it's the worst

1290
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,720
is because it's a new build.

1291
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,240
Like they did this a few years ago.

1292
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:42,280
Just a few years ago, like they could have done anything. Sure.

1293
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:47,720
Yeah, this is the same line of logic as Fast and the Furious Supercharge.

1294
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:51,600
I'm not saying these equivalents, I'm saying these are their big

1295
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,920
both respective studios, biggest, biggest properties.

1296
01:06:55,240 --> 01:07:00,880
And they both just like slam their foot in a door like on the guest is not.

1297
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,360
That's not to the same extent.

1298
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:06,040
But it's like this ride is very popular.

1299
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,880
And that's that right.

1300
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:10,160
Yeah, Fast and Furious is very disliked.

1301
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,800
Frozen Ever After is not.

1302
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,320
I think that's like just pure numbers wise.

1303
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:19,000
And that's not we can't we won't always point to that as something being successful.

1304
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,920
But like, do you do you guys feel general guest

1305
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,160
dissatisfaction with this attraction, or do you think that it's your guys

1306
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,400
in particular taste?

1307
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,680
I think it's just me in particular.

1308
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,920
It's from what I understand, people really enjoy it.

1309
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,600
I went on it with my friends' kids and I feel like the older one was like,

1310
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:41,680
their faces are weird, but that like otherwise they really enjoyed it.

1311
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:46,000
And I will go on it mostly just to try to understand

1312
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,840
because I have like I've been arguing about this ride with my friend

1313
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:53,880
Todd Martens, who reports on Disney for the LA Times.

1314
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,320
He loves Frozen. He loves this ride.

1315
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:59,520
We have gotten into very public fights about this attraction.

1316
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:04,360
And I go on it specifically to text him and be like, I'm trying.

1317
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,840
Like, I am trying to understand.

1318
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,680
And I think parts of it are great.

1319
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:14,800
But I can't lose my critical eye, I suppose, when I'm on this one,

1320
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,200
because just the that hallway is so egregious to me.

1321
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:23,240
It feels like an elementary school when people would like put on a haunted house.

1322
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,600
Like, that's what that is to me.

1323
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,200
And I can't I can't get over it.

1324
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:31,720
No beautiful Olaf audio animatronic can outdo that for me.

1325
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:35,440
When you when you brought this, because I was recalling this black room

1326
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:39,800
discussion, this had come up and I was I think I had the the the inverse of this.

1327
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:43,160
I was watching right there and I was trying to dislike it.

1328
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:47,040
I was like, OK, will I be as mad as Carly about this room?

1329
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:50,440
And I swear I'm watching the right there is and like, yeah, but you're out of there.

1330
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:51,080
You're out of there.

1331
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:54,000
And like what I mean, I have to time it out.

1332
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,120
I don't want to like exaggerate that it's four seconds.

1333
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:01,160
But in my head is for it is no more than eight seconds, I believe.

1334
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,440
Maybe we can do the actual count.

1335
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,720
But is this so crazy?

1336
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:09,640
It takes you eight seconds to go and get like a Kleenex to wipe the tears away.

1337
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,960
For God's sake. You know, I didn't notice it either.

1338
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,120
I'm coming down.

1339
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:16,200
I'm coming down from the emotion of the drop.

1340
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:20,880
Only this only this in Sinbad in Tokyo

1341
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,960
in my adult years have made me a little emotional. Wow.

1342
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,120
The emotional boat rides.

1343
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:31,360
You're 30 full ass crying at this ride when you don't even know the movie.

1344
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,840
Like, what is it? What is it about it?

1345
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:37,640
I well, I think it is how well they they pulled up.

1346
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,000
You know, I get

1347
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,320
I think it's the theme park love coming through.

1348
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:48,640
And I think I will I think I will tear up at amazing work by Imagineers,

1349
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,240
which I believe that this is I think when there is like I think when

1350
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,080
when technology comes together,

1351
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:59,440
I think, you know, what else is another aspect of it is that I, as I said,

1352
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,120
love Maelstrom, really love Maelstrom.

1353
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:04,520
I would have been mad if I didn't like what replaced the Maelstrom.

1354
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:08,120
And I feel like they used the bones of a great ride and they did.

1355
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:11,160
They they plus it up and did something really wonderful with it.

1356
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:15,720
I feel like, am I passionate about the trolls and into the bog?

1357
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:16,880
Of course I am.

1358
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,560
But I think I'm also passionate about the type of ride.

1359
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:21,240
I think it is a really inventive.

1360
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:24,600
Into the bog. What's that?

1361
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,920
Over the falls, not into the bog.

1362
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:30,080
I thought they say into the bog.

1363
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,040
Into the bog? What is it, Mike?

1364
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,400
It's a good question.

1365
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,600
I thought it was back back over the falls.

1366
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,320
Yeah, well, I guess how passionate I get it wrong.

1367
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,760
I but I, you know, yeah, look, I love the trolls, whatever they're saying.

1368
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,960
I love but what was I saying?

1369
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:52,920
Oh, I just think that I like that it's a ride that still has the things

1370
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,040
that I like about the Maelstrom.

1371
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:57,120
I think that the switchbacks are really innovative.

1372
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,120
I think it's it's very unexpected.

1373
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:04,280
I love like rotating around a figure, whether it's a three headed troll or Elsa.

1374
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,240
I think it's really innovative and neat that they did.

1375
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:12,000
They took a drop, which should be scary, but they made it

1376
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,920
this emotional.

1377
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:18,440
I don't know what other word to use.

1378
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:21,560
Yeah. Uplifting despite going down.

1379
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,280
What's that? Triumphant.

1380
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,600
Yeah, yeah.

1381
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:29,280
Similar to Guardians becoming a fun laughing ride

1382
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,000
from what was a scary drop ride.

1383
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,680
I think it's a similar like cool

1384
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:39,360
imaginary feat to like give this a different mood that this type of ride

1385
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,160
shouldn't have.

1386
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,040
I agree with that.

1387
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,120
Yeah, I see where you're coming from.

1388
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,560
And I do like parts of the ride.

1389
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:48,840
I don't want anyone to think that because if they catch me on this,

1390
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,320
I don't want them to think they're like, I hate it.

1391
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,920
But I think that there are certain portions that I think are fabulous,

1392
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:58,160
certain portions that I think are a sad excuse for a theme park ride.

1393
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,960
And then some areas live in the middle. Right.

1394
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:05,560
You want if we want to flip to since I was just passionately monologuing

1395
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:09,880
about what I what I like about that sequence, I'll give everybody this.

1396
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:12,040
The the the figures are odd.

1397
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:16,000
I think there might be some general agreement that the the way

1398
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,720
the animatronics faces look is a little strange.

1399
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:23,760
It wasn't enough of a strike for me, but I I don't disagree with that point.

1400
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,120
They have Buzz Lightyear Astro Blaster face.

1401
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:27,840
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

1402
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,360
I'd like faces and it.

1403
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,200
Yeah, it's correct me if I'm wrong, but these are these were the first

1404
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,560
fully electronic animatronics.

1405
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:39,720
And the other thing to note is the facial the face projections

1406
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,800
are coming from inside the head.

1407
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,640
I think that is right.

1408
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:48,400
And as opposed to, let's say, the the bell from Beauty and the Beast,

1409
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:52,880
the new Beauty and the Beast attraction in Disney, see, which is all just

1410
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,840
like practical, right? Yeah.

1411
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,920
This is the same sort of

1412
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,320
face projection that's in Seven Dwarfs monitoring. Yeah, right, right.

1413
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:07,280
And another a ride, I think I like more, but I'm like,

1414
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:10,960
oh, I'm not waiting that you like Seven Dwarfs like more than this.

1415
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,040
I think so, because it's a roller coaster.

1416
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,160
I like that right.

1417
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,280
I don't know. I sort of lacking in my mind.

1418
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:25,080
I find the animatronics in both unnerving this sort of face projection.

1419
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:31,080
That's true. I find it both kind of this generation of animatronic.

1420
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:34,400
I think they were trying this out and it does it is obviously now

1421
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,480
if we're seeing what they're doing in Tokyo and I guess on Rise of the Resistance,

1422
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:40,760
like I think they're backing away fully from just fully

1423
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:44,400
digital face because it's a little odd.

1424
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,360
And it also like doesn't seem to match the color of their skin.

1425
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,800
It does look like they all have.

1426
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,120
I'm trying to think of five o'clock shadow, like everybody's got like a weird.

1427
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:56,400
They're very light and then very dark around the side.

1428
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,720
Like they all have Lincoln Beards, like light Lincoln Beards.

1429
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,320
And then back to a bright neck. Yes.

1430
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:08,440
So that's really yeah, that's the only major thing I would complain about,

1431
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,800
I think, is that those faces are odd.

1432
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:14,880
And depending on how you look at them, you feel like maybe the robot

1433
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,960
is going to come to life and kill you or.

1434
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:22,000
There is a very funny video online of an Elsa.

1435
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,280
I have it, I have it, I have it.

1436
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:25,200
You want to see it?

1437
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,240
I haven't seen it yet.

1438
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,880
Yeah. OK, hold on.

1439
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,320
Is this the one where the people are like laughing and screaming?

1440
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:34,320
Sure. Here, I'll show you if this is what you're talking about.

1441
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,600
The ring girl come out of her face.

1442
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:46,960
So she is just like waving her hand a little bit and no music's playing.

1443
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:48,480
She's doing the Trump hand.

1444
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,720
She's doing the Trump animatronic hands.

1445
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:52,800
The accordion.

1446
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,960
The song does not like play triumphantly.

1447
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,240
Yeah, the screens aren't really going, are they?

1448
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,360
What happened here?

1449
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,280
Something happened.

1450
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:07,080
We'll post the will retweet that and you can see it.

1451
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:10,560
Yes. So maybe I haven't been in a theme park in a very long time

1452
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,760
because I watched that and was like, this is a bit.

1453
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:19,080
Oh, we would be thrilled to get like lazy Elsa on a ride at that point.

1454
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,240
You'd be like, oh, my God, it's like a walk off at that point.

1455
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,280
Yeah. To get like a like a lazy Elsa.

1456
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:27,160
You can turn off half their animatronics when we come back.

1457
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,120
I won't care.

1458
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,720
I whatever whatever you got to do.

1459
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:33,600
Honestly, more plants wearing sombreros like brought me so much joy.

1460
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,520
I'll take it anywhere.

1461
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,680
Oh, yeah, this is so we haven't talked about this on the show.

1462
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:42,760
How on the three caballeros boat ride that Donald broke

1463
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:48,200
and now there seems to be an in memoriam for you know that it's the three caballeros.

1464
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,720
So there's no way around it.

1465
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:52,600
You do you like there's three, we know the count.

1466
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:57,360
And then when only two characters show up next to a wait,

1467
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,360
it is a cactus with a sombrero.

1468
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:04,640
It was I believe it was first a plant and then it was a plant with a sombrero.

1469
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:08,640
And I wouldn't even call it like it was like a wooden stake with vines.

1470
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,240
So like not even a full blown plant.

1471
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,680
And then it was gone.

1472
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:17,080
And I have to assume it was gone because they just got their asses

1473
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:20,360
handed to them for putting sombrero on leaves, which like

1474
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,440
how could you not?

1475
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:26,200
They fired like 90 percent of the imagineers at this point.

1476
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,600
So like the one imagineer that's still around was like, I don't know,

1477
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,440
just put some bro on a cat.

1478
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,000
I don't know. What are we going to do?

1479
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,160
We don't have any budget.

1480
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,680
They fired everyone else.

1481
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:40,040
We we got a we got a fern backstage and we got a bunch of scrap metal

1482
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:43,560
for the the water show model.

1483
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:48,000
Well, it's either a piece of scrap metal or it just to me seemed

1484
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,280
like a black bag situation, like Donald's not working.

1485
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,680
You can't pretend he wasn't here because of the name.

1486
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:57,280
Just toss a black bag over it and we'll all just move on.

1487
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:02,200
And instead, they were like, let's get creative and like erected

1488
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,480
some non plant.

1489
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:06,280
And then we're like, no one will know this.

1490
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:09,160
Let's put a sombrero on it.

1491
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,440
It's actually kind of cute.

1492
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,640
You know what? Maybe it's better than what was there.

1493
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,920
What do we know? Like today, what is it right now?

1494
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,600
Now there's nothing as far as I got rid of it.

1495
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:21,560
Yeah. Got it.

1496
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:24,560
That's very your Donald's voice doing nothing.

1497
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,440
Like his ghostly voice.

1498
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:30,800
Sure, they should have like badly dubbed

1499
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,840
somebody's voice over being like, OK, I can't do we can't wait.

1500
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:35,960
We can't do Donald's voice.

1501
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,600
We've tried a million times on the show.

1502
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,960
So I don't know if I should even try again, but it should be like a guy

1503
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:42,080
going, oh, I was turned into a cactus.

1504
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,640
Like there could be a little bit of explanation.

1505
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,720
Like somebody's wish turned me into a cactus.

1506
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:51,440
Oh, that was another you've done the subtitle.

1507
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,560
How do you say now?

1508
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,400
Now say I was turned into a cactus.

1509
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:01,800
Sounds like you're dying.

1510
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,640
You got it. You guys want to try?

1511
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:04,840
No, I was turned into a cactus.

1512
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,840
Currently.

1513
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:11,960
Uh, what's the opposite of viral when people just attack you?

1514
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:15,480
Because that's what I am on TikTok right now, because I said that

1515
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:17,760
Donald Duck was mean.

1516
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:18,800
So I that's right.

1517
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,200
Oh, you're in the middle of the thing.

1518
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,600
I sort of caught this.

1519
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:26,080
What happened? I can't even open TikTok because my entire feed

1520
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:29,440
is teenagers screaming at me for a full week now.

1521
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,680
We are having a real living with the land situation.

1522
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:33,880
Yes, I am.

1523
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:35,840
And I didn't even get any cereal out of it.

1524
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:37,920
Is this you?

1525
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,920
You were like you were.

1526
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:43,520
I don't remember what I don't know.

1527
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,120
I don't know if I even know what you said, but you were like your joke.

1528
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:48,720
It was one of those situations where people don't

1529
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,680
comprehend jokes on social media.

1530
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:53,520
Sometimes they just view things as factual or not.

1531
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:56,600
So like also, they're just mad at your statement.

1532
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:57,560
He is mean.

1533
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:02,880
And then so the first wave of I did like I was I didn't do anything over Christmas.

1534
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,720
I sat in my house. I did nothing.

1535
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,560
And I was like, I guess it's time for TikTok.

1536
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:10,520
I'm bored. And then made one that's like, what's your most unpopular opinion?

1537
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:12,720
Because it's my opinion that he's mean.

1538
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:15,840
And then I got a wave of people yelling at me that he's mean

1539
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:19,440
because he's like a war vet and because of PTSD.

1540
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,000
And then like, I don't support our troops.

1541
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:24,880
What? Yeah, that was the first wave of it.

1542
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:29,600
Then I happened to be friendly with the guy who voices

1543
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,160
Donald Duck in the newer cartoons.

1544
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:32,680
I met him at a party last year.

1545
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,640
And so he's big on TikTok.

1546
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,600
And he was like, I'm going to make one. Is it OK?

1547
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,280
And I'm like, do whatever you want.

1548
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,920
And so he made one like in good fun.

1549
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,800
And even in the comments was like, please don't bully her.

1550
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,520
And that didn't stop anyone.

1551
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:47,640
So it's his is like him crying and reaction.

1552
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:52,280
And then there's this other TikTok account called Donald Duck with two C's.

1553
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,200
And I feel very old because I don't know who this is.

1554
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:58,160
It is a Donald Duck stuffed animal that just screams.

1555
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:02,000
I don't know. He has like nine million followers or something.

1556
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,880
And he found it and he reposted it.

1557
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:09,960
And since then, it has just been hell, hell, hell.

1558
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:16,560
Look, Donald has PTSD and depression from dropping both Batman and Little Boy.

1559
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,920
OK, he pressed the button both times.

1560
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:23,160
He firebombed Dresden, you know, he's still he's doing his best.

1561
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:27,800
Using like the war cartoons as canon to prove that Donald Duck is

1562
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,560
Donald Duck was mean before he went to war.

1563
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:34,240
I don't know. I mean, I've been sweating since I said this one scene was bad,

1564
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:39,520
because now I'm like, if the teens find out, what are they going to do to me this time?

1565
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,760
Oh, my God.

1566
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,960
This is we got we brought up Donald.

1567
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,080
Without even realizing we're walking into it.

1568
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,200
But they didn't deny that Donald is mean.

1569
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:51,160
They're just justifying that his meanness is for a reason.

1570
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:55,000
They're like, they're they're mad.

1571
01:20:55,960 --> 01:21:00,680
Huh, did they think that he's a veteran because he always wears a sailor suit?

1572
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:04,360
Do they think he was in the Navy before he met Mickey?

1573
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,280
I don't know. I don't know much about him, except that he always feels like a very

1574
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:10,520
negative presence in the cartoon and he takes away from Goofy's time.

1575
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,360
So that's where I am.

1576
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:13,520
Yes. Boy, huh?

1577
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,800
Donald is mean and negative.

1578
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,720
You mean the point of Donald?

1579
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,880
You mean why Donald is funny?

1580
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:23,040
There were this is like Goofy's kind of dumb.

1581
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,800
Oh, how dare you?

1582
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,760
He wasn't he wasn't educated properly.

1583
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,960
He's like he's always frustrated.

1584
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:32,880
And that's why it's funny to watch them like mess with him.

1585
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:36,040
Like Mr. Duck steps out, which is my favorite Donald short.

1586
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:39,440
He's trying to hook up with Daisy and the nephews just keep screwing with him.

1587
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:42,160
And he gets furious and it's so funny.

1588
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,280
Like, that's his whole point.

1589
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:49,440
He does not he's not helpful when Mickey and Goofy are trying to get the ghost

1590
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,680
or rescue Mickey's trailer when it's wildly out of control.

1591
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:54,840
You know, he's not not the best.

1592
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,040
Is this the certain subsect of the Internet that it's like books

1593
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:01,520
should have a sticker on the front that tells you if there's a happy ending or not?

1594
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,600
Like, OK, I don't know.

1595
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,080
I don't understand the zoomer experience.

1596
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,160
I don't know.

1597
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:09,000
That's what that's like.

1598
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,800
That's like why a that sounds like a Tucker Carlson segment.

1599
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:14,320
That's a dark Carlson segment that you're already writing there.

1600
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:17,360
Oh, Ariel Pink's new manager.

1601
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:21,680
Yeah, I feel like I've praised Ariel Pink before on the show.

1602
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:25,600
Oh, no, I like the music before I knew he was a conservative maniac.

1603
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:28,240
I didn't know.

1604
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,320
We know he had made good keyboard sound.

1605
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:33,560
It was like retro sounding and lo fi.

1606
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:39,200
Do the kids do the teens have any like are we we on this podcast

1607
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:42,560
as far as Donald discourse, like we accidentally ended up

1608
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:46,720
talking about Donald Seat on one episode a few years ago.

1609
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:49,800
Do they are they do they know about us?

1610
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,360
Do the teens know about us?

1611
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:52,520
And what we say?

1612
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:57,120
I don't think that the seat discourse has made it to them.

1613
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:01,480
But if you made a tick tock about it, I think that the two would meld.

1614
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,480
Most likely. No, this is we should.

1615
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,320
Sure. No, no, no.

1616
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,160
I'm going to sign up a podcast, right?

1617
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:12,320
Tick tock. And we should probably start seat posting.

1618
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,840
Yeah. No. God.

1619
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,400
You know, this is perfect.

1620
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,560
Friend of the show.

1621
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,760
Regular guest Marissa Strickland sent me for Christmas

1622
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:26,000
a an iPhone case that has a big Donald seat on the bottom.

1623
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:27,760
Oh, let's take a look. Yeah.

1624
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,520
I you want me to go get it.

1625
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:30,800
It's in the other room.

1626
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,600
Yeah, go get it. Yeah.

1627
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,160
All right. Talk amongst yourselves.

1628
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:36,600
It is like you're so interesting.

1629
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:41,560
You've really cornered the market on something and it's but I guess I don't

1630
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,160
I mean, anytime I see Donald stuff, I'm like, that's a Donald seat.

1631
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,640
Like it's it's just stuck with me.

1632
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:48,880
I don't like this.

1633
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,320
If this is one of these.

1634
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,960
All right. Just like the vacation club points episode.

1635
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:57,160
This if there is this tick tock that happens and there is something called seat

1636
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:59,400
posting, this is Scott Free.

1637
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:01,720
This is a new brand within podcast.

1638
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,080
The ride. What was that?

1639
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:04,840
I said not shit posting.

1640
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:05,880
It's seat posting.

1641
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,720
Seat posting. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

1642
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,880
Yeah. It's not part of the seat posting.

1643
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,000
I'm not on this tick tock.

1644
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,920
It's all because I accidentally called like called Donald's butt his ass once.

1645
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:17,400
And then I would like immediately was ashamed of myself.

1646
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:20,960
And then tried to knock it back down to a cute, harmless version of it.

1647
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,120
We should be more ashamed of seat.

1648
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,720
This is where the. Oh, that.

1649
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:29,440
And then we all waited for Jason to bring this this phone case.

1650
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,960
It's great. Yeah, it's very good.

1651
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,240
Any huge. It is huge.

1652
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:35,640
No, it's not at all practical.

1653
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,240
It's very cute, though.

1654
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,920
And Donald Duck also has a great John Hancock.

1655
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,160
Great signature.

1656
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,960
If you can see. Oh, yeah.

1657
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,960
Very dignified.

1658
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,360
That addition to his.

1659
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:48,760
I like it. See.

1660
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,520
All right. Enjoy your tick tock.

1661
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,800
Enjoy knowing.

1662
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,960
Enjoy chasing your teen audience.

1663
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:57,760
We have fun, fellas.

1664
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,800
We need the teens need to listen.

1665
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,960
We need to get youthful.

1666
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:06,400
I just said we have no college audience and we should have no teen audience.

1667
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,000
We're going to keep it.

1668
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,960
You don't have young listeners. I just assumed we do.

1669
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:13,240
We do. With those jokes out of Carlson, please.

1670
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:17,280
Wait, what these jokes about William Frawley from I Love Lucy?

1671
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:22,080
They're going wild for this discussion about both Jack Benny.

1672
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,160
And I don't know what have I talked about?

1673
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,480
I don't know.

1674
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:31,160
Coon, Nelson, Frank, Nelson, Steel, his bit being stolen by Gail Gordon.

1675
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:36,080
Teens are doing the whip and the nae nae while they read Lee Child's

1676
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,760
Jack Reacher series.

1677
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:42,040
This guy told this story on Tick Tock about how people used to bring

1678
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,600
citrus fruits back from vacation.

1679
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:45,920
It's so viral.

1680
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,320
Bring it back.

1681
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,200
It's called it's called Nelsoning.

1682
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:55,800
It's when you imitate classic character actor Frank Nelson on Tick Tock.

1683
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:58,880
Yes. These guys are great.

1684
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,400
They talk. They do seat posting.

1685
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,880
They talk. They do Nelsoning.

1686
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:06,280
And then every third tick tock is like, so like I'm youthful, right?

1687
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,760
Like, I'm youthful enough, aren't I?

1688
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,680
I mean, like, I'll wear like a hat like I'm youthful, right?

1689
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,720
Fruity Pebbles. And look how I'm dressed.

1690
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:17,960
That's going to be my pretty bubbles is what kicks you down.

1691
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,920
How does Fruity Pebbles make you?

1692
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:24,440
Well, Fruity Pebbles is is celebrating an anniversary.

1693
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,120
I just saw.

1694
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:29,600
And I can't remember if it's 30 years or 40 or paper.

1695
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,800
Paper, gold, silver.

1696
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,160
I got to look it up. Fruity Pebbles.

1697
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:35,920
I just saw this is a big anniversary.

1698
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:37,800
And I really want to celebrate.

1699
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,000
They do. They do seat posting. They do Nelsoning.

1700
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,400
They make each other wait for Fruity Pebbles facts on their podcast.

1701
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:47,360
Wow. Pebbles 50th birthday. Wow. Wow.

1702
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:50,400
So happy birthday to Fruity Pebbles and Cocoa Pebbles.

1703
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:52,520
How about that?

1704
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:55,800
So the first tick tock will be happy birthday, Fruity Pebbles,

1705
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:58,960
and then just lots of zooming into Donald's seat.

1706
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:03,040
Yeah. Well, Jason, you name the new song.

1707
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:05,640
Name the current song that plays. Oh, yeah.

1708
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:08,360
Oh, what's what's the big?

1709
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,480
Dua Lipa. Dua Lipa.

1710
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,120
Doja Cat. Doja Cat.

1711
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:13,840
Yeah, doja cat. Yeah, those those.

1712
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:16,880
Yeah, Dua Lipa was just on SNL and she had a new song out.

1713
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:20,160
There's an aria on a very out of date already.

1714
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,640
I think we're talking we might be.

1715
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,040
No, I'm just like your old thing.

1716
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:25,480
I just liked to think that we're somewhat young,

1717
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:28,840
but then referencing music as what played on SNL is.

1718
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:31,680
Yeah, that's true.

1719
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:32,120
Oh, there's a.

1720
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:35,240
Wait. Yeah, that that's maybe not the good litmus is it? Yes.

1721
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:38,920
Yeah, maybe the cool music is not at that point.

1722
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,840
Yeah, I thought I was cool for saying I liked Ariel Pink.

1723
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:47,360
You were cool in 2008 and now you're a right wing.

1724
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,920
Yeah. Apologist.

1725
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,160
Big mistake.

1726
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:52,320
All right. Here's what I will say.

1727
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,200
I again, a frozen movie.

1728
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,280
Fine. Whatever. I like a few of the songs.

1729
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:03,640
As soon as I start on this ride, I feel very comfortable.

1730
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:07,440
I feel comforted and I feel like all these characters are my friends.

1731
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,280
You know, I've talked a lot about this.

1732
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:13,800
What I like on rides is to feel the presence of the characters.

1733
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,280
I like Optimus Prime telling me he's proud of me.

1734
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:22,480
I my favorite part of Rise of the Resistance is the Lieutenant Beck part.

1735
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:26,280
I want to go up to that animatronic while he's like

1736
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,840
shouting out commands at nine numb.

1737
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:31,000
That's my favorite part of Rise of the Resistance.

1738
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,080
And I like Rise of the Resistance fine.

1739
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:36,160
But there's not a lot of good face time with characters

1740
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:40,360
and especially characters that I find warm and friendly and familiar.

1741
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:42,920
Like Finn is way far away.

1742
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:44,720
Ray isn't even on the ride.

1743
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:47,080
This is not a lot of human characters.

1744
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,160
So I'm immediately unfrozen.

1745
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:50,960
The music is blasting, which I love.

1746
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:53,400
I feel like some rides don't blast music.

1747
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,640
They're blasting this music.

1748
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:57,360
It feels very magical.

1749
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:01,160
And I'm so close to all of these robots on like in the same way you are

1750
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:05,440
on like a classic Disneyland dark ride that I immediately feel good.

1751
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:09,360
I immediately have a good feeling that I'm in the presence of all my friends.

1752
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:14,800
Now I wish they said they were proud of me, but this is just as almost just as good.

1753
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,840
And I think that kind of leads up to it.

1754
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:21,640
What Scott is describing is that magical moment with the let it go room to lead me

1755
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:25,040
into feeling really good when I'm on this ride, it feels good.

1756
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:29,280
And I think it's partly also because Malstrom, they had to work within like a

1757
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:33,240
certain limitation and Malstrom is narrow.

1758
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:35,000
It's a very small ride.

1759
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,400
It's a very it's got narrow corridors.

1760
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:41,640
And I think that helps because even if the scenes are a little spare, I'm still

1761
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:47,080
like making eye contact with Olaf and he's talking to me and I don't even have

1762
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:48,560
that much affection for him outside.

1763
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,480
And we haven't even done the Olaf voice yet on this episode.

1764
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:54,120
So that can change.

1765
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,480
We can keep doing it, can't we?

1766
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:01,040
There might, you know, I think we've only danced around it, but I might as well,

1767
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,640
again, to say what I think is successful about this.

1768
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:07,920
It got it. I I like the ride despite not really knowing Frozen.

1769
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:12,960
Some of the things that I've said over the many episodes might imply that I'm not

1770
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,720
the biggest fan of the work of Josh Gadd.

1771
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:18,160
I will stop it there.

1772
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,960
I'm glad he's reuniting all the cast.

1773
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:23,280
It's uplifted my spirits throughout this trying time.

1774
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:29,720
But so I think it should say something that yet, despite me kind of feeling that way,

1775
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:35,560
when Olaf kind of leans around the corner like that look he has, like you're here.

1776
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,560
I it I don't know.

1777
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:38,880
It still gets to me.

1778
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,880
There is a lot of character in that robot.

1779
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,640
It's fantastic. He skates.

1780
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:44,720
He's looking at you.

1781
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:47,240
It's like I like I like Olaf.

1782
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:49,040
I like Mater. I like Olaf.

1783
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:51,520
And those are movies that I don't love, but I get it.

1784
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:55,120
And I understand and I think as a kid, I would have really liked those characters.

1785
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,960
But Olaf is is really good.

1786
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:00,360
I mean, he's the first one I think it talks to you, right?

1787
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:03,800
So that's he immediately is what I'm describing is like feeling comfortable

1788
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:06,320
and feeling like I'm among my friends.

1789
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,560
Mm hmm. So it covers a lot of ground.

1790
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:13,480
He he's sort of of this school with the rocket animatronic.

1791
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:16,360
We're like, boy, this is just a long sequence that this

1792
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,560
animatronic has to do.

1793
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,440
And like you really follow him for a while.

1794
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:21,400
I think it's impressive.

1795
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,600
It feels like they've perfected short nonhuman robots.

1796
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:28,120
Yeah, they're like more of these.

1797
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,360
What's that? Are there any more of these?

1798
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:33,080
What else? Short nonhuman?

1799
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:35,720
BB8. But he's kind of the reindeer.

1800
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:38,920
What's Sven Sven is the reindeer, I believe.

1801
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:40,800
He's that was real good.

1802
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:44,080
He's really good. I mean, those those animatronics, I'm right there with you.

1803
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:47,880
I agree with this side that they're those are fantastic

1804
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:51,240
because it feels like the movie came to life, which is all you want.

1805
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:54,760
As much as they like, you know, have to make some cockamamie story

1806
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:58,360
that isn't the exact plot of the movie, but still hits all the same movie points.

1807
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:01,520
Like the you get you get what you want out of it.

1808
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,000
You get to see all off in real life.

1809
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,040
And that's magical.

1810
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:06,080
And that's I think that part is so good.

1811
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:09,120
That's why I get so mad about the other parts. Yeah, it's.

1812
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:14,480
He's obviously like he's on another level from the human characters.

1813
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:18,600
But I think he does so much heavy lifting that I don't even

1814
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,520
especially the first time I wrote it.

1815
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:23,520
Like I didn't even I didn't even really clock that I had a problem

1816
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,160
with the faces the first time.

1817
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:28,120
I was just like, holy shit, when am I going to get to see Olaf again?

1818
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:31,360
My favorite character in fiction, Olaf, like that immediately.

1819
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:37,440
He seduced Olaf seduces me on the ride in a way he does not in real life.

1820
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:38,960
And I like him fine in real life.

1821
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:41,320
Olaf seduces me on the ride.

1822
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:45,560
Quote Mike Carlson, what's weird about that pastor, Mike Carlson.

1823
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:49,400
I think it sounds normal, honestly.

1824
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:54,200
Did I really is this an anti Josh Gad podcast?

1825
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:55,360
I don't know.

1826
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:58,320
I don't want to go putting that in anyone's anyone's mouth.

1827
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:02,360
I feel like I missed I missed an episode where this was discussed.

1828
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:06,440
We've just we've just done a voice, you know, it's not to my benefit

1829
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:08,640
to go on and on about this.

1830
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:14,000
This never really, truly enjoyed a film.

1831
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:16,560
Maybe it's the writing.

1832
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,520
Maybe it's great Book of Mormon.

1833
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:20,240
Great Olaf. Great.

1834
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:23,360
I think I never saw him do Book of Mormon, which I'm sure was fantastic.

1835
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,800
Did nobody watch the comedians?

1836
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:28,200
I did not see the comedians.

1837
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,480
Fabulous. OK. All right. OK.

1838
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,560
Loved it.

1839
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:34,720
It also blends into my Pillsbury doughboy impression.

1840
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:39,280
It's like they're both very cloying kind of voices like nothing says love.

1841
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:42,200
It's sort of the same like needy.

1842
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:43,800
They're both needy, honestly.

1843
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:47,640
They could redress this Olaf as the Pillsbury doughboy.

1844
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:49,440
And then Jason would love

1845
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:53,520
if there was a Pillsbury doughboy overlay.

1846
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:58,240
If there was a Pillsbury doughboy animatron, I would lose my shit.

1847
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,760
If you got to make one.

1848
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:04,040
Yeah, you can't touch him. There's no way they would never let us touch him.

1849
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,800
It couldn't be on a moving ride.

1850
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,600
Augmented reality.

1851
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:11,480
I think the Mario Kart is really going to.

1852
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,760
Take augmented reality to another.

1853
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:18,280
I hate to be real, we've had a lot of asides here.

1854
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:23,960
I heard a rumor that Mario Kart actually is a slow moving kids

1855
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:29,000
dark ride, but it'll feel faster because of just the screens and the AR and stuff.

1856
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:31,640
I was under the impression it would actually move fairly fast,

1857
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:34,120
but I've heard it's a slow moving children's dark ride.

1858
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,520
I just thought I'd let everyone know.

1859
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:39,200
What if they could pull that trick off?

1860
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:41,440
I think they'd be able to trick trick us.

1861
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:44,080
They didn't trick us with fast and furious. No.

1862
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:46,320
Yeah, no, no.

1863
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,960
But I just had to recalibrate my expectations

1864
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:52,480
that it wouldn't be like a Cars Land type of thing.

1865
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:55,400
Maybe it just like whips and maybe it like hits corners

1866
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,840
in a way that feels like drifting or something.

1867
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:00,040
That's kind of the the excitement.

1868
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:03,720
Slow moving means more room for scenes, which is good.

1869
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:06,800
Yeah, I'd take because if you're just plowing through that thing.

1870
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,840
Yeah, how many can they fit in?

1871
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:12,320
So yeah, so that's good.

1872
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,840
But anyway, back to Olaf skating.

1873
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:19,600
I yeah, I think that the combination of the music,

1874
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:23,360
which like the pre part, like the pre do you want to build it?

1875
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:24,760
Is it song called Do You Want to Build a Stone?

1876
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:26,200
I don't even know the name of the song.

1877
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:27,360
Do you want to build a stone?

1878
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,080
Yeah, that's right.

1879
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:32,120
Twinkly part of it, which again, I have no affection prior.

1880
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,680
But you go up, you start the ride and there's like the like

1881
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,200
sparkly, like icicle kind of lights hanging.

1882
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:38,280
That part's fabulous.

1883
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:40,400
It's fabulous. Yeah.

1884
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,440
So yeah, love that scene.

1885
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:44,080
And then you think it's only going to be Olaf.

1886
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,600
And then there's like a whole other second scene within the scene.

1887
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:47,960
It's fabulous. Yeah.

1888
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:49,160
So I don't know.

1889
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:54,720
I I just like I don't think there's a other than maybe the unthemed

1890
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:56,880
little eight seconds.

1891
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:59,600
I don't think there's a bad scene in this because I like those trolls.

1892
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,720
And I forget the trolls are there.

1893
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:04,440
And the trolls are like, as far as my memory of the movie,

1894
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:06,960
like nothing like I don't remember those trolls in the movie.

1895
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:09,160
I was like, oh, yeah, there were trolls, I guess.

1896
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:14,480
Oh, I like the gaslighting prints and the coup d'etat attempt.

1897
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:18,320
If you list out everything that happens in Frozen, the movie, it's a mess.

1898
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:20,240
I'll tell you what I like.

1899
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:22,800
I like that chant that Nordic

1900
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:26,040
the thing it's called Vuli or Vuli.

1901
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:26,960
I like that.

1902
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,040
I think plays on the lift hill going up.

1903
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:31,720
I always that was that that might have been the song

1904
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:33,880
I remembered the most from the movie.

1905
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:36,400
I feel like every time every time Mike says something he likes,

1906
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,440
I like this ride 20 percent more.

1907
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:40,000
I'm very persuasive.

1908
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,200
Just might not.

1909
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:43,240
I do like the icicle lights.

1910
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,200
Why am I not doing it?

1911
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:47,160
I said some very impassioned things.

1912
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:48,640
Yes, because he's right.

1913
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:53,240
You aren't always like like a inappropriate touch away from a character.

1914
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,560
You know what I mean?

1915
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:55,840
Like you're right there.

1916
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,920
Like you you're not supposed to reach your arm out of the boat,

1917
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:59,480
but you could and you can touch them.

1918
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:00,400
They're right there.

1919
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,080
It's so interesting.

1920
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:05,840
It's it's really I feel like if they there's almost there's a chance,

1921
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:08,920
especially in the era of building Little Mermaid, like if they built this

1922
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:13,880
like Little Mermaid, you wouldn't have the intimacy of this ride.

1923
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:18,600
You would have a bigger show building and perhaps it wouldn't feel so close

1924
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,680
quartered to the point where you would feel like like you get right

1925
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:22,960
by that snow monster at the end.

1926
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:23,360
I don't even know.

1927
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:24,920
Is that is an abominable snowman?

1928
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:27,680
I don't know the names of that character, but I love that giant

1929
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:29,680
ice man at the end.

1930
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:31,680
And he I forget he blows steam at you.

1931
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:32,560
That part's awesome.

1932
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:33,040
The steam.

1933
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:36,200
Also, the steam is perfectly time when like the snow never bothered me anyway

1934
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,560
and that the fog goes up.

1935
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:38,640
I think that's perfect.

1936
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:41,360
I that kind of surprised me every time, too.

1937
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:43,760
The amount of things they pack into five minutes.

1938
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:50,240
I mean, I think this is on par with like the like Peter Pan, honestly.

1939
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:52,320
OK, well, they're OK.

1940
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,000
I think it's that good.

1941
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,200
I don't know. And I don't again.

1942
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,600
No, not that much affection for the movie.

1943
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:00,000
What is the audience that I'm so curious?

1944
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,960
Are we going to like on Earth that people have been quietly despising this ride

1945
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:05,080
for a while?

1946
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:08,360
Or a lot of people like it, I think.

1947
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:10,000
We'll see. I'm not sure.

1948
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,760
I think it's I do think people like I don't get the sense that people hate it,

1949
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:14,960
but I am interested to see.

1950
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,920
I was I was I'm trying to think of the things that I was right.

1951
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:18,640
I guess right.

1952
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,720
That most people thought Baby Aladar was cute.

1953
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:25,320
I was wrong that I thought it would be 50 50 on people liking Mr.

1954
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:27,320
Six, the old man Six Flags mascot.

1955
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:29,560
People love Mr. Six.

1956
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:32,440
I was totally wrong about that.

1957
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:33,560
So I'm interested now.

1958
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:35,600
I bet it would. OK, here's my official guess.

1959
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:41,160
I bet like 75 percent of the audience likes this.

1960
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:43,040
I know I'm going down.

1961
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:44,520
You think it's lower? Yeah.

1962
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:47,000
No, I mean, yeah, I'm out.

1963
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:51,760
I mean, I'm out here hating the hallway and just like bypassing the beautiful Olaf.

1964
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,880
And people are just going to be like, shut her up.

1965
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:57,440
Well, people will feel heard, I think, in what you're saying, too.

1966
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:00,560
There will definitely be people who what you're saying resonates.

1967
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:05,600
I which is not a feeling I felt after living with the land,

1968
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,960
where I think if we apparently if we did live in the land, that poll would be

1969
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:12,320
ninety nine point four percent.

1970
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,240
I truly didn't know that.

1971
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:19,400
I honestly did not know the the like strong, strong affection.

1972
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:22,440
Like, did you before that argument ever came up?

1973
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:24,760
What would what would you have guessed on that, Mike?

1974
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:26,920
Like, would you like living with?

1975
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:29,640
Yeah, that's a good question, because I hmm.

1976
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:34,320
I would have thought that people that really like living with the land

1977
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,680
would be like.

1978
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:39,440
Fifty five or 60 percent that liked it and 40 would say like,

1979
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:42,800
it's fine, but I don't there's better stuff and I've got better classic up.

1980
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:45,800
So I was a little surprised by the amount of people

1981
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:49,200
that had such a strong affection for it, because I don't have such a strong

1982
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:52,160
affection for it. I was the theme park moderate on that episode.

1983
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:55,440
No, that's right. Yes. And liked going on and would don't.

1984
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:59,280
I would like it to continue, but I'm not so looking bad.

1985
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:04,760
Men moderation won at the end of the year.

1986
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,840
That's true. Everyone just wants a nice moderate.

1987
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:13,280
Really? I want those fourteen hundred dollar checks.

1988
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:14,840
I don't want it to be more.

1989
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:17,440
I never wanted more. I don't want to ask for more.

1990
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:19,680
I don't want to bother.

1991
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:22,400
Whatever you can spare is fine.

1992
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,400
I've just been unemployed for 10 months.

1993
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,400
I'll take the 14.

1994
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,360
Now we're doing a lot.

1995
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:33,520
I think with living with the land, my perspective on it would be that

1996
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:37,720
as you see these classic attractions disappear,

1997
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:41,800
it's like we all have to double down to be very loud about them.

1998
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:45,760
Like you have to be like, spaceship or there's the best so that they don't

1999
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:50,480
just make it like a whole Moana ride, whatever that's going to be.

2000
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,680
So like you got to be loud and proud about the old stuff

2001
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:55,360
because they'll just pull it out of there.

2002
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,240
They'll just bulldoze it.

2003
01:40:57,240 --> 01:41:00,000
So, you know, we got to concentrate our efforts. Right.

2004
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,240
I am. Let him hear you in the rafters from the rafters.

2005
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:08,720
I am optimistic about some of the character stuff coming to Epcot

2006
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:13,560
because with Ratatouille and I mean, Ratatouille,

2007
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:16,760
they built a whole new area and a whole new building.

2008
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:18,760
Beautiful. Guardians.

2009
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:22,040
Yeah, it looks the French street, the France Pavilion already.

2010
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:23,800
Very nice. Expanded that.

2011
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:25,840
Guardians, they just got it.

2012
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:29,760
Like kept the exterior gut at the inside, kind of not dissimilar

2013
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:34,040
to what they, you know, did with Guardians and California Adventure

2014
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:36,080
and starting fresh.

2015
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,000
And I do like those.

2016
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,360
And but I I I'm optimistic about that.

2017
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:46,360
And then I'm conflicted about like, you know, we talked about on the living seas,

2018
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:51,120
they put in a lot of the signs back in about sea base, about the modules.

2019
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:52,880
And like the Epcot font.

2020
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:56,360
And I kind of like I like it, but I'm conflicted

2021
01:41:56,360 --> 01:42:00,720
because I think the phrase lack of imagination comes up.

2022
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:05,520
It's like, OK, it's kind of it's a little sad that our version of the future.

2023
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:09,960
We don't have an optimistic version of the future presented in Epcot.

2024
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:15,320
We have the future of like 40 years ago coming back around.

2025
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:19,800
That's your option for the future park is is future from 40 years ago.

2026
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:23,960
Or the characters which you can pull up on Disney Plus

2027
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:26,720
on your phone and see the characters, you know.

2028
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:28,120
Yeah. Well, yeah.

2029
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:31,400
Yeah. The optimistic future, all being from 40 years ago, is why we're getting

2030
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:34,880
29 new Star Wars shows.

2031
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:37,720
Yeah.

2032
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,760
I mean, look, I wish

2033
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:46,600
I there's no I wish there was a world where like Epcot,

2034
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:49,680
when they were designing Epcot, they could have figured out a way

2035
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:53,040
and I think I've said this before, if it was maybe it's like putting

2036
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:57,680
original characters on each ride and trying to grant to make them

2037
01:42:57,680 --> 01:43:00,960
so they were grandfathered in more like haunted mansion and pirates.

2038
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:06,440
Like there's a version of us being able to keep some of these original things

2039
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:11,000
that I think they they didn't want to do what they were doing over

2040
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:14,040
in Disneyland, in Disney World for a reason.

2041
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:17,160
But I think it's cost them in the long run.

2042
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:20,240
Because of that, like they like Figment and the Dreamfinder

2043
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:23,880
were the closest thing they got to it, but even they didn't make it out

2044
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:26,280
unscathed and still might not.

2045
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:31,320
But I wish I wish they could have still done their weirdo fun,

2046
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:34,760
interesting, not fun, scary, interesting rides

2047
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:39,720
and done it in such a way that would have made a lot more of these untouchable.

2048
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:42,720
So give Epcot more history. Sorry, keep going.

2049
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:45,680
Yeah, you know, like Epcot's more about

2050
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:50,600
cool environments and vibes and not so much characters.

2051
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:54,040
And you might say the same thing in a way about pirates and Haunted Mansion,

2052
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:58,000
except that you remember like, oh, yeah, the foot pirate

2053
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,800
or the three guys locked in the jail or these particular ghosts.

2054
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:08,880
And that is maybe like, am I crazy that Epcot is not full of that?

2055
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:11,360
Like, you know, think about like World of Motion.

2056
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:14,400
I was a big fan of World of Motion, but like, what are the characters?

2057
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:16,640
That you need to save? Right.

2058
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,120
Horse car crash. Really any of them.

2059
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:19,400
I mean, I like all these rides.

2060
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:21,400
What did you say, Jason? Horse car crash?

2061
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:24,400
Oh, yeah. Remember the big horse car crash?

2062
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:26,960
Didn't that end up in Pirates or something? Didn't they move that?

2063
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:31,120
Or some of the characters? They might have reused it.

2064
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,200
Some at Figment Jedi on Twitter sent us the concept art of

2065
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:41,400
Captain Salty Hind, Captain Salty Hinder and his mackerel

2066
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:45,400
that were characters originally considered for the living seas at some point.

2067
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:48,680
Yes, this was this is something like that.

2068
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:50,520
Now, this is what Mike's talking about.

2069
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:52,720
More grandfathered in good characters.

2070
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:55,400
Yeah. I mean, I don't know if Captain Salty

2071
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:59,680
would have completely saved the seas from becoming Nemo and friends, but

2072
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:02,000
there's something to it.

2073
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,600
I mean, there's no way you could have known, I guess,

2074
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:07,000
when you were trying to do something interesting and cool that like

2075
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,520
this stuff is going to have to go away at a certain point, because

2076
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:11,000
people aren't quite as attached to it.

2077
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,600
The general population isn't quite as attached to it.

2078
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:18,800
But I do think some of that would have helped at least preserve it.

2079
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:21,800
And maybe that's maybe this is just maybe doesn't need to be preserved.

2080
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:26,800
I think Joe Rody was saying, like, he thinks of things and rides

2081
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:31,400
and attractions and his adventurers club more like a Broadway show.

2082
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:34,000
Well, it had a 20 it had 15 year run, a 20 year run.

2083
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,520
So maybe that's fine.

2084
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:37,400
Maybe everything doesn't need to be run.

2085
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:39,920
Maybe everything doesn't need to be forever.

2086
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:44,000
I guess you could also say that about why we might not need 26 Star Wars shows.

2087
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:46,480
Maybe Star Wars could be over.

2088
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:48,800
It's possible we don't need it forever.

2089
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:51,160
A new thing will come that we'll like.

2090
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:56,600
Or is it possible that because the first Star Wars show everyone loves,

2091
01:45:56,600 --> 01:46:00,400
that that doesn't necessarily mean that you have to do all of the rest of them?

2092
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:03,080
I'm not discounting that's what I'm saying is like Mandalorian.

2093
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:04,720
I think Mandalorian is worth doing clearly.

2094
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:06,920
People are apeshit for Mandalorian.

2095
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:09,760
Does that mean we're going to like all the rest of it?

2096
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:12,720
Well, I'm kind of like I'm kind of like, let's be quiet,

2097
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:15,360
because then maybe they'll apply that to the Muppets.

2098
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:17,400
You know what I'm saying?

2099
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:21,760
Where it's like maybe we'll get 26 Muppets shows if we show enough interest.

2100
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:24,440
There will be a pattern for this.

2101
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:27,840
Yeah, we let anyone know we we want that.

2102
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:30,440
What's the what's the move as an audience?

2103
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:32,440
We of course we want that.

2104
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:35,040
But how do we how do we make Disney aware?

2105
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:36,880
What's the best way?

2106
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:38,720
Just got to keep talking about it.

2107
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:40,080
I guess so. I don't know.

2108
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:41,280
The Muppets is a trick.

2109
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,920
The Muppets is trickier, I feel like.

2110
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:47,280
I feel like we'll get like a little bone thrown every few years

2111
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:51,560
until it's been pretty much until they like sell them off to someone else.

2112
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:56,360
The Muppets is a whole nother episode, though.

2113
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:58,760
That's a whole nother discussion.

2114
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:00,960
Where is it going? Oh, before we stop,

2115
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:04,400
I know the name of the guy who was the lead, the lead imagineer.

2116
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:09,080
His name was Michelle and I can't pronounce his last name, Den Dolk.

2117
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:12,720
And he is a mentee of a Mr.

2118
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:14,440
Tony Baxter.

2119
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:15,440
Mm hmm.

2120
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:17,800
And he his first project because he worked at Efteling

2121
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:20,440
and he worked overseas for a while.

2122
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:24,600
And his first project was where he was, I think, lead on was Fantasy Fair

2123
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:29,240
in Disneyland, which is that area over by that stage where people swing dance

2124
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:33,120
and where Figaro the cat has a little animatronic outside,

2125
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:35,200
which I think that was a big hit.

2126
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:36,480
That was immediately a big hit.

2127
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:37,720
Little. Mm hmm.

2128
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:42,080
And Tony Baxter, I was also because I remembered an old season pass

2129
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:45,560
where they asked Tony about the ride and he goes, Oh, I have faith in

2130
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:49,840
my mentee, essentially, because I know he knows what he's doing.

2131
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:53,200
And I'm not sure what he's I don't know if he still works for the company.

2132
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:56,200
I'm not sure what he's done or has been a lead on lately.

2133
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:59,920
But I like both of his things that I know he was in charge of.

2134
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:02,360
So, Michelle, thank you.

2135
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:06,160
Similar place making for the the Fantasy Fair and the queue.

2136
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:08,360
Yeah. Yes. Similar.

2137
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:10,280
What a great queue. Yeah. Great.

2138
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:14,120
You know, obviously, you know, Efteling, that's a place I've not been,

2139
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:16,080
but I hear the theming is out of control.

2140
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:17,840
So in a good way.

2141
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:19,760
So kudos to this gentleman.

2142
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:22,840
Maybe this is a good

2143
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:25,880
attraction to do

2144
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:27,720
the not always done

2145
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:32,840
plus it up, keep it, keep it or whatever it's called.

2146
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,640
Plus, keep it or burn it to the ground for insurance money.

2147
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:38,840
Maybe this is a thing to pose to Carly.

2148
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:45,160
How do we what what happens to this ride to make you more satisfied with it?

2149
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,640
It's hard because when you look at it realistically,

2150
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:54,720
I wish they would have gotten a Guardian style attraction.

2151
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:59,160
Like I wish they would have gotten the brand new groundbreaking, whatever,

2152
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:03,520
whatever, instead of being shoehorned into a former track and ride.

2153
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:06,560
I think that they did a really good job with what they were given,

2154
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:08,800
because what they were given was not normal.

2155
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:12,240
It was not like a normal just like, oh, you're just going to take over

2156
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:13,440
like a random fantasyland ride.

2157
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:16,280
Like it truly there's like boat switchbacks.

2158
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:19,240
So I think they did a great job with it.

2159
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:23,040
But I would say keep it, but give them another one.

2160
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:28,080
So keep it, but give them a new one, because this ride,

2161
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:30,160
there's I really don't know how you would plus it,

2162
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:34,280
because you would never spend the money to just put in new Princess animatronics.

2163
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:36,080
Like that's just not worth it.

2164
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:37,880
And you can't put more oil off.

2165
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:39,960
Like there's I mean, you could fix that hallway.

2166
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:44,680
But beyond that, like there's not much you can do to plus it beyond what it is.

2167
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:47,120
So like just give them a second plot of land

2168
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:49,680
and put in that thing you designed for Hong Kong.

2169
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:51,920
That's a good call.

2170
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:57,080
That's a very good like make this the Navi River journey to a

2171
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:01,480
TBD flight of passage.

2172
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:05,720
Yes, I just to me, Frozen has has proven itself at this point.

2173
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:07,680
It's a huge franchise.

2174
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:08,520
People love it.

2175
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:12,480
And I assume the kids who grew up on it so strongly still like it

2176
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:13,680
and still identify with it.

2177
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:16,720
So at this point, like if there's any new animated film

2178
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:20,440
that deserves another ride, I think they do.

2179
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,320
Sure. Yeah, big time.

2180
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:23,560
What do we do with the hallway?

2181
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:24,840
How do you fix the hallway?

2182
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:26,520
That's what I want to crack it.

2183
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:27,360
Just Christmas lights.

2184
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:29,880
Like, honestly, if you just put in Christmas lights, I'd be thrilled.

2185
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:32,160
Thrilled. Couple candles.

2186
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:36,600
I mean, the the the icicle things at the beginning of the ride are so good,

2187
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:39,520
even if you just ordered another shipment of those

2188
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:41,480
and just like shoved them in the ceiling.

2189
01:50:41,480 --> 01:50:44,560
Like, I think truly like any or anything that would make you feel

2190
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:48,040
like you're entering more of like a mossy space, just a transition.

2191
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:51,240
And any anything.

2192
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:55,160
You know, when I also in thinking about this room before this episode,

2193
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:58,440
one thing that I was like, I bet I'll have the upper hand here.

2194
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:01,960
I was going to go back into the maelstrom and then see, well,

2195
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:03,040
what was that room before?

2196
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:05,280
I bet it was kind of nothing before, too.

2197
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:08,080
So it's almost just exactly what the maelstrom was.

2198
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:10,040
And then I watched the ride through the maelstrom.

2199
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:15,400
And you know, it was in that space was the weird, tall, upright polar bear,

2200
01:51:15,680 --> 01:51:18,160
which is one of my now you talk about our IP.

2201
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:24,120
Great, I've got IP, the very stiff, like perfect posture,

2202
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:28,280
bizarrely upright, begging for a treat polar bear.

2203
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:31,640
I don't know if other people are as fond of the weird, tall polar bear as me.

2204
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:36,640
But it was always like mocking me in the ride through like, oh, my God, this

2205
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:40,000
this bizarre polar bear used to be in that spot where there's nothing.

2206
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,800
Well, I guess Carly's got me there. Put him back.

2207
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:46,080
But yes, it's got to be somewhere, right?

2208
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:50,080
Yeah, it stresses me out in like such an existential way,

2209
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:54,640
because I feel like I can't I can't praise the ride,

2210
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:59,200
knowing that there's this one segment where they showed their hand.

2211
01:51:59,240 --> 01:51:59,960
You know what I mean?

2212
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:03,280
It's like they shoved all of the time and effort on like the cool new robot.

2213
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:06,720
But then even something where you can emerge, like it just takes you out of the whole story.

2214
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:10,520
And you could just immerse me just truly by stringing lights, stringing lights.

2215
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:14,840
Also, for me, like animate some crowd scenes.

2216
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:20,120
Like a whole premise is that the whole kingdom is celebrating this event.

2217
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:24,920
And I think by the end, there's like eight people around, you know?

2218
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:28,440
So it's a little I guess you are the kingdom in theory.

2219
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:30,600
But how many people are in your boat?

2220
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:34,240
You know, I think I missed the summer fest thing entirely.

2221
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:37,120
The guy that one went over my head when I went on it.

2222
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:41,280
I didn't realize that was the idea until recapping it.

2223
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:42,640
It doesn't matter.

2224
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:45,480
It doesn't matter. It's just a nice trip with your friends.

2225
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:47,040
You know, that's really all.

2226
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:50,560
If my plus that I would just be like, let the boat stop for 30 seconds

2227
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:53,120
and have Olaf, as I said on the episode about the Fast and Furious,

2228
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:56,320
Olaf comes up to the boat and like talks to me for a couple seconds

2229
01:52:56,920 --> 01:52:58,600
and like addresses me.

2230
01:52:58,600 --> 01:52:59,880
Hey, Michael.

2231
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:04,440
Thanks for coming on my ride.

2232
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:04,800
I love that.

2233
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:09,080
And I would say, yeah, fix the faces, fix the faces,

2234
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:13,280
maybe put the new heads on, put the more advanced heads on the robots

2235
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:16,720
and then crank the music up even louder.

2236
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:17,560
Like, let's get it.

2237
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:22,440
Let's get it. Vegas, douchey Vegas, pool party club level base

2238
01:53:22,440 --> 01:53:27,160
going because I want to really enjoy on a ride.

2239
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:28,720
I feel like I'm rocking roller coaster.

2240
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:33,200
I want Aerosmith cranked up five more like times five decibels.

2241
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:36,640
I feel like it used to be that when I went on first when I was younger

2242
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:39,680
in the 90s, I feel like they really had cranked up Aerosmith.

2243
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:42,120
And I feel like now it's not is not loud enough.

2244
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:46,480
How do you think the tick tock teens are going to feel about your love of Aerosmith?

2245
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:50,000
Well, we'll see the Aerosmith.

2246
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,920
I guess, well, this Steven Tyler didn't know Lyft.

2247
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:54,840
Tyler was his daughter for years.

2248
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:56,600
That's kind of sus.

2249
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:58,360
Cancel Mike.

2250
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:05,680
I yeah, the teens, I'm sure, will be interested in any Aerosmith content we put out.

2251
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:08,720
As I've said before, I think I've said it at least on Twitter.

2252
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:13,960
One of the first things I want to do post vaccine is get in the pit

2253
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:17,440
at Aerosmith's Deuces are Wild Las Vegas residency.

2254
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:21,600
So I am really counting on this vaccine.

2255
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:24,080
I will promise I will spend the money.

2256
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:26,600
It's too much money.

2257
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:30,040
My one my one concern is that they have not been putting jaded in the set

2258
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:33,960
lists that I've seen online, which is the best Aerosmith song by far.

2259
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:35,800
And other Scott and I, we have a lot of agreement.

2260
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:39,800
And I feel like jaded in the frozen ride are it are both

2261
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:42,040
the two of the biggest agreements we have.

2262
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:44,360
So this is what unites us as friends.

2263
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:47,880
Yes, mainly it's all built on the back of the song jaded.

2264
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:51,200
So, yeah, get in the set list and let's get.

2265
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:53,080
Yeah, you know what? I'm in I'm in there with you.

2266
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:55,600
I'm jumping in the Deuces Wild Pit.

2267
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:58,400
And I want Steven Tyler to cough on me.

2268
01:54:58,440 --> 01:55:00,520
Yeah, that's when I'll know everything's better.

2269
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:02,720
Yeah, that is when we'll know.

2270
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:08,200
So, yeah, so better robot heads crank it, DJ crank up this frozen music.

2271
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:10,000
And I don't know, I'm good.

2272
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,920
I think that's all it really needs.

2273
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:15,600
Hmm. All right. Well, did we do it?

2274
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:19,160
Do I guess I guess Carly Weisel, you survived podcast the ride.

2275
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:24,720
We survived another we we had another another boat beef.

2276
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,480
We had a boat beef.

2277
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:28,120
We worked our way through it.

2278
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:31,720
And it's always fun.

2279
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:36,200
If we know, do we have this divergent of opinions about any other?

2280
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:39,560
Oh, yeah. We had to set up the next episode somehow.

2281
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:42,760
Oh, goodness. I'm not sure.

2282
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:44,240
How do you do what's here?

2283
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:48,600
Just like general gay or nay on a Mexico boat ride.

2284
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:51,640
I mean, it depends on if Donald's back or not,

2285
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:55,960
because I'm really starting to appreciate plant with sombrero.

2286
01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:59,040
You might be that's maybe a fix for the hallways.

2287
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:00,800
I mean, there's already some fan art.

2288
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:05,360
Like I'm I'm kind of in on this new unexpected IP.

2289
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:09,280
There's your Epcot. This is the hope for the future.

2290
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:12,480
This is an innovative Epcot IP for the 2020s.

2291
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:16,560
Carly, here's how you get back in the good graces on TikTok.

2292
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:23,160
You you you post a video of you pointing out that meme

2293
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:26,000
where the guy's holding hands with his girlfriend

2294
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,920
and she looks unhappy because he's looking at another lady.

2295
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:33,480
And the angry girlfriend is Donald's head.

2296
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:37,480
And then the other lady is the plant with a hat on it.

2297
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:39,480
Oh, and everyone will laugh.

2298
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:40,680
And they'll all like that.

2299
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:43,280
They'll all enjoy that two year old meme.

2300
01:56:43,480 --> 01:56:46,320
Oh, that is exactly how I feel.

2301
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:49,640
Yeah. Yeah, that'll really work.

2302
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,880
Yeah. Yeah. I can't think of any other.

2303
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:55,160
I mean, I have we've really exploited my extremely strong opinions

2304
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:59,400
on the previous the previous episodes I've been on with Starbucks,

2305
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:01,680
with with the land, things like that.

2306
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:05,360
But I mean, no, everything else I'm just pretty chill with.

2307
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:08,000
What about River Journey, Navi River Journey?

2308
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:11,360
I think it's fine. I mean, I enjoy it when I go on it.

2309
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:14,960
I like some of the smaller detailed work they've done

2310
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:20,160
with like the shadowing on the like lily pads or leaves of character footprints.

2311
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:21,760
I think that's nice.

2312
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:22,520
I'm fine with it.

2313
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:25,760
I don't know what's going on, but I don't like I don't like it.

2314
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:28,480
I hate it the way some people do.

2315
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:30,840
I don't know if any of us do either.

2316
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:32,840
I love it. I like it.

2317
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:34,000
So maybe somebody's got a crime.

2318
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,800
Maybe I have to say I hate it just to I have to be this.

2319
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:39,360
What's his name? Stephen Lang.

2320
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:41,440
I have to be the Stephen Lang of yes.

2321
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,680
I hate the Navi River Journey.

2322
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:45,760
We're going to blow it up from the base.

2323
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:48,400
And I chase those blue bastards out of there.

2324
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:50,840
Well, you know, maybe we should.

2325
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:52,920
I would I would hope we could get a next episode.

2326
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:55,480
When you're on, we could do like Gideon's Bakery or something.

2327
01:57:55,480 --> 01:57:57,320
Oh, my God. That's a dream.

2328
01:57:57,320 --> 01:57:59,760
Maybe that's too big. Oh, the dream.

2329
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:02,400
That's too ambitious, perhaps.

2330
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:06,120
Well, we'll find something with all the Disneyland funny business.

2331
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:09,360
I it could very well play out that I get the vaccine

2332
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:14,280
and end up at Florida in the Gideon's line before I am able to get into Disneyland.

2333
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:17,000
Absolutely. It's absolutely possible.

2334
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:20,560
Yeah, sure. Well, we can we demand that you do it at this point.

2335
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:23,400
I think you have to for content. Oh, me.

2336
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:27,920
Yeah. You know, I tentatively already have a trip planned

2337
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:32,720
because my family was supposed to go in November of 2020.

2338
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:36,080
And we just called that, I think, in April or May.

2339
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:37,840
And just pushed it a year.

2340
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:39,640
So we'll see. OK.

2341
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:41,760
Well, you'll be in Florida. I'll be in the pit.

2342
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:44,440
I'll be in the pit in Vegas.

2343
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:46,000
Well, also, Jason, don't miss out.

2344
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,720
There's a hot cookie hour where for one hour a day,

2345
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:51,840
they serve you a hot ass cookie with local ice cream.

2346
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:55,120
Carly, I know all about the hot cookie.

2347
01:58:57,240 --> 01:58:59,480
Which which hour is it?

2348
01:58:59,480 --> 01:59:01,160
I think it's seven p.m.

2349
01:59:01,160 --> 01:59:02,440
Yeah, it's late. It's late.

2350
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:03,960
It's it's late.

2351
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:07,000
Even though they're one of their vibes is that like, you know,

2352
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,440
when we run out, we want we only make so much when we're out, we're out.

2353
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:13,040
Well, the way.

2354
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:15,760
But look, there's a lot of fun that we had when we're all vaccinated.

2355
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:19,560
Yeah, boy, that's going to be you just Jason just tucks into bed,

2356
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:24,240
just rent the the literal closest hotel room you can to the ice cream

2357
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:26,960
and the cookie and then just covers up.

2358
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:29,720
And that's that I I read.

2359
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:33,560
I read the Disney tourist blog review of the Disney

2360
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:37,960
Gideon's and I think they spent seventy dollars to sample a bunch of stuff.

2361
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:40,040
And I was like, OK, yeah, I'm prepared for that.

2362
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:41,600
Yeah, that sounds right.

2363
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:45,600
We're like a few cookies, a few things, a cake and two coffees.

2364
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:47,560
I'm like, OK, yeah.

2365
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:48,840
All right, let's do that.

2366
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:49,440
Jason's story.

2367
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:51,520
Well, you also have to pay for the flight, I guess, too.

2368
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:53,840
So it's going to it's going to climb, but it'll all be worth it.

2369
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:54,560
That's true.

2370
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:58,280
But these these frequent flyer miles aren't doing anything right now.

2371
01:59:59,960 --> 02:00:01,000
And I know I'm a mess.

2372
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,960
Yeah, I'm messing a lot of points because I'm not.

2373
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:04,680
Yeah, I'm using them on anything.

2374
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:05,600
And then you're going to.

2375
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:07,400
I am the.

2376
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:08,200
Yeah, yeah, please.

2377
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:13,080
So this day, we have to exit through the gift shop

2378
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:14,560
and ask if there's anything you'd like to play with.

2379
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:16,880
Last time you were on, you did not have your own podcast.

2380
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:18,600
And now you have your own podcast.

2381
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:20,760
Tell our listeners about it.

2382
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:22,360
Yes. Surprise.

2383
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:27,440
I now do this, I hope, with more eloquence than me screaming about a hallway

2384
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:30,080
in a work setting.

2385
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:33,120
It's called Very Amusing with Karla Wazel, who is me.

2386
02:00:33,120 --> 02:00:36,080
If you made it this far without knowing that, that's cool.

2387
02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:40,280
It is reported theme park stories for the most part.

2388
02:00:40,280 --> 02:00:44,160
So it's really like diving into the type of things that fans are very interested

2389
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:47,480
in that usually like we laugh about on Twitter for two days and then it goes away.

2390
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:52,480
Things like when all those weird Star Wars sodas wound up in a random grocery store.

2391
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:56,160
I tried to track them all the way back, just like random

2392
02:00:56,160 --> 02:00:58,760
fun things that are very fan focused.

2393
02:00:58,760 --> 02:01:01,360
So we wrapped season one at the end of the year.

2394
02:01:01,640 --> 02:01:05,040
And now I'm taking a cool few weeks off and then I'm back at it.

2395
02:01:05,680 --> 02:01:07,720
It is fantastic. Yes.

2396
02:01:07,720 --> 02:01:10,240
Well, yeah, yeah. Check it out. I've checked that. It's great.

That is the new luxury brand within podcast the ride.

2401
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:30,040
Or you know, I had nothing to do with it.

2402
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:32,480
If you see some seat posting, that's the deal.

2403
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:39,560
And and as for as a hey, if you want three bonus episodes every month,

02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:49,480
the ride, which is Scott's there for as of now.

2406
02:01:50,440 --> 02:01:52,720
And you think it change? Yes. Yeah.

2407
02:01:53,600 --> 02:02:01,880
Well, so I guess what's a frozen anyway to end it?

2408
02:02:03,240 --> 02:02:08,680
Hey, as you walk through that unthemed black hallway of life backwards.

2409
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:13,160
It's like a Twin Peaks ending. Yeah.

2410
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:17,240
So frozen.

2411
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:20,880
Just Scott, maybe to say say something to your followers,

2412
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:25,880
just to say to the Esenons, just say goodbye to them, maybe in your special way.

2413
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:35,000
Maybe the day the the storm is coming to Arendelle, and it's going to be fun.

2414
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:37,400
It's going to be very emotional. You're going to be saying, let it go.

2415
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:40,400
It's going to be the most fun storm you've ever had.

2416
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:42,400
That's my s drop.

2417
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:44,440
And in general, there's been a PTR drop.

2418
02:02:44,440 --> 02:02:46,080
Thanks for listening, everybody.

2419
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:47,840
Goodbye. Bye.
