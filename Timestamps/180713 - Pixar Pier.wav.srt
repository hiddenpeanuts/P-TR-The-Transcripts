Warning, the following podcasts may contain costumed characters with plastic heads and human hands,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
a scathing review of an ice cream cone, pal-arounds, and a curious look at the Disneyland Resort's newest offering, Pixar Pier.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Spoiler alert, it's fine, this is Podcast the Ride.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the only theme park podcast where you'll hear a heartfelt apology directed to robot birds,

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
which I'll do in one second once I get to my co-host, Jason Sheridan.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh, I'm glad you're doing that. Yeah, I have that written down.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
See? I was telling Scott this happened a lot. There were a lot of comments this week from last week's episode.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But very polite.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I was trying to figure out what a lot meant because my guess was two and you asserted five.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I said like five to six or seven.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Across the social media, I think-

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You just upped it to six or seven.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Now I'm exaggerating for the air.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I think the truth is in between as it often is. I think it was three to four across a couple social media.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, I'm not going to take any more time other than saying my full name is Scott Gardner and then seating the floor to Mike Carlson for his apology.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Okay, so here's the thing. I would like to heart-felt-ly apologize to the group of white cockatoos who appear in Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I incorrectly stated on last week's episode that they did not have names and only the four hosts said names. That is incorrect.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
They absolutely have names. There are six ladybirds who have names and I would like to apologize to each of them right now.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry to Colette, Suzette, Mimi, Gigi, Fifi, and Josephine.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I very much apologize. You guys have fun names. You passed the Hell and Tests as far as I'm concerned.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We certainly do.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They don't have any lines really in the show. They just sing a song.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And also apology in absentia to Rosita. No one knows what happened to Rosita.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes. And I also would like to take the blame for this myself, but I'd also like to call out my two co-hosts for not correcting me.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Okay, so where were you guys? We're all experts here.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I think I was probably asleep every time I visited the Enchanted Tiki Room and thus did not pick up any names.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Jason, where were you? Come on, man.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I was so charmed and enthralled by the actual entertainment. I occasionally just black out certain elements of it to invest it in the story.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
As I said, we got 13 to 20 comments about this. 24.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And I'm very... Look, I did feel a bit of shame. People would tweet and I did feel like, well, we're supposed to be guys that know what we're talking about.

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You didn't know what you're talking about. How could you let a mistake like this happen?

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You know, we were kind of in universal mindset and we were also blue sky-ing the Hell and Tests.

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I feel like we just got probably caught up in the heat of podcasting.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is like Steve Renna's Easy, 9-11, not quite on that level, but the comedian who claimed he was in 9-11.

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is a big embarrassment is what I'm saying. It's not a one-to-one as far as...

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
There is some conspiracy theories that Rosita was actually in the towers but got out ahead of time.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Easier for a bird to do so than for a person.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Very easy.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Wait, okay. Let me clarify a couple of things. We're talking about last week when we came up with a new theory, the Hell and Test,

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:56,000
which relates to characters being named on interesting names like Hell and specifically in theme park rides or robot shows

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
because this came from Hell and in Waterworld and Hell and in the Chuck E. Cheese band.

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
By the way, does the Hell and Test apply to non-theme park entertainment as well?

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Do we think Hellen is just a bad name, a boring name for characters?

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's all comparatively. If the movie has a series of male characters and one is named The Flashlight and one is named Sun Man,

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and then it's like Linda is the female character.

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah, yeah. Got you.

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If they have fun names or silly names and then the female character is boring. So I think so.

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's a good way to frame the rule. I'm not sure if my wife pointed out a new one to me, Daria. Daria's mom is Hellen.

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Now, I don't know if all of the characters have interesting names on Daria. I don't remember everybody else's name,

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
but Hellen is not as interesting of a name as Daria.

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's true.

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But maybe that's important for the story that she was raised by this kind of waspy or yuppie mother and then Daria is an oddball who doesn't fit in with the family.

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So maybe if it's narratively important, that can override the Hellen test.

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yeah, I think that's right. And also the thing, maybe the flaw in the Hellen test is there could be a movie where like all the characters are named Jim, Michael, Hellen, and Linda, let's say.

55
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I think that's okay.

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And that's fine. But the problem is now people will misinterpret that just Hellen is a bad name. And that's not what we're saying.

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Because we mentioned Hellen Parr, Elastigirl and the Incredibles. It's got an IOC Incredibles 2.

58
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Since recording it, yes.

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Since recording, a terrific movie. She gets a great arc. Like it's mostly her movie, I would say.

60
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But that's not what this is about. It's just about her name.

61
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah.

62
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We don't care if the female has a good arc or a satisfying thing. We just care that the name is interesting.

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But what's Mr. Incredible's non Mr. Incredible name?

64
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Bob.

65
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Well, so does that? No, it's fine. I think the Incredibles pass is for sure.

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Then the kids are named Dashal and Violet, which are interesting names. Very interesting names.

67
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But that's a generational thing. Bob and Hellen are of a certain generation, and that makes sense. And they have code names that are very fun.

68
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Similar to Hellen and Daria.

69
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yes.

70
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It makes sense that a younger generation. So if the interesting name issue is due to generational difference, we'll allow it.

71
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But if it's characters who are all roughly of the same age, like Pasquale, Munch and Jasper, and then one of their ranks is named Hellen, that's boring.

72
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's boring.

73
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Birdie in McDonald's gang is fine. Birdie is interesting.

74
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yes.

75
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
As much as Hamburglar or Grimace, maybe not quite. But it's more specific than Hellen. If her name was just Jill.

76
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah, it's as good as Mayor Big Mac or, oh no, Officer Big Mac.

77
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Officer Big Mac and Mayor McCheese.

78
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Mayor McCheese.

79
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
God damn it.

80
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Sorry, I'm screwing up a lot these last few weeks.

81
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Would Hellen the Bird pass the test if she had, if her middle name was Entertainment, like Chuck Entertainment Cheese?

82
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So it would be Hellen E. Henny?

83
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Is it Henny?

84
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Is it Henny? Henny gets closer, I guess, to being fun.

85
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I guess it couldn't also be Entertainment. It would be like Hellen Musicality Henny or Hellen Excellent Service. Another aspect of the Chuck E. Cheese experience.

86
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Oh, an infamous aspect of the Chuck E. Cheese experience.

87
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Oh yes. Famously their service is perfect.

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Hellen Skeeball Hen.

89
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah, she would be, yeah, if Birdie was in, it would be cool because Birdie is a fun name.

90
00:07:48,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'd be curious to think about, I think this is important, a distinction to make that Hellen, it's not about the name Hellen. It's about female character names not keeping up with the dynamic nature of them.

91
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So there's probably other examples of this and go ahead and tweet them at us if you think you have.

92
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And if you understand what we're talking about, if you understand the concept because it's a bit confusing.

93
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It is a little bit, but interesting that there's a couple of dully named Hellens throughout theme park lore.

94
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah.

95
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And we're going to try to put a stop to that going forward.

96
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Well, I mean Hellen is, I guess this leads us into the primary topic today. This came up entirely because Hellen, the AKA Elastigirl factors into the Disney's newest quote unquote attraction, the Incredicoaster.

97
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And its newest land, Pixar Pier.

98
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The Hellen of California Adventure.

99
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Well, yeah, are we showing our cards of our opinion of this? I think it does seem like we're maybe following the, it seems, from my sense, theme park media, YouTube channels, Twitterers, wherever else these people can live, are not super psyched about Pixar Pier.

100
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Well, it depends. I think the people that got a free ride to Disney and got to experience it early, they found a lot to like for some reason.

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh, does this happen often?

102
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yes. It depends. I think it depends because I saw certain places and I don't want to call out podcasts or websites, but I saw on a certain website versus a certain website's podcast, the discrepancy.

103
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The podcast was much more glowing about it. And then if you actually read the website buried down in a few paragraphs, there was actually some criticism.

104
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So I'm saying they're forward facing clickbait title is pro.

105
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'll call them out. Ferris wheel lovers dot net.

106
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm tired of you guys being bought.

107
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Y'all are bullshit artists.

108
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, that's it. That's the one we all know.

109
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I don't mind making an enemy here today. I didn't want to, but I guess we everyone go to that.

110
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The head. That dot net go to their site and yell at him and give him a piece of your mind.

111
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And yeah, and rate and review Ferris pod at Apple podcasts and tell them that look, you need to be consistent here and you need to be objective theme park journalists like we are.

112
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah, send them to the one star basement. You are disgracing Mr. Ferris is legacy.

113
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Dare you use his name.

114
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Well, so you guys have been to Pixar peer been to not because I'm I'm off my past for a little while.

115
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll take a couple months off. I'm certainly taking the summer off because we there was there was a tweet going around about how the other day Friday as we record this.

116
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm not exactly objective, but the recently at Disneyland had the most the hottest day on record of any Disney theme park.

117
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Any Disney theme park.

118
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
How can that be 13 degrees?

119
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah, it does seem like something would have hit that hit that before that because it's not 113 isn't the hottest temperature of all time.

120
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
No, in an maybe it is though.

121
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I feel like it's that is the hottest single. That's the hottest temperature I can remember since I moved to Southern California.

122
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yeah, but I'm surprised it has not gotten hotter in Orlando.

123
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But maybe it I don't know.

124
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Maybe the rain cools it down like the humidity keeps it a little cooler.

125
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But curious the height in general.

126
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I mean, I think I feel like humidity is more the what's oppressive there than the the dry California on top of that to the hottest day.

127
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Disney was having tech problems and the apps went down.

128
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So like FastPass and like food restaurants like what a disaster on a day when like the heat is already pushing everyone to their limit.

129
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Just like the worst like I'm sure there were just dads like just losing their minds.

130
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Like if people maybe if it was a trip that's been in the works for months or years and you get there and that's how it plays out.

131
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I don't know or show.

132
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I feel like at that temperature, the smallest like a cashier going, oh, excuse me, sir.

133
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I have to go get a roll of quarters.

134
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm out of quarters can make someone go like what else is going to go to play to plant the seed that when they get back to their hometown, they will leave their family or maybe they don't go back to their home.

135
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I was going to say it just happens there and he just walks into downtown Disney and they never seen again.

136
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
He's never seen again.

137
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Gets on a bus to Garden Grove and I'm starting over.

138
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Y'all are on your own.

139
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Temperature does crazy things to people.

140
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I also saw that the Cars Land, all the Cars Land rides were down at one point.

141
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, really?

142
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah.

143
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Just a Disneyland meltdown.

144
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And I'm wrong for not wanting to go to the park, get a glass of wine, go on one ride and then leave.

145
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Well, in that heat, of course, no one would blame you.

146
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But we're saying when it's temperate day, two rides at least.

147
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's been a hot summer out here.

148
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
If I'm feeling patient.

149
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So you're on your past break and you're thinking how long has the break now been from Disney?

150
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
This is one of the longest stretches I've made it.

151
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I think I'm almost at five months.

152
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
My God.

153
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah. I've had others where I said I was going to take the year off and then I broke it four months, but I'm up to five.

154
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
This is odd.

155
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I guess it's odd to be saying on it.

156
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm treating this like it's sobriety, but I'm talking about taking time off from Disneyland.

157
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
On my Disneyland oriented podcast.

158
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah.

159
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Well, in all fairness, you are the only one currently with a universal pass, though.

160
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Hey, yeah.

161
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So I'm representing in another area and that's come in handy during our many, many city walk trips that well, that's where we're going out of order in the timeline.

162
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But when was Jason, when was the last time you didn't have a Disneyland pass?

163
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
2010.

164
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You've renewed consistently the whole time?

165
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Or 2011. Yeah.

166
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So you've had one continuous for seven years.

167
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yes, pretty much.

168
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm trying to think.

169
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And at a certain point, it just became like, well, they got rid of my tier, so I have to keep renewing.

170
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Like this year I was hemming and hawing and then I feel like I was just like, I may as well do it still.

171
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That's true. You were threatening me.

172
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You were saying you might not get a pass, but then you did it anyway.

173
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You must have been terrified for that.

174
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yeah, I was horrified because yeah.

175
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I honestly think I'm the only, I've had one continuously except for like a month in 2014.

176
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Wow.

177
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Or a couple months, maybe like two months in 2014.

178
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Wow.

179
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So you know, I think I actually did all of, I think I took all of 2016 off.

180
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:32,000
2016 was, you know, everybody was having those hell years and I was doing it to save money and which made sense on paper.

181
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But I started to realize I'd be much happier during this awful political and celebrity death laden hellscape that was 2016.

182
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I think Disney would have tempered the whole thing.

183
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So I was wrong in 2016.

184
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I shouldn't put these boundaries on myself.

185
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But you hear about these temperatures and it's like, yeah, I'm, I don't think I'm, I'm going to try to make it to September, October.

186
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Okay.

187
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Because there's going to be a hike.

188
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
That's what the rumors are.

189
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I want to tell everybody out there, if you don't have a pass and you're thinking about getting a pass, but head of Star Wars land, the rumor is, and it's not coming from ferriswheel.net.

190
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's coming from a different website, a different podcaster.

191
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The bumper car boys.

192
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The bumper car boys have, Jason, I'm fine.

193
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Thank you for saying it.

194
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
We love their podcasts.

195
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Remember it's a dash between bumper and car, but not boys.

196
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
They made it as confusing of a URL as possible.

197
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
No bumper car boys. One word is like a weird proud boys called right off.

198
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So you got to make sure to distinguish between them somehow.

199
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
They're legally both allowed to exist.

200
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's weird.

201
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's weird. Yeah.

202
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Those are people who hit their enemies with bottom of the.

203
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Oh yeah.

204
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
They're the people trying to pass the, uh, they mow over their cars.

205
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
If you are crossing in front of an on ramp or something, they're awful, but bumper dash car boys.

206
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
No dash.

207
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Yeah, they're great.

208
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And their rumor is of course that soon there's going to be a substantial price.

209
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Like in annual passes, uh, I had to start to try to root even more people out before star wars land comes,

210
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
which is probably going to soft open before may cause they have to test stuff out.

211
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But even when star wars land opens, we're not sure about which passes we'll be able to get.

212
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Sure. They could block all of them out.

213
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I mean, they're talking about, they've already announced, haven't they?

214
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Like one park blackouts where it's like, oh, you can't come to Disneyland.

215
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You can go to California.

216
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah. I do think though, depending on when you like, like right now, whatever it says on the maps, you you're getting that.

217
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I don't think they can like block out like new, new dates.

218
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Like they've already sort of, they can, they have to me.

219
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Well, I know they can restrict stuff, but you're saying they can.

220
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I, when I had family come out to visit in 2015, we're like, let's, uh, uh, we'll plan to go to the park these days.

221
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I was looking at my blackout calendar and that was like five months out.

222
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And then the week before they came, I went, oh, I'm apparently blacked out on Sunday.

223
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
The first day you came here.

224
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Are you sure you didn't make a mistake?

225
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Uh, no, I didn't because what happened was hyperspace mountain opened all that star wars crap.

226
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
All that, uh, they would do it for that.

227
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
They blacked out. That was like the soft opening day.

228
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So I bought like a one day.

229
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I know they can restrict it if all of a sudden the, like the park is too crowded.

230
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Like, like if it gets capacity, the fire marshal will literally say no more.

231
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You can't commit.

232
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yeah. If you follow them on Twitter, you can see when the parking garages are.

233
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I think in general, whatever the schedule is now, the day you buy your pass, that is, that should be okay.

234
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
They're not going to change.

235
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's not legally binding.

236
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That's fair enough.

237
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
The fine print says we can, you know, change these conditions at any time.

238
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's not like.

239
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yes, that's true.

240
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I mean, if it's truly insane, I'm just saying that I think you'll probably get an approximation of whatever it is.

241
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The day you buy it and they can change it going forward and make alterations to like even the same level of pass.

242
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Like if you buy it two weeks from now, it'll be way more money and there could be a different set of things attached to it.

243
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Cause like they will grandfather certain things in like, like photo pass and stuff.

244
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
If you had it before on your tier, but then they get rid of it, you still get grandfathered in.

245
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So that's what I'm saying.

246
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The nature of this draconian rule set.

247
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:22,000
This is all this I'm going to continue what might be my, maybe I'm the villain of the podcast or something for even presenting controversial ideas like this.

248
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
There's a part of me that wants to not go to star wars.

249
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What for a while, huh?

250
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Doesn't it seem like it's going to be hellish?

251
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It does.

252
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yeah.

253
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It seems like society, the rules of polite society may break down.

254
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It seems like it would be as lawless as the actual outer rims are in the star wars universe.

255
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You were talking about the outer rims of the planet Batuu?

256
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yeah.

257
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Of course I was talking about Batuu.

258
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Okay. I just wanted to make sure we were talking about Batuu.

259
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I feel like I think this isn't the first time we've had this exact exchange where you say Batuu and I go, of course I'm talking about Batuu.

260
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That may have been in our real life, but I don't think it's been on the air.

261
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Maybe that's what it is.

262
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I think that the thing with Star Wars land is they're going to, the hellish part of it would be waiting to get in because I don't think they're going to let more people.

263
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Everyone into the part, into the land.

264
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So I think that the hellish thing is going to be standing outside in frontier land or over in critter country waiting to get in, in the heat with a bunch of cranky people because there's going to have to be lines.

265
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
There were like lines when Harry Potter opened, there would be our way just to step foot in the land.

266
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't think they're going to let it be the case where you're just like shoulder to shoulder in the land and it's a nightmare.

267
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I think they're only going to let an amount of people that's at least somewhat manageable in there.

268
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
But what if there was a place you could wait with all your friends from the Pixar universe?

269
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Sure. You mean strategically opened a year before to try to be like, well, you know, Star Wars land isn't open, but we have a new area open last year.

270
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:03,000
An entirely new that is it is not thin soup of a of a theme park land.

271
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It is hearty, robust, minestrone.

272
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
There's so much in here. A lot of nutrients.

273
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
There's a lot and it all opened on time. It all opened.

274
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh, wait, no, wait, three things are not open yet.

275
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And then there's a whole but oh, God, they're calling it something.

276
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
OK, that makes their entire right to build yet.

277
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Yeah. Well, it then any hopefully in a year it'll be all open when they're telling this potential Star Wars land person.

278
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So in case people I mean, I think people listening might not know this full set of theories.

279
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And I think that's absolutely right. I think this if you've been wondering what is up with this Pixar appeared thing, because I feel like I've talked to some slightly invested theme park fans who are who don't

280
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
who are are confused about. So there's a new Incredibles coaster. Right.

281
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Now it's a rethemed. So there's a new Pixar land. No, it's kind of a rethemed.

282
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's what was there already. And if you've been wondering what's the deal with this,

283
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:12,000
that's certainly the working theory that they are trying to throw whatever they can to attract people over to California Adventure to ease the what will be a hellish burden.

284
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yes. In the Star Wars area, Disneyland.

285
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So real quick, as you're saying this, I had the realization because I have a park map in front of me from the opening weekend of Pixar Pier.

286
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And usually I don't have an actual map in front of me. And one of the things I was wondering about because how to say this.

287
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So Pixar Pier did not just replace Paradise Pier entirely.

288
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It replaced Paradise Pier up to like the silly Symphony Swings. And unless I'm wrong, which I could very well be the the rest of that area with like the Zephyr and the corn dog castle and even up to little

289
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:11,000
goofy sky school and Little Mermaid is now called Paradise Gardens Park. Did you guys know that? Not until this morning. I saw it in an L.A. Times article and would have missed it otherwise. And you know, you were there and you didn't know until you literally looked at a map.

290
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah. The famous area Paradise Gardens Park of the California Adventure. It's presented on the same level as Cars Land. Yeah. These are equal lands. Cars Land Paradise Garden Park.

291
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But I just assumed it was going to be like this is Pixar Pier and this other stuff is here, but we're not going to talk about that.

292
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:42,000
This whole thing is so strange and sloppy. What did they really do? The Incredicoaster is now they took something that was not Pixar themed and now it is.

293
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But then the the Mickey the wheel, the Ferris wheel. Mickey's fun. Formerly Mickey's fun wheel. Mickey's fun. It still has Mickey on it. Yeah. But now it's called what? The Pixar Pal-Around. Got it.

294
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:16,000
What are the worst names? Awful. Pixar Pal-Around is a ride where lots of you sit in a car themed after one of your favorite Pixar pals and all the Pixar pals rotate around the center of the Pixar universe.

295
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Mickey. What's going on? What is this? This is terrible. If hey, I'm a guy who goes to the theme parks for the theming, as you know, I'm a wimp. I don't go for rock for G forces and thrills.

296
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I go for theming. So if I'm going to go to a place that's about theming, what is this shit theming? Yeah. I here's what I the feeling I get.

297
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And I don't know this. I didn't see this on any of those websites, but I get the sense that this was like last second. This is a last second thing.

298
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
They announced this at D23 last year, and I think we can tell it's last second because we didn't hear any rumors about it.

299
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:09,000
All of a sudden they're like, and next year, Pixar Pier coming. And usually when something big happens, we've heard a little rumbling on one of those websites we were mentioning before. There was some feeling of like, oh, something's coming.

300
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:21,000
This was totally new. So I have a feeling like it was a last second decision. We got to do something. There was a limited budget here. Yeah. Let's make this happen in six because they closed everything in January.

301
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yeah, they turned it around fast and you can tell in places that this was a fast job and there's stuff that doesn't make sense. The Mickey thing clearly to me is like people love that Mickey Mouse Ferris wheel. Yeah.

302
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:51,000
People like it more than the terrifying baby son they used to adorn. The rosacea cheeked sun cherub that used to be in the center of the Ferris wheel. It was signaling everyone's death.

303
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You would see something like that in a nightmare where you were about to die. It's a ring face. Yes. Yeah.

304
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I remember hearing someone. What was the other? Oh, yeah. Mickey and the sun wheel, the old sun wheel. But there used to be the Mickey thing in the roller coaster loop, right? Didn't there used to be Mickey ears? Yeah.

305
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Kind of abstract Mickey ears kind of with an epic. That was a first Earth on the roller coaster. Yeah. Yeah. I like that. I kind of miss that a couple years ago. I was at the park and I heard a guest ask a cast member. Hey, what? Why? Why come the Mickey ears aren't on the roller coaster?

306
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And I was like, that's been I was just like, wow, people really like seeing Mickey at play because I was like, that's been gone for years. And people are still like, oh, why did you get rid of that? I like that. So I kind of understand why they left Mickey on the Ferris wheel, even though it doesn't make any sense.

307
00:26:49,000 --> 00:27:07,000
No, I thought. Well, I mean, what would they have done? Would they have replaced Mickey with John Lasseter? Yes. I mean, God damn it. Look, I when I was over there, I said that same thing to my girlfriend. I said, well, who would they ever place me with? John Lasseter's face. Was that the idea?

308
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The dictator of Pixar. Yeah. Power mad. I recently resigned and disgraced. Yes. I it's a screen, though. Mickey thing is a screen. What? I'm pretty sure it can change colors at least for the world.

309
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Oh, yes, they project on it. And that's another thing. That's another funny thing I found out about. They took this time while the pier is closed to like do work on the fountains and stuff and damage them. Why? So it's going to take even longer to get World of Color back up and running.

310
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Has it not been for a while? It's not been running for a while. And this map, I think, probably printed in advance about like these attractions close early due to World of Color. I don't think World of Color is in sight anytime soon because they have the paint the night parade going here.

311
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Yes. So that's it. It's all it's all diversions. He's gaslighting us left and right. It's Pixar Fest now going on as well at the whole resort, which is different than Pixar. It's always good to have two new things with one similar word.

312
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So Pixar. Yeah. So Pixar Fest is happening and they moved the parade. They moved the Pixar Play Parade to Disneyland, which is the parade that was always at California Adventure. And then they moved paint the night to California back to the other park.

313
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:42,000
So for Pixar Fest, Pixar Play moved from the place where Pixar Pier is. Yes. Now it's in Disneyland. But Pixar Fest is happening at both parks, not just Pixar Pier Park. Oh, so Pixar Play Parade is at Disneyland.

314
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:56,000
But the new Incredibles float is in Paint the Night, which is at California Adventure. So the new float in the parade is in Paint the Night, but is not in the Pixar Play Parade. There's no new float in Pixar Play Parade, which is in Disneyland, not in California Adventure.

315
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It's still an unpleasant parade. There's a little bit of blood coming out of Scott's ear. I don't know what that is. I'm one more name. I'm one more Pixar, some more Pixar plaza away from falling on the ground and seizureing.

316
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Let's just slow down. I will just say the names of the things we said and you will tell us where they are. Pixar Pier is where? California Adventure. Great. Disney California Adventure, which doesn't have an apostrophe or an S, damn it.

317
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:37,000
That's right. Pixar Play Parade is where? It was in Disney California Adventure and now it's in Disneyland Park. Uh huh. But Pixar Fest is where? It is in both parks. That's correct. Disneyland Resort. Resort wide.

318
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Where's the new Incredibles float?

319
00:29:43,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I think it's a trick. So I think it's in the in the Paint the Night parade. See you know all of it. I'm following you. Paradise Gardens Park famously is the non-Pixar related area. And of course, Paradise Pier Hotel has not been renamed. Oh God, I forgot about the hotel.

320
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It's still, it's still, there's a hotel named after a part of the park that no longer exists. Pixar Pier, Paradise Pier Hotel, Paradise Gardens Park. What's going on? Disney. This is the loudest I've gotten on the podcast ever. Feel free to check my levels.

321
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I'm upset. I gotta check. Oh yeah. This is what's supposed to be sending me to Disneyland for the summer braving the hottest temperature ever recorded. It's like much, much hotter than the opening day where women's heels melted into the concrete. I'm supposed to go there now to see all of these confusing pea brands.

322
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Coffee spilled. It's coming apart. In all fairness, it's also supposed to distract you a year from now when you are waiting to get into what could be the most immersive themed experience ever created. It better be after all this shit.

323
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You're supposed to be waiting in line for the Incredicoaster while eating, you know, an angry dog, which is a spicy corn dog now available. Those brands are clear at least. Do you, well, okay. You guys went. We went on the Sunday after it opened.

324
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Just to to just stemming from angry dog, which is themed after the anger Lewis Black character from Inside Out. Would you guys like to talk about the food, which me having not been, it seems like from the sound of it, maybe the Pixar Pier food is one of the more successful elements of Pixar Pier.

325
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Yeah, we can do that. So, yeah, let's build to the Incredicoaster. So the food. So I had an angry dog. It was a spicy hot dog and I liked it. It's a little stand.

326
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:12,000
But here's the thing with the food, all the food. I feel like there's some catches. So the angry dogs, the little stand, they have like a big like I've been they served it to you with flaming hot Cheetos fries, which are kind of like Andy caps hot fries, not flaming hot Cheetos flaming hot Cheetos fries.

327
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I don't know if we are dusting the.

328
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
But not french fries. It's like a bag like a bag of chips.

329
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Essentially, so you're saying it's it's confusing theming that doesn't let you know what you're actually getting.

330
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Much like the land you're getting them in.

331
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So, but I think it's clever. Oh, it's a hot. It's a spicy hot dog spicy chips.

332
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Sir, but what are they fries? They're not for like they're hot Cheetos.

333
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
They're like hot Cheetos, but they're shaped like fries.

334
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Like the Andy caps hot fries. Do you guys eat Andy caps hot fries?

335
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Jason is referencing a comic strip character, Andy Cap from 1950s. What? It's a snack food.

336
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I know it is. I'm just saying that where adventure in the world.

337
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Jason's family bought in the 1950s a stockpile of Andy Cap hot fries and he's been eating them.

338
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
This is another one of my weird regional things.

339
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Anyway, so you so you get the spicy food and then there's a big condiment and it's they got ketchup and spicy ketchup, mustard and spicy mustard like buffalo salt.

340
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So but here's the thing. So there's this row of like condiment dispensers to like customize your hot dog.

341
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It is directly next to a standing bar where you can like stand for a couple minutes and eat your hot dog.

342
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
But they share the same like physical spit.

343
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
So like as people are trying to quickly get in and out and dress their dog, there's also people lingering to stay.

344
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:46,000
So it's just like, wait, how did you this is like if you put a wall on that standing bar, then people can only stand on one side and then you would clear.

345
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Like it's a weird logistical thing.

346
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And Jason, you're using your mark. You have your Marcus Limonis helmet on right now and I appreciate it.

347
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I would be shaking his head and crossing his arms.

348
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Well, real hard about this came up again at Jack Jack's Cookie Num Num, which is I I'm still trying to process my feelings on Jack Jack's Cookie Num Nums.

349
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Mike, you've been to Jack Jack's twice now.

350
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Jack Jack's what? Yeah, Jack Jack's Cookie Num Num, which is they you know, it's a part of the narrative on the ride.

351
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And then at the end of the ride, you get to in the movie, in the movie as well.

352
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And then you can go to Pixar Pier and get a Jack Jack's Cookie Num Num.

353
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Yeah. So it's a cookies and milk stand, which is kind of clever.

354
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I again, that's an interesting idea. Sure.

355
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It's an interesting idea to have cookies and milk in the park.

356
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I feel like they don't have like a designated cookies and milk like experience.

357
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Well, you're saying that you can get cookies and milk in the park everywhere, except they don't have it dedicated together in one stand.

358
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So, yes, that is a new thing, I guess. So I have been you pulled it off, everybody.

359
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So so I went down with you and we had a few things.

360
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And I will also I will reveal this. I follow the Disney Parks blog on Twitter.

361
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And what that means is that sometimes they have opportunities for, you know, one hundred and fifty to two hundred people to sign up and get a free special event.

362
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And of course, I have my Twitter set to give me an alert when a tweet happens from the Disney Parks blog.

363
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
So I can get first dibs on something like a crazy experience for free.

364
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
You you switched out your Amber Alerts that alerts you to a kidnapped child.

365
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And now your phone vibrates and sirens at you when there's a Disney Parks blog event.

366
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It's it's exactly the same. There's a new candy apple, Michael. Get down here.

367
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:53,000
And candy apple. So I was driving a car and I saw an alert in this. I swear to God, I was at a light.

368
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I looked down, alert, an alert popped up and it said Pixar Pier Meetup.

369
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I grabbed my phone, hit the button. It went right to like put in your email. I didn't even see what the event was, what the day was.

370
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I didn't care. I know you got to move fast on one of these things.

371
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Put my email in and submit it and said, you've been accepted to the Pixar Pier Meetup. And I was like, great. I'll see what the date was later.

372
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:23,000
And of course, it was July 2nd. Collided with an elderly woman crossing the street. James Dean's spider.

373
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It was worth it, though, for that free event that I got to go to. And I went with Lindsay.

374
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I did not take either of my co-hosts to this event. I apologize, but sometimes I have to, you know, take the woman that is my significant other.

375
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Sometimes. Much to Jason's chagrin. Jason was probably upset with me. Thanks for nothing, Dad.

376
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
He thinks of me as a father figure. I know that. I hate you, Dad.

377
00:36:51,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So we went down and they do these like I really shouldn't tell the audiences because people are going to now set alerts for Disney Parks blog.

378
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And it's going to be even harder to get a reservation to someplace like this. And I've done this a couple of times.

379
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,000
So you so basically we go in at 730. They give you a free admission to California Adventure, which is amazing, which I did not need.

380
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
But like you get free admission. Wait, if you sign up for this thing, you get the park for free.

381
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Well, depending on what time the event is. But yeah, for like it's starting at 730. You got just free admission to California Adventure.

382
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
After four or five. So you get like. Oh, it's a limited amount of time. That's how long I like to go for.

383
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But the one I did in 2014 was early in the morning and it was free.

384
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And that's when I didn't have a pass just kind of coincidentally. And it was for all day at Disneyland.

385
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Like we had a whole free day and they gave us a bunch of free stuff. This will be this.

386
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:51,000
This system is over because you talked about it. They say you won't hear this and they will end it by day's end of this.

387
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I really I should just cut this out. Just mute a couple of the words on parks or blog.

388
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And if you heard a bleep for either of those, you know which one we settled on.

389
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So so this particular event, we went at 730. They give you we got like we got free stuff, which is crazy when you go to Disney because you don't get free stuff that often.

390
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:23,000
We got free. I'm showing the showing you guys. We got free Pixar Fest years with Edna and the mode on one ear and Jack Jack on the other.

391
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And then you kind of kind of the buddies, the buddy duo of the new movie.

392
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
So that's very, that's very cute. Their partnership. Yes.

393
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And so so they they the event basically was like, hey, here's here's free reservations to paint the night parade, which we did not go to.

394
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Then we went because we went to the new restaurant.

395
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Also, the back of these hats has the silhouettes of some of the Pixar characters and they all take me a sec to figure out.

396
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Especially this splat over this mustard stain over on the far right. Can you even tell what that is?

397
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I mean, I think you'll get it from here. I can't.

398
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I think it is one of the other fish. I want to say it's Nemo, but it could also be my dad.

399
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Yeah, that it's even in question. Nemo's Nemo's.

400
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I think it's friends. So Pixar Fest is about celebrating friendship and beyond. So it's Woody and Buzz, Doug and boy and Dory and adult manfish.

401
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So for the celebration of friendship, you chose to go with your girlfriend instead of your best bro, Jason.

402
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Yeah, he betrayed the sentiments of the hat.

403
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
You fool. I know. I'm sorry.

404
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Also, I set you up to talk about Jack Jack's Cookie Num Nums, not to write an Iliad-like story about.

405
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Well, I have to explain how I got to experience two different type of Jack Jack's Cookie Num Nums.

406
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So, yeah. So all I'm saying is that there's this event. We got to see Imagineers talk about Pixar Pier and then what they did.

407
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And I'll show you. I have the remnants of it is that we got a lanyard that had like a little tab on it for a free each thing that they have at Pixar Fest, a free Jack Jack's Cookie Num Num.

408
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:26,000
But not in Paradise Gardens Park. No, no. So I'm saying I got to do. I had a Jack Jack's Cookie Num Num with you.

409
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And then when at this event, I got to try the shortbread cookie as well. Yeah, that's really what I was leading to.

410
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So, I mean, the Jack, the classic Jack Jack's Cookie Num Num, the word classic.

411
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
You used to refer to something that is two weeks old. It's a deep dish chocolate chip cookie served warm.

412
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Brown butter chocolate chip cookie, I believe, as well.

413
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Brown butter, I think that's right. Yeah. And more like a chocolate chunk cookie, I should say. It's chunks, not chips.

414
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I'm a big chocolate chip cookie guy. I thought it was delicious. I love that it's an option in the park. Not terribly expensive.

415
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:11,000
But to put my Marcus Lemotis hat on, there were some problems with Jack Jack's Cookie Num Nums and kind of Paradise Pier at large.

416
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Pixar Pier? Sorry, Pixar Pier. See, this is a nightmare.

417
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
It is literally a stand right after you after you get off the roller coaster.

418
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And the queue is just stand next to the roller coaster. There's no and there's no shade as far as the eye can see.

419
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So it was I think it was only like 80 degrees or something when you and I were there waiting in line for Cookie Num Nums.

420
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
But what which Jack Jack's Cookie Num Num? Sorry, sorry to confuse you.

421
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
So we are sitting and there's not a cloud in the sky.

422
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:59,000
We are sitting just just in the raw Orange County sun to be sweating to then be served a hot Cookie Num Num.

423
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And the beverage object Jack Jack's Cookie Num Num.

424
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:09,000
The beverage options at this cart are milk or milk substitutes.

425
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Strawberry milk, which is what I got.

426
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Strawberry milk. Yeah.

427
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Both times, by the way.

428
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
So you're saying milk was a bad choice.

429
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Yeah. So I'm saying yeah.

430
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
As the funny guy in your office says too much, milk was a bad choice.

431
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And you get your choice of milk, interestingly, to paraphrase Ron Burgundy on this on this land.

432
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Yes, choice of cookie and one milk offering.

433
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Yeah. Yeah. I got a milk.

434
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Well, both Lindsay and I got a lanyard too.

435
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
So we both got a milk offering.

436
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
We've got a different milk.

437
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Your lanyard got you a milk offering from locale 1B from the Disney dining Pixar Parks blog. God, I can't.

438
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I'm getting dyslexia from this episode.

439
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I can't my brain can't retain any more dull specifics.

440
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Yeah, there's too many in this episode.

441
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I'm so sorry to some of the listeners.

442
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
We'll provide a transcript.

443
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
We'll write it all out.

444
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Mike, when you and I were there, did we also wait like 25 minutes for Jack Jack's Cookie Nums?

445
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
It felt like a while.

446
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It was a while. I mean, this is also one of the first weekends.

447
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
So people were very excited to try it.

448
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,000
So, yeah, but it was a while and it was in the heat and the cookie I thought was good.

449
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
It was good. It's probably the best of all the new things they have there.

450
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Yeah.

451
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Is it amazing? Is it a revelation? Is it as good as a Pizzucchi from BJ's?

452
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I don't think it is.

453
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And I think it probably costs as much.

454
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I'm sure it does cost as much.

455
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
And I understand you can't get like a give everyone a hot skillet.

456
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
No, no, you don't want a hot skillet.

457
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Because if you don't know it, this wonderful chain restaurant called BJ's is like a hot skillet cookie with some ice cream on top.

458
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And it's delicious. It's the best hot cookie I've ever had.

459
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I think it's a superior num num.

460
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Yeah, it's a better num num than Jack Jack's cookie num nums.

461
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So we stood in the hot sun to eat warm cookies and cold ish milk.

462
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Here's the whole milk offerings.

463
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
But like put some umbrellas in that line.

464
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Like it's the it's it's going to be summer for a while.

465
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And then my other thing about Jack Jack's cookie num nums, as you are finally getting to get your cookie num num,

466
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:43,000
you've got a great view of this industrial pipe covered in tape right above the the queue.

467
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Yeah, there's a lot. So yeah.

468
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:53,000
So this is no shot at the Imagineers or anything, but it's clear that this time wise was such a crunch that everything is not finished.

469
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
They had a deadline before they had an assessment of what they had to build.

470
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:03,000
The roller coaster could have used a full repaint, just the white part of the roller coaster.

471
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Like some of that looks like it's old.

472
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
So you're I mean, the fish stinks from the head down here.

473
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It's not there's I'm sure a lot of good Imagineers worked hard on this thing.

474
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
And I saw them talk about what they had to achieve in a short amount of time.

475
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:26,000
And probably with Imagineering staff all over the map with all of the projects going on globally.

476
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
You know, maybe they didn't get to give all the love to Pixar Pier that they that they should have.

477
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Yes, I think that we would never blame Imagineers, the hardworking, the workers that maybe had to paint and had to do all this stuff.

478
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Yeah, I would lay the blame solely at the feet of Bob Chapek, head of parks and resorts.

479
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Oh, you know, he's the one who gave them a deadline and gave them an amount of money and gave.

480
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
He's the guy that obviously put all this stuff in place and maybe it was impossible.

481
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Maybe didn't give enough, you know, like people and man hours.

482
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,000
And but you're we're still fishing for more free stuff and early access to things.

483
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
And yet we're calling out Bob Chapek specifically.

484
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I think that Bob, if he's a businessman, he respects that we have the balls to do this and that he that he knows we're watching him.

485
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And out of respect, Bob Chapek will say, well, I don't always agree with these theme park journalists, but we need them to cover and keep me honest.

486
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
That's what I'm hoping, at least.

487
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:30,000
So with that said, just to remind her, the adorable snowman frosted treats, lemon ice is dog shit.

488
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
That's wrong, by the way. It's not dog shit. That's wrong.

489
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
It's bad.

490
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
It's not bad.

491
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Guys, Jason, make your argument and Mike, make your rebuttal.

492
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
All right, Jason, you go first.

493
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
It's bad and it upset me and I don't want to have it again.

494
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Great argument, Mike.

495
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Well, I liked it and I thought it tasted pretty good.

496
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
What?

497
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Yes, it was tart. It was a little too tart.

498
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I'll tell you this, though.

499
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
It's less tart than when you had it, because, again, I've had it twice now.

500
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I had the regular cone with the tart ice cream and then the white chocolate dip, which is very minuscule amount of white chocolate.

501
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:13,000
But then I got the full one that has the tart new soft serve and that blue slush crap in it.

502
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And I thought that the ice cream itself was less tart.

503
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Now, I think they made a bit of an adjustment the day we were there.

504
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Maybe they had the machine set to like 75 percent tart and that was too much.

505
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
And now it's maybe down to 50 and it's much better.

506
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
It's a much more to again put on the phrase.

507
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I'm invoking the Marcus helmet.

508
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
You only get one chance with most consumers.

509
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Most people make their decision the first time around.

510
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:46,000
And, you know, though though, I do want to hold Jason to the standard of theme park journalism where he has to go back and eat a dessert.

511
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,000
He didn't like another time to make sure that the machine is running more efficiently this time around.

512
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Most people, most regular folks are not going to do that.

513
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
And you got to set your you're going to set your tartometer correctly the first time.

514
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
That's why you have to have the proper process in place and the right people and the right people.

515
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:12,000
The best product that's probably can't see at Pixar Pier or Paradise Gardens Park.

516
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Now, now that you said that and I am likely more forgiving than the average consumer, maybe I'll give it another shot.

517
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
But I'll try that eight dollar option with a bunch of blue crap.

518
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
That's what I had. And I had a complimentary because of the Pixar Pier meetup.

519
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
But even the day when we had it, that it was a little too tart, I still didn't think it was dog shit.

520
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Dog shit is maybe some other another thing I had.

521
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Oh, well, I don't say I wouldn't say dog shit.

522
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I don't use language like that when I'm describing this stuff.

523
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:51,000
But you didn't like the dog's dog shit.

524
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Just call it worms and dirt guys. Worms and dirt has worked for 30 years.

525
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
It's just a bowl of the reinvent. Just a bowl of beans.

526
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Doug's dog. It costs 1250.

527
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I'll say I didn't love the angry dog, Jason. No.

528
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
And here's here's what I'll say. And I'm not trying to play one up.

529
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I'm not trying to get back at you for what you just did to the adorable Stoneman's Frosted Treats, Dan.

530
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:30,000
But the angry dog, it's nothing. It's not it's it's it's the laziest thing I think on the pier.

531
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It's it's just like I'm like a mildly spicy hot dog, but it looks just like a hot dog I got when I played soccer when I was in third grade.

532
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I'm not saying it's a revelatory. I'm just saying it's a nice it's a nice step up from the default Disney hot dog.

533
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
But it's like a little more a little more so just the basic boring hot dog.

534
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Like, as I said to Lindsay, I said, you know what they need? They need like a bun or something.

535
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:59,000
They need something like fun, like like a like a cheddar, like habanero or jalapeno bun, a poofier bun.

536
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Don't make this look like everything is just like tinfoil crammed hot dog that you would like somebody would grill up for a bunch of kids after they played sports.

537
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Oh, no, go ahead. No, I mean, I think that's great. I think the resort wide, they need kind of a bun upgrade for hamburgers and hot dogs.

538
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Now, I agree. Now, finally, we can come together here and agree that resort wide a bun upgrade is necessary.

539
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:34,000
These buns look soggy. They look cheap. I don't think it would take more than a couple cents to do a puffier bun that made this feel more like a meal.

540
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,000
It can dress up the fact that it's a cheap hot dog. I would pay an extra 50 cents for a brioche.

541
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
OK, I feel like brioche are once you start seeing brioche at like McDonald's and Burger King, it's ubiquitous.

542
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
There's a way to churn it out in large quantities and cheap. Yeah.

543
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Scott, have you ever noticed that the buns are lacking at the Disneyland Resort?

544
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I have to admit my hot dog intake has increased, has decreased significantly since my childhood.

545
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:10,000
However, I appreciate your passion on it. And I think this is a good use of the extra profit that Disney has lying around.

546
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:19,000
So I'm going to say number one, get those buns better. Number two, try to raise rates for Disney minimum wage employees.

547
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,000
But let's let first things first, the bun issue. It's easier with the bun to get the buns up, I think.

548
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:31,000
So, yeah, do take care of the buns and then get around to paying everyone more than nine dollars an hour.

549
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Yeah, so make more profits from the better buns. Right. The word is going to spread.

550
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,000
We're going to once the buns are fixed, we'll get on here. We will tell our audience they did it.

551
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Thank you, Bob Chapek, for listening and paying attention. I mean, at least we're past the wheat bun phase.

552
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I feel like there was a time where like the burgers and hot dogs all came on like like wheat bread is the thing of the moment.

553
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
And like even Disney tried it. And it's just like, oh, this is terrible.

554
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Like this is yeah, wheat buns are not significantly different.

555
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:13,000
This is a side issue. But the only time a year really I have a hot dog is that is at the Los Angeles Open Golf Tournament,

556
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
which I go to with my dad every year at the Riviera Country Club.

557
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And the hot dog situation there is aggressively poor. Food lines also in the sun, unshaded, that go back and back,

558
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:35,000
that take half an hour of time that you could be watching golfers like Jordan Spieth make or possibly miss putts.

559
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:42,000
So if anyone listening has any influence on the Los Angeles Open Golf Tournament, just go back to the it used to be hot dogs.

560
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:49,000
You just grabbed out of a tray and then went and paid twelve dollars for let's go back to that.

561
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Now, that's a sidetrack. But if we're if this episode is going to be full of hot dog passion, then I feel like I should probably convey mine.

562
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Is the would you say that that that the whatever that is the golf tournament? Do they need a bun upgrade?

563
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Absolutely. The buns are the buns have been weak for a long time and I've watched it happen for like I've gone every year since the early 90s.

564
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And I've watched I think there's been a much sharper decline in bun quality than in hot dog, the hot dog quality than Frank quality, I guess you would say.

565
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
He's getting sad, sadder. No, I mean, it's a low standard of excellence for hot dog.

566
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Go to like a grocery store and you buy a pack of hot dogs, you buy a pack of buns, you go into a barbecue like those buns are like a dollar.

567
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Yes. And it's not it's it's you just need something to hold the hot dog and toppings. That's really what you want.

568
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Yeah. And the presentation is what I'm talking about, too. It's just wrapped like give me a little something.

569
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Put it not in the tin foil, but give it in a little paper tray. Those little recyclable paper trays that makes it look nice. The impression of an upgraded product.

570
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I want optics to be better on this, too. You know, it's funny.

571
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:07,000
There's been that naked burger trend for a long time. We get and get it in a lettuce wrap instead of a bun.

572
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,000
This has never been desired for a hot dog. No one has ever wanted a naked hot dog.

573
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:18,000
And maybe if you found a way to wrap it in a pickle, but there's no way for the pickle to not overpower the hold on.

574
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I got to see you. Wait a minute.

575
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Draw out your concepts. Maybe this maybe this pickle spiral will end up looking appealing.

576
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I think that's actually a good idea. I kind of like it. Yeah.

577
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
How do you hold it together? You got to fuse it together. There's got to be some fondant equivalent.

578
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I'm picturing like a full dill pickle that you cut a triangle out of and you put the hot dog in that.

579
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Now, that functions as a bond. But again, you're getting pickle on three sides and hot dog only on one.

580
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:50,000
But then it really is a pickle that happens to have a hot dog in it, which sounds terrible.

581
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:02,000
If there's some spiral that where it's like it's like a shish kebab situation with a wedge of pickle, a wedge of pepper, a wedge of tomato.

582
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
That's delightful. Yeah.

583
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I think we're developing an interesting. We're still workshopping in here, but this some like hot dog spiral notion.

584
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

585
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Well, we'll start working that out and we'll announce our plans in future episodes.

586
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,000
That would be great for Pixar because the hot dog is friends with the pickle. He's friends with the peppers.

587
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Friends with the tomato. That's the sort of upgraded product you want at a Pixar pier. Yeah, that's true.

588
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:36,000
So this is friendship and beyond. We're celebrating the friendship between hot dogs and condiments and then and beyond what could be on mean.

589
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
We're the only ones brave enough to imagine it.

590
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,000
We'll have we'll have these out for you guys to purchase before we have T-shirts.

591
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
We're going to get into the hot dog game.

592
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Are we going to mail these to people as this business going to work? That's a good question.

593
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
We'll figure that out. We'll call. We haven't talked.

594
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:59,000
We have to talk about to what is this? We haven't you know, we haven't talked about is the fucking roller coaster.

595
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
There's actually a lot more to talk about before we get to the roller coaster.

596
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:08,000
So I'm not rushing to get there. I'm just saying if fans might be thinking any listeners might be thinking.

597
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I mean, I think it's clearly like the thing of the land.

598
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
So probably best to build as I said, senior buzzes churros.

599
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:23,000
How were they? You had one. OK, so saying your buzzes churros again got them complimentary because of the Pixar appear meetup.

600
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Lindsay got a normal churro, just cinnamon sugar.

601
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
These are giant, too. I mean, you've seen these at the party.

602
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
These are not small churros. These are like a foot long.

603
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I got the red hot churro because I had to try the silliest one.

604
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,000
And that is literally like a churro just dipped in red hots, the candy red hots.

605
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
It's bright neon red and it is good.

606
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
It is fun for half of it. It's fun for half of it.

607
00:56:53,000 --> 00:57:02,000
But it's a lot if you like it's honestly I liked it better than the hot dog, which I was expecting to hate it because I was like this is I don't really.

608
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Red hots are kind of good, but this is a lot happening.

609
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I would say high praise talking about the blue crap. The abominable snow treats are better because it has blue crap.

610
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Yeah, the blue crap was fine. Red hots are kind of good.

611
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Yeah. So so I would say the red hots would be good. Share it.

612
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:29,000
It's a fun novelty if you have a significant other or one of your best pals, you know, start in the middle.

613
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
It's just it's a lot. It's a lot of sugary.

614
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I think it's a fun idea, though, in the senior buzz is a fun little thing from Toy Story 3.

615
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I'll say this though. So and it's named after him.

616
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:48,000
So yes. Let's say this senior buzz churro stand is the worst themed stand there.

617
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
It's flat. It looks like it's just like kind of drawn on.

618
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:58,000
It doesn't have any like like, for instance, angry dogs has anger from inside out and it's a 3D little version of him.

619
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Oh, it's good. Yeah. And it's got, yeah, is like steam coming out in a big hot dog over his brain,

620
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:12,000
which is like if you saw a picture of what Jason is thinking about most of the day, it would look similar to this.

621
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:19,000
So, yeah, you will post a picture of it. But this the stand is by far the weakest stand.

622
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,000
It looks pretty cheap. Again, not blaming the Imagineers for it. They're wonderful people.

623
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:34,000
No, but I was going to say the I think the nicest stand theme wise, I have not eaten yet.

624
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
And you have a comically long story about why you have not eaten there.

625
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
The poultry palace, right? It looks like a little takeout box.

626
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,000
So, yes, it's still kind of thematically doesn't fit with the land, which is all kind of like Victorian.

627
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,000
And like also there's this cartoon box of chicken just sitting in the middle of there.

628
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
That is at least something kind of elaborate. What does this have to do with Pixar?

629
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Oh, yeah, it's from from something movie.

630
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,000
It's one of the fictional chains in one of the Pixar movies, like Pizza Planet.

631
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Poultry Palace is like everything is double piece.

632
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Pixar Pier Paradise Park. Oh, yeah.

633
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Oh, it's from a Toy Story short called Small Fry, where there's like a happy meal versions of Buzz Lightyear and Emperor's.

634
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. OK.

635
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:27,000
That's where that comes from. And there's a store also that's named after the the it's Nick's Nax,

636
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:34,000
which is named after the snowman and one of the first shorts, the snowman and a snow globe in one of the early Pixar shorts.

637
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Yes, that's true. Which I think is kind of neat and a cool way.

638
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Those I've read about how those those early Pixar shorts were like so important to the development of this medium.

639
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And they would show you'd show up at this thing called SIGGRAPH that where people showed off new developments in computer animation.

640
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:56,000
And people would show like a 360 shot of a head or something like these things were sometimes.

641
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Now you think it's nothing, but they but they were actually like technological massive leaps forward.

642
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Right. That Pixar that they showed up with stories, a story about a bee or about a snowman and takes you to a world.

643
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Yeah, they like yeah, you cannot underestimate the importance of those old shorts.

644
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
And even they I think some of them were like, oh, this can be the future.

645
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:24,000
But I know from reading one of the Steve Jobs biographies, a lot of the thought was like, well, this will help us sell the render band software.

646
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
This is a proof of concept. Look what you can do.

647
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Oh, yeah, because the point of Pixar was not that that's why it is bizarre if you back up and there's a whole area named after Pixar at a theme park.

648
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Pixar was once like the most functional company and Lucas bought it for a while and did nothing with it and couldn't figure out how to make it work for him.

649
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:51,000
And then Steve Jobs took it in this this direction that became there like one of the primary storytelling brands.

650
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
It's kind of insane when you think about the whole history.

651
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I do have to wonder what he would think of this area.

652
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
What jobs would think? What would you say about poultry palace?

653
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I yeah, well, far my baby has come.

654
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Famously, Tony Baxter said that Steve Jobs rode the Nemo sub ride.

655
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
And he said like that he was expecting Steve Jobs to come off and just give him the normal like great job.

656
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Good. Thanks so much. See you later.

657
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Whatever. But he like pointed immediately pointed out one of the flaw.

658
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Like he immediately pointed out what was the weakest part of the ride.

659
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Like, you know, that one part was not so good. Oh, and that's all he did.

660
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
So I would imagine if he if he thought there was a problem, he would say something.

661
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Yeah, that that is kind of a similar complaint about the buns.

662
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
I like the first two.

663
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
The devil's advocate is like, well, that's just kind of how it was.

664
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
And if he gave a comment like that, that meant he really engaged with it that he saw that.

665
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And the other side is that like, well, he was kind of a notorious asshole.

666
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Sure. So I wish that he had survived to be able to present all of these new food items at the keynotes.

667
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:02,000
And one more thing cut to Churro covered in red.

668
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Scott, let me ask you. I want to know, what do you think?

669
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:14,000
So poultry pals, it's just a stand. OK, it's a quick takeaway, like snack kind of thing.

670
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,000
What do you think? So, you know, there's only three to four menu items at that kind of stand.

671
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
They can only stock so much and they want to get you in and out.

672
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
What do you think they are? What do you think is for sale there?

673
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:38,000
The chip, the the quickest kind of chicken you would have to think are nuggets or fingers or popcorn bites or what have you.

674
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Not available. What? All right. You lured me in.

675
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,000
What's instead? Traditional theme park turkey leg.

676
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:55,000
That makes sense. OK. The main thing they're slinging is a box of three fried chicken drumsticks and a cup of coleslaw.

677
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Huh? That famous meal we all know and love.

678
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And where do you eat it? You're on your own friend.

679
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Boy, Marcus would be as angry as anger himself.

680
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:18,000
You know what else that means? There are trash cans around this stand that will just fill up all day with thin cardboard boxes covered, filled with chicken bones.

681
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I think what might happen to Pixar Pier is what happens to like the floor of like a Hooters or a dirtier like chicken place where you just throw the bones on the floor.

682
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Pixar Pier will just be covered in bone.

683
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,000
That's kind of fun. You feel like you're some kind of like conqueror of empires as you walk through there.

684
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
You can imagine you killed. They're all people that you you had murdered.

685
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
You're as powerful as Chapec.

686
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,000
And full disclosure, none of us have had this Pixar, the poultry palace chicken.

687
01:03:49,000 --> 01:04:01,000
The reviews are not good, which is insane to me because right across the way at in Disneyland on Main Street, you can get some of the best fried chicken I have ever eaten.

688
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Yeah. So so we didn't have the poultry palace because what happened was we basically had after going to for that, the meetup thing, we after seeing Imagineer speak,

689
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
they basically for an hour and a half let us loose in Pixar Pier.

690
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
It was awesome because there was like 150 people.

691
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:28,000
So we go on any ride as much as we wanted. And we like to ride any of the three three Toy Story mania was open to the fun.

692
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Yeah. The fun one that's been there for years.

693
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Oh my God. These names. So so we had already eaten dinner and we were like, how are we going to eat all this food?

694
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
It's insane. You know, don't that's an option.

695
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:47,000
We had to try it all. And also the thing is like to add add more of a wrinkle to this problem.

696
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I had just flown in from Chicago where I went to a baseball game the day before where a friend of mine had a very good tickets.

697
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:00,000
And there's a thing called Club 1914 at Wrigley Field where you can eat all you want and drink all you want.

698
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:09,000
So I was in another situation two days in a row, 48 hours where I gorged myself on food and treats.

699
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Mike Carlson, the most sympathetic. I know I'm too many free meals to eat.

700
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I'm saying he's a member of the leisure class.

701
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:28,000
That boy, that's deep. That's a refer. That's the film from Project Greenlight that I don't really remember that well.

702
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I'm assuming it's about like rich people with too much time on their hands or like it's a bad guy.

703
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:37,000
He's eating hot dogs. Got too many hot dogs to meet to eat cross country.

704
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Well, I have to watch this. So, yeah, look, don't feel sorry for me.

705
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I'm just saying that I had a horrible headache the night of the baseball game because of overindulging.

706
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:58,000
And then I flew to Los Angeles where, again, I was for again, I in my mind forced to eat six or seven free things.

707
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:05,000
And because again, I'm a theme park journalist, so I need to try them out so we could discuss the audience is what you're doing.

708
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
And listening is responsible for your body trauma.

709
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Much like I blamed you guys for not correcting me on the Tiki Room, I am blaming the audience for making me eat all this free stuff like our president.

710
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
It's never your fault. Yes, that's what I'm saying. I'm just like the president.

711
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:27,000
So we so so we were running out of time. We were like standing and like trying to eat stuff and we're like, we only have 20 minutes left.

712
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
We should go on the rides again. That's actually better.

713
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:37,000
We should just sort of like and then like the Pixar, excuse me, the poultry palace line was by far the longest because I think everybody put it off.

714
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Everyone in the everyone was like, yeah, we'll get to the chicken later.

715
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Well, it comes in a box with handles so you could take it home.

716
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Well, that was fried chicken. We made a big hot or cold.

717
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Excuse my language. We made a big fucking mistake.

718
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:55,000
We should have gotten that poultry palace first to get the box and then loaded in things to take home later.

719
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:11,000
That would have been a great idea, but we didn't do it because to say it again, we made a big fucking mistake and we were so we honestly we were we were like, that's what we should have done because we had like eaten half of everything and thrown a lot of stuff away because there's no way.

720
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:25,000
There's no way I can eat a full churro, a hot dog, a blue and yellow thing, three drumsticks, a cookie num num, a thing of milk, water and the meal I'd already eaten at Lamplight Lounge.

721
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I'm so confused how you're not obese.

722
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:34,000
You're you're an in shape man. I've only I've had many a meal with you been out many times.

723
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Yeah. I've only seen you eat horse shit.

724
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I've never seen a reasonable some plates like I have seen him.

725
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:57,000
You're very lucky is what I'm saying. I am very lucky. I don't I have to like I walk like three miles every morning and I like pound water all day long just to maintain this.

726
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Look, I look it's not like I don't have to do anything. You know, maybe I starve myself on the days that I don't eat a bunch of bullshit, a bunch of sprinkled.

727
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:13,000
If there's sprinkles or multi colors, I have to eat it. I am a child. I acknowledge that.

728
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:19,000
You were you had a meal with the Doughboys and they referenced it on their podcast and they said they had a lot of sprinkles in it.

729
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
That's kind of a child's meal, but I thought it was good anyway.

730
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Yeah, yeah, Liger did or say it was a child's meal and I don't disagree with that.

731
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,000
I'm just trying to live the way I wanted to live when I was five and I'm getting pretty close to it.

732
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
You know, that's all getting pretty close. That's what we're all doing.

733
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
So, yeah, yeah, don't don't feel sorry for me.

734
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Well, let's you mentioned it.

735
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:48,000
This is a one thing that people have been saying is a highlight of Pixar Pier is Lamplight Lounge.

736
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Yes, a very nicely designed formerly the Cove Bar and Ariel's Grotto.

737
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Now it's all just kind of one. It all kind of connects and it's all got the same design style.

738
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
It is a separate restaurant and bar still.

739
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Yeah, it's so I had never eaten at Ariel's Grotto. I don't think you guys have either.

740
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
No, no, but we have been to the Cove Bar many times.

741
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Sure. One of our favorite places, I think, in Disney's California Adventure.

742
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:18,000
It's right by the water, right by the pier. You get your lobster nachos.

743
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I think you've both probably seen me get Mickey's Funwheel, the secret cocktail that's multicolored.

744
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
A brightly colored child's alcohol drink.

745
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
That's correct.

746
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
If you had to visualize it.

747
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
What are they going to call that drink now?

748
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I think it might be called the same thing.

749
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I think it's a secret because they can't put Mickey in the title of an alcoholic drink on a menu.

750
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Oh, oh.

751
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
But it's like it's the Pixar's flavor pals.

752
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
It's five flavors all being pals together.

753
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Yeah, the colors are friends.

754
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,000
You're staying late tonight. We have a deadline tomorrow.

755
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
We're all staying late now.

756
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:03,000
There are a lot of menu items at Lamplight Lounge where it's like, this is what the anime like.

757
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:10,000
This is named after like like Deadline or yeah, like short, like all like terms that might get thrown around

758
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:17,000
at Pixar or like explain one meal called Don't Touch My Leg, John.

759
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:23,000
You know, stuff you'd hear on Pixar, that type of thing.

760
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Hug your wife, not me.

761
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I'll take the hug your wife, not me.

762
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Explain this to your your sons.

763
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Look them in the eye and explain your choices to your family.

764
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Yeah.

765
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,000
If we ordered the get a let a woman talk cocktail.

766
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Yeah, I the the idea.

767
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I didn't know this till I read it.

768
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:53,000
So I was paragraphs deep in a LA Times article that the theme of the Lamplight Lounge is that you're in a Pixar break area.

769
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,000
It's like a bar where the animators and stuff would hang out.

770
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Mm hmm. Yeah. So the idea you want to be just where you want to be 18 with everything we've learned, just a place where all the Pixar people are getting loose.

771
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Oh, and did you know there's a secret room called the office that like locks for the outside.

772
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
There's like a crazy combination lock.

773
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:20,000
You got the Matt Lauer button is inside in case you want to be alone.

774
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:32,000
It looks it looks like, yeah, there's a lot of drawings inside or a lot of sketches and signatures and all that kidding aside, the idea of a secret room and a Disney restaurant is awesome.

775
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Yeah, sure.

776
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
That's always bought because of the Pixar connection.

777
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
It seems like I don't know if it's open yet.

778
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Yeah, I think that like there's I don't know how you get in yet. There's a whole like kind of like a slot machine system on the door that like you pull it and like if you get, you know, there might be clue or you're given clues yourself.

779
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I don't know. It's it's going to be a thing you can reserve.

780
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:00,000
And it's like a it is. Yeah, it's just a dining room. It's just a private dining room.

781
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:07,000
There's little ones like at the Carthay. I've eaten in one. There's little like side rooms with only one table in them.

782
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:21,000
And yeah, so so yeah, the lamp light lounge. Yeah, the top floor is still basically the same just repainted as the cove bar. But then below it's like very brick. It's very modern gastro pub. That's what everything is now.

783
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
L.A. gastro pub sort of thing.

784
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:37,000
And they there's a lot of they've renamed there's a lot of new items on the menu they call the kids the kids menu budding artists and all the cocktails. There's a lot of fun cocktails.

785
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:50,000
They have fun as we were saying names like the short plot twist over budget final with a fix the sequel Park Avenue sizzle reel.

786
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I don't want to hear about the fucking minions. Don't tell me how well Dreamworks did this year.

787
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:03,000
The actual director goes uncredited for this film.

788
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:09,000
The 25th rewrite throwing out half the movie because it's not working.

789
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Cal art students dragged on Bluth on the Internet.

790
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:23,000
This is it's finally a restaurant that acknowledges it's it's close to being a restaurant themed after that secret shelved documentary that stings wife made.

791
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:33,000
You know that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Which which movie is it about? What's it called? It's called something awful like you know it's it's called like the like the hell house or the cauldron.

792
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:41,000
It's some like it's a name that describes that it seems to imply the Disney process is terrible and difficult. And what was it?

793
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Was it the Emperor's New Groove? Because Sting was originally doing all of the songs for the movie Kingdom of the Sun. What was it right? Something like that became the Emperor's New Groove was a much more austere film with songs by Sting.

794
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:14,000
And he and so though so I mean it follows the entire creative process of the movie but it's also kind of sting centric and it lets Sting complain to his wife about how badly it's all going and he ended up with like one song in the credits after like years of work and he was trying to get brand new day out the door.

795
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:23,000
He was worried he was trying to get to he's trying to get Desert Rose out into the market and tour it and he's having a waste time with these these Disney.

796
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:31,000
That was his comeback too. Oh yeah. And it all got delayed because of all the time he spent messing around with Disney.

797
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:39,000
That reminds me listeners another documentary that you can find I think I think it's on YouTube at this point.

798
01:14:39,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Waking Sleeping Beauty if you haven't seen that like the resurgence of Disney animation some stuff in there also like not exactly a positive document like I mean it's fascinating to see how it all came together and what made everything work but there's so many shots of like yeah and then they crammed the animators in a barely air conditioned warehouse and by the Burbank Airport.

799
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Oh that's right because little like they animators had kind of sweeter digs on the Disney lot and they were considering killing the program altogether.

800
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Yeah and they got put into this kind of sweat lodge. Yeah.

801
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:22,000
That's where the Little Mermaid was was birthed. Yeah they like worked their way out of it and by the time that classic period was done.

802
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:30,000
There's now the incredibly very very nice Disney animation building that you see off the 134 freeway and Burbank with the big sorcerers hat.

803
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Yeah actually I think it I think I had that wrong I think it was Zootopia something very recent they put them for whatever reason they didn't have room for the production so they put them in an offsite location and they were like they made this big hit like by the runway of the Burbank Airport essentially.

804
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Weird.

805
01:15:51,000 --> 01:16:02,000
So these are the kind of conditions you can think about while you enjoy a meal at the lamp light lounge. I'll have a right next to the Burbank Airport runway please.

806
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Yeah. I'm assuming priced reasonably well a table service.

807
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I think you might be leading me on here. It's a little expensive. So the problem was we knew that we were about to have to gorge ourselves later. So I had this reservation it's very hard to get right now.

808
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,000
So we just had some what they call bites you know not like a full meal.

809
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:43,000
So Lindsey had the deviled eggs and toast which were basically like a couple hard boiled eggs and like toast for $12. And was like this. This really wasn't anything was it and I was like that's a bit of bummer.

810
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,000
That wholesale rate is probably 50 cents worth of food.

811
01:16:47,000 --> 01:17:03,000
No yeah absolutely it was. And then I had tuna poke which was good but it was $18 and it's a small amount of poke and it's supposed to be like their appetizer. And it's like this is not $4 off this and then I feel a little bit better $4 or $5.

812
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:17,000
But I like the poke fine and I got what did I get I got the it wasn't as fun of a name. I got the nectar in the rye drink which was like whiskey and you know some like peach fruit.

813
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Is that a play on catcher in the rye? Probably not right? Probably not.

814
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:34,000
This is the thing that I noticed looking at the Lamplight menu. You all know I'm a thrifty man. But I give Disney like alright it's Disney Park I know you're gonna pay more.

815
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:48,000
$21 spinach salad. Oh my god. Like the cheddar okay $22 burger alright well it's got like Tilla McCheddar on it and bacon and okay fine you upskip it.

816
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Like a chicken salad or like I don't this just seems a lot like it just seems like so much.

817
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Yeah yeah it seems a little expensive obviously I think I've read again read now that I think about it I've read that some of this stuff is good but these are all on these sites that I think might be bought and paid for.

818
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Not us obviously we've had real loose tongues this episode. Yeah we're like real cranky today or something. The whole thing we have to scrap this whole episode I think. For political purposes.

819
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Well the whole thing like you guys are talking about it's an okay cookie and all like that's this is why I can't just be at the theme parks all day every day because I like the restaurants are they're good for theme parks other than Cartway Circle.

820
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Other than a few options throughout the Disney Park universe like they aren't the best you don't get the best restaurants the best food in the world at these places.

821
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Yeah they're all at best they're very good impressions of real restaurants. Yeah and Disneyland is one of the better food programs of any theme parks.

822
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Yeah Florida is a lot more I feel like Florida is just getting around to cupcakes like they're just getting around to it was like a couple years ago they're like we have cronuts now and it's like okay yeah about four years after any major city they got around to grow not too little too late.

823
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I think the canteen in Pandora really ushered in like better food at Disney Disney World. That seems like a step up yes. Yeah like that's a good like I would have that meal if I could go walk to it.

824
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:46,000
That looks good yeah you pick a protein pick a grain pick a sauce like that seems like actually what you probably should be eating to do these kind of like 10 hour days in the park. Yes a lot of protein high protein low carbs low sugar.

825
01:19:46,000 --> 01:20:00,000
But you seem to be implying that if if Pandora Grill became an option at your local mall or just if that if there were 100 locations you know US wide of Pandora Grill you'd be psyched.

826
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Oh yeah of course especially if they had a license though Avatar license. Yeah yeah I would go to a Saltooli canteen. Saltooli canteen we would go there every day.

827
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:23,000
It'd be pretty exciting if Pandoran food landed and was like an equal to Mexican and Japanese. Sure. It's a it's if it was a legitimate genre of food that emanated out. I mean Disney World.

828
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I think it would be probably more like Navi food because Pandora's the planet and obviously a lot of different species have different types of food. So I'm just saying.

829
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:42,000
So the food that you get there is the Navi's food. Yeah but well it depends on that but it's also the name of the place. That's true. You're right you're right.

830
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:53,000
You can call it earthy. But I'm saying if we transported you know French food to another planet would they just say earth food. Yeah maybe. So they would say well earth food but it's specifically from the country of France.

831
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:05,000
I suppose so. That's all I'm saying. Navi. OK so the restaurant's called Navi food but it's from Pandora. From Pandora by Pandora. By from and by Pandora. That's branding.

832
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:15,000
The so the inside the Lamplight Lounge it's like a lot of brick. It looks like honestly like at night like it seemed cool like it would be cool to hang out at the bar down there. Like that seems fun. It's right by the water.

833
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:40,000
The music in there seems like and I don't know if this reference makes any sense to everyone here. The music in there seems like the woman's clothing store Chico's a commercial for that clothing store like a lot of like 90s like kind of house beat seemingly like trying to be cool music like.

834
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:55,000
So music that has no genre music that is nothing like a lot of things where like you can see they're like they'll like change how the drums sound like how the like they put like a lot of compression all of a sudden on the drums and then it becomes a difference.

835
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Like there's too much production going on in the music and it's supposed to sound hip but ultimately as you said like sounds like nothing like some of you use worse DJ. Yeah.

836
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Yeah. Someone had the faintest memory of Samba and bossa nova musics. Yeah. It's like it's like very like it has no absolutely no soul to it all. And there's like so I because we went down there and I'm like oh they're going to be playing like and I get it they don't want to just play like Randy Newman songs from Pixar movies.

837
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Why not. But yeah. So maybe why not. We're like maybe that would have been better like me like instrumental covers or like the Incredibles music when they would like just the background music and the quieter loungy kind of kind of stuff.

838
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Yeah. Maybe there maybe we just got on a stretch of music that I was maybe they do have that somewhere. But so they put so it's a restaurant that plays really neutered hip hop has the most expensive spinach salad you ever had.

839
01:22:50,000 --> 01:23:07,000
It's themed after animators pulling long hours. And if you went to if you weren't lucky enough to be part of a free event if I if we went to Disneyland right now we're recording this on a Sunday afternoon if we got there by three o'clock how long are we waiting to get in the lamp.

840
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Friends parking structure is currently closed. Yes. Well first of all that's Lees Park at Dodger Stadium.

841
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:25,000
We would wait for an hour to sit upstairs. But we wouldn't be able to go to this right now. Oh that's something I wanted to talk about. You have to get reservations for downstairs which is the full menu.

842
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:45,000
OK. This is a thing that really but this is like this is terrible show to me and it's still going. We walked by it the day we were there. So the upstairs is a bar and just like a normal bar in the regular world. You just kind of got to wait. You know if it's crowded you got to wait for a seat to open up.

843
01:23:45,000 --> 01:24:00,000
But I'm like a bar in the regular world. You can't just stand around. So as you walk down this pier this brand new area there's just a mass of humanity. There's a line waiting to get into this bar and it was like that at the cove bar. It's the same way now.

844
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:17,000
I don't understand why they don't just invest in that software for iPads where they just say like OK what's your name. All right. What's your phone number. All right. We'll text you when we're like 10 when your table's almost ready. Like why are they. They have that for inside with a reservation.

845
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:26,000
So I'm assuming they'll roll that out at a certain point but it seems like they shouldn't make me. I. The way it was that seems shorter when we were there. So I don't know if they are doing that yet. OK.

846
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:37,000
I don't. Yeah I don't understand why. I mean I guess in the park it's like oh well what if someone tries to go on Soorin on the other side of the park and then they get back and then they had to give the table away.

847
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:50,000
But still like let people walk around or something like that just looks terrible to have this like brand new area and just like a snaking line as soon as you walk into it. That's like a terrible optics.

848
01:24:50,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Yeah sure. We'll see when you've had a nice stroll up to up to the line with the chicken bones pouring out of trash can stepping over cracking bones as you walk.

849
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:16,000
It's crazy. I mean because they have it at the hotel restaurants. I see to remember like I feel like I when my family stayed at the Grand Californian they told us like all right we'll text you you can go to the lobby or go back to the room.

850
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Yeah I'm sure that'll be coming if it I would have already. Guys we're an hour and a half in and we've avoided the roller coaster in the place.

851
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:36,000
So this is the last little bit right is that probably. So let's talk we've ridden the we both ridden the Incredicoaster now. Yes and the original California Screamin.

852
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Yes Scott have you ridden Screamin. I did. That's a launch coaster. When I had a girlfriend who made me do such things then yes I did. I ended up going on it a second time. I did like I like the rest of it enough to get me past the quick launch although not since 2005.

853
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:09,000
So that's where I am now. So I've been on the Incredicoaster now four times. I went on three times at this event. I went twice in a row and then one at the end of the night when I was full of food.

854
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:24,000
I just went on the once when we went and I went on during the day I've heard it's much better at night which kind of bugs me where it's like well you're supposed to build an attraction so it's great no matter when you go on it.

855
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Sure and the people that said much better at night let's just say better. OK. Let's not say it is not a revelation at night or anything. It's just that the colors are there and I also think that like since it's dark you can't see like the paint that needs to be repainted.

856
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:53,000
On the coaster itself. So yeah so so the queue is all different. The queue is Incredibles and it's got the cool like retro we feel looks like their house now. Yeah that stuff all looks very cool and there's a new pre-show and stuff.

857
01:26:53,000 --> 01:27:08,000
These covers in line that are sort of throwback homages to like the old funky umbrellas that used to provide shade in Tomorrowland. They could use a few dozen more of these covers throughout the area.

858
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Most of your complaints today have been about shade. It's just it's it's a very exposed land. It's just in the summer. It's a heat. It's opening on a heat wave late in summer and you're not careful that you're going to end up looking exactly like anger.

859
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Yeah. Bright red bright red bright red with a hot and pissed about poultry.

860
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:43,000
And steam coming out of your ears about a hot dog. Put some suntan lotion on folks. So so all of that is fun and like seeing the Incredibles and credit coaster and a new like fast pass wait time.

861
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:54,000
You get like excited like wow cool and Incredibles ride like you're excited about a wait time. Well no I'm just saying that because an effective queue makes you excited about the ride and the idea of it.

862
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:12,000
And there's original footage in the line with the actors doing the dialogue. I'm just saying it tricks you for a second into thinking it's a oh wow it's a cool like your brain starts to go wow this feels newish to me this feels like I'm going to get to you know experience the movie like you would on a new e-ticket

863
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Incredibles ride. There's kind of a there's funny joke in the line. There's funny joke at the launch too but in the line what does she say Violet says oh sure just slap our name on an old ride.

864
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:38,000
There is a real wow. This is a pretty funny joke. I'm usually hot and cold on some times some of the self-awareness that comes with that feels like a universal joke quite frankly. Yeah.

865
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:55,000
That's a universal joke. It's funny coming out of like the teen girl like the smart ass teen girl in a character. I think that's great. Yeah. So they ever everyone knows like the Imagineers did their best with the money they had don't get when we when we were cranky about this stuff.

866
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I'm just saying like everyone knew what the deal was here. We have they have a little amount of money to do a little something to this ride.

867
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:14,000
With this story is that it's like oh the town is celebrating the return of the heroes by rechristening this roller coaster with the Incredibles name. That's the plot. That's the plot. That's the plot.

868
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:29,000
And then. So spoiler alert if you don't want to know the story of the Incredicoaster we'll give you five seconds here to turn off the podcast. Go experience the roller coaster and then come back. Go back and listen to our talk about the chicken and the ice cream and then.

869
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Well Mike I'm sorry. Spoiler alert for you too. I am going to mention some of the very basic plot points from that. That's fine. So yeah. So then you get on the coaster and Edna mode is watching Jack Jack like she does in the movie.

870
01:29:47,000 --> 01:30:02,000
It's a great great bunch of scenes in the movie and the mode babysitting Jack Jack in the movie it goes well but in the ride Jack Jack teleports out of there. And that's the other funny joke in the light like you come or you get in the coaster.

871
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:17,000
It starts to leave the station you see into the I guess it's the Incredibles home and she's like I watch the baby don't worry about it and then like right as you're about before you launch she goes and the baby is gone.

872
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:33,000
It's a funny delivery for Brad Bird's funny joke and then it's that sets up the launch Mr. Incredible yells Dash go after him and then you hear Dash's voice countdown and there's a little fun water spray effect after they launch.

873
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:47,000
See Dash I guess like it would I don't know they can't probably make a robot run on water yet. Or they maybe they can they just have the money for it so they just have like a little water sprays if he's running up. It's a lot of suggestion on this ride.

874
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:59,000
A lot of audio because there's not a lot of room to do. There aren't any robots they're all statues. That's true they're all statues. There's no one of the Jack Jacks moves a little. Well there's a screen for his face in one of the two.

875
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:15,000
So he moves around a little bit because he gets like snotty. It's like it's not all over his head but he is like it's like a little screen. So yeah it's a lot of a lot of story told with narration from the audio on the back of the roller coaster or in your speakers excuse me.

876
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:38,000
It's yeah every two basically has a couple static Incredibles characters mixed with whatever like the audio is telling you they're doing. Yeah trying to they're trying to all trying to catch Jack Jack which is weird in the context of the Incredibles 2 because Edna makes a special suit for Jack Jack that makes it easier to keep him under control.

877
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:54,000
So was this supposed to take place before Incredibles 2 in the narrative. He's wearing the suit. Oh I see. He's wearing the same. So that's a hole. It wasn't a perfect thing. They didn't have the remote. That's a big thing in it. The remote for the suit.

878
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:08,000
But it's like wait but Edna's thing is supposed to stop this. But it's not I guess it's not perfect because he still gets in the hijinks in the movie. It seems like a big oversight as far as I'm concerned. I haven't seen the movie but it sounds like they had a big problem on their hands here.

879
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:20,000
They have to rectify. Take him out of the suit that he gets in the movie maybe. Maybe that's the fix. Yeah I mean I guess it just kind of looks like a red baby onesie anytime. That's true.

880
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:35,000
So you go in like a two you go. So they made the tunnels basically longer and maybe not bigger but longer like there were a couple of tunnels before with nothing in them. Now they've painted them red. Now it's longer just so they can put in a little bit more show.

881
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:50,000
The first one you go up it's like there's like purple I guess purple neon that makes it look like laser eyes. The next one is I forget what the next one is that the elastic girl stretching.

882
01:32:50,000 --> 01:33:06,000
And then it's like Mr. Incredible burst through to try to hand a cookie to a Jack Jack cookie num num to lure Jack. One of them is violet. That's probably the best one. That's probably the best one. Because they've made the whole area look hot like it looks like it's fire in the tube and that's fun.

883
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:20,000
It's cool. You're hearing their voices. There's a lot of them yelling at you. Which is fun. There's a lot of fun stuff on this and the music is great. The music is the best. The music is like basically like the score. The music definitely kicks it up a notch.

884
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:34,000
And then there's a fun little scene of statues at the end to sort of sum it all up. But between the last tunnel and the end scene with Edna and Jack Jack there's nothing. They needed like another tunnel or two.

885
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:51,000
There's like no wall there's extra stuff. It's just a roller coaster playing music. Yeah it's just yeah there's there's just like a lot of voice and there's no place especially when you're going at the end turn which is like basically a bunch of grass in the center and you're just turning around this like kind of open field.

886
01:33:51,000 --> 01:34:20,000
It's been that way for a long time. Yeah it's weird. I think there's supposed to be that's always been I think been an expansion pad for a ride. Well that's different. That's a different one. That's where the Malibuumer used to be. But isn't that I thought the other one maybe. Really? It looks like there's such a small footprint there. Yeah maybe. I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. It does look like they were planning something though right. You could have built a Jack Jack. A giant big Jack Jack. I said build a giant Jack Jack and he turns around and tries to grab the coaster or something. But there's no money in this budget for that. That's that's that's obvious.

887
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Might have been in a previous path. I'm sure the blue sky had something like that. I just don't like even the Edna's at the beginning or end just make them move a little or make the Jack Jack's move. Yeah. Like I don't. It's hard because I get it in the tunnel like the roller coaster is going so fast. Yeah. It doesn't make sense to have people like robots that can do so much because you're seeing it for a second. You don't want to break it down with the hydraulic fluid and everything. But like you've got a show scene at the beginning and the end.

888
01:34:49,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Like you want to do this a little more. Or at least you know what they really should have just have them blink. Just do that screen technology to have them blink or do something or talk. It looks good from the Frozen. Yes. That's a lot of. So so yeah. So we look we love robots here. We just like them when they move. We just want them to move a little bit. Yeah. And yeah there was probably a way to like put like for instance Guardians of the Galaxy Mission Breakout which we have not reviewed officially on here. But like that is

889
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:49,000
they did a hell of a job with taking a ride you know very well and truly making it feel different feeling like a different lobby a different ride experience. This is just like exactly the same. But they're fun music now and you get to see a few things here and there which isn't bad. But it is not nearly like the experience of Guardians of the Galaxy ride. So it's not like it's bad and it's not like the. No it's fun. Let me say what you said. You said it as if you were anticipating me saying it as soon as we were done.

890
01:35:49,000 --> 01:36:04,280
On the ride you don't remember this. You went well I think it's fun. It's pre defensive. You were pre defensive like I was going to go well it was fine or whatever. But you said that we saw Ant-Man 2. It did. Yes. We that's another. We'll talk about that.

891
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:34,280
I did think it was fun but I had a laundry. I had this. Well it's fun of course it's fun. It's a good roller coaster. It's definitely an upgrade. I think it's an upgrade from California Screamin. I think you probably have to say yeah it's an upgrade from California Screamin. It's just that like when you're talking about like a Incredibles ride when you think of the promise of that. Yeah. You do go like ah why can't. And I've I always wondered if maybe Incredibles was a candidate to be some kind of attraction in Tomorrowland. It's been a long time.

892
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:53,800
It's been rumored for years that the interventions building or whatever the hell. Now the launch bay. There was going to be some awesome three excuse me e-ticket Incredibles ride. I feel like I heard the rumor or maybe just thought in my fan brain that the there's pretty cool pods that are like in the first Incredibles.

893
01:36:53,800 --> 01:37:22,800
And then Bob is on this island right. That where he ends up meeting syndrome and like some cool glass bubbles kind of that maybe those end up on the people mover. Yeah. Maybe I don't think there's a ton of great set pieces in the new Incredibles that it's like well that's a ride. Superhero training I think was thrown around the idea like you would go and like probably like an X-Men Danger Room ride. You train to be a superhero and you just got to hope that you get to be a superhero.

894
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:40,800
This doesn't negate that's what I possibly like it might. I don't know. It might keep it away for a little bit. But that's because that that movie of all the Pixar movies I think lends itself to an awesome e-ticket ride. Yeah. Like there's no nothing with more like fun action colorful that great score.

895
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:55,800
And I think it's doing great at the box. I mean it'll be a nice one. I saw it three weeks after it opened and the theater was full. Yeah. Yeah. We are in the middle of a heat wave in Los Angeles. Yeah. And we'll I'll go see it this week. I should have done it.

896
01:37:55,800 --> 01:38:17,800
People are out tolerating Uncle Drew and Sicario too because it's so hot. But still yes. Incredibles too is wonderful. Yeah. I think that's my here's my feeling about this whole thing. Sure do Pixar appear. Absolutely. And yet for another year at Disneyland Tomorrowland decays.

897
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:32,800
Tomorrowland gets worse and worse. They may they somehow found a way to make pizza port more unpleasant. They put like they put a cloth sign over it that like that's for this. You got what is it part of what is the class.

898
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:48,800
Boy Pixar fast. Yes. It's part of Pixar. That's celebrating friendship and beyond. I don't know if you heard. OK. It's not the one they call the Pixar pal party and then it's we keep it all peas. I just do yet to your Pixar peer.

899
01:38:48,800 --> 01:39:03,800
But for the love of good. Do we see Tomorrowland change in our lifetimes. Does this happen. I don't know. I think I think I will be on my deathbed and wondering why it never that's still going to be the fucking rocket that serves coke.

900
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:18,800
It's going to be the it's going to be interventions with ads for Dyson Air Blades like it's like I this it makes me this is why I'm of course do your gentrification anywhere you want across this property.

901
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:31,800
But were we really going to let Tomorrowland just I mean languish and languish. I get it. They wanted to do something cheap that they could do in the other park that would draw people over there and they wanted to use characters that everyone knows.

902
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:41,800
So I get it from a cynical marketing perspective. This was probably the thing they had to do something along these lines. I think they should have put in another five hundred million dollars into it.

903
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:53,800
They call it synergy darling. That's a joke from the queue line to joke about the overlay. That is more universal style edgy referential comedy.

904
01:39:53,800 --> 01:40:06,800
And I can't. That's fun. I don't know. I like that. I like that. I like a lot. I didn't I wasn't wild about it in the last Jedi when Finn what does he yell. Oh they hate that.

905
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:23,800
Like the TIE fighters. I don't remember. So yeah. Well you know the public is kind of not exactly hot on the future right now. People are feeling a little hopeless you know in terms of Tomorrowland getting redone.

906
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:38,800
But I tell you what you will have to look forward to the inside out emotional whirlwind coming soon. Coming to Pixar Pier that is a bad for flex our times. That's a day you're just repainting flicks flyers from

907
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:52,800
Bugsland. There's Jesse's critter carousel. That's the old carousel. They are repainting it. That is not open yet. And Bing bongs candy store which they is opening sometime in this month of July.

908
01:40:53,800 --> 01:41:05,800
So we're gonna have to air grievances about all those things in a future episode. Pixar Pier Part 2. Pixar Pier Complaint Fest Part 2. Bing bongs candy store has a sign like it has a bunch of his quotes on the sign.

909
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:18,800
I saw a picture and one of them says I cry candy. And that's yeah that's a fun little piece of the movie. But I don't know to me it seemed very weird to see the word cry in big letters at a Disney park.

910
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:30,800
I thought that was kind of like I like it's edgy I think I think that that's a good idea like it's fun and you can buy his candy tears supposedly. You can buy his tears at the store. Which is weird.

911
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:46,800
Yep. Which but I like I like that. So get loaded up on his tears get loaded up on Bing bong tears and then poultry and hit that credit coaster. If the candy doesn't melt. Gosh he thought he was leaving the flames of hell and now he's coming to Southern California.

912
01:41:46,800 --> 01:42:03,800
He's heat waving ages. It seemed like at one point there was going to be a leg two of Pixar Pier presumably Paradise Gardens Park. Right and they rethemed goofy sky school for the fifth time. The good dinosaurs crazy antics.

913
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:18,800
As long as they preserve that perfect state fair ride within. Yeah. Then we're fine. But then like Silly Symphony swings like that's Mickey. Will that go away. Because like that's a cool theme. I actually Paradise Gardens Park Michael. Oh no.

914
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:34,800
But I'm saying when they free of the need to rethink when they go around. So yeah. So so there's more Pixar Pier may be coming. Also I have a feeling there's not more picks up. I feel like this is it. Some nice things I like. I like they have a guy sketching Pixar characters in the in Nick neck and Nick's necks.

915
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:51,800
I didn't know that's fun. That's nice. Some of the merchandise is very good. I like the sign a lot. I think this is funny that we complained for like ninety five minutes and I'm just going to give two minutes of like kudos. The sign I think is cool. I like the color scheme. I like the I like it's big. It's it's nice. It looks nice at night.

916
01:42:51,800 --> 01:43:20,800
The billboards are cute. The billboards are cute. I like I like the sort of color scheme. I think that's fun. I think it looks cool and I think a lot of it is an upgrade. It's just like it doesn't everything isn't cohesive yet. They are still repainting things I think once maybe they get more money. Everything's open. I think all of it you'll go well this is certainly you know what was maybe a B B minus land. Now it's B or B plus like it's it's an A plus.

917
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:37,800
Incremental change and this area has grown slowly from orange peels and and sure just straight up knots rides to at least it you know it got more charm with Midway mania. It has more charm with. Yeah.

918
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:55,800
Which is still great. Carnival Barker potato head. Well that's a great ride. And they repainted the roof there. Good. That's fun. I think they added fast pass. They did add fast pass to it. That is a thing that I think like oh yeah this needed fast pass. And they have Edna mode walk around character now which is grace. That looks great.

919
01:43:55,800 --> 01:44:11,800
Here's what we took a photo. Lindsay and I took a photo with her. What I do think is unnerving is that she is human hands. It's a plastic head but human hands. So she comes and when you go to see the character she shakes your hand and I go like I didn't say it but like my brain was like oh real skin.

920
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:33,800
Like I just give her a mane of hair on the back of it. Give her gloves please. Give her those. Yeah. So cut cut for budget. So Edna mode gloves gloves better dogs better milk choice milk offerings and to check the lanyard again. Yeah.

921
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:51,800
Give Edna hands better milk offerings and just call it Mickey's fun wheel. What in the world. Yeah. Pixar Pixar. That's like an algorithm. Name that right. Yeah. So our pal around all around. It is all your pals and they are going around together.

922
01:44:51,800 --> 01:45:09,800
I've never I've never been I had never been on the Mickey's fun wheel and we didn't have time to go on the power round. I have still not been on the Pixar pal around. I will go on and everyone says though you like it. I know I like it. I've never been on it. I've never been on the stationary and the moving cars.

923
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:26,800
But it's a Ferris wheel. They've never figured out how to quickly load and unload a Ferris wheel. It's just not possible. And there should be two robots in every car. Yeah. Because if you're now the Pixar. You should sit next to one and you're so like you sit with up or the old man and then the other.

924
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:46,800
Oh I thought you meant of like Pixar. Like you just sit next to a Pete doctor animatronic and he doesn't talk. He's just trying to research Mark Davis stuff for that. That's fair. Those should all be like you all the cars should be cubicles and you have eight shots to get done that day. Oh cool. I got the cereal bar one.

925
01:45:46,800 --> 01:46:15,800
You just get notes. Yes. The the notacoaster the notawheel. So yeah we've we've been plusing up as we go I think here. Plus the buzz up so we don't have to do one overall. I hope. And they're going to keep they're obviously working out. I saw a nice Q&A with the Imagineers and they were they were talking all the things they were showing in the reference art was very cool and they very much care about it and they're still working on a lot of it. So this is a work in progress.

926
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:35,800
You know it's it's fun but it's it's it's a bummer because we from Disney you want like some insane amazing thing that right out of the gate is is great. And this one just feels like it's a work in progress. Well Pixar Pier will never be complete until the tape is removed from the pipes on the roof.

927
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:53,800
That is actually probably a teaser for a new short of like taping the pipe. It's an Easter egg. You know they love their Easter eggs. They're a one thirteen. You know I did. This is really damning it with a praise but I'm happy it gave a reason to reopen the blue sky cellar.

928
01:46:53,800 --> 01:47:07,800
The little making of behind the scenes walk through by the winery that's still holding on. I love walking through there. Still holding on. Let's not have any shit talk at the winery. That's Scott's favorite place in all the parks. That's correct.

929
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:26,800
You know what it's it does look lovely and it's always crowded. Yeah I've never been able to successfully eat at the balcony the little tapas place they have upstairs. I have. It's wonderful. Many relaxing hours. We all went there once. Yeah.

930
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:42,800
Seriously they just tell you there's no seats. That one there's nowhere to have a line. That one I feel like they just tell you yeah we're full up. We got it. We have to wrap this episode up before I before we start suggesting that plus ups need to happen at the beloved winery.

931
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:54,800
We really I won't have it. We haven't even thrown out that we'll do a full episode on there but of course we have to. Hmm. Let's do it from there. Yeah. Let's get a couple bottles. Yeah that's a good idea.

932
01:47:54,800 --> 01:48:11,800
Hey. So we stay tuned for that winery review episode. Yeah. And until then. I got something to say to Michael. I say bring back Robert Mondavi. Get Shapik over here. Get him over here.

933
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:27,800
I want more Disney specific brands of winery. I've got it. The alumni privileges to bother Bob Iger. I wonder how much I could find in the directory. The last thing I would say is that blue sky seller. We were talking about the button on Space Mountain many episodes ago.

934
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:45,800
You can press the button a fake button to launch the Pixar Pier and credit coaster model. So you get that's fine. It's a it's a it's a controls. Yes. And you get to it shows you how you would launch the coaster if you work there. It's really just training you to take a minimum wage job.

935
01:48:45,800 --> 01:49:08,800
But I was very excited because of what we were saying about the Space Mountain. But well given you a good good practice for your old button finger. Disney has taken over the whole state. Everything's a theme park and we're all working there. Yeah. And when they've yeah when they've lured us at first through promises of free spicy hot dogs and then through slate employment opportunities.

936
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:28,800
We'll be there soon. We know that's where it's heading. Hey folks you survived podcast the ride. Thanks for listening to us air these grievances. And if you have if you want to hear more or give more you can head to our Twitter at podcast the ride head to our Instagram head to the Facebook group.

937
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:57,800
Rate and review us on iTunes if you have specific requests for the winery episode or a minimum amount of ounces that you would like each of us to drink. What is the number. What is the traditional pour for a glass of wine. Is that four ounces six ounces. Probably. I see him on the menu and in sixes and nines. OK. Yeah. We're getting up to we're getting up to 36. Mike knows this wine makes me crazy. Oh well.

938
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:11,800
And this episode is necessary. What if we do it. They probably won't let us record there. But what if we record in the car immediately. We all jam into a car the closest or get a hotel room. That's the idea.

939
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:27,800
We're going to the park. We like pull out a zoom recorder in one of our reasonably sedans. What a reasonably sized sedans. I think we can just we can just take a recorder and put it on the table. Yeah. Do it.

940
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:50,800
Just let the conversation fly. Yeah. And the audio is not going to be as good as this but whatever. Watch out. Watch out. We're going there. It's still better than the bumper car boys audio on their podcast. Let's be honest. Yeah. Go rate and review them on iTunes and get sync them sync them for us. Thanks listeners. All right. We'll catch you next time. So long. Bye.
