1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Club Three.

2
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,560
All right, let's just kick right in this time.

3
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,440
No discussion of whether Mike's gonna tell his story or not.

4
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,200
This is jam-packed, that'll come at a later time.

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,920
Unless you wanna do the 20 minutes where we talk about

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,640
if you're gonna tell the story and then don't tell the story.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,280
But let me think about telling.

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,200
Let's think about, yeah.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,800
Let me think about thinking about it.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,480
And I'll think about you thinking,

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,440
but we'll talk about you thinking about it.

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,600
No, this is, we got a lot to do here.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,480
It's Warner Brothers Studio Store,

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,720
a delightful remnant of the 90s in our childhoods.

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,800
The poll this time, the runner-up,

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,960
Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede.

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,960
Which is, I believe, the Medieval Times-esque dinner show,

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,240
horse-related show in which, to their credit,

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,040
it's not the Dixie Stampede anymore,

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,600
but how can you not think of it as that?

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,800
And I believe that there was,

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,640
what I was, maybe we'll look at it when it's not true.

23
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,880
I feel like I always heard that you could choose

24
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,320
whether your side in the dinner show

25
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,880
is the Union or the Confederacy.

26
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,680
That was my understanding of it.

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,880
And I believe it changed a long time ago,

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,360
2017, 2018, something like a long time ago.

29
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,080
A long time ago.

30
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,680
I always was under the understanding,

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,240
and maybe this is next door, the Hatfields & McCoy show.

32
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,360
Oh, uh-huh.

33
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,560
Cause that's like an easy Jedi versus Sith.

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,800
There's no definite Jedi versus Sith.

35
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,440
The Capulets and the Montagues, I guess.

36
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,640
Well, those are two families, yeah.

37
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,560
Those are both two warring families.

38
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,600
Yeah, that's better.

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,120
Jedi-Sith is more of a faction.

40
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,560
I've never heard a professor,

41
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,440
an English professor or Shakespeare scholar go,

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,040
the Capulets, those are the good guys.

43
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,280
The Montagues, those were the bad guys.

44
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,080
It's not like Jedi versus Sith.

45
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,240
Right, right.

47
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,480
And every block in, what's that town?

48
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,640
Where's Dollywood?

49
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,400
Pigeon Forge. Pigeon Forge, yeah.

50
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,640
It's nothing but versus dinner theaters.

51
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,240
Wow, that's Coke versus Pepsi.

52
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,600
This Coke, I'm sorry, this horse represents Coke.

53
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
Who are we fighting for?

54
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,920
Wow, that sounds fun.

55
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,160
That's RC Cola's music.

56
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,560
Oh, the Dark Horse.

57
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,520
The Dark Horse, it's a donkey, it's coming in.

58
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,240
Portrayed by a donkey.

59
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,960
Well, we're gonna figure that out,

60
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,640
but I, you know, why I haven't discussed this with you guys,

61
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,920
this kind of a question.

62
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,680
By the time the Club 3 is up next month,

63
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,600
we might be in Vegas mode.

64
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,440
I'm not sure we could slot it before,

65
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,400
we could slot it after.

66
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,680
I'll just say, submit any ideas you want,

67
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,960
but maybe let's get some Vegas ideas.

68
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,240
Because if we don't do it in July,

69
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,880
we'll definitely do it in August.

70
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,880
So if you got burning Vegas obscurities or passions,

71
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,760
now might be the time to do it.

72
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,160
Yeah, good tip.

73
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,080
If, we'll see, I mean, well, I think people,

74
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,600
I'm always surprised by what is in Vegas or was in Vegas.

75
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,760
So I imagine there's somebody out there

76
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,520
that has something we've never even heard of

77
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,200
that might shoot to the front of the pack.

78
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,000
I bet, try to stump us.

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,560
Yeah, I mean, there's so many,

80
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,800
like the crazy thing about Vegas for sure is like,

81
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,160
there's something that was only open for seven months,

82
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,240
but it cost a theme park amount of money.

83
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,440
Like somebody really did put money into it

84
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,480
and then like, nope, gone forever, burn it.

85
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,880
No one has a picture,

86
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,720
nobody thought to write down in a diary that it was there.

87
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,600
So if you have one of those things

88
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,000
you think only you know about, throw it in, please.

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,960
Did you know there was a Marmaduke experience

90
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,760
at Caesar's Palace from 1999 to-

91
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,760
20,000 square feet.

92
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Yeah, there was 30 different dogs

93
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,480
that all looked like Marmaduke

94
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,840
that you could interact with.

95
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,960
To train them to act like you.

96
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,800
To drag you on a leash.

97
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,600
To drag you, yeah.

98
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,760
It cost, it did take a $20 million hit the casino

99
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,200
and they had to wait 12 whole days to make that money back.

100
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,200
It was a tough year for them.

101
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,080
Tough week and a half.

102
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,440
So throw Vegas ideas out, please.

103
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,040
But for now, let's get into this thing.

104
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,480
This is from Seth Finkelstein,

105
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,320
a second time Club 3 topic winner.

106
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,640
Wow, congrats.

107
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,480
I believe now tied with Shane Cannon of Garfield Eats fame.

108
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,920
I feel like we should reward-

109
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,840
We should have a restaurant where we join,

110
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,600
people can go on a Seth side or-

111
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,480
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

112
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,080
Yes, Seth versus Shane, the ultimate dinner experience.

113
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,920
Exactly.

114
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,520
I'll leave it to Seth and Shane to tell us

115
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,880
what you like to eat and what they should serve

116
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,080
on your side.

117
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,920
The answer might just be bad chicken no matter what.

118
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,760
It's probably bad chicken.

119
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,800
But you know, give us some, you know,

120
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,720
we'll try to incorporate your taste into the theater.

121
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,520
Plastic beer stein, soup out of a pitcher.

122
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,240
The finest culinary delights.

123
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,200
Coincidentally, Seth just likes the worst,

124
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,040
most watered down soup that's ever been made.

125
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,960
So his favorite food will be represented.

126
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,800
So here's a quote from Seth.

127
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,000
With the premiere of Max, it's time to celebrate

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,640
the great brands and intellectual property

129
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,120
of Warner Brothers with a look

130
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,880
at the Warner Brothers studio store.

131
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,880
Indeed, I know.

132
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,280
And it's been a great, it's been a banner year

133
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,680
for this corporation for Warner Brothers Discovery.

134
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,280
And I'm like, it's, you know, it's actually good

135
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,080
to see you guys just to like process the flash.

136
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,400
Like, I'm just so like, I feel like soft inside

137
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,640
from the feeling of seeing all my Batmans again.

138
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,480
Oh, yeah.

139
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,160
Just seeing, and seeing the, you know,

140
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,000
the respect with which they treated these, you know,

141
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,960
deceased actors who suffered more than most human beings

142
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,320
anyway while they were alive.

143
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,280
It's sad, you know, you would think that puppeting

144
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,840
around their dead bodies, like a digital weekend

145
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,880
at Bernie's would be like a, like a bad thing.

146
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,600
But you should see how they, you should see how they do it.

147
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,080
What's the name of the, do you guys know the name

148
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,960
of the flash director?

149
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,840
I've been talking about him.

150
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,680
My new favorite director.

151
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,520
Andy Muschietti?

152
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,840
Yeah, yeah, Muschietti.

153
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,560
The way you would think it'd be bad, but Muschietti.

154
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,600
Oh, Muschietti.

155
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,440
He pulls it together.

156
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,880
Muschietti, that's how I say it.

157
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,840
I say it with a zest and a chef's kiss.

158
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,680
Yeah.

159
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,840
Muschietti.

160
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,080
He pulled it off.

161
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,400
I was gonna either send it to, send this to you somehow,

162
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,960
but I didn't want to ruin your fun.

163
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,120
I was gonna go like, and they probably,

164
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,160
all these multiverses, DC multiverses,

165
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,480
they probably didn't use the right charts.

166
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,880
There's a lot of charts.

167
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,040
There's truly a lot of charts for the DC comics.

168
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,080
Explaining multiverses, okay, okay, yeah.

169
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,560
Multiverses in the 70s, 80s,

170
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,000
and then in the 90s, they kind of reset.

171
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,280
Do you think this is a new chart?

172
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,120
Maybe they just made a new chart.

173
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,240
I think it's a new chart,

174
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,880
because they reset in 2011,

175
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,360
and then they reset with the multiversity storyline.

176
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,920
I have not seen the flash.

177
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,800
I've seen every spoiler possible,

178
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,760
because people have been tweeting everything about it.

179
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,840
I am upset though, it seems like Space Jam 2

180
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,680
paced it for the amount of cameos

181
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,240
from the Warner Brothers family.

182
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,560
Yeah, I mean, they had to focus.

183
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,680
Yeah, and it's true, because Space Jam,

184
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,240
ultimately you get more, it's a bigger Batman multiverse,

185
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,760
because in those basketball background shots,

186
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,200
you would have seven Danny DeVito penguins,

187
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,960
because they would just copy and repeat them

188
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,560
for another one in the 10th row,

189
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,600
put another one in the 30th row.

190
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,680
If you do want to see more of your favorite

191
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,840
Batman characters silent,

192
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,480
and not contributing to the story in any way, shape or form,

193
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,480
Space Jam 2 is still the place for you.

194
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,320
Still wins, and it's a grand tradition now

195
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,440
in the Warner Brothers family, I think.

196
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,480
Yeah, well, look what they're doing, right?

197
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,080
It does make this, that is correct.

198
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,360
This is, I think, a good time to talk about the brand,

199
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,040
and to analyze the brand, and this,

200
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,400
you know, the studio store, which was this way of kind of,

201
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,640
how do we sum up the brand and the vibe of the brand?

202
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,040
Because it's clearly on their minds now, again,

203
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,680
they're trying to convey it to us with these movies

204
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,680
where all of their characters meet digitally dead,

205
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,920
and do nothing together, you know?

206
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,280
And plus, you know, every two years,

207
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,000
when they have to relaunch their streamer again,

208
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,840
they also have to like summarize it,

209
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,880
and go like, we're the home of the doctors,

210
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,360
and then they have to make a poster

211
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,280
where it's Doctor Strange Love and Doctor Evil,

212
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,640
and I don't know what TV Doctor's in there,

213
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,640
the good doctor, or Cluny from ER, I don't know.

214
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,400
Yeah, Cluny, oh, spoiler, Cluny from ER isn't the Flash.

215
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,520
Oh, why do you think I'm so emotional?

216
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,280
Why do you spoil his name?

217
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,800
Jason, you know Cluny's name in ER?

218
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,760
I didn't really watch ER.

219
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,760
I didn't either.

220
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,080
Well, yeah, they open it, like, the Flash just keeps split,

221
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,840
he goes so fast that he opens up every line,

222
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,600
you see George Cluny from ER,

223
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,640
and also George Cluny from the 80s sitcom called ER,

224
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,000
that he was also on.

225
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,400
He opens up every George Cluny ER.

226
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,880
Sure, well, you can do anything if you harness the speed force,

227
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,800
I mean, if they get the treadmill in there,

228
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,600
the cosmic treadmill.

229
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,560
It's probably been in there, isn't it?

230
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,040
I haven't seen it yet.

231
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,720
We haven't seen it, but there is a treadmill

232
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,520
where Flash runs on.

233
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,840
And these are like the high point of Flash,

234
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,240
these are Grant Morrison, Mark Millar,

235
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,240
who would go on to do Wanted and Kick Ass and stuff,

236
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,600
and Mark Wade, who's like a life for comics guy.

237
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,040
They wrote a lot of great Flash comics in the late,

238
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,600
most of the 90s into the early 2000s.

239
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,200
That's true, but it's all trash now.

240
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,440
Who gives a shit about any of it now?

241
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,200
After an incredible weekend

242
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,120
of just people outpouring Flash love.

243
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,960
Flash is gonna do more for Black M.

244
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,680
And we forgive you, Ezra, Ezra, everything's cool.

245
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,560
If the movie had been less good, then maybe not,

246
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,560
but in this butt, the Flash ran so fast

247
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,680
that we forgot everything.

248
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,920
This is also a banner weekend for Max,

249
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,520
because CEO David Zaslav was mentioned

250
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,200
in a on-air wrestling promo by CM Punk.

251
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,440
Whoa.

252
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,040
How so, what was the context?

253
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,920
He was a favorite of the CEO, David Zaslav,

254
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,000
because of how much money he can bring in.

255
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,160
Yeah, he calls him one Bill Phil.

256
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,920
He's touting, he wants to be connected to Zaslav.

257
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,480
It's sort of a heel promo.

258
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,560
Depending on who you talk to, it's sort of a heel promo,

259
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,120
but he came back and this was part of his promo,

260
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,600
was talking about David Zaslav now,

261
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,960
because AEW is in the Warner family, the Max family,

262
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,800
whatever you call it.

263
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,920
I don't even know what to call it.

264
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,760
Yeah, yeah.

265
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,600
Yeah, what is it now?

266
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,120
It's Warner Brothers.

267
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,960
It's Warner Brothers.

268
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,800
I know Max's the app.

269
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,640
Warner Brothers Discovery is the whole thing.

270
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,000
Max, of course, and Max is the place

271
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,520
where you can be watching HBO if you want.

272
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,920
That's the official tagline.

273
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,560
Not AEW.

274
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,400
Not yet.

275
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,240
Not yet.

276
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,560
Even though it's one of the rosier sides

277
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,600
of Warner Brothers Discovery.

278
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,440
Success-wise.

279
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,280
Success-wise.

280
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,720
It's all rosy to me.

281
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,520
They're shaking it up at CNN,

282
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,720
they're having a blast over there.

283
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,880
Everything's going great.

284
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,520
They don't, you know, sure there's this writer's strike,

285
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,240
but a shared love for storytelling

286
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,120
is gonna bring us all back,

287
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,960
and it's gonna bring us back

288
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,240
to Warner Brothers Discovery first,

289
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,280
because that's the place where the best stories are told.

290
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,720
It's really saying something when you get booed

291
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,680
by graduating college seniors on their graduation day.

292
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,400
Like commencement speech is supposed

293
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,200
to be the most softball thing.

294
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,040
Yes.

295
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,680
And speech was the most softball thing.

296
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,520
Yeah.

297
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,280
He did his end of the softball.

298
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,120
Yeah, yeah.

299
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,040
But then why did these students throw nothing

300
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,440
but hard, hard pitches on fire?

301
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,960
They entered the speed force.

302
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,200
Yes.

303
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,800
Throwing rocks at the Sands Love's bed.

304
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,560
This, going through the Warner Brothers store

305
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,520
and all the photos and all the catalogs and everything,

306
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,480
it felt like exploring Rome before the fall.

307
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,440
The current, like going back in time

308
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,320
and seeing the glory of Rome,

309
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,840
everyone was flourishing and architecture was perfect.

310
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,600
And then thinking like, oh, this is what it looks like now.

311
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,200
It's just a shadow of what it once was.

312
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,240
Yeah.

313
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,400
This is one of the most well-preserved things

314
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,080
I think we've talked about, because-

315
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,280
Yeah, that's, yeah.

316
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,360
Pinterest and Flickr and YouTube, I mean YouTube-

317
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,800
Lots of photos.

318
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,800
I'm assuming maybe we all found the 1993 and 94 Christmas.

319
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,400
Like it's been a banner year for us.

320
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,440
And like everyone's having fun.

321
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,600
All the local employer, like Merry Christmas,

322
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,160
Happy Annika, Happy New Year, you know.

323
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,000
Everyone's having a good time.

324
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,320
Yes, these are like internal use holiday videos

325
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,200
showing how this brand is going up and up and up.

326
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,640
And not only that, everybody seems so excited,

327
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
the enthusiasm.

328
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,600
I feel like this must have been a good company to work for.

329
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,760
Maybe not like all the way on the ground,

330
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,760
maybe like all the way at the bottom, retail job, who knows?

331
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,800
But I feel like people in the middle,

332
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,720
I feel like kind of like a regional manager is psyched.

333
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,360
And I'll try to provide, I have further proof of that

334
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,360
as well, speaking of the YouTube stuff.

335
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,360
But, and look, the enthusiasm is on my end

336
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,560
for the Warner Brothers Studio Store as well.

337
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,880
I loved this store.

338
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,720
I loved it.

339
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,360
Do we all feel the same way about it?

340
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,200
100%.

341
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,800
We should be kicked out of this podcast

342
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,320
if we all didn't feel the same way about this.

343
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,160
Absolutely.

344
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,200
Yeah, thing in a mall, a thing in a mall,

345
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,840
like much like the Disney store

346
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,560
or any other weird mall oddity that, you know,

347
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,280
I know that we were all the kind of kid who wishes,

348
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,000
wished that they were at theme parks all the time

349
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,440
as much as possible.

350
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,560
But you can't be at a theme park all the time.

351
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,600
But much closer to you is a mall

352
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,280
and maybe mom has to do some boring shopping,

353
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,720
but that's okay because there's one place

354
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,880
where there are big cartoon statues and things to play with.

355
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,080
And I don't mean some boring, like little dopey sly

356
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,200
that can fit into a mall.

357
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,200
I mean, interactive IP based experiences

358
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,260
that felt made by themed entertainment crafters.

359
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,440
I mean, that were, like, this place was great.

360
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,280
It was, I'll say this, better than the Disney store.

361
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,400
And I don't think I ever vocalized that as a child,

362
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,440
but I feel it when I remember the memories of both stores.

363
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,160
And I loved the Disney store as a kid.

364
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,720
And I loved Mickey's Kitchen, of course,

365
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,160
which was in Woodfield Mall.

366
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,720
I don't wanna keep bragging about it.

367
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,560
You're so lucky.

368
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,680
But we got to try Mickey's Kitchen.

369
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,200
My parents would never drive me to Montclair.

370
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,920
All I ask is that you drive me

371
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,760
to go to a failing fast food restaurant.

372
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,040
But we have a Disney store.

373
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,000
It's five minutes away.

374
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,200
I don't care.

375
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,760
You do that all the time.

376
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,360
Show me that you love me and drive me.

377
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,120
Wait, actually, wait, no.

378
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,680
Montclair might be like an hour and a half

379
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,520
from where I grew up.

380
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,160
It would be shorter for you to have driven to Disneyland.

381
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,520
Yes, yeah, yeah.

382
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,320
But I'm bored of Disneyland.

383
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,200
I wanna go to a place

384
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,320
with only one Disney themed restaurant

385
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,920
that's worse than some of the ones in Disneyland.

386
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,440
Scott, I wanna go a step further.

387
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,240
And Warner Brothers Suites store,

388
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,920
if I saw one that was like, drop what you're doing.

389
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,440
We're going in there now.

390
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,680
And I didn't have it at the local malls,

391
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,640
but the nice, the big malls

392
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,120
and out of town weekend trips.

393
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,240
So we're talking King of Prussia,

394
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,960
which is one of the biggest shopping,

395
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,680
like Mall of America, for a little while,

396
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,480
the Syracuse Sky Center, I think it was called,

397
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,880
or Carousel Center, excuse me.

398
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,880
These were like the biggest shopping areas in the country.

399
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,080
So of course they had massive Warner Brothers stores.

400
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,240
Washington DC, Baltimore, they had Warner Brothers stores.

401
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,960
So this is a sign that you're somewhere elevated.

402
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,800
Somewhere elevated.

403
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,200
And I'm sure we'll get to it,

404
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,200
cause I have a clip and maybe we all pulled it,

405
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,520
but the Atlantic City Boardwalk.

406
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,360
Of course.

407
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,920
That was a primo one.

408
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,200
And the revelations of like,

409
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,160
oh, I didn't remember this from childhood.

410
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,680
The man, the man himself.

411
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,760
What's great about, yeah, I guess,

412
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,040
well, we're for sure getting into this,

413
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,880
but each store had different,

414
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,880
like specifically made like statues

415
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,560
of the Looney Tunes characters dressed in different attire,

416
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,600
depending on what the location was.

417
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,440
Yeah.

418
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,800
So you get totally unique,

419
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,480
different like outfits for the characters.

420
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,080
You didn't feel like you were,

421
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,080
hey, you know what?

422
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,960
Here's a bold statement.

423
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,440
Warner Brothers Studios stores were better than Galaxy's Edge.

424
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,280
And here's why.

425
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,880
Because you go to Galaxy's Edge in California,

426
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,000
then you go to Orlando, it's the exact same thing.

427
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,680
Been there, I don't need to,

428
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,840
but Warner Brothers Studios stores

429
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,760
different everywhere you go.

430
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,240
So obviously I've made the case.

431
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,400
I think we can all agree on this.

432
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,680
Ancient Rome Looney Tunes is different

433
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,800
from turn of the century, Seaside Resort Looney Tunes.

434
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,600
You know, these are all different Looney Tunes.

435
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,840
It's different than the beach,

436
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,800
chilling out LA style with a big flip phone.

437
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,680
Oh, LA had so many.

438
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,520
I just read it.

439
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,360
Yeah, I know.

440
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,560
I wish I came out here for just to go

441
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,120
to the Warner Brothers stores when I was a kid.

442
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,960
Just on a trip.

443
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,800
Yeah.

444
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,800
There was like a community open Google doc of like,

445
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
okay, I think this is the full list

446
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,200
that I've been able to find in Warner Brothers stores.

447
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,920
And I saw it missing a few.

448
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,120
So it's not a hundred percent accurate,

449
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,560
but the LA area had so many.

450
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,560
Woodfield Mall, one of the first.

451
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,240
I believe.

452
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,800
The second is what I saw.

453
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,640
Wow.

454
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,480
I think.

455
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,440
The memories, I was trying to figure out

456
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,240
it was there a more exciting store.

457
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,920
And I don't think so.

458
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,520
I can certainly, there's a handful of stores

459
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,520
I found very exciting, but I don't know.

460
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,840
That might've been number one.

461
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,520
Do you ever have like a nature company with a little,

462
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,520
I forget if the one at City Walk,

463
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,280
used and that look, that's no mere mall.

464
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,120
That's City Walk.

465
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,600
But the City Walk one had like a walkthrough

466
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,000
that was a little forest.

467
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,440
And it smelled like the ET forest in there.

468
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,080
And you could pick up rain sticks

469
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,600
and tip them over and shake them.

470
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,400
And I think other nature companies

471
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,640
may have had some little walkthrough.

472
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,480
That's an interesting thing.

473
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,480
So that's one of the only, like,

474
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,640
oh, I get to go in a little rainforest.

475
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,400
But I don't think a lot of them had it.

476
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,640
I also like the store, the Imaginarium,

477
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,760
because there was a little door for kids to use.

478
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,840
But once you're past the little door,

479
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,520
then it's a bunch of toys I can't play with

480
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,280
because they're in a package.

481
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,040
And Disney Store is great.

482
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,840
I like the clips they're playing.

483
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,960
And I like all those little dioramas

484
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,120
and see whatever you wanna call them.

485
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,400
You know, the maquettes, the statues, I'm not sure.

486
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,120
But there was not like,

487
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,480
there were not environments to explore in any of these.

488
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,440
So it's gotta be Warner Brothers, right?

489
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,080
I think it has to be.

490
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,800
I think the combination of environments

491
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,120
and then also looking back at pictures of the stores,

492
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,120
the catalogs and some of the items aimed at

493
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,360
older folks, adults, and young adults and stuff.

494
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,440
There's an attempt to be tasteful.

495
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,280
Does that make sense?

496
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,120
There's jewelry counters in the Warner Brothers store.

497
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,120
There's expensive statues and cookie jars

498
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,440
and coffee, home goods. Tasteful's the word

499
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,520
you're looking for.

500
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,320
I think it's trying to elevate.

501
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,000
Elevate it. Elevate crap.

502
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,640
But it worked. Let's not overlook that it worked.

503
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm not saying it's bad.

504
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,360
I'm saying that maybe the word is unright.

505
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,080
That's all. This was a real time,

506
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,600
I feel like, where it kinda worked.

507
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,640
Where, you know, Tasmanian devil shirts

508
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,080
had a real cultural era.

509
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,240
This was kinda the time of the huge jacket

510
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,520
with the puffy sleeves.

511
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,680
The store had to be a lot of what caused that.

512
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,600
Here, there are so many, I hope this just works.

513
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,280
Pepe Le Pew things you can buy for your wedding

514
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,280
in this one catalog, where you can get champagne sippers.

515
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,840
You can get cake slicers with Pepe in this.

516
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,280
The cat he was always seducing, quote unquote.

517
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,320
Yeah. Champagne glasses, a wedding cake topper,

518
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,320
plush where they're in a bride's outfit,

519
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,200
a dress, and a tuxedo.

520
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,960
Like. Look, this is all very romantic,

521
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,320
assuming that she is a willing participant in this wedding.

522
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,240
Which we're not sure.

523
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,840
Assuming that the cat, we don't know the full story.

524
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,560
It doesn't look good at the start.

525
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,280
No, and we have cartoons to prove.

526
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,520
We have evidence.

527
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,360
Yeah.

528
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,200
So.

529
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,160
Maybe canonically.

530
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,400
They gave them a willing wedding,

531
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,600
and if that's the case,

532
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,160
then these cake cutters are really romantic.

533
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,240
Yeah.

534
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,360
How about this tasteful statue?

535
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,520
Here's Bugs Bunny playing the saxophone.

536
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,360
Tastful?

537
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,080
Wait, you saw that street lamp?

538
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,920
Street lamp.

539
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,760
Elevated.

540
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,600
Elevated.

541
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,440
Fancy.

542
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,520
Tastful, I think is funny.

543
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,360
Tastful.

544
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,480
That's the most tasteful bunny

545
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,200
you've ever seen play the saxophone.

546
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,240
Oh my God, is that Bugs playing a saxophone?

547
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,320
What a tasteful piece.

548
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,200
Who knows what tasteful things you'll find

549
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,560
in the Batman Forever tie-in catalog.

550
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,400
Of course I have.

551
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,240
I saw that.

552
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,080
I saw that, yeah.

553
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,920
Oh my God.

554
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,120
And we're recording on the day

555
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,520
when Kevin Smith is about to reveal

556
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,920
that he has seen the Schumacher cut of Batman Forever.

557
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,760
Oh.

558
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,720
He's gonna talk about it today.

559
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,760
He's recording whatever it's premiering today.

560
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,520
So will we hear it by the end of the day?

561
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,360
I'm sorry.

562
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,200
I know let me correct myself.

563
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,520
Will you hear it by the end of the day?

564
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,360
Yeah, I will, yeah.

565
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,400
And tell us about it

566
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,160
because I'm not going anywhere near that.

567
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,640
Luckily, okay.

568
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,600
Luckily, where this is on topic for the Warner Brothers store

569
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,200
because Batman and Batman Forever,

570
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,160
but like Akiva Goldsman also in a recent interview

571
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,200
was like, I've seen the Schumacher cut.

572
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,720
So someone in Warner Brothers is like

573
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,120
giving this to people to watch.

574
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,960
Wow.

575
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,360
So it exists on some levels.

576
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,160
I feel like we are going to get it

577
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,000
in one form or another.

578
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,040
You're gonna get the Schumacher cut.

579
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,880
I think so.

580
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,960
In our lifetimes.

581
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,800
I think so.

582
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,840
Probably on Max.

583
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,320
We'll have to sign back up for Max.

584
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,200
Maybe.

585
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,360
Yeah, yeah.

586
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,200
Yeah.

587
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,640
But is it too evil now?

588
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,360
Are they not gonna see the upside

589
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,320
and paying for the Schumacher cut?

590
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,200
I don't know if they have to.

591
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,480
Joel Schumacher is dead.

592
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,840
So they don't have to give him any money maybe.

593
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,880
So true.

594
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,720
I'm not sure.

595
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,480
I don't know what deal they have with everybody involved

596
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,040
if it's gonna cost so much money

597
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,440
that it won't be worth it.

598
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,280
I don't know.

599
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,120
We'll see.

600
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,400
You're saying Akiva Goldsmith, Ken Smith,

601
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,360
willing to sanction Jim Carrey's buffoonery,

602
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,280
but you don't know if the accounting department

603
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,440
at Warner Brothers is willing to sanction it.

604
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,520
That is what I'm saying, yeah.

605
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,440
Okay.

606
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,280
So we'll see.

607
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,280
I'm hopeful that we will get the full two and a half hour,

608
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,120
two hour 45 minute cut of Batman Forever

609
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,760
with all the dark stuff put back into it.

610
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,720
We'll see.

611
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,120
And with like, I don't know, maybe like Chase Meridian

612
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,560
and like a little negligee or something.

613
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,480
Like an outfit that we didn't see in the-

614
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,760
Yeah, but maybe like a different one.

615
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,520
Yeah, maybe a more sheer one.

616
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,840
Yes, that's what I'm thinking.

617
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,160
We'll inch up and a little inch down in certain directions.

618
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,360
Yes, and if yes, if she,

619
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,840
maybe just a longer like horny rooftop scene or something.

620
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,480
Maybe just a little bit like a couple more lines

621
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,120
of dialogue, suggestive dialogue or something.

622
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,560
She sucked his codpiece.

623
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,320
Of course they're not gonna-

624
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,160
For some reason.

625
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,320
Like I'm not filled, I know that in that movie,

626
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,160
that's for 10 year olds,

627
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,440
they're not gonna show actual oral sex,

628
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,200
but there's nothing inappropriate about showing a woman-

629
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,160
A codpiece?

630
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,440
Licking a codpiece.

631
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,240
Well, I mean, let's say she is a successful doctor,

632
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,160
so we can at least assume she has a full closet

633
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,880
of slips and camisoles.

634
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,720
Mm-hmm.

635
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,560
So there's any-

636
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,560
Plenty of time to see all of them.

637
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,520
Number, yeah, time to see all of them.

638
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,760
Yeah, well, look, there'll be plenty of time.

639
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,520
If this indeed gets announced for release,

640
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,040
we'll have to do a pre-episode and a post-episode.

641
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,680
Our feelings before we see it, our feelings after.

642
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,840
So at that point, then we can speculate

643
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,160
on all kinds of scenes that might appear in the new cut.

644
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,760
We can get a lot of content out of that.

645
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,600
Yeah.

646
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,440
Oh, absolutely.

647
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,160
I mean, I know Kevin already is,

648
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,680
but he's trying to be kind of the face of it.

649
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,080
But like, you know.

650
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,800
And then maybe Batman Forever 2 is right around the corner.

651
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,680
I do feel, and it actually posts to the Flash.

652
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,960
Well, maybe not because the Flash was not,

653
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,280
not everyone opened their hearts to the Flash,

654
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,680
but it feels like the actual contents of the Flash

655
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,560
lead us closer to Batman Forever 2 than ever before.

656
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,400
I agree, I completely agree.

657
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,240
Yeah, so.

658
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,480
Yeah, anyway.

659
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,920
We'll see, fingers crossed.

660
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,120
Okay, to step back a little bit.

661
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,960
Actually, you know, all right,

662
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,560
let me go back to this like brand issue.

663
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,160
This like, what is the Warner Brothers brand?

664
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,680
To me, it was crystal clear at this time.

665
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,000
And I don't know if it was just because of the store,

666
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,360
that was certainly part of it.

667
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,600
But I know they've struggled to make all of these things

668
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,440
fit under one confusing umbrella.

669
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,000
And it's even the craziest now that like, all right,

670
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
how do we explain that we are Dr. Pill Popper

671
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,600
and the Matrix?

672
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,880
How do I like, and an increasingly unpopular CNN.

673
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,640
How do we sum that all up?

674
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,640
But at the time of this, when it's a smaller corporate,

675
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,720
we're Time Warner, we're not AOL Time Warner yet,

676
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,520
it made a lot of sense to me.

677
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,440
It's okay, I know that it's the Looney Tunes,

678
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,360
those are still on TV and I like them.

679
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,760
They're a little more for my parents.

680
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,480
I know that's what my parents liked,

681
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,600
but I have my own Looney Tunes, the Tiny Tunes.

682
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,280
And I know that Batman and Superman

683
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,040
are in this umbrella as well.

684
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,760
And then there's, yeah, there's Tiny Tunes for me

685
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,520
and there's Animaniacs and Animaniacs especially

686
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,360
makes fun of all of it.

687
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,360
And I'll see, you'll see Plucky Duck dressed up as Batman

688
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,840
and you'll see an Animaniacs parody of something else

689
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,880
in the umbrella of like, do they only treasure

690
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,360
the Sierra Madre?

691
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,120
I think it all made sense to me.

692
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,320
Those all feel like disparate things,

693
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,120
but it's like cartoon icons and some are classic

694
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,640
and they'll always be beloved and some are new and hip

695
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,120
and sardonic and they poke fun at the old ones

696
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,960
and they all live together at the mall and I go see them.

697
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,080
Yeah, I think maybe this is what you're saying,

698
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,880
just everything felt very relevant to me.

699
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,560
Every character seemingly seemed relevant

700
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,200
and they had just recently added like Hannah Barbera

701
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,480
into the mix.

702
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,600
It was maybe a little bit into the run of the studio,

703
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,440
that might have been a mid 90s.

704
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,280
Yes.

705
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,360
Because I was gonna say like with that even

706
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,280
when that got added.

707
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,880
That was Turner, Turner.

708
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,720
Right.

709
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,760
Turner acquisition, when they combined,

710
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,880
that got them the Hannah Barbera and sure enough,

711
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,040
there is a graphic with Fred Flintstone next to Bugs Bunny.

712
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,600
Yeah, but those all maybe were not quite as relevant,

713
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,000
but they felt like, oh, they're getting an upgrade now

714
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
or something too.

715
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,840
Friends.

716
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,240
So it felt like everything in the store

717
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,080
was like cool at the time.

718
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,920
Yeah.

719
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,000
It didn't feel, yeah, dated.

720
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,480
Also with Animaniacs, I can't say enough about Tower,

721
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,840
at least to me as a kid in the early 90s,

722
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,360
loved Animaniacs and it really tied it all together,

723
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,840
including that suddenly you're into that water tower.

724
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
So then the water tower on the Warner Brothers lot

725
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,840
is something, because that's where they live

726
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,160
and I grew up around here.

727
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,280
I didn't grow up near that, but if we went by it

728
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,560
or we're in the area and like, oh wow, the tower.

729
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,160
I still think that driving by it.

730
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,040
You still think of the Animaniacs every time?

731
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,880
Yeah.

732
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,600
I go to the fucking tower from the Animaniacs.

733
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,240
Which only a couple years prior

734
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,760
would have not meant anything.

735
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,720
It's a pretty modest tower.

736
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,440
I mean, it's in the logo and everything.

737
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,440
It's cool and as you know, that's Warner Brothers

738
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,320
and they shot famous movies here for sure,

739
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,120
but yes, I drive by and I go into the Animaniacs house.

740
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,800
They still have the, if you're driving by it

741
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,640
on Olive, which from Burbank leads you into Hollywood.

742
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,400
There's still, there's that huge space

743
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,880
where there'll be big murals, usually for animated shows.

744
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,720
Yes.

745
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,560
They're doing.

746
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,120
So a couple of times I got to see that when I was a kid

747
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,120
and it's probably some big collage of all of them.

748
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,920
I'm like, this is a magical place.

749
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,040
It looks like old Hollywood, the studio itself,

750
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,120
but they're making things that do matter to me now.

751
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,960
They're making new Batman that is good,

752
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,520
the movies and the animated series.

753
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,000
It all made sense, right?

754
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,040
Yeah, it was a magic time.

755
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,920
It was a magic time.

756
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,240
Probably worth examining the evolution

757
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,160
of the Warner Brothers mural wall.

758
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,600
Cause I thought it was documented.

759
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,360
I think when I first came to LA,

760
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,360
I think it was more Looney Tunes, more client.

761
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,560
And then it's been updated so much over the years.

762
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,320
Well, they have to trade out different shows

763
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,840
that they then would pull from Max Forever

764
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,480
two years later after spending millions of dollars.

765
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,560
Judging their behavior, it just makes them furious

766
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,400
to have successful animated things that people like.

767
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,280
I was gonna let this go and then Jason brought it up again.

768
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,120
And now I have to say,

769
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,520
it's not one of these things where I have to say it.

770
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,840
You're talking about the wall where you drive by on Olive.

771
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,680
Yeah.

772
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,960
And for a long time it was Justice League.

773
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,800
Okay.

774
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,920
And you would see at night,

775
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,640
the villains would be illuminated on the bottom of it.

776
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,920
So it was some paint effect or whatever.

777
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,200
So they look spooky, like campfire lighting.

778
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,920
So you would see Joker and you would see whoever else,

779
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,760
Lex Luthor or something.

780
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,000
And here is my confession to you right now

781
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,240
that I've never shared with anybody.

782
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,400
There was some, for some reason,

783
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,000
when I first moved out here and I would drive by there,

784
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,120
I would feel weird and creeped out.

785
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,720
I got some sort of weird intrusive thought in my head

786
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,480
that I would get freaked out by this mural

787
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,960
specifically at night to the point where I would avoid it

788
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,440
for like six months, seven months,

789
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,080
because I used to work right around there.

790
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,240
But all your friends are on it.

791
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,920
I don't know how to explain this.

792
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,400
And this is, I haven't thought about this in years

793
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,960
because I know I drive by it all the time

794
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,400
and it's been switched so many times.

795
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,880
And I don't think about it at all.

796
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,400
But there were a few months, maybe a year,

797
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,320
maybe two years where I had this bizarre,

798
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,720
I would even describe it like when you talk about

799
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,360
like a fear of some big thing in a small room or something.

800
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,840
It was so weird.

801
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,560
I cannot even qualify or quantify what it is about it,

802
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,880
but I would almost have to like in an OCD way,

803
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,520
try to avoid driving past this mural

804
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,880
on the Warner Brothers lot.

805
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,720
What?

806
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,840
I don't know what it is.

807
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:37,200
It was like a nauseating kind of green and purple.

808
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,040
I think it was sort of a big thing.

809
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,880
It was bad guys.

810
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,720
It was your friend's enemy.

811
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,800
I think it was a size thing.

812
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,080
I think it comes back to when I was talking about

813
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,200
how I used to be very afraid of like inflatable things.

814
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,120
Inflatable things like at a car dealership.

815
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,240
And I think there was some old buried memory

816
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,840
that was triggered by this specific,

817
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,160
did you find it?

818
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,000
It's probably on there somewhere.

819
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,480
I don't think the one I'm looking at is it

820
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,760
cause it doesn't have villains.

821
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,600
It's just-

822
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,440
Well you won't be able to see it.

823
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,280
Cause-

824
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,200
Oh, I see, wait.

825
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,520
Exactly as you said that.

826
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,240
I found a different picture where they're all like

827
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,160
half opaque.

828
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,000
Yes.

829
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,760
Wow. Well it's a little scary.

830
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,800
I mean, I still don't understand exactly why you would-

831
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,840
It's not scary.

832
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,720
I'm telling you, I can't explain what it exactly was.

833
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,080
I wasn't going by it going,

834
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,080
oh, the Joker is going to get me.

835
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,800
I think that on some level it was a size thing

836
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,640
from when I was a kid.

837
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,400
And for whatever reason,

838
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,760
this thing one day kind of gave me an intrusive thought.

839
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,400
Just an aura of foreboding as they say.

840
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,760
As they say on the mansion.

841
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,240
Yeah. So I would sort of,

842
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,880
I would avoid that for a long time,

843
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,960
which is not a convenient street to avoid.

844
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,200
If you're trying to get into Hollywood from Burbank,

845
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,200
you'd have to kind of go around

846
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,200
or go all the way down to Lancasham or something,

847
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,320
or go around to Luca Lake.

848
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,680
You could get around, I guess,

849
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,880
go by the smokehouse.

850
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,640
Was it just the villain component

851
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,960
because this big billboard,

852
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,320
this billboard also has Tweety and Scooby Doo on it.

853
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,560
You're not bothered by Tweety and Scooby Doo.

854
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,400
I'm telling you,

855
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,600
I don't think it has anything to do

856
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,480
with the actual characters.

857
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,320
I'm not afraid of Scooby Doo.

858
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,240
Yes, but the treatment is different.

859
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,160
So you're not, are you afraid of the big top ones

860
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,680
or only the scary glowy ones at the bottom?

861
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,560
Well, afraid is even maybe the wrong word

862
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,400
because I don't look at that and I don't feel fearful,

863
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,560
but I do feel some sort of like weirdness in my stomach.

864
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,880
If it's like on something unsettling about it.

865
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,280
And I don't know why it's a hall of justice.

866
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,480
It's the Bruce Tim DC universe, which I am very fond of.

867
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,120
I would think you'd want to see this as much as possible.

868
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,200
Yeah, it's really strange.

869
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,880
Maybe it was too real for me.

870
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,720
I don't know.

871
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,880
I think I could drive by it right now if it was still up.

872
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,160
Now I forget what it is.

873
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,280
It's changed into, it was Thundercast Roar for a while.

874
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,640
Yeah, it was Philander Katz Roar.

875
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,120
I swear I drive by it.

876
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,760
I don't think twice about that anymore,

877
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,040
but I really cannot tell you,

878
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,360
I'm usually decent at analyzing myself.

879
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,280
I cannot tell you what it was about it.

880
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,480
This is funny, cause this was like my initial,

881
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,280
this was my entry level to LA.

882
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,160
Cause I in college lived at the Oakwoods for a semester,

883
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,040
the apartments, the furnished apartments

884
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,440
that it put people up at temporarily

885
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,720
be those college students or people out here for pilots.

886
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,440
And then the Ithaca satellite campus for a long time

887
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,680
has been in this office building at the corner.

888
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,720
And then people would intern at Universal or Warner Brothers.

889
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,120
And there's a bank and a pizza place on that strip.

890
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,200
So it was like, it was convenient and it was quiet.

891
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,600
And it wasn't super zooey except at rush hour

892
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,440
in the morning and the evening.

893
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,280
Super zooey.

894
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,920
It's a little zooey.

895
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,560
That actually, that bar and backs up,

896
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,040
that street backs up a lot.

897
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,280
Well, right now I pass by it

898
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,880
and there's all these fucking people everywhere,

899
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,880
yelling, waving signs.

900
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,720
Get a light.

901
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,160
I don't know who they are,

902
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,720
but I tried to drive my car into them the other day.

903
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,800
Okay, get out of here.

904
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,280
It's too zooey here.

905
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,040
How are these stomp drummers?

906
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,040
They're banging on trash cans.

907
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,400
It's a bunch of clamp trap.

908
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Warner Brothers don't stomp.

909
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,240
They might.

910
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,200
The billboards need to teach us.

911
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,720
Well, I'm very curious what this spall means.

912
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,960
I am too for you.

913
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,760
Honestly, I am too.

914
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,480
But all right, so despite those fears that you had,

915
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,920
we got a warm feeling from the place.

916
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,760
A hundred percent.

917
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,600
Yes.

918
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,760
And you'd get them from the store.

919
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,040
I think also, okay, the fact that it is,

920
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,720
if you've ever been by the lot,

921
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,520
I think, I work on the lot,

922
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,480
like it's a, it does have an old Hollywood feel

923
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,600
more than a lot of lots have.

924
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,040
And I think they brought some of that

925
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,760
into the vibe of the store too.

926
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,680
Cause I really like just the marquees,

927
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,480
the gold on black and it's very art deco.

928
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,920
It feels a lot, it has a lot in common,

929
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,880
I feel like with that, you know,

930
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,160
big at that time 90s Gotham vibe,

931
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,880
like I think it tied that together too.

932
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,360
Cause Gotham is sort of perennially 40s.

933
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,200
Right.

934
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,760
Especially in the Burton or Schumacher mood.

935
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,760
Yeah, yeah, the stores felt to me,

936
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,560
there was a distinct Gotham vibe

937
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,960
just before you even go into the place.

938
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,200
Some of the ones that had giant marquees outside

939
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:13,200
like Atlantic City had very Burton, Batman,

940
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,480
Gotham City accents.

941
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,320
Yeah. I feel like.

942
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,160
Absolutely.

943
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,640
In the way that some of the Planet Hollywood

944
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,200
also does, you know, similar art direction and such.

945
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,600
Yeah. I mean, it wasn't,

946
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,520
I have the same fondness for them that I do

947
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,320
for Planet Hollywood that either it's at my local mall

948
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,880
or I'd go on vacations and get to see just these big,

949
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,920
gaudy, bright kid things, you know?

950
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,240
And I feel like there's been a blandening

951
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,080
of everything a little bit.

952
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,040
And it was just like exciting touches of kind of like,

953
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,840
places that you'd get to go.

954
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,680
Especially as this grew and grew

955
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,320
and it spread so quickly.

956
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,680
Mike, the Schomburg one was your, the second one,

957
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,800
one other great feather in the cap

958
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,400
of this great shopping center.

959
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,240
Yeah.

960
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,600
Anything about yours you remember specifically?

961
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,440
You know what's funny?

962
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,960
The thing I remember the most was the,

963
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,680
like paint a Looney Tunes screen.

964
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,680
Where you could just go,

965
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,520
that's the strongest memory I have of it is where, yeah,

966
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,240
you could pick Bugs Bunny or whatever,

967
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,720
and then it felt like future technology where you pick red

968
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,720
and you'd make his head red.

969
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,360
Like this was just like mind blowing to me.

970
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,840
It all was really similar to the post show

971
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,960
of the Hanna-Barbera, the Fantastic World

972
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,640
at Universal Florida.

973
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,600
Digital touchscreens, black and white character,

974
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,160
like a digital coloring book.

975
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,160
Wow, cool.

976
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,080
And then let's not go too far

977
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,520
without talking about something I imagine all of them had.

978
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,120
I hope they all had Marvin's Rocket.

979
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,960
Yes.

980
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,360
This is 80% of it right here.

981
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,560
Why to love it.

982
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,840
If you were in Marvin's Rocket, you're having a great day.

983
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,360
This is Marvin the Martian.

984
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,000
And I always liked those a lot.

985
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,840
But you got to like, it was a little space

986
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,360
only kids could fit in.

987
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,240
You crawl in there and there are so many buttons.

988
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,760
There's so many noises to make.

989
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,800
Just like, there's one video of it

990
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
decently preserved on YouTube.

991
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,880
And if you get four kids in there,

992
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,000
it is just the most cacophony you could possibly make.

993
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,640
So many things I feel like would have buttons

994
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,040
for kids to push that wouldn't do much.

995
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,880
Yeah.

996
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,600
So just going a little bit at the extra mile for kids

997
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,440
to make them feel like a button was doing something.

998
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,280
Yeah, really.

999
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,840
Felt like amazing as well.

1000
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,360
Yeah, hey, again, I'll go back to it

1001
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,000
better than Galaxy's Edge.

1002
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,560
Smuggler's Run, some buttons do make a big sound,

1003
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,560
but some of them just go like bloop, bloop.

1004
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,560
This thing, you get an iconic mel blank sound effect

1005
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,560
when you push it.

1006
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,400
Is it better?

1007
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,240
You're saying it's better.

1008
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,080
Yeah, there's another reason why.

1009
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,800
Better than Smuggler's Run.

1010
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,960
Better than Smuggler's.

1011
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,280
Yeah, maybe.

1012
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,200
Yeah, maybe.

1013
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,920
If you're in the iconic rocket of Marvin the Martian,

1014
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,520
just like the Millennium Falcon.

1015
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,360
Yeah.

1016
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,640
But you're even getting more like,

1017
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,840
the Falcon, I've seen it, you know?

1018
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,120
I've seen it in a movie.

1019
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,480
I don't really know what it's like in Marvin's Rocket.

1020
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,320
Right.

1021
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,320
And it's less frustrating in Marvin's Rocket.

1022
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,160
Yes.

1023
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,200
You get rewards no matter what you do.

1024
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,040
Right.

1025
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,440
You really know, you might not know what Coaxium is,

1026
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,160
but you knew Marvin the Martian

1027
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,800
because of cartoons and syndication

1028
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,960
and t-shirts with the giant,

1029
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,160
the biggest screen printed image you've ever seen.

1030
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,000
Yeah.

1031
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,840
Yes.

1032
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,920
He is huge on shirts.

1033
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,760
He's huge.

1034
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,080
At school and at theme park.

1035
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,480
I see Marvin more than I see some family members.

1036
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,800
Weird little guy in the cartoons,

1037
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,560
huge on the Peggy t-shirts.

1038
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,000
My dad, I was asking him,

1039
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,080
I was like, what do you remember at Warner Brothers stories?

1040
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,320
Like, were we trying to track down

1041
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,360
Marvin the Martian figurine for you?

1042
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,800
And I'm like, look,

1043
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,800
between my outings to Warner Brothers Studio Stores,

1044
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,640
you going out of town on business

1045
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,360
and inevitably finding a Warner Brothers store

1046
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,080
when you like went to a mall

1047
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,160
and Six Flags Great Adventure,

1048
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,640
I think I assembled a full Duck Dodgers.

1049
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,120
I think I got Daffy and Porky and Marvin and the dog.

1050
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,240
Like it's like, I think we assembled that.

1051
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,800
And I full disclosure,

1052
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,440
I love the Warner Brothers Studio Store.

1053
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,000
I think total over the years,

1054
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,120
I spent maybe $15 on little PVC figurines.

1055
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,480
I don't think I ever bought anything large there.

1056
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,440
Yeah, I don't think, yeah, I was trying to recall,

1057
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,160
do I have memories of anything I bought?

1058
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,720
I think I would just go and run around,

1059
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,880
which maybe was part of the downfall.

1060
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,640
Yeah, it was a playground and you don't buy anything

1061
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,560
or your parents don't want to.

1062
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,600
I think my parents didn't want to.

1063
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,280
I think I wanted big stuff,

1064
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,240
but I think maybe I got like a toy or a shirt

1065
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,080
and that was it.

1066
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,320
And the shirts I think were more expensive

1067
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,040
than shirts everywhere else.

1068
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,520
That's my memory, which could have meant they were $25.

1069
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,880
Yes, at that time.

1070
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,720
Yeah, yeah.

1071
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,360
And like $10, $5 is what shirts for little boys were.

1072
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,680
Well, and now like Looney Tunes shirts

1073
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,080
or Warner Brothers Store stuff at resale websites,

1074
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,560
like Etsy and Depop or Jane finds it at like vintage store.

1075
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,920
It's incredibly expensive, this stuff now.

1076
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,960
Sure, yeah.

1077
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,240
Can I ask who, was Marvin your guy?

1078
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,080
Was Marvin your guy from Looney Tunes?

1079
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,280
Well, I think Marvin and Taz.

1080
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,720
So you equally would split that they were your favorites?

1081
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,000
I think them and Buster Bunny to some extent.

1082
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,400
Okay, you're adding, you keep adding to this.

1083
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,000
I keep adding because there's so many friends.

1084
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,840
Okay, all right.

1085
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,680
So you have three, it's a three-way tie.

1086
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,520
I think Marvin and Taz were the big ones.

1087
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,600
Take Buster out, take Looney Tunes out of the universe.

1088
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,440
Yeah, that's a different universe.

1089
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,280
Yeah, okay, fair enough.

1090
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,120
And of the core Looney Tunes, who was your guy?

1091
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,680
You know what, I'm gonna make you choose.

1092
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,520
Huh?

1093
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,640
I'm gonna make you choose.

1094
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,480
Oh, wow.

1095
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,080
Taz or Marvin.

1096
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,920
Who do you like better?

1097
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,000
That's pretty good.

1098
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,120
Yeah, yeah, I never tried that.

1099
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,600
I think it's gotta be Taz.

1100
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,440
I was in the 90s.

1101
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,280
Oh, my God.

1102
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,120
Taz, okay.

1103
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:06,960
Good choice, good choice.

1104
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,960
I bought the adult version of the kids Taz shirt I had

1105
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,520
thanks to listeners finding it on eBay.

1106
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,360
Oh, wow.

1107
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,180
Scott, who's your guy?

1108
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,020
Daffy.

1109
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,860
Okay.

1110
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,800
Yeah, clever sardonic.

1111
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,320
Daffy's sure for me.

1112
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,640
Who doesn't get mad?

1113
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,080
Who's yours?

1114
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,120
Wiley Coyote.

1115
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,440
Oh, cool.

1116
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,840
I haven't talked about them yet.

1117
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,680
Mm-hmm.

1118
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,000
Any particular rationale?

1119
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,720
I really don't know why.

1120
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,560
I'm not sure.

1121
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,880
Again, there's a lot of things I'm saying today

1122
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,560
that I don't really have a good explanation for.

1123
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,680
I had a plush of him on my bed.

1124
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,040
I think I liked it when he would talk.

1125
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,000
I liked the ones where he would talk.

1126
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,960
I think I found him.

1127
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,960
Those are funny.

1128
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,800
Yeah.

1129
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,040
I thought it was funny that he was smart,

1130
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,880
but then he'd get shit kicked out of him.

1131
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,680
Did you relate it to a character

1132
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,000
with a lot of anxieties and dealing with grief?

1133
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,840
Like, oh, good grief.

1134
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,520
Did Wiley have a lot of anxiety?

1135
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,800
I mean, he was always trying.

1136
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,240
None of his solutions would work.

1137
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,480
It's one way to put it.

1138
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,160
He was trying to get Roadrunner,

1139
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,000
and it would never work.

1140
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,960
I mean, it would never work,

1141
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,280
but they would show it, I guess,

1142
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,520
as he went on in the cartoon,

1143
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,880
but he didn't seem, it didn't read to me.

1144
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,800
I could see you being like,

1145
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,960
okay, so there's this company called Acme, right?

1146
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,440
And they have all these gadgets,

1147
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,040
and they're actually really reasonably priced,

1148
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,640
and I get the alerts for when the items go on sale.

1149
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,040
And yeah, often they don't work,

1150
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,920
but that's a little like over, you know,

1151
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,040
if you read a lot online,

1152
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,880
if you read comments,

1153
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,480
you see that like sometimes the traps do work.

1154
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,520
Quite often, and it's like the ones where they fail

1155
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,640
are the only ones that get attention.

1156
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,480
So.

1157
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,300
The best day of my life

1158
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,400
when one of those big crates arrives,

1159
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,160
and I gotta use a crew bar to pry the top open.

1160
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,480
I have a whole display in my house now,

1161
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,320
just for the Acme stuff.

1162
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,440
I collect all of the Acme stuff.

1163
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,920
Yeah, I have a lot of eating crate Acme stuff.

1164
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,680
It actually makes more sense for me

1165
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,000
to subscribe to Acme Plus,

1166
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,880
because I get the shipping for free, you know,

1167
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,840
because if you just buy five guns a month,

1168
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,120
and like, and a couple of ropes, you can mix and match,

1169
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,320
but like it actually ends up being a pretty good deal.

1170
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,160
Good point.

1171
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,800
So I become Wile E. Coyote in a lot of ways,

1172
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,760
is what you're saying.

1173
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,240
I said, yeah, I see it.

1174
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,200
I think that's right.

1175
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,240
I'm like a tall guy, like he is,

1176
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,080
compared to somebody else.

1177
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,080
Oh, you are, yeah.

1178
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:07,920
I look like him.

1179
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,840
Is your hair, the top of your hair looks maybe like.

1180
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,960
Like the ears.

1181
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,400
Sure. Yeah.

1182
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,160
You got headphones on right now.

1183
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,000
Yeah.

1184
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,840
Okay.

1185
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,660
Looks like Coyote ears.

1186
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,040
Every now and then to keep you on your toes,

1187
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,760
Scott and I will paint a tunnel on a wall.

1188
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,600
I'll run right into it.

1189
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,720
See if you can run right into it.

1190
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,440
I think we're all like our favorite characters.

1191
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,280
Sure.

1192
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,600
Jason out of control.

1193
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,920
Just out of control.

1194
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,760
Wild man.

1195
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,960
Oh, I said to Jane when I was leaving,

1196
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,160
like girl, Taz, girlfriend, Marvin the Martian boyfriend.

1197
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,720
Like that's our dynamic.

1198
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,560
Wait, say it again.

1199
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,400
Yeah, say it again.

1200
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,040
Girl, Taz, boyfriend, and Marvin the Martian,

1201
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,480
or no, girl, Taz, girlfriend,

1202
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,960
Marvin the Martian boyfriend.

1203
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,800
That's our.

1204
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,720
You're Marvin dating girl, Taz?

1205
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,320
I'm a weird little guy.

1206
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,640
She's girl, Taz.

1207
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,000
Yeah, she's girl, Taz.

1208
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,920
So she's girl, Taz.

1209
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,760
Yeah.

1210
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,080
I like that you're crossing Looney Tunes world

1211
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,120
in the dating.

1212
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,320
That's fascinating to me.

1213
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,160
You know what?

1214
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,000
It takes all kinds of opposites to track to you know.

1215
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,240
Is that the first time you've ever like given

1216
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,420
like characters, cartoon characters,

1217
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,040
like you've ascribed them to yourselves?

1218
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:15,880
I don't know.

1219
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,920
I can't remember.

1220
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,240
Now she's gonna make fun of me

1221
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,680
because she's like you're forgetting

1222
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,240
when we choked about this thing.

1223
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,080
Okay.

1224
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,440
That's interesting.

1225
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,880
Well, I mean, she compared you to Quasimodo before.

1226
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,200
So don't forget that one.

1227
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,040
You know.

1228
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,360
Quasi energy.

1229
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,480
Usually flattering way.

1230
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,320
Yeah.

1231
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,840
The BZE of Quasimodo.

1232
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,400
I remember very well.

1233
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,240
Sure I was.

1234
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,440
You know, here while we're in this area, personal stories,

1235
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,840
this one's not me.

1236
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,160
This is my mother

1237
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,680
because my mom was over this morning, babysitting.

1238
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,400
And I said, I am learning

1239
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,720
about the Warner Brothers Studio store right now.

1240
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,680
Do you have any memories of that?

1241
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,680
And I said, I'm sorry.

1242
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,340
She said, yeah, yeah.

1243
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,360
And I was like, that was an odd tone.

1244
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,200
Is that something you don't wanna talk about?

1245
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,040
No, no, no.

1246
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:11,360
It's just, I don't think I've talked about this before.

1247
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,560
Said, oh, well do tell.

1248
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,800
You have to tell me now.

1249
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,400
And she said, I only have one real association

1250
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,240
with that place.

1251
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,960
And it's that one time your father

1252
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,920
got me something from there, like an article of clothing.

1253
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,760
And at the time I wasn't feeling great

1254
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,000
about my appearance or my weight.

1255
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And I was just in a weird state anyway.

1256
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,520
And then he got me this thing

1257
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,840
and the thing didn't make me feel good.

1258
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:48,320
It just didn't play well into where I was at at that moment.

1259
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,480
And you might see it and think,

1260
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,720
oh, what is he talking about?

1261
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,280
I'm like, what do you mean?

1262
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,160
This is crazy.

1263
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,500
There's an article of clothing

1264
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,520
that drove right into your insecurities at that moment.

1265
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,700
And she, you gotta tell me more details of this.

1266
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,240
And she's like, it was just like a,

1267
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,800
it was a big sleep shirt or something, right?

1268
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,000
And it was one size fits all.

1269
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,440
So I probably didn't like that.

1270
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,320
Like I'm just wearing a big bag or something.

1271
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,280
Like I'm dying to see this shirt.

1272
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,120
Is there any way?

1273
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,920
And she said, well, there wouldn't be a picture of it

1274
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,720
because I didn't wanna be photographed in it

1275
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,520
because it made me look terrible and made me feel bad.

1276
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,440
Whoa, okay.

1277
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,320
First question, can I tell all of this on the podcast?

1278
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,680
She said, oh, it's behind the paywall.

1279
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,840
Your father's never gonna go there.

1280
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,040
So that's fine.

1281
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,560
So I do have my mom's permission

1282
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,960
and she's in a better state about all this now.

1283
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,840
But my sister also over watching my son.

1284
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,360
So she said, maybe she wouldn't,

1285
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,680
my sister has a photographic memory

1286
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,580
and this was described to her.

1287
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,980
My sister, without missing a beat, was like,

1288
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:52,980
you wore that when we went to Newport Beach in 99 or whatever.

1289
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,960
And I think it's in a photo album.

1290
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,440
What do you, you remember this being in a photo album?

1291
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,720
Well, maybe we could find the shirt.

1292
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,560
This is great.

1293
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,240
Do you remember what was on it or what it was?

1294
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,320
And she said, the brown guy, Taz?

1295
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,040
Okay, well, I could see that.

1296
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,800
So now I'm going, okay, my dad got my mom

1297
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,520
a big dowdy item with the Tasmanian devil on it.

1298
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,800
But then I'm just like, I'm scratching my head.

1299
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,880
Like, what could it have said?

1300
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,000
She said that it said something too.

1301
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,540
Like, what could the Tasmanian devil have said

1302
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:25,840
that made her feel bad?

1303
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,940
I was flashing to like, me so hungry.

1304
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,800
Like, what would the devil say?

1305
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,700
Me hungry all the time.

1306
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,140
Yeah, because Taz likes to eat.

1307
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:39,340
I think he like eats everything in sight, right?

1308
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,180
It's your guy, Jay.

1309
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,860
Am I missing other qualities that would not,

1310
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,580
I don't think that your, girl Taz maybe,

1311
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,540
I'm glad Jaynes is associated with girl Taz,

1312
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:50,020
but I could see why my mom does not wanna be

1313
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,860
the Tasmanian devil.

1314
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:55,340
I mean, Taz, I feel like very similar to Stitch.

1315
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,820
You can ascribe so anything to him.

1316
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:58,900
Mischief and mayhem.

1317
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,620
Mischief, mayhem, yeah.

1318
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,620
Things chaotic when I'm around.

1319
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,580
He's also like, he's not slovenly,

1320
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:08,060
but he suggests being slovenly.

1321
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:08,900
Yeah, sure.

1322
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,720
You know what I mean?

1323
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,860
So if it was a picture of Taz sticking his tongue out

1324
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,500
and it said, I'm a mess.

1325
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,340
Yes.

1326
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,180
Yeah.

1327
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,680
Or me crazy.

1328
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,140
Me out of me mind.

1329
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:24,020
It could be like, don't talk to me before me cough.

1330
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,660
I know, I was wondering about that.

1331
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:28,240
So I started digging and there was a version of that

1332
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,540
with Tweety and she said, no, Tweety would be fine.

1333
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,720
I'd say he's cute.

1334
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,080
I found one with Taz and it was Taz eating

1335
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,580
a big sub sandwich like Carl Winslow would have eaten.

1336
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,600
And she said, no, I think that's kind of cute.

1337
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,840
I don't mind that.

1338
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,520
She said, maybe it was a little like Western themed.

1339
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,520
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm thrown now.

1340
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,600
And we can't decide if it's a nightgown or a big sleep shirt

1341
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,660
and I'm dying to know.

1342
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:50,960
So I am now waiting and she's like,

1343
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,520
you're recording the podcast at three?

1344
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,480
Okay, and there's just enough time

1345
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,560
or maybe I get an update about what was this awful shirt

1346
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,520
that my dad gave.

1347
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,840
Wow.

1348
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,440
What could this have been?

1349
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,960
And then thankfully with an hour to go,

1350
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,720
she finds a photo, but the photo is a little too hard to see.

1351
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,800
But so she says, all right, I found a photo

1352
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,120
but it's too unclear to read anything

1353
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,200
except cowboys all caps and sleep.

1354
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,520
Just can't remember.

1355
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,640
Looks like characters include Pepe Le Pew.

1356
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,920
Okay, I don't know.

1357
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,140
Go to sleep so I can fulfill my cowboy fantasies

1358
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,960
coming out of Pepe Le Pew's mouth.

1359
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,120
I don't know.

1360
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,560
Pepe Le Pew's through the whole thing.

1361
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,840
I didn't know what to think.

1362
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,440
But cowboys and sleep, that's enough.

1363
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,480
And sure enough, I found it.

1364
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,080
I found it on eBay, the item, here it is.

1365
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:48,320
It is a giant beige shirt that says

1366
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,120
even cowboys need their sleep.

1367
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,000
And it is a-

1368
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,840
Why did you buy that for?

1369
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,860
I don't know.

1370
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:59,920
My dad, oh, well, first of all, sail rack.

1371
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,360
That's first reason why.

1372
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,340
First reason why is sail rack.

1373
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:08,440
But then it's bugs and not Pepe but Sylvester

1374
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,880
and an especially grouchy Tasmanian devil.

1375
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,480
So he is on it and they are all in like,

1376
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,200
I mean, honestly, what it looks like they're wearing

1377
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,280
is Civil War uniforms.

1378
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,760
Like it looks like they're waking up on the battlefield.

1379
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,080
And honestly, and I hope that's not what it is

1380
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,360
because I think one's in blue and one's in gray.

1381
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,200
Oh my God.

1382
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,560
I don't remember which is which.

1383
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,840
One wore blue, one wore gray.

1384
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,960
Gray is the south, is it not?

1385
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:33,960
Well, that's Taz.

1386
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,240
Oh, well then that's where you don't wanna be.

1387
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,080
Jesus.

1388
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,600
Do you believe in tradition?

1389
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,960
Oh my God, that's a big story you've broken here

1390
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,360
in the middle of this other story.

1391
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,160
America built on slavery.

1392
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,000
Oh no.

1393
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,360
Must be kept up at all costs.

1394
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,200
I feel-

1395
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,080
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

1396
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,920
There's a lot of cowboy stories that are post Civil War

1397
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,280
and people like trying to start new lives or disappear.

1398
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,520
Maybe they just all still had the uniforms.

1399
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,000
But they're all making like grouchy faces.

1400
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,240
It is definitely a very male shirt.

1401
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,880
And yet seemingly, I feel like meant for females.

1402
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,720
It is, you think?

1403
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,560
Yeah, well, at least-

1404
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,840
Why do you think even cowboys needs?

1405
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,360
Were men wearing big giant sleep shirts?

1406
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,200
I mean, it's very, you know what?

1407
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,160
We keep mentioning this on the show, barren stained bears.

1408
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:25,480
This is, this is ma, this is mama bear type.

1409
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,320
I can see what it did to my mom.

1410
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:31,280
This does not make you feel feminine.

1411
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,480
I hear whatever she wanted to feel.

1412
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,320
Yeah, certain way.

1413
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,600
And that's on it.

1414
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:40,160
But like, if it was, it was for specifically a female,

1415
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,800
like even, are they cowboys even though they're dressed

1416
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,240
like Civil War characters?

1417
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,400
It says even cow, one is boots, bugs as boots,

1418
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,400
even cowboys need their sleep.

1419
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,400
First of all, of course, what do you mean?

1420
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,720
I would think that, I would think cowboys more

1421
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,240
than anyone would sleep.

1422
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,640
You're on a horse all day, physical, heads on a swivel.

1423
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,480
I have never doubted for once in my life that cowboys sleep.

1424
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,520
Sleep under the stars when it gets dark

1425
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,960
and then you arise as the sun gets up.

1426
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,120
I actually really do picture them sleeping.

1427
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,920
You could picture, you could picture cowboys

1428
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,480
about to go to sleep so easily.

1429
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,600
I mean, this is confusing because I feel like the marketing

1430
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,800
in the 90s was like, dad doesn't get enough sleep.

1431
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,720
So the dad stuff is about sleep.

1432
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,400
And the mom stuff, at least for Warner Brothers

1433
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,040
was like Tweety Bird.

1434
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:33,320
And then when they got the MGM, whatever it is,

1435
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:37,240
pre 1960 movies with one of the acquisitions,

1436
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,520
it's like half the stores Wizard of Oz now.

1437
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,000
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1438
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,840
But this, I think what really did it for her was that

1439
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,920
if she wasn't liking it as she was looking at the time,

1440
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,680
seeing a shirt that had two, both sides of the tag,

1441
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,840
fits all, all caps, fits all.

1442
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,400
It says several times.

1443
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,680
And then the worst fact that I learned was

1444
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,280
that this was a present for Valentine's Day.

1445
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,840
Oh, that's the whole, that ruined it forever.

1446
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,760
Cause if it was just always the funny thing I picked,

1447
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,160
oh, now it's completely clear.

1448
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,240
I'm glad you saved that for the end

1449
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,000
because now it makes the mystery.

1450
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,840
No, she was upset no matter what.

1451
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,800
I mean, there's no holiday where it's good,

1452
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,280
but Valentine's Day, the only box you need to check is cute.

1453
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,880
And apparently my dad said, I thought it was cute.

1454
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,600
He gets it a little bit, but he defended it and said,

1455
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,560
I thought it was cute.

1456
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,360
And apparently his full answer was, I'm sorry,

1457
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,920
but I don't see you as just a sex object.

1458
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,760
Yeah.

1459
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,600
That's right.

1460
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,560
That's twisted as a statement.

1461
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,800
Yeah, trying to take control of this narrative.

1462
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,280
I guess I think you're pretty even in a cowboy related

1463
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,320
burlap sack.

1464
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,280
Maybe that's just me.

1465
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,640
Maybe I'm just progressive.

1466
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:59,280
Can I ask, was she anything approaching a Looney Tunes

1467
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,040
fanatic?

1468
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:00,360
No.

1469
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,480
Looney Tunes not.

1470
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:01,800
No.

1471
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,880
That's the only way I could have been like, oh,

1472
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,840
she likes all kinds of Looney Tunes stuff.

1473
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:09,400
That's the only way I could see reaching.

1474
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,680
Beige shirt, the characters in dark burlappy clothes

1475
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:19,200
themselves, cowboys, the biggest word on the.

1476
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,880
The shirt doesn't make sense.

1477
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,520
There's so many strikes against it.

1478
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,480
This is confusing.

1479
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,160
It's a character she doesn't particularly

1480
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:28,200
care for looking the least attractive possible.

1481
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,160
They all look like they're on their way to smile in a photo,

1482
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:34,080
but being caught in a weird state with their tongues out.

1483
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,960
Right.

1484
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,800
Here you go, honey.

1485
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,960
I guess just a little something.

1486
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,000
Hey.

1487
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,600
I hope it's a real special Valentine's Day for you.

1488
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,720
While you were talking, I didn't know if you had found it.

1489
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,260
So I was looking through this catalog.

1490
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,320
And there's so many denim shirts with the Looney Tunes

1491
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,560
characters on them.

1492
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,080
Now that I feel like she again, I

1493
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,680
was showing her a number of other things.

1494
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,080
And she's like, oh, I like that.

1495
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,200
I like she liked almost everything else.

1496
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,200
I would say she was an elementary school teacher

1497
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,280
denim shirt with a cartoon character on it.

1498
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,760
OK, so bread and butter.

1499
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:03,440
Right.

1500
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,160
That would have should have worn that every day.

1501
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,000
Yeah.

1502
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,280
But the sack to sleep.

1503
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,600
Did you see these right here?

1504
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,440
I can't see what's on them from here.

1505
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,880
I'll walk over there.

1506
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,800
I wonder if Jay has any.

1507
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,080
Jay probably just sticks with the regular denim.

1508
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:17,840
Silly.

1509
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,040
Yeah, like this on their top.

1510
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,640
Gets in the way of the denim.

1511
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,680
Top right.

1512
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,200
OK, it's Wiley Coyote.

1513
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:23,680
What is it?

1514
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,200
Just well, there's a Taz one.

1515
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,520
Just call me a party animal.

1516
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,000
Daffy, I am.

1517
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,760
Yes, I am totally out of control.

1518
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,600
And these are like stitched embroidered like lines

1519
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,080
on a like a Jay Leno denim shirt.

1520
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,200
OK, yeah.

1521
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:39,880
Wow.

1522
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,360
Again, Jason said tasteful.

1523
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,960
And that's what this is.

1524
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,640
This is a tasteful shirt on the top right there.

1525
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,680
I you know what?

1526
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,640
Like CM Punk says, tell me when I'm telling lies.

1527
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:57,960
Because a lot of these openings, the big stores,

1528
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,400
they did a fashion show.

1529
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,280
They would do a fashion show with like those denim shirts

1530
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,440
and like the varsity jackets with the Warner Brothers emblem

1531
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,360
on the back.

1532
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,920
You're right in one regard.

1533
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:14,280
But the only like OK, they did they did a fashion show,

1534
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,040
I would underline is the true.

1535
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:19,480
But the questionable part is they did a fashion show.

1536
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,720
They would they are trying to sell this shit.

1537
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,000
They'll do a show of any.

1538
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,040
They probably had an entire they got all the most beautiful women

1539
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:30,200
in the world to come wear that Cowboys Need Their Sleep shirt.

1540
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,600
This is going to be the hot thing.

1541
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,960
You're going to override Victoria's Secret this year.

1542
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,520
Well, they also put those very attractive men and women

1543
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:40,960
like in the most like this is the most current shirt.

1544
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,160
Like this is the most modern shirt we have.

1545
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,440
This is the like patchwork.

1546
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,200
Coats is that this is the newest technology.

1547
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,080
This is the newest type of denim shirt men are wearing.

1548
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:56,200
I definitely saw a fashion show in London where, yes, that

1549
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,080
is going on in very attractive people.

1550
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:01,040
And then Tweetie comes out just like pointing fingers

1551
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:01,880
maniacally.

1552
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,520
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

1553
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,960
Full of piss and vinegar.

1554
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,480
Tweetie.

1555
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,360
Mick Jagger in the first song of a Rolling Stones show.

1556
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,640
Be great if that Tweetie actor just did a line right before.

1557
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,160
Yeah, yeah.

1558
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,560
Need my Tweetie energy.

1559
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,600
Stop me up.

1560
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,480
There was a five minute video on YouTube.

1561
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,440
And I do wish I knew the origin of it.

1562
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,840
It is Bugs Bunny greeting people at one of the stores.

1563
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,640
And the very start, they pan to the video wall.

1564
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,400
And it's playing a New Order music video.

1565
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:40,320
And that scores that the New Order song scores the footage.

1566
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:44,640
And it has production company slates at the beginning and end.

1567
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,880
So I'm like, where did this go?

1568
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,320
Where did this Bugs Bunny New Order video go?

1569
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,000
Bugs Bunny and the Tucks and Tails.

1570
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,880
That's cool.

1571
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,380
Yeah.

1572
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:54,360
That sounds good.

1573
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:58,240
They used a lot of big songs and some of the internal stuff,

1574
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,680
I'm assuming, because Warner Brothers Records probably

1575
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,520
had those songs.

1576
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,800
Probably Warner owned.

1577
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:08,080
There was definitely a big stretch just showing,

1578
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:11,560
here's some of the features of the Connecticut location.

1579
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,840
And then the music is Cream by Prince.

1580
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:21,160
And they use when he sings boogie, but they don't use cream.

1581
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:24,120
It's not the most explicit song in the world.

1582
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,160
But you kind of guess what he's talking about when

1583
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,240
he talks about cream.

1584
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,400
Yeah, of course.

1585
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,560
They don't play that.

1586
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:33,080
So they did take that part out.

1587
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:36,280
But knowing where Prince was at at the time with Warner Brothers,

1588
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:39,120
his feelings about Warner Brothers at the time

1589
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:43,960
where he changed his name to not be beholden to the contract.

1590
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,480
It was like, OK, sure, well, we get it.

1591
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,640
But have you seen how well Cream goes with this Connecticut mall

1592
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:51,760
montage?

1593
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,360
You might want to change that name back when you see this one,

1594
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,000
Prince-O.

1595
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Do they censor the chorus?

1596
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,440
Or do they just don't play it at all?

1597
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,640
Just instrumentally.

1598
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,840
I think they changed it to dream or something.

1599
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,120
Dream.

1600
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:08,080
I don't think they use the moaning at the beginning of the song either.

1601
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:08,560
Snoring.

1602
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,920
They change it to snoring.

1603
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,280
Oh, yeah.

1604
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,320
Cream becomes dream.

1605
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,480
And it's a song about having a nice nap.

1606
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,680
Tasteful, close.

1607
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,880
Jason likes Prince.

1608
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,880
Now I like it.

1609
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,520
You know my famous anti-Prince tie-race.

1610
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,560
That's right.

1611
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:29,440
Jason, I found a very classy, tasteful Marvin the Martian polo

1612
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,920
shirt on the bottom right here.

1613
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,800
Would you be interested in wearing this even to this day?

1614
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:33,440
Let me see.

1615
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,560
OK, here it is.

1616
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,400
You see it?

1617
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,400
It's over here.

1618
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,440
Oh, yeah.

1619
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,760
I mean, the collar is a little, some of those.

1620
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,120
You're not usually a polo.

1621
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,560
They're a little Proud Boy-y.

1622
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,320
For sure it is.

1623
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:50,240
It's a very preppy kind of shirt, but it's got Marvin the Martian logo on it.

1624
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,000
I have a few polos.

1625
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,680
I haven't worn them that much.

1626
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,080
I feel like I haven't seen you in a polo shirt in years, if ever.

1627
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,000
Not in a long time.

1628
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,600
I have one with crabs on it I like to wear sometimes.

1629
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,560
Crabs all over?

1630
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,040
Little crabs, yeah.

1631
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:01,560
OK.

1632
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,720
It's a Uniqlo.

1633
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,520
Audience, let's get this crab shirt out.

1634
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,840
Let's get the crab shirt going.

1635
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:15,800
So I, OK, maybe let's talk about some of these other location,

1636
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:20,040
like some of the bigger, you know, I feel like all the,

1637
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:25,080
like the base style was always good, but then they would elevate

1638
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:28,000
in the big spaces like crazy.

1639
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,800
New York City, incredible.

1640
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,840
These were so massive.

1641
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:43,360
In New York it was on 5th and 57th, which I believe is now Louis Vuitton.

1642
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:47,240
It is nothing but the entire intersection is like,

1643
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:52,280
and was at the time, the most crazy elevated brands.

1644
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:58,120
And I found this quote even, like OK, I loathed the Coke store,

1645
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:03,080
the Disney store said Roxanne Bednar, a New Yorker who was headed for tea

1646
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:06,520
at the plaza dressed in a fashionable cream colored suit.

1647
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:09,200
They're destroying the most elegant corner of New York.

1648
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,600
This is not Hollywood or Florida.

1649
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,160
This is Fifth Avenue.

1650
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:14,680
Wow.

1651
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:23,000
I look, if you like cream colored, I have a very tasteful shirt

1652
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,600
about how cowboys need their sleep.

1653
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,120
Yeah.

1654
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,920
I think you'd look great in Roxanne.

1655
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,120
Wow, so snooty.

1656
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:28,840
Yeah, I know.

1657
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:33,240
What is the, and she did not get her wish in terms of this going away right away

1658
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:39,800
because the store did close and then reopened to go from three stories to nine stories.

1659
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:45,960
It was a massive location in like the highest end shopping New York.

1660
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,200
Then that's still there.

1661
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,680
Then they do Times Square also.

1662
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,160
Right.

1663
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,320
One Times Square specifically.

1664
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,160
The address is one Times Square.

1665
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,840
They were in one Times Square.

1666
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,320
Wow.

1667
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,840
They were number one.

1668
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:04,840
That is the location I believe where there was a glass elevator you could see from the outside

1669
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:10,760
so that you could see Superman lifting the elevator into the air.

1670
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:12,680
So cool.

1671
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:16,920
And then to go elsewhere, let's maybe head into,

1672
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,760
you can't go too long without talking about Atlantic City.

1673
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,600
So you must have been to this one a number of times.

1674
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,800
This one, yeah, it is again massive marquee.

1675
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,720
You could see it from the boardwalk.

1676
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:38,200
Kind of important location wise because when we started, Atlantic City had its Vegas theme

1677
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:45,960
parky years and so Caesar's Palace, of course, one of the most themed casinos.

1678
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:53,160
Of course, the restaurant on the boardwalk at the end of Caesar's Palace was Planet Hollywood.

1679
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:59,640
When you made a right and you went barely half a block, there was the Warner Brothers store.

1680
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:04,120
So this is kind of what I knew of Atlantic City for a long time.

1681
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,040
That is insane.

1682
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,320
It is such massive statues.

1683
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,320
They look like they're three stories tall.

1684
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,320
Yeah, I think they are.

1685
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,520
I think that's exactly right.

1686
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:20,200
Bugs and Daffy in Tux's, the carrot alone is so huge.

1687
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:26,360
And, you know, we're in Atlantic City, so you might sense a ghost already.

1688
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,800
Do you have the clip?

1689
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,000
I have the clip.

1690
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,800
Yeah, yeah, he probably knows what this is going on.

1691
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,240
We've talked about this on the show before.

1692
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:33,960
I'm sure we have.

1693
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:38,280
Yeah, I mean, the full segment is like 230, but I'm just going to play the start of it.

1694
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:43,000
It touches on something we did an episode on before.

1695
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:43,480
That's right.

1696
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,120
Yeah.

1697
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:44,620
Yeah.

1698
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:52,700
You simply can't miss the Warner Brothers studio store on the boardwalk in Atlantic City.

1699
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:59,820
Besides sporting three story high versions of Bugs and Daffy on its portals,

1700
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:03,660
the store is located adjacent to the famed Trump Plaza Hotel.

1701
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:10,220
This is where the action is, and that action translates into 30 million visitors a year.

1702
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:15,660
I think it's one of the most beautiful stores I've ever seen.

1703
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:20,460
Donald Trump, chairman of the Trump Organization and a host of the opening ceremonies,

1704
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:23,900
thinks that Warner Brothers Studio stores will fit right in.

1705
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:27,660
This store is going to play a very big part in the success of Trump Plaza.

1706
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:28,780
So we're really happy with it.

1707
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:30,060
It's going to be a tremendous success.

1708
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:31,500
There you have it.

1709
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,420
OK, you got beautiful store.

1710
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:35,020
You got tremendous success.

1711
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:39,260
He thinks it's one of the most beautiful stores he's ever seen.

1712
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:41,820
He doesn't dole out compliments like that very often.

1713
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:43,500
I've never seen him use language like that.

1714
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,060
No, no.

1715
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:44,700
I'm impressed.

1716
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:45,580
Language, wow.

1717
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:48,060
He looks relatively normal.

1718
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:52,300
Well, no, I mean relative to him now.

1719
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:55,740
Yeah, relative is doing a lot of heavy lifting.

1720
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:58,460
Relative to him now and relative to humanity.

1721
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:03,020
Well, it is to whiplash, you know, because the last I hear is him like,

1722
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:05,100
I think it's going to be a beautiful thing and it's going to be.

1723
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:10,700
And the last I heard him talk before that clip just now was I did.

1724
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:11,980
I did nothing wrong.

1725
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:17,340
He is boy.

1726
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,020
What has happened to this man's voice?

1727
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,180
How it started, how it started, how it's going.

1728
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:23,900
Put those two together.

1729
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:27,740
I really wish he had commented on something specific to one of the characters.

1730
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:32,220
Like he was holding up a daffy mug or something and talking about the craftsmanship or something.

1731
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,500
At the very end of the clip, you can't hear what the sound is,

1732
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,180
but he's holding up the jacket.

1733
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:39,260
He's holding up like the letterman jacket.

1734
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:42,460
Very tasteful, incredibly tasteful.

1735
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:45,180
Is your screen cracked on your iPad?

1736
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,100
Oh yeah, I got to go to the Apple store.

1737
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:47,820
What happened?

1738
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:48,380
I don't know.

1739
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:49,580
It's like a airline crack.

1740
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:52,780
It happened a few weeks ago and it's just, yeah.

1741
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:53,660
It just appeared.

1742
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:54,860
You didn't drop something, Aaron?

1743
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:57,100
No, I don't have any memory of dropping it.

1744
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,060
It just appeared.

1745
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:00,060
That language seems like a little bit wiggle room.

1746
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:04,140
I have no recollection of how it appeared.

1747
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:05,020
Okay.

1748
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:07,100
I have no recollection of how it appeared.

1749
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:11,660
I did lean it up against this chair in the garage, this garage one night,

1750
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:13,100
and didn't flip the cover.

1751
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,340
So I'm wondering if it just slid under the ground.

1752
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,580
I'm going to get a new screen on it soon.

1753
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:18,140
Can you get that?

1754
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:19,660
Can you just get a quick new screen?

1755
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,540
You can get a replacement.

1756
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,260
It's a little bit of money, but at the Apple store,

1757
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:26,460
I think they'll take it and give it back to you in a couple of days with a new screen.

1758
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:27,100
Interesting.

1759
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,780
Jason's blazed out of his mind.

1760
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,700
He's like, you know what I've been thinking about?

1761
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:31,900
That crab shirt.

1762
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:32,780
I'm putting it on.

1763
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:33,340
I'm putting it on.

1764
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,060
I think it's cool.

1765
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:35,020
I think it's good.

1766
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:37,900
And you're for some reason struggling to get it over your head.

1767
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:40,860
And somehow he's putting it on.

1768
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:41,360
Yeah.

1769
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:44,940
Fling the iPad across the room.

1770
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:45,500
Oh boy.

1771
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,700
This is now, this is something I don't want to remember.

1772
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:51,180
Time to smoke some more.

1773
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:58,140
I think Jason was eating a heavy East Coast meat in his bed, his research fort.

1774
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:02,460
On his bed and the heavy meat fell and cracked the iPad screen.

1775
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:05,820
Pimento loaf, but the whole loaf, not the slices.

1776
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:07,500
The whole loaf.

1777
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,300
It's so heavy.

1778
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:09,020
And you dropped it.

1779
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:10,220
How much they pack in there?

1780
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:10,860
Yeah.

1781
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:12,300
No, thick enough to crack a screen.

1782
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:13,420
All right.

1783
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:14,460
We'll keep it posted.

1784
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,700
Hey, I've never cracked an Apple device before.

1785
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:17,740
I actually haven't either.

1786
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:18,940
This was the first one.

1787
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:19,900
I had never seen that.

1788
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:21,420
I just wanted to know what happened.

1789
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:21,900
It's good.

1790
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:23,100
Four years I've had this.

1791
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,580
So it's like a little crack.

1792
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:27,180
I'll take care of it.

1793
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:28,620
Thank you for noticing.

1794
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:31,820
Look, there felt like there might've been a story there.

1795
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:32,380
I don't know.

1796
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:32,860
There was.

1797
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:35,260
We just had to remember it for him.

1798
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:39,020
He has no recollection of a possible story existing is what I maintain.

1799
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:41,020
I'm pretty sure I leaned it up this chair.

1800
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:45,180
It's like this one night when we were recording and it might've slid off.

1801
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:48,700
That's still pretty, like they usually hold up to like something like that.

1802
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:49,660
That's true.

1803
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:50,220
Interesting.

1804
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,180
Well, if the mic goes off there.

1805
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,780
So I've been thinking, I think I know what happened.

1806
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:55,820
I'm going to crack this case.

1807
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:59,820
This is really what we're going to start digging through some ACME.

1808
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:04,140
If you would just give me your exit, if you would give me your Apple login,

1809
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,380
I think I can access the iPad's camera.

1810
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:07,740
Oh, that's definitely going to go.

1811
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:10,220
Your Apple ID and login.

1812
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:12,860
You definitely want to be giving that out to pass or by.

1813
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:13,260
Is it?

1814
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:14,540
I will pass or by now.

1815
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:16,300
Well, I never.

1816
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:18,460
He was.

1817
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:23,980
It's hey, it's great footage and you get to see his fucking piece of shit kids

1818
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:27,420
hanging out with Batman and Catwoman and some.

1819
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:27,980
Yeah, yeah.

1820
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:31,660
Like, you know, doing what any of us would have dreamed of doing.

1821
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:34,140
I guess I guess only piece of shit kids got to do it.

1822
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:34,940
It's really a bummer.

1823
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:35,340
Yeah.

1824
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:35,900
Yeah.

1825
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:37,500
We weren't shitty enough guys.

1826
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,060
Neither were I.

1827
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:41,900
Now look, my dad gave some shitty gifts, but it doesn't put them in the league of

1828
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:42,940
Donald Trump.

1829
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:48,780
Unfortunately, it was that was that shirt was the like Trump stakes of shirts.

1830
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,700
It was a poor investment.

1831
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:51,180
Right, right.

1832
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:51,740
So yeah.

1833
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:59,500
The Ivanka and the kids and maybe Donald, I believe, are also in the footage from

1834
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,020
the New York opening.

1835
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:01,660
Yeah, yeah.

1836
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:03,180
This was his second time.

1837
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,940
There was even it didn't end up being the location.

1838
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:11,580
I think that that shopping district one was really near Trump Tower, but not in

1839
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:12,060
Trump Tower.

1840
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:15,500
But I did find find concept art where it could have been in Trump.

1841
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,620
So they were vying to be in Trump Tower.

1842
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:23,420
OK, he was very interested in being associated with this brand.

1843
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:24,060
The other guy.

1844
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:25,500
And only the best for him.

1845
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:26,300
I saw.

1846
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:31,500
I mean, we may have all seen the Sylvester Stallone, like, and they're like who he's

1847
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:34,300
they ask him, who's my favorite Looney Tunes?

1848
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:36,540
Let me ponder that.

1849
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:38,380
Oh, Thuffer and Thoth.

1850
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:40,780
Sylvester like me, my name.

1851
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:43,020
I'm really just now got that.

1852
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:43,660
That's why.

1853
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:45,180
Yeah, that's all I need to say.

1854
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:46,460
Your name is Sylvester.

1855
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:48,540
He's doing a horrible impression.

1856
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:50,940
Like I'm not putting these pieces together.

1857
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:52,620
But he's he's had an opening.

1858
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:54,700
Of course, got to play an Hollywood Jacket on.

1859
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:58,140
But the guy that I saw in multiple openings was Steven Seagal.

1860
01:10:58,780 --> 01:10:59,500
Oh, yeah.

1861
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:00,300
It was Seagal.

1862
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:04,780
And I didn't there was no audio to clip because he just put his hand together and bowed a

1863
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:07,900
lot like ribbon cuttings.

1864
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:10,300
He wasn't saying anything, seemingly.

1865
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:12,300
Is like under siege at Warner Brothers movie.

1866
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:14,940
I wonder, was he in the family at this point?

1867
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:15,420
Like that.

1868
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:19,260
Yeah, because it's a weird guy to send to the Warner Brothers store.

1869
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:21,980
Like Christine Brinkley, Tia Carrere.

1870
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:26,620
Steven Seagal, like, you know, it's all the 90s stars.

1871
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:27,580
OK, yeah.

1872
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:30,380
No, they got him out for this.

1873
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:30,860
Definitely.

1874
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:35,100
This was this seemed to be a real like brand lynchpin.

1875
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:40,460
You could buy like a Steven Seagal mug from under siege at the Warner Brothers store of

1876
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:40,960
his head.

1877
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,900
You'd like a lot of coffee and my big fat head.

1878
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:49,020
Yeah, you could buy his like clothes, his outfit from under siege or his,

1879
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:52,300
I don't know, his geese from his training kimonos.

1880
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:53,280
Right.

1881
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:54,700
From his dojo.

1882
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:56,940
Seagal dojo.

1883
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:02,620
That's a way to bring his stuff back, you know, give us more specialized merch like that.

1884
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:02,940
I know.

1885
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:06,140
Yeah, well, I don't think they were activating every part of the brand and everything that

1886
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:06,860
they own.

1887
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:07,360
Right.

1888
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:13,580
I do have a memory, though, of not really investigating much further than this, but

1889
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:19,660
like going to the corner of the Warner Brothers store and seeing like the Humphrey Bogart

1890
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:26,140
standee and the James Dean standee and it was like, wow, the movies, the golden age

1891
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:27,180
of Hollywood.

1892
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:29,020
He did represent them.

1893
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:29,520
Yeah.

1894
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:33,980
Under siege Warner Brothers, they were trying to reboot it two years ago.

1895
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:36,300
There's an article on deadline.

1896
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:37,180
Without Seagal.

1897
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:41,740
I think I haven't read the article, but I'm assuming it's without Seagal.

1898
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,780
If they don't want him around anymore.

1899
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:45,820
For some reason.

1900
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:46,300
Yeah.

1901
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:46,860
Well, they do.

1902
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:47,260
They do.

1903
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:54,300
There's no word yet if Seagal will reprise his role as Casey Ryback, the ex-Navy Seal

1904
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:58,860
turned cook, who was the only person in that movie to stop a group of terrorists from taking

1905
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:00,620
control of a U.S. battleship.

1906
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:02,140
Of course, Casey Ryback.

1907
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:03,340
Casey Ryback.

1908
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:04,060
All of our tongues.

1909
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:05,660
How can you do it without Casey?

1910
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:06,380
Yeah, true.

1911
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:08,300
1992 was the first under siege.

1912
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,500
So this is prime.

1913
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,020
It's right before, but it's prime.

1914
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:13,420
And under siege two probably was 94 then.

1915
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:14,060
They're going to get it.

1916
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:18,540
So it'll be about, you know, Colin Ryback.

1917
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:19,900
It's about his kid.

1918
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:24,700
And then there's like, you know, a flashback or they like Mufasa cloud him basically.

1919
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:30,300
And it's it's that's a CGI puppeted deep fake of Seagal who nod, who like does the

1920
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:31,980
little bow to him from heaven.

1921
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:34,700
You're like, wow, it's cool that they got Seagal in there.

1922
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,660
Wait, he didn't die.

1923
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:38,620
No, but Ryback did.

1924
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:40,140
Actually, yeah, Ryback died.

1925
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:43,820
The next time he faced a bunch of terrorists, they cut all his limbs off

1926
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:45,020
and threw him in the ocean.

1927
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:50,220
Yeah, he was available, but they insisted on doing siege.

1928
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:55,660
They insisted on giving a couple visual effects guys, nervous breakdowns to have that CGI.

1929
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:59,820
They were just like, oh, we cannot deal with Seagal on set.

1930
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:03,580
Like just just ruin a couple of people's lives for the worst.

1931
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:08,060
See you've ever seen under siege to dark territory.

1932
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:09,100
Nineteen ninety five.

1933
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,180
So that's right there.

1934
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:12,540
So that's why he's doing the rounds.

1935
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:19,900
Because sometimes if his toilet situation isn't agreeing with it, he took a shit.

1936
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:21,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, charged.

1937
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,700
Dark territory.

1938
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:25,020
Hey, Jay, thanks for having me.

1939
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,260
Just heads up before you go to the bathroom.

1940
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:29,340
It might be some dark territory.

1941
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:30,940
Your bathroom was under siege.

1942
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:40,300
Steve is all bowed towards me after he told me he destroyed my bathroom.

1943
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:44,140
Under siege with both one and two.

1944
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,660
So the stars are coming out.

1945
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:55,340
They're attracted all the at least New York's best and brightest.

1946
01:14:55,340 --> 01:15:03,740
And then the other really major one in my mind, the the forum shops at Caesar's in Las Vegas,

1947
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:08,940
because that as here as we're heading into into Vegas, I mean,

1948
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:17,020
the Caesar's aesthetic is incredible that Caesar's mall aesthetic is nuts with the cloud ceiling,

1949
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:21,100
the perpetual cloud ceiling and all the brands had to elevate that.

1950
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:24,140
Like that is the most like insane, gaudy.

1951
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:30,300
That's that's honestly that the forum shops are like the ultimate stretch of the Trump aesthetic.

1952
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:37,100
Yeah, beyond it's all columns and grandeur and arbitrary gold.

1953
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:40,620
And I mean, there that's that's really that's that's Trump's dream.

1954
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:46,380
I feel like that's like a like not not classy opulence.

1955
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:51,820
Yeah, that's this this weird brand of like, I'm not sure where I wonder where that aesthetic

1956
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:57,580
came from for certain people to think it was like the height of class is like the gaudiest

1957
01:15:57,580 --> 01:15:59,420
gold shit possible.

1958
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:04,540
Like the pictures of Trump's apartment or whatever condo in Manhattan is just you're

1959
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:07,020
like, this is the ugliest thing I've ever seen.

1960
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,900
The gold toilet like, yeah, this sucks.

1961
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:13,740
Well, the room with the boxes has isn't there a chandelier in the box?

1962
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:14,860
I think so.

1963
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:18,380
Yeah, there's little touches of fancy, but then just like,

1964
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:21,740
there's some touch I'm not coming up with.

1965
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:25,900
But like, yeah, it is just like really basic ass sink or something.

1966
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:30,540
Or it's like, all right, I would know if you put a chandelier, they're not going to care.

1967
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:31,660
They'll be looking up.

1968
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:34,380
Yeah, that feels like, yeah, like they're like, he's like, I want everything in here

1969
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:35,980
gold. They're like, well, it's going to be very expensive.

1970
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:38,380
All right, we'll just throw up a chandelier and it'll take care of it.

1971
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:42,220
Like, while you're taking a shit, you're going to look, there's a chandelier in here.

1972
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:45,820
And you are going to pay the chandelier guy, right?

1973
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:48,060
Of course it's going to be a tremendous payment.

1974
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:49,420
A beautiful check.

1975
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:51,100
My checks are medical too.

1976
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:54,940
And he's going to get everyone chandeliers for everyone.

1977
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:59,580
He said as he went into the chandelier store and then didn't pay for anyone's chandelier.

1978
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:02,220
Never seen this coming.

1979
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:08,220
I was in a shared, either a shared ride or like a shuttle bus or something in Vegas once.

1980
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:13,900
And a bunch of people on the bus, it was like a group of people and they had, you know,

1981
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:18,300
everyone was talking with the driver and he said, they said they were from North Carolina.

1982
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:21,420
We can see the Trump thing in the distance.

1983
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:26,700
And one of them just went like with the most specific, I don't know the North Carolina twang

1984
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:30,460
super well, just hearing them say like, wow, look at that thing.

1985
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:32,380
What a piece of shit.

1986
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:34,620
That's the gaudiest shit I've ever seen.

1987
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:36,300
All right.

1988
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:36,780
All right.

1989
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:38,300
We have more.

1990
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:42,460
So much in common from around the country here in Sin City.

1991
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:43,420
Having a good time.

1992
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:46,620
Looking at the dumb fucking gold cigarette lighter building.

1993
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:48,620
Carolina's turning blue.

1994
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:55,740
But this, this version of the store, insane, like huge crazy marquee.

1995
01:17:55,740 --> 01:18:00,780
In this one, they're, they're all in gladiator uniforms.

1996
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:03,740
So huge helmets, huge shields.

1997
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:05,180
Everybody's going to battle.

1998
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:10,140
This it's, Aaron recalled that it's right in the front.

1999
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:12,620
It's one of the, it was one of the first locations in the mall.

2000
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:13,420
So it's in a corner.

2001
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:16,380
So it's also like exploding into the main casino.

2002
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:22,540
So there's photos of just slot machines and Elmer foot in a gladiator uniform.

2003
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:26,860
So much to add to the chaos of the aesthetics around there.

2004
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:32,620
And then they point out in that holiday video that usually when you leave the stores,

2005
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:34,620
it says that's all folks.

2006
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:39,980
But in this one, it says that is Phinney T as focus.

2007
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:44,060
They fake Greek it.

2008
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:44,560
Wow.

2009
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,460
Did you ever go to this?

2010
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:48,060
I don't recall.

2011
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:49,260
I definitely, I was in that.

2012
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:50,300
I must've been in that show.

2013
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,380
It was still there.

2014
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:54,380
I don't recall.

2015
01:18:55,820 --> 01:19:03,660
I noted that it is in the background of an iconic scene, which is a scene in show girls

2016
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:07,420
where it is Elizabeth Berkeley and Gina Gershon.

2017
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:11,740
And it is there like they were kind of enemies, but now they're getting along over a fancy lunch

2018
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:14,940
and they're bonding over how they used to eat doggy chow.

2019
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:18,300
It is in the background of the famous doggy chow scene.

2020
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:19,980
Check that out on YouTube.

2021
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:21,100
Are you show girls?

2022
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:23,420
I am a big show girls fan.

2023
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:23,580
Yeah.

2024
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:26,540
I don't know it as well as you do, but I've seen show girls and I'm a big, yeah.

2025
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:27,820
There's like, it's iconic.

2026
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:29,660
There's so many iconic scenes from it.

2027
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:31,900
We just talked ourselves into an episode.

2028
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:33,420
Maybe it counts.

2029
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:33,980
I don't know.

2030
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:37,980
I mean, the like something in there, it's on my mind with Vegas coming up because it's

2031
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:46,060
a really wonderfully captures 94, 95 Vegas, especially with a scene in that shopping center.

2032
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:51,180
And you know what it really is is that the perpetual blue cloud ceiling

2033
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:56,140
mixed with all the gold and everything, it is so like vapor wave.

2034
01:19:56,140 --> 01:20:01,980
Like it looks like a CD-ROM in there always still now.

2035
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:02,780
That's what I love.

2036
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:03,500
Wow.

2037
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:04,380
So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2038
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:05,180
I know you're saying.

2039
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:05,660
Yeah.

2040
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:08,220
I think a lot of other places duplicate.

2041
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:13,820
I mean, plan Hollywood, the miracle mile shops, they have, I think that sees their own now,

2042
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:19,500
but they have the blue sky ceiling with the clouds and really has it or whatever.

2043
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:20,300
What is it called now?

2044
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:22,620
Planet Hollywood, whatever store connects to that.

2045
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:23,020
Yeah.

2046
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:23,660
Yeah.

2047
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:24,220
Yeah.

2048
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:25,420
Indoor clouds.

2049
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:27,100
They were all in her class.

2050
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:29,980
Never really caught on in the theme park world.

2051
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:35,180
I think there's one like Mickey meet and greet where it's like Mickey's barn.

2052
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:39,100
Maybe it's in Florida and it's like a farm in the daytime.

2053
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,660
They have a little of the blue scale ceiling clouds.

2054
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:44,860
Because ultimately it's depressing, I would say.

2055
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:47,500
It's a bit of a bummer.

2056
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:47,980
Yeah.

2057
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:49,900
But it's like almost it's a pull off.

2058
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:52,940
I don't know if you can even call it well in there, but it's pulled off insanely.

2059
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:55,500
I mixed with golden columns.

2060
01:20:55,500 --> 01:21:00,140
Have you done a full Vegas tour of the scenes of showgirls?

2061
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:01,340
No, that's a good idea.

2062
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:06,460
I mean, I've been to the pepper mill, the really red diner that they filmed one scene there where

2063
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:08,540
she freaks out with the fries.

2064
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:09,660
I don't really know where they filmed.

2065
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:13,100
I don't know what the main casino is or what the showroom is.

2066
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:14,300
That's worth looking into.

2067
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:15,100
That's a good idea.

2068
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:16,460
And I haven't been to the pool.

2069
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:17,740
You've not been to the pool?

2070
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:18,380
I haven't.

2071
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:20,380
I haven't splashed around backwards.

2072
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,780
The iconic pool, yeah.

2073
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:24,460
Yeah, I'd love to.

2074
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:25,580
That's a good idea though.

2075
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:26,220
Maybe while we're there.

2076
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:28,140
Okay.

2077
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:28,940
Oh, and one more.

2078
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:29,900
I didn't know about this one before.

2079
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:37,020
This was in a mall in Buffalo and maybe this is a nod to Niagara Falls.

2080
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:41,820
Much like Schomburg, there is a waterfall in the mall.

2081
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:47,500
I think they took the pre-existing water feature in this mall.

2082
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:48,460
Yeah, right.

2083
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:49,340
Massive.

2084
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:51,020
And they hijacked it.

2085
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:57,260
They put Bugs and Daffy in barrels going off of the waterfall.

2086
01:21:57,260 --> 01:22:03,820
Then a boat down below with a bunch of the characters in rain slickers.

2087
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:04,300
That must be...

2088
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,540
You go do that in Niagara Falls.

2089
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:08,860
Cover yourself and go get near the falls.

2090
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:11,900
And Wile E. Coyote with just an umbrella.

2091
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:12,460
That's great.

2092
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:15,500
That's his only protection against the anvil.

2093
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:20,380
And then Taz and some sort of insane flying device.

2094
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:21,980
I don't know what he's up to.

2095
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:23,260
These are so elaborate.

2096
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:25,740
This is the most elaborate one maybe of all of them.

2097
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:26,780
It might be the biggest one, weirdly.

2098
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:27,580
I didn't know about it.

2099
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:32,540
I was looking on eBay for any of these things to see if they existed.

2100
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:35,100
And I could find only a couple like...

2101
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:37,900
I found this on Mercari, which is eBay.

2102
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:41,500
This is just a regular Marvin the Martian that looks like a WB store.

2103
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,940
Looks like it was WB store.

2104
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:47,980
But I couldn't find any specific location ones that had an outfit on.

2105
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:48,940
Oh, okay.

2106
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,460
One of the like...

2107
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:50,940
Yeah, yeah.

2108
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:52,460
Clearly you only made for that store.

2109
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:58,860
Well, when these closed, I think that the Warner Brothers put out the message,

2110
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:04,940
destroy the statues as quickly as you can because we don't want them falling into the wrong hand.

2111
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:13,020
We don't want a brand with some fly by night thing taking our characters and using them.

2112
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:13,500
Of course.

2113
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:17,180
So first of all, first things first, there were like 130 of these at one point.

2114
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:21,500
That means there must have been a bunch of bonfires across the world,

2115
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:25,500
burning bugs and Daffy and Marvin the Martian alive.

2116
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,780
That's what's cool.

2117
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:28,220
Yeah, it is awesome.

2118
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:33,820
But that's why there's so many you would think a couple made it out, but I guess not.

2119
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:35,420
Well, there's one.

2120
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:37,100
Well, you guys found it?

2121
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:37,580
What do you got?

2122
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:43,180
The ones that kind of more became historic artifacts.

2123
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:43,660
Oh, yeah.

2124
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:45,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2125
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:46,700
Okay. Well, this is what...

2126
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:47,180
All right, here.

2127
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:48,460
Wait, maybe I'll use...

2128
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:51,340
Mine will cheer us up after that one.

2129
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:51,820
All right.

2130
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:52,700
Yes, you do this one.

2131
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:53,420
Impressing one.

2132
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:53,920
Yep.

2133
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:55,020
Okay.

2134
01:23:55,020 --> 01:24:01,820
There was a Warner Brothers store in the mall in the basement of the World Trade Center.

2135
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:02,460
Oh, okay.

2136
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:03,100
Yes.

2137
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:08,060
This is what it looked like after people were able to get in there.

2138
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:16,700
There was a number of pretty unscathed statues and stuff that just have a little dust on them.

2139
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:19,100
And these, I believe, were preserved.

2140
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:24,540
There was a hanger showing stuff that was taken out of the World Trade Center.

2141
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:26,140
Here's a subway sign.

2142
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:28,540
The most haunting thing is the sign that says,

2143
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:29,980
that's all folk.

2144
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:31,340
The S did not survive.

2145
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:34,700
I mean, that's insane.

2146
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:38,700
Scott, what are the cheeriest thing I've ever seen to get us out of this section of the podcast?

2147
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:42,540
Well, first of all, look on the bright side.

2148
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:44,380
Foghorn Leghorn survived 9-11.

2149
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:46,620
I'm pleased to know that that happened.

2150
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:48,780
Foghorn Leghorn dressed in a...

2151
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:49,900
I say I made it.

2152
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:54,060
In a pinstripe suit, Bugs is talking on a...

2153
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:56,060
Bugs is like an electric...

2154
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:58,380
Oh, no, he's got a cell phone and a trench.

2155
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:00,140
He's a New Yorker on the go.

2156
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:03,340
I say, soon the whole world is going to hear you.

2157
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:05,740
And the people who did this to us are going to hear you too.

2158
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:08,700
You know, you forget that it was George Bush and Foghorn.

2159
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:11,100
Yeah, they shared they went back and forth on the microphone.

2160
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:11,660
Well, he didn't need...

2161
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:14,060
Foghorn didn't need the megaphone because he's so loud.

2162
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:15,500
Yeah, he is a Foghorn himself.

2163
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:21,020
The events, I believe the people doing recovery of everything underneath...

2164
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:23,020
Jason's trying to take us back into it.

2165
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:24,620
We're trying to leave.

2166
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,540
I was just trying to contextualize it.

2167
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:28,220
They offered to Warner Brothers, like,

2168
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:31,580
we found a bunch of stuff from your store and they're like, you can...

2169
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:33,020
We don't need...

2170
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:33,740
You can keep it.

2171
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:35,180
This was on day one.

2172
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:37,740
This was important to get to Warner Brothers.

2173
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:38,300
This is...

2174
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:38,620
Well...

2175
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:41,820
As they're all going under, it's just like...

2176
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:44,540
That is an insane thing.

2177
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:47,820
The stores are disappearing.

2178
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:51,420
One of the New York ones closes and then the worst possible thing.

2179
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:52,540
I'm getting a layoff.

2180
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:54,140
Can this day get any worse?

2181
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:55,980
Oh, yeah.

2182
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:57,020
All right, Scott, hit us.

2183
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:57,740
Let's do it.

2184
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:58,460
Get us out of here.

2185
01:25:58,460 --> 01:26:03,100
The other one is that the Atlantic City ones, the Trump Plaza ones, the giant ones,

2186
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:09,020
for some reason showed up at a place called Sanford's Grubbin Pub in Casper, Wyoming.

2187
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:10,380
Why?

2188
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:11,260
I missed this.

2189
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:12,620
Why are they there?

2190
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:13,740
They're still there.

2191
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:15,660
You can look this up on Street View.

2192
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:17,020
They're so big.

2193
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:17,740
One of them's just...

2194
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:19,500
Oh, wait, I thought one was standing on a rock.

2195
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:20,700
I was like, I was at balancing.

2196
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:22,060
No, that's just on the ground.

2197
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:23,740
But these are massive and there's a...

2198
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:25,020
Unbelievable.

2199
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:27,580
Whatever's going on with this place is there's big NASCAR's out

2200
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:32,700
outside and like a big statue of a gas attendant.

2201
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:35,820
So Sanford's Grubbin Pub has it going on,

2202
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:41,500
seemingly, maybe some original IP and the logo, like a big weird character lounging

2203
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:42,860
around shirtless drinking a beer.

2204
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:45,900
Wyoming is so far for those to go.

2205
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:50,140
I thought you were going to say it went up and down the coast or something.

2206
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:55,420
They were still there when they did the implosion and the implosion caused them to fly away

2207
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:58,540
into the sea and some deep sea divers found them one day.

2208
01:26:58,540 --> 01:26:59,420
You know what?

2209
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:01,100
I think it's clear what happened.

2210
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:03,580
It's the same thing as the documents at Mar-a-Lago.

2211
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:05,340
He took the statues.

2212
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:08,700
Trump took the statues and then sold them to this place.

2213
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:11,260
Well, he was on the campaign trail in Wyoming.

2214
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:12,700
Why else would it be there?

2215
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:14,620
Oh, yeah, still got all the Warner Brothers stuff.

2216
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:15,500
I got them all.

2217
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:17,500
You know, I have the brown guy.

2218
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:18,620
I got the big chicken.

2219
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:19,420
I got every one of them.

2220
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:19,980
They're beautiful.

2221
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:21,260
They're tasteful.

2222
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:22,380
I'll give them to you.

2223
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:23,020
Cash upfront.

2224
01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:24,300
You could have nuclear secrets.

2225
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:25,740
Which one do you want, Sanford?

2226
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:29,020
That's exactly what happened.

2227
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:32,380
I got to say I love your grub, but I love your pub even more.

2228
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:33,980
I don't drink, but I love the vibe of the pub.

2229
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:36,940
In terms of the boardwalk.

2230
01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:37,420
Hey, you know what?

2231
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:38,380
Grub for everyone.

2232
01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:39,980
I'll pay on me.

2233
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:42,140
Trump was found later to not have paid for any grub.

2234
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:47,420
In terms of the boardwalk, that would eventually become the area with the boardwalk side

2235
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:48,940
Rainforest Cafe.

2236
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:49,900
Oh, yeah.

2237
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:57,260
That has had so many lot like I believe still open eventually got a permit to like have their own

2238
01:27:58,060 --> 01:28:02,780
you know, utilities because their utilities were hooked up to the one Trump Tower building.

2239
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:04,140
Oh, they wanted to keep operating.

2240
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:05,660
Yeah, they wanted to keep operating.

2241
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:06,700
So they got their own.

2242
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:09,980
They got permission to keep operating.

2243
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:12,300
They got permission for the utilities and stuff.

2244
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:16,300
I believe attached to a portion of the hotel that has not been imploded.

2245
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:17,660
Mm hmm.

2246
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:21,660
And hopefully it wasn't just the Trump just like ripped out the all the outlets.

2247
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:24,780
He for sure ripped out all the outlets.

2248
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:26,620
Get the copper.

2249
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:29,340
Yeah, I'm taking the copper.

2250
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:29,740
Man.

2251
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:31,500
So I was looking in the wrong spot.

2252
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:35,500
I should not have been looking on these retail site eBay or anything because that's probably

2253
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:38,380
not where you're going to find this is going to be a black market situation.

2254
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:41,180
Like so you buy a statue from a Warner Brothers.

2255
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:45,660
Well, I was just I was just doing Google Street View all across America until life.

2256
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:46,860
I've been up every day.

2257
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:48,620
I haven't slept for months.

2258
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:51,900
Just maybe if I find and then write, I was about to give up.

2259
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:55,180
I said in North Dakota, I'm giving up right in Wyoming.

2260
01:28:55,900 --> 01:29:01,100
Found a couple doing Geo Guest Sir just for the Warner Brothers store cast off statues.

2261
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:06,380
There were many like journey limited statues you could buy in the stores that you can get

2262
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:09,740
that are pretty expensive, you know, but those are just statues.

2263
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:11,580
Those aren't animation cells, too.

2264
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:15,260
That was the crazy high end nature of this that you could buy.

2265
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:19,260
It was kind of maybe some of the beginning of the interest in that on a wide scale,

2266
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:23,740
that this bit of mall in the middle of the country would have real Chuck Jones.

2267
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:24,060
Right.

2268
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:25,020
Work who is around.

2269
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:26,620
They would have him come do events.

2270
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:29,500
So you got the real artists in there sometimes.

2271
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:35,820
You know, I think at various points in time, this place was a important hub.

2272
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:40,060
If you're for particular fandoms, the fact that you could meet Chuck Jones at the opening.

2273
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:40,300
Yeah.

2274
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:43,340
If you really like Warner Brothers, you could actually get a cell.

2275
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:47,980
I think that they they ebbed and flowed in terms of their relevance or how well they

2276
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:48,380
were selling.

2277
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:52,060
But I think right before they closed, I think I think Harry Potter fans ended up kind of

2278
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:58,060
bummed out that these closed because good Harry Potter merch and I think like the cast

2279
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:01,180
members would go to the more prominent ones at times.

2280
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:05,580
And then, of course, it becomes the hub of the Batman.

2281
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:07,500
I feel like this is do you recall?

2282
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:10,140
Did you get like Batman stuff at these?

2283
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:10,540
I don't.

2284
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:16,620
I really think I got very little here because I believe the words this is store is expensive

2285
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:17,420
was was set.

2286
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:20,780
I remember this being a case of like this is a little expensive.

2287
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:23,900
So you would get like a little tiny like plastic.

2288
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:25,580
It wasn't even a good figurine.

2289
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:28,860
It was not a figure, you know, not a figure.

2290
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:31,500
Yeah, not not an articulated action figure.

2291
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:34,380
Four inch figurine.

2292
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:36,780
Wonderful thing about figures.

2293
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:37,280
Yeah.

2294
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:40,960
So they were, yeah, like they weren't articulated.

2295
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,040
It was just a little statue, essentially.

2296
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:45,040
That was like, I think I got a couple of those.

2297
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:45,280
Yeah.

2298
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,280
You know what I'm talking about distinction here?

2299
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,400
They may not action figure.

2300
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,000
Not like you don't play with the arms.

2301
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:50,880
You couldn't move the legs.

2302
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:54,720
It was just kind of this little like plastic piece that was the character, but it didn't

2303
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:57,440
have articulation is the word in toy business.

2304
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:57,920
Right.

2305
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,600
Where you can't move its head or whatever.

2306
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:04,720
You know, you still see them at Disney parks, but they don't really sell as much in a bin

2307
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:05,120
anymore.

2308
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,320
They sell you a box.

2309
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:07,600
They have a picture somewhere.

2310
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:08,080
Yeah.

2311
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:13,280
Most of the characters from Mulan and you have to buy the set and it's 30 bucks.

2312
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:13,440
Yeah.

2313
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:14,320
It's like they were in this.

2314
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:15,280
I'm going to move again.

2315
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:18,560
It's like they were all in these little like tray.

2316
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:22,080
That tray is like little bins, essentially.

2317
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:22,400
Okay.

2318
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,680
I'll let you remember the.

2319
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:24,480
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

2320
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:24,640
Yeah.

2321
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:25,280
I see what you're saying.

2322
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,720
All the characters would be in there.

2323
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:28,800
And you pick one out.

2324
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:30,320
Not bad.

2325
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:34,640
So I think we got like those and again, maybe a shirt, but I do remember because I was too.

2326
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:39,360
I was not allowed to see the first two Batman movies in the theater.

2327
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,240
I was told obviously Batman.

2328
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:40,880
Yeah, me same.

2329
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:41,280
Yeah, yeah.

2330
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:41,840
89.

2331
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,680
I'm four years old.

2332
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:45,200
So, okay, probably not.

2333
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:46,720
But then returns comes on.

2334
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:51,040
I remember my mom, she doesn't remember any of this saw return Batman returns with her

2335
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:53,120
friend to see if I could see it.

2336
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,560
And they ruled no.

2337
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:55,280
They said no.

2338
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:57,920
They may have been right.

2339
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:58,880
It's a disturbing.

2340
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,560
It's a very, it's a horny movie.

2341
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:01,600
It's disturbing.

2342
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,200
It's I was, yeah, 92.

2343
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:08,800
I'm eight years old, so I probably would have been freaked out in the theater, but I loved

2344
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:09,840
Batman.

2345
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:12,640
And anytime you would see Batman in the mall, you get very excited.

2346
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:16,880
So I would just be, it was cool to be near Batman in the Warner Brothers store.

2347
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:17,760
I remember.

2348
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,520
And then finally going to see Batman forever.

2349
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:23,840
Ninety five was my first, which maybe this explains my thing with Batman forever.

2350
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:26,560
In some ways, my first Batman experience.

2351
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:28,800
You were pent up and ready to explode.

2352
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,800
I was here to shoot all over the.

2353
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:35,280
Batman joy.

2354
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,760
Yes, not with anything, not with cream.

2355
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,760
With Danny Devito, black blood like.

2356
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:47,040
Yeah, it says read a bleed all over Batman in celebration with my black blood.

2357
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,680
I had a lot of toys for Batman returns.

2358
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:51,120
Yes, McDonald's toys.

2359
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:52,160
Toys, toys.

2360
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:54,960
Yeah, let me have all the toys, but didn't see the wow.

2361
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:55,600
We're all the same.

2362
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:56,100
Yeah.

2363
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,120
And the toys make it look so much more fun.

2364
01:32:59,120 --> 01:32:59,840
The penguins.

2365
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:04,560
I had some of the penguins, like the penguin with a jet pack and the penguin with a rocket launcher.

2366
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,640
The actual penguin, not the character.

2367
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:11,760
My mom brought one of those here because my son saw a penguin that he liked in an aquarium

2368
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:14,000
and gave it a hug and like, doesn't he have a penguin?

2369
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,880
He took the rocket pack off, but so now it's just a generic penguin.

2370
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:20,080
Well, some of it, because like penguin is in a, they say toy, you know,

2371
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:24,000
toy addict, it's a very toy addict giant duck like vehicle in that movie.

2372
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:24,480
Oh yeah.

2373
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:25,280
The big yellow duck.

2374
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:28,400
So they had, I had the toy, I think of him in the like duck too.

2375
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,280
You're like, oh man, I want to see this, but it's scary.

2376
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:35,520
And it was so emotional for me was when the flesh entered the speed force

2377
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:41,680
and he ripped open the fabric of time, thus creating a line of every single bat mobile

2378
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:48,720
and vehicle with a price tag on top of it and a QR code that you can scan in the theater.

2379
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:52,560
So you could just buy them right then and there.

2380
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:53,440
Did you see the flesh?

2381
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:55,120
Yeah.

2382
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:55,360
Yeah.

2383
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:55,860
Okay.

2384
01:33:56,820 --> 01:33:58,420
It's why I've been so, yeah.

2385
01:33:58,420 --> 01:33:59,620
I just wanted to make sure.

2386
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:00,260
I just wanted to make sure.

2387
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:00,980
Cora, what do you mean?

2388
01:34:00,980 --> 01:34:02,100
Did I see, I felt it.

2389
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:03,380
No, you sound like you saw it.

2390
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:04,420
I just wanted to double check.

2391
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:05,620
No, I'm sorry.

2392
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:07,780
Did I not just describe the best part of it?

2393
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:08,980
Yeah, yeah, you did.

2394
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:10,900
It is so, it's so funny.

2395
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:16,180
It's such a weird movie in theaters, but like reading the monthly flash comics has like

2396
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:16,580
puberty.

2397
01:34:16,580 --> 01:34:18,420
Jesus wants to talk about the flash comics.

2398
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:20,100
And it's hitting me like-

2399
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:20,900
At 9-11.

2400
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:24,100
I don't really like being 12 or 13.

2401
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,700
Super school's kind of hard.

2402
01:34:27,860 --> 01:34:31,620
I don't have a girlfriend as far as the eye can see, but maybe my friend bought the

2403
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:34,260
flash comic this month and I could borrow it to read.

2404
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:34,420
You know what?

2405
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:36,020
I got no lady taz yet.

2406
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:39,860
As far as I know, I don't have a girlfriend, which sounded like the answer about the iPad.

2407
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:42,340
As far as I know, I did not.

2408
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:43,300
As far as I know.

2409
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:45,460
Sorry, I am made of a streak.

2410
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:47,460
I definitely did not have a girlfriend.

2411
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:48,500
That's definitive.

2412
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:49,060
Definitively.

2413
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:50,180
You know what's funny about flash?

2414
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:51,300
Now I'm thinking about it.

2415
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:54,180
I was reading flash a little bit when I was like 10 or 11.

2416
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:55,300
It felt like an adult comic.

2417
01:34:55,300 --> 01:35:01,060
And maybe you guys ever have this happen where you would whine about going to get something?

2418
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:03,780
Because I remember going, we need to go get the flash.

2419
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:08,980
And then your mom would be very mad at you, but do it.

2420
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:12,020
And then you'd have this weird feeling of like, oh shit.

2421
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:18,660
Like we're on our way to get the comic and I'm going to win, but mom is so mad at me.

2422
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:22,180
And now it like leaves a cloud over you the rest of the night.

2423
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:23,780
Do you remember this?

2424
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:28,980
Honestly, you're describing that I'm hearing this as a parent and I'm realizing this is a very good

2425
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:30,500
weapon to me.

2426
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:30,980
It is.

2427
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:34,340
In a way that I like attitude and tension.

2428
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:35,060
Yes.

2429
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:37,220
To make him feel bad for not shutting up.

2430
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:39,700
I think I'm going to use this on the other side is what I'm going to do.

2431
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:41,700
No, break the cycle.

2432
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:45,140
I think it's the only way to learn.

2433
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:47,860
Your child will end up becoming a podcast or even worse.

2434
01:35:47,860 --> 01:35:48,360
No.

2435
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:50,900
Now you've really scared them the other way.

2436
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:51,780
A truth teller.

2437
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:53,860
I remember it going well for me.

2438
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:57,780
I remember doing it with the dragon's order and going to Toys R Us at like 8 45

2439
01:35:57,780 --> 01:35:59,620
and getting the dragon's order and it was fine.

2440
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:02,260
But this flash you did, you're talking about flash comics so much.

2441
01:36:02,260 --> 01:36:06,500
I remember we went to go get flash like at 9 PM or something.

2442
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:08,740
And I remember she was just mad at me.

2443
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:15,700
And I remember like feeling so bad, like reading it and like having an unpleasant time doing it.

2444
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:18,660
Because I felt like I had made her so upset.

2445
01:36:18,660 --> 01:36:19,860
I think I'm on her side.

2446
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:21,140
I think that's what she had to do.

2447
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:23,060
Well, obviously you need to shut up about the flash.

2448
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:25,940
It left me because I saw flash on the side of the building.

2449
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:28,420
It's a memory from when I was a kid.

2450
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:33,300
Now my association, if we're playing psychologist here, my association with the flash is that

2451
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:37,700
it means that I made my mother upset, which is the worst thing you can have as a kid.

2452
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:38,260
Wow.

2453
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:38,580
Wow.

2454
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:40,900
And this is why you need to go and heal.

2455
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:43,060
To see this new flash.

2456
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:44,820
Andy Machetti's flash.

2457
01:36:44,820 --> 01:36:46,020
Yes, Mushi-ed-y.

2458
01:36:46,020 --> 01:36:46,740
Mushi-ed-y.

2459
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:47,940
Sorry, Mushi-ed-y.

2460
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:49,220
Wait, that might be wrong.

2461
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:50,020
I forget already.

2462
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:50,980
I don't know.

2463
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:51,700
It might have been.

2464
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:53,540
Who knows?

2465
01:36:54,820 --> 01:36:58,580
Maybe there's a part of it where the flash enters the speed force and reverses that

2466
01:36:58,580 --> 01:37:00,180
and makes your mom happy in that moment.

2467
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:00,820
Oh, gosh.

2468
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:03,460
Your awareness, you a kid.

2469
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:08,420
This is how much the movies are AI'd now to just appeal to.

2470
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:12,500
Please put my own flash memories in the movie for me.

2471
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:13,620
That is not far away.

2472
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:14,500
Yeah, that's the future.

2473
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:15,060
That is.

2474
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:15,780
Yeah.

2475
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:16,340
Sure.

2476
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:19,540
All my toys scuffed in the exact places.

2477
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:23,380
This is what Zaslav is going to do for us.

2478
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:23,940
My Ernie.

2479
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:28,260
As soon as we get those pesky writers out of the way, movies can be what we need them to be.

2480
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:29,300
Yep, that's true.

2481
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:29,940
Who's the director?

2482
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:30,660
Oh, the Russos.

2483
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:38,580
Yeah, the Russos are dreaming of this future where every movie stars you and a famous actress

2484
01:37:38,580 --> 01:37:39,540
who you want to kiss.

2485
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:42,900
Or a character like Chase Meridian.

2486
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:49,460
I think you're going to end up all for all of all four Zaslav, Russo, Muschietti future.

2487
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:49,780
Yeah.

2488
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:52,020
Because it's finally your chance to.

2489
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:52,580
Finally.

2490
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:58,340
Finally, we get the cool dystopian parts of Fahrenheit 451.

2491
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:03,780
No individual can stop a dystopia entirely themselves.

2492
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:04,420
So why not?

2493
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:08,100
If it's going to be one, let's enjoy the cool parts.

2494
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:08,600
Yeah.

2495
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:13,720
There's no, if you look in that little insert, the Batman forever insert catalog,

2496
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:16,200
there are no Chase Meridian anything.

2497
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:22,520
It's all Batman and Robin and Two-Face and the Riddler and the Batmobile and

2498
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:25,560
the Shafour shirts are those characters as well.

2499
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:27,400
Marketing is already they're working on.

2500
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:33,240
There was a line of exclusive Wizard of Oz action figures to the Warner Brothers tour.

2501
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:37,880
Or also at some point I saw them like in the marketing department, the product management

2502
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:38,360
department.

2503
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:38,600
Yeah.

2504
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:45,080
One of them was holding like clearly a Maltese Falcon and I'm like, oh man, it is amazing.

2505
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:49,320
I was not a weird little kid going like, can we buy the Maltese Falcon for the house?

2506
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:51,400
It won't be our downfall.

2507
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:52,920
Surely by obsessions.

2508
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:55,400
Buy a Maltese Falcon.

2509
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:58,040
I'm surprised you didn't have a Maltese Falcon as a kid.

2510
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:01,240
Mom, mom, we have like no McGuffins in the house at all.

2511
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:02,280
You should own.

2512
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,600
I'm going to buy you a Maltese Falcon.

2513
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:05,240
It's a good idea.

2514
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:05,560
It's a good.

2515
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:06,440
Oh, thank you.

2516
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:10,680
And just give it to him purely.

2517
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:11,960
Don't make him feel bad about it.

2518
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:15,640
Don't you start whining so that he gives it to you and makes you feel guilty about it.

2519
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:19,080
Oh, my trick used to be like, oh, you're going to the mall.

2520
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:20,280
You're going to Sears to return.

2521
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:21,560
So I'll come with you.

2522
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:22,840
I'll swing by the comic store.

2523
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:24,840
Well, we can't say no.

2524
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:28,440
I can't politely say no.

2525
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:29,960
I was like, oh, you're driving right by there.

2526
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:35,640
I'll just run in real quick and do my 25 minutes looping around the comic store.

2527
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:36,440
Really sly.

2528
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:36,840
Yeah.

2529
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:37,480
Yeah.

2530
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:46,440
So to tie into the Batman thing a little bit, clearly the like need for these places to

2531
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:51,480
become the Schumacher Batman headquarters was very strong.

2532
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:58,920
And now we go into a rabbit hole that somehow I did long ago before this episode was even

2533
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:02,200
a twinkle in Finkelstein's eye.

2534
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:09,000
I weirdly a couple of years ago found a set of videos on the same YouTube chip, probably

2535
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:14,360
because it's on the same YouTube channel as the holiday videos that say how good the stores

2536
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:16,360
are doing elsewhere on that.

2537
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:22,680
There are multiple, I believe, four entire editions of the Warner Brothers Studio Store

2538
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:30,600
internal awards where they award like general managers and like just, you know, like whatever.

2539
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:31,880
All right.

2540
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:33,400
And representing the West region.

2541
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:36,680
And that sounds incredibly mundane.

2542
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:38,440
And it is for a lot of it.

2543
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:44,440
But the thing that makes it special, I think, is that they dress these things up to the

2544
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:44,840
nines.

2545
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:51,160
These are happening on the lot in Burbank and they are happening with stars.

2546
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:55,000
These are produced award shows shot multicam.

2547
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,040
Like the quality is not incredible, but it's also not bad.

2548
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:02,760
They they they preserve these things and like made it a tape that you could get if I think

2549
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:04,280
if you worked at the stores.

2550
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:06,520
Oh, and by the way, what these awards, what are they called?

2551
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:08,760
You ask why they're called the bugs.

2552
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:10,920
It's the bugs.

2553
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:13,080
Yeah, that's right.

2554
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:15,640
I did have a line in my notes.

2555
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:18,200
I was just like, yes, about the bugs.

2556
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:18,920
The award.

2557
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:22,040
Like, are they good enough for their own?

2558
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:24,120
And I was like, what are the bugs?

2559
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:25,640
No, we're not doing the bugs.

2560
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:27,640
I can say my thoughts about the bugs.

2561
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:29,160
The awards in 10 minutes.

2562
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:29,560
I didn't.

2563
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:31,080
I saw them right before we came.

2564
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:32,600
This is crazy talk out there.

2565
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:34,120
OK, I went.

2566
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:34,840
You are right, though.

2567
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:35,960
There is there is a ton there.

2568
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:38,440
I'll try to do it quickly.

2569
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:43,880
The biggest thing about it, you can tell that these just makes you it makes you feel like

2570
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:51,320
these stores mattered to the Warner Company because one year Bob Daly co CEO is there.

2571
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:55,640
They send different stars of Warner properties to go to these things.

2572
01:41:57,880 --> 01:41:59,400
Perhaps the biggest.

2573
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:01,880
Well, I mean, I'll say this one because it happens twice.

2574
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:05,160
Joel Schumacher is sent to these things on two occasions.

2575
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:07,560
I can't tell exactly.

2576
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:11,080
One is definitely right before Batman and Robin is coming out.

2577
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:13,640
And the other one might have been while they were filming.

2578
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:16,760
I'm not sure because here's how open book this guy.

2579
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:18,200
He has nothing prepared.

2580
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:23,000
He's just extemporaneously talking and being really casual about how everything's going.

2581
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,160
And you know, and it's and you guys are important to it.

2582
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:28,520
You know, we're just one end of this thing and you guys need to get it out there.

2583
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:30,520
And we love the work that you're doing.

2584
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:36,360
And hey, is anybody if anybody a fan of the circus circus fans because we're doing this

2585
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:37,880
big circus sequence tomorrow.

2586
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:40,360
If you want to come over to stage 16, we're shooting it.

2587
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:45,320
If you all want to come, he invites all of these Warburg Studios stores managers to the set.

2588
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:45,820
Wow.

2589
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:47,980
I didn't see this.

2590
01:42:47,980 --> 01:42:49,420
Is there a circus part of Batman and Robin?

2591
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:53,740
Well, no, circuses in three is in forever because of the graces.

2592
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:56,620
OK, Batman Forever is ninety five.

2593
01:42:56,620 --> 01:42:57,500
I think it's too late.

2594
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:58,940
I think this would have been.

2595
01:42:58,940 --> 01:42:59,820
Well, what's a circus?

2596
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:05,180
Well, there's the there's the poison ivy ball that she has in Batman and Robin

2597
01:43:05,820 --> 01:43:11,660
where like Bane is in the gorilla suit and then Batman and Robin swing.

2598
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:14,460
Yeah, but that's a whole big like on the Warner Brothers lot.

2599
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:17,580
Big set constructed on the biggest stage.

2600
01:43:17,580 --> 01:43:22,060
They have the one with the logo on is right next to where we did Conan and credit like

2601
01:43:22,060 --> 01:43:23,420
massive, massive stage.

2602
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:29,260
So he like they're like these Warner Brothers, these store people, they might work in

2603
01:43:29,260 --> 01:43:31,260
Schomburg or Connecticut or whatever.

2604
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:34,300
But they're part of that's crazy for this day.

2605
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:37,180
And like and not only that, Schumacher comes twice.

2606
01:43:37,180 --> 01:43:41,820
Chris O'Donnell, Chris O'Donnell is there once and they are screaming their heads off.

2607
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:43,100
They're losing their minds.

2608
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:44,540
The Chris O'Donnell is there.

2609
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:45,040
Wow.

2610
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:48,220
What year did it say it was that those awards?

2611
01:43:48,220 --> 01:43:49,260
There's so many.

2612
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:50,380
There's multiple ones.

2613
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:50,540
Yes.

2614
01:43:50,540 --> 01:43:51,900
Yeah, yeah, of them are on.

2615
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:56,060
But I feel like it's I feel like what's posted is ninety five to ninety.

2616
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:57,580
It is on a specific YouTube channel.

2617
01:43:57,580 --> 01:43:58,540
Dan wait.

2618
01:43:58,540 --> 01:44:03,660
Thanks, Dan, for posting this stuff because Warner Brothers stores open in ninety four.

2619
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:06,140
No earlier one ninety one.

2620
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:06,460
Sorry.

2621
01:44:06,460 --> 01:44:06,860
Yeah, yeah.

2622
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:08,300
Stores open in eighty seven.

2623
01:44:08,940 --> 01:44:09,440
OK.

2624
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,800
It's all rise and fall kind of YouTube video.

2625
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:16,560
And it was pointing out like Disney store opens in ninety seven.

2626
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:21,680
At some point, the chain Paramount video morphed into Suncoast movies,

2627
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:23,280
which was everywhere.

2628
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:23,780
Right.

2629
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:29,600
So if the ninety five awards, that's the would have been out.

2630
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:30,800
Yeah, it would have been out already.

2631
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:31,280
I don't know.

2632
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:32,480
He calls a circus sequence.

2633
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:32,800
I'm not sure.

2634
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:33,680
Maybe it was cut.

2635
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:34,320
Maybe this was it.

2636
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:37,440
Maybe this was this could only be seen in the Schumacher cut of Batman and Robin.

2637
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:38,000
Oh, my gosh.

2638
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:39,040
First, we can't.

2639
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:43,760
There's no way there's Schumacher, Batman and Robin without Schumacher, Batman forever.

2640
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:47,600
Oh, no, I would love to know what if he was given free rein.

2641
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:52,080
To me, Batman and Robin feels plenty Schumacher as it is.

2642
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:55,920
I don't think there was a different vision for Batman and Robin.

2643
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:58,800
No, I think he got I think he completely got his way there.

2644
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:00,880
They got all the Burton out of it.

2645
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:04,480
Yeah, there's not one drop of Burton left in Batman and Robin.

2646
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:11,040
The one it's so great when he he talks for so long to them in the second one, especially

2647
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:15,680
he presents the awards he has to go like and he has to say jargon.

2648
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:19,440
He talks about like, you know, in this in the Atlantic City location

2649
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:23,360
has been great with their white TV's and he's like, I don't know what that means.

2650
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:24,080
What's white TV?

2651
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:24,480
I don't know.

2652
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:25,920
And just go on.

2653
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:29,520
Just blab it like, you know, I just came from vacation, so I'm just wearing this.

2654
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:32,560
Should is the only shirt that I have so that you're just going to have to deal with this.

2655
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:33,600
I don't know where I am.

2656
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:34,400
Do we have a clip?

2657
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:34,880
I think we have a good.

2658
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:35,920
Do you want to see the trailer?

2659
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:38,480
OK, I wasn't sure because I don't know if they maybe they showed the trailer to you

2660
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:38,720
already.

2661
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:39,360
Let's watch the trailer.

2662
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:40,320
Let's do the trailer.

2663
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:43,360
OK, well, we're going to need and he talks about some of the stuff that you're alluding

2664
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:45,200
to my that there were no chase meridian.

2665
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:49,440
He says, like, we noticed with the first one young girls really liked it.

2666
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,440
So that's why we're happy we had Batgirl.

2667
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:54,240
And so we got a lot of great Batgirl stuff coming for you.

2668
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:55,360
Robin, if he's talking about this.

2669
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:56,400
That's a yes.

2670
01:45:56,400 --> 01:46:00,880
But the first one, I swear he invites everyone who works at the company who's there to come

2671
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:02,000
see a circus scene.

2672
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:03,200
Could it be mislabeled?

2673
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:04,400
Maybe it's mislabeled.

2674
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,200
I don't think so.

2675
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:06,640
I mean, I think this guy knows his shit.

2676
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:08,000
I think this is an insider.

2677
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,040
I'll send you the clip.

2678
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:10,640
You're going to solve this.

2679
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:14,080
We need to solve the case of the correct case.

2680
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:15,440
You got a lot to solve after this.

2681
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:22,960
He's he's it's great seeing him before Batman and Robin comes out because he doesn't know

2682
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:23,680
what's coming.

2683
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:27,040
He doesn't know that it's not going to go over so great.

2684
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,960
So he's going he loves he's going on and on.

2685
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:32,240
He says when we got Mr.

2686
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:33,760
Freeze, of course, Arnold, what can you say?

2687
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:34,960
I think the suit I think Mr.

2688
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:39,360
Freeze is suit is the greatest suit ever constructed for any film ever.

2689
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:44,000
I guess now that I've said that, I was going to say the suit is awesome.

2690
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:49,360
It's a specific area suits to Batman.

2691
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:53,920
Robin is great, but it's great in a specific way.

2692
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:59,760
But you can't not say but of course you can't end the sentence with great.

2693
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:04,080
I've maintained that if you keep the same cast and the same outfits and sets and the

2694
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:09,520
script is just different that we it's a whole different ballgame torn because what makes

2695
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:10,160
it bad?

2696
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:11,680
A lot of it is the puns.

2697
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:12,180
Yes.

2698
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,200
If the puns weren't there, that's part of it.

2699
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:17,520
Then what then what when what do you have?

2700
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:18,960
You'd have to have a new take on it.

2701
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,280
But I maintain that if you wrote it more like the sick, they thought they were making

2702
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:24,640
like a 60s Batman.

2703
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:25,840
That's actually funny.

2704
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:27,760
This is actually growing worthy funny.

2705
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:32,640
It also has things where like there's like henchmen on ice and then they slip around

2706
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:35,360
and it goes like really bad.

2707
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:36,560
That's cartoon sound.

2708
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:39,520
There's a little of it in Batman forever.

2709
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:45,680
Yeah, but I maintain that people still don't know that the 60s Batman was funny on purpose.

2710
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:49,920
And I do believe that it was an elevated that it was like a get smart that it was like a

2711
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:51,920
I think it was like part of a wave of.

2712
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:52,880
Yeah, for sure.

2713
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:54,720
Yeah, played straight.

2714
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:55,920
I think Joel didn't know that.

2715
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:57,920
Like everybody didn't know that.

2716
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:59,760
No, it's like it's what they saw they were doing.

2717
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:02,800
It's Dutch angles and colors, aka funny.

2718
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:03,120
Yeah.

2719
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:05,920
And then the jokes, the joke is that it's cheesy.

2720
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:09,120
Yeah, because that's what if you think people think about 60s Batman is the joke is that

2721
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:11,600
it's cheesy, but that is not the joke.

2722
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:12,400
No, no.

2723
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:15,280
It is written by comedy writers.

2724
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:22,000
Yeah, the the part of the conflict is that like the market, the McDonald's tie ins,

2725
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,360
the action for like all of that is just like, oh, there's a new Batman.

2726
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:27,840
It's a dramatic Batman.

2727
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:29,280
It's he's solving crimes.

2728
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:30,560
You know, he's fighting bad guys.

2729
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:34,560
You know, you get there and you don't know that it's suddenly become like it's like it's

2730
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:35,760
like a big 60s.

2731
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:36,960
It's like, yeah, good.

2732
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:42,880
Do it's like it's the biggest fair knows what's good to do is it's like a bit of giant

2733
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,760
all star gaudy silly.

2734
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:50,480
Yeah, like it's there's no way to truly prepare for what you're getting with Batman and Robin.

2735
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:55,520
He also seems like he Joel was much more like, all right, you want me to do more stuff for the

2736
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:55,920
kids?

2737
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:56,240
Fine.

2738
01:48:56,240 --> 01:48:58,480
Whatever you'd like, like, God bless.

2739
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:02,160
OK, it's going to be like like lighter and there's going to be a lot more characters

2740
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:02,720
for toys.

2741
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:03,040
Great.

2742
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:05,520
The corporate mandate, he's completely on board to do it.

2743
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,200
He's like, I'm a hired gun.

2744
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,640
I think it's evidenced by that.

2745
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:11,920
He is here talking to the store people twice.

2746
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:14,000
Yeah, 15, 20 minute stretches.

2747
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,120
He doesn't want to leave.

2748
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:16,240
They have to drag him out of that.

2749
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:17,440
He would stay there all day.

2750
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:18,000
He loves it.

2751
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:23,200
And the final thing he says also, and hey, what more what more need I say?

2752
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:24,560
George Clooney and black rubber.

2753
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,520
I remember him pushing in general.

2754
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:31,120
That was part of the I don't I don't know.

2755
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:32,560
I think you do need to say more.

2756
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:34,480
Yeah, that's weird.

2757
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:40,640
Also, I think you also need to disclose that the black rubber includes nipples and realistic

2758
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:40,960
body.

2759
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:43,360
Realistic near like almost like scrotum shape.

2760
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:45,040
That's what the rubber is.

2761
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:49,120
One thing I don't think anyone was prepared for what was going to be on those bodies.

2762
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:49,760
The buttocks.

2763
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:50,960
Yes.

2764
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:55,200
Yeah, it's insane when there's smash cut when they smash into the crotches.

2765
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:56,720
Yeah, I'll get them back.

2766
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:57,840
Girl gets them too.

2767
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:00,800
Yeah, we got a smash soon.

2768
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:01,920
Yes, in a way, though.

2769
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:07,360
I mean, wouldn't you love if I know they're Hey, spoilers characters are coming back,

2770
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,200
but they're never going to bring back the vibe.

2771
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:10,400
That's what's gone forever.

2772
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:12,160
The vibe is that's yeah.

2773
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:14,480
And it's the same with the store vibe.

2774
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:15,200
It's gone.

2775
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:15,840
The vibe is gone.

2776
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:17,280
Never to be recaptured.

2777
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:20,800
Yeah, I didn't know when it was closing.

2778
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:25,920
The closure resulted in 3800 people getting laid off.

2779
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:34,400
Which even with like mergers, that was 4% of the company's 90,000 member workforce.

2780
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:35,680
Like that's not nothing.

2781
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:37,200
Of all of Warner Brothers?

2782
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:37,600
Yeah.

2783
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:38,240
My God.

2784
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:43,920
I think it was and it was something like half of those employees are part time,

2785
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,800
which means the other half are full time.

2786
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:49,840
And so I guess if you factor in marketing and product,

2787
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:52,480
like all the behind the scenes, like office people,

2788
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:54,640
but even so that's like 3800.

2789
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:56,720
And I think one of the mergers,

2790
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:01,920
after I forget, I think it was the Turner merger.

2791
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:05,760
This was like the second round of layoffs that year.

2792
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:08,960
Like they were already condensing the company.

2793
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:12,640
Well, this was this is them transitioning from their old brand to the new brand.

2794
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:15,440
The old brand is cartoons and superheroes.

2795
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:17,520
The new brand is constant layoffs.

2796
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:20,400
So they were thinking to the future,

2797
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:23,280
the Warner Brothers of the 2000s is going to be a little different.

2798
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:26,880
Mainly there will not be health benefits for anybody.

2799
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:29,520
But they are also simultaneously, I believe right now,

2800
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:32,320
doing 100 years of Warner Brothers.

2801
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:35,280
And I mean, we're all so excited to celebrate.

2802
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:36,480
Is very odd.

2803
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:39,040
They have read the room and the room has said,

2804
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:40,560
we want to celebrate with you.

2805
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:41,280
Congrats.

2806
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:42,480
Happy 100 Warner.

2807
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:45,840
Thanks for everything you've done for us.

2808
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:48,800
And thanks for getting rid of those pesky shows that we don't.

2809
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:50,000
They were just in the way.

2810
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:50,560
They're in the way.

2811
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:52,800
We don't want to take any more.

2812
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:54,400
Yeah, we were worried about the server.

2813
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:56,720
We know how precarious the server is.

2814
01:51:56,720 --> 01:52:00,560
What would the devious algae rhythm always trying to make his way on there?

2815
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:03,360
You need is you need to clear off the clutter.

2816
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:06,560
There's too many Space Coast Coast to Coast episodes.

2817
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:08,800
And they didn't even make it to half an hour.

2818
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:14,720
I was I've been like, like Max is I've been honestly dying to sign up for Max,

2819
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:17,920
but I was just really waiting for like, what's that last hook going to be?

2820
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:21,840
And ultimately, when I heard a total lack of Space Coast Coast to Coast,

2821
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:25,280
I was like in I signed up for I signed up straight to 10 years.

2822
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:27,440
Yeah, I love what a hook.

2823
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:29,040
I fucking hate Space Coast.

2824
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:30,400
I'm so glad he won't be there.

2825
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:31,680
Yeah, they got me.

2826
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:32,560
They got you.

2827
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:38,400
If you want to see these employees in happier times before it all fell apart,

2828
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:47,360
watch the the Bugsy Awards where you can see full sketches that they made in the store.

2829
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:56,800
Music videos, a foot like a multi song version of Grease that is fleece because of fleece sweaters.

2830
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:00,720
There is a big parody of Madonna's Vogue called Fold.

2831
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:03,040
That one is that's at the Woodfield Mall.

2832
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:05,600
There's a music video filmed by employees at your mall.

2833
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:10,640
There's all the like I've heard that the Gremlins are a part of this in general.

2834
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:13,760
They've got certain stores that Gremlins crawling up in the walls.

2835
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:18,320
It's so they do like Letterman top 10 lists.

2836
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:22,080
There's a whole Willy Wonka parody called the Acme Man can.

2837
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:28,560
They do the entire thing called Shoppers Paradise where some general manager is in a Coolio wig.

2838
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:33,920
This is what a treasure trove of retail mundanity.

2839
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:37,520
There's so there's I've look I've participated in something like this.

2840
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:43,840
I've explained on the show before making videos for internal use only for retail, a retail store.

2841
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:45,680
But that container store.

2842
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:47,040
Yeah, yeah, I've talked about this.

2843
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:50,640
I made a video for the and we showed it to the owner of the store when he was in town.

2844
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:52,400
I mentioned this for him to see.

2845
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:53,120
I don't remember it.

2846
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:55,040
Next time I said this, I think you've mentioned.

2847
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:58,720
Yeah, so my friends and I would make videos in high school and we decided to make a video

2848
01:53:58,720 --> 01:53:59,760
because we all worked at Container Store.

2849
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:05,760
We made a video for to talk about the new sale for the shelving we were having during the winter

2850
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:14,000
and we made a very weird video at the store at like 4 a.m. and we edited it and we everyone in

2851
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,400
the store thought it was the greatest thing they'd ever seen.

2852
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:18,800
So we were getting like, oh my God, this is so funny.

2853
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:19,520
This is great.

2854
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:22,640
Let's show it to one of the owners when he's here in a couple of weeks

2855
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:24,720
working at the store because he would he would come around.

2856
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:28,560
And I remember I was not even working that day.

2857
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:33,520
I came to the store so I could sit and watch him watch this video.

2858
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:34,000
We made it.

2859
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:39,760
Went into the stock room and we put it in.

2860
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:41,440
It's very like unassuming.

2861
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:43,040
Texas guy.

2862
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:44,240
Well, nice to meet you.

2863
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:52,000
Showed him this video in which Luke, my friend, Luke playing an employee gets choked out by a rabid

2864
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:53,440
customer.

2865
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:57,600
He didn't crack a smile the entire time.

2866
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:58,240
Oh.

2867
01:54:58,240 --> 01:54:59,760
And said, well, that's very nice.

2868
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:00,800
It's very interesting.

2869
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:01,920
And then he got up and he left.

2870
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:04,720
And we were devastated.

2871
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:06,320
I don't know what we know.

2872
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:06,960
We Asian.

2873
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:08,640
We were humiliated in this one guy.

2874
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:13,040
This guy, Frank, Frank, Soraru was like an old Vietnam vet who worked at the store

2875
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:18,720
who was behind him watching the video stifling his laughter because he thought it was the

2876
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:23,040
funniest thing he'd ever seen, but he didn't want to laugh in front of the guy who owns a company.

2877
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:26,080
So he was like, that is the funniest fucking thing I've ever seen.

2878
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:26,720
He told us later.

2879
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:28,080
We're like, that's great.

2880
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:30,400
But we didn't, the guy didn't like it.

2881
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:34,960
The guy who owns a company solely like counting down the time where he can just jump to like

2882
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:39,840
home goods or bed bath and be like, he was just trying to trade up.

2883
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:41,200
Yeah.

2884
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:41,600
Well, no.

2885
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:43,120
So like, so it was shock.

2886
01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:43,920
We were shocked.

2887
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:48,960
But, but anyway, my point was going to be just that I, there's so many more internal

2888
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:54,160
videos out there like that of like all the employees put on a show or they do this thing

2889
01:55:54,160 --> 01:55:59,440
or I would like some of it's online and like, there's so much of that.

2890
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:03,040
There's like a whole podcast in that probably just in general.

2891
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:03,680
That's true.

2892
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:04,240
Yeah. I know.

2893
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:06,160
I know I saw a good cheesecake factory one.

2894
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:06,640
I know.

2895
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:11,840
I think it was, I think it was a parody of fancy Iggy Zellies fancy with a bunch of like,

2896
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:17,920
you know, like whatever they call the buzzers, like the cheesy factory internal use terminology.

2897
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:21,440
We there's of course that captain Eeyore Disney thing.

2898
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:22,080
Oh yeah.

2899
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:26,320
Land employees made the Narts videos we were talking about with Rachel Bloom.

2900
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:27,440
Yeah.

2901
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:29,120
Those were very polished.

2902
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:29,760
So internal.

2903
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:30,960
It's great.

2904
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:32,000
Store video.

2905
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,760
If you made a video at your store, we want to see it.

2906
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:40,880
It's a Jay Mike's video of them like dancing to Robin's dancing on my own.

2907
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:43,440
Didn't take off where they're singing.

2908
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:47,040
I'm in the corner stocking the shelving.

2909
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:50,160
You think that's what the video was?

2910
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:51,840
That's what Mike's video was.

2911
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:53,520
When did that song come out?

2912
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:53,760
Yeah.

2913
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:54,720
Timeline wise.

2914
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:54,880
Yeah.

2915
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,560
Wait, is Mike at the container store?

2916
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:57,520
A few years.

2917
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:58,560
In 20 minutes.

2918
01:56:58,560 --> 01:56:59,120
A couple years in.

2919
01:56:59,120 --> 01:57:00,960
A few years in.

2920
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:02,560
I know it's a little before they think.

2921
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:02,800
Yeah.

2922
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:04,560
Do you have a video?

2923
01:57:05,120 --> 01:57:05,680
I have a video.

2924
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:05,840
Yeah.

2925
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:06,480
Oh my God.

2926
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:07,920
At least a part of it.

2927
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:08,800
You got to post this.

2928
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:08,960
Yeah.

2929
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:09,600
I have all of it.

2930
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:10,000
Yes.

2931
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:10,560
Yeah.

2932
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:11,360
Okay.

2933
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:12,160
All right.

2934
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:13,920
Make reminds my listeners.

2935
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:15,200
Luke might have digitized.

2936
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:15,680
I think.

2937
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:16,800
Get this up.

2938
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:18,000
We want to see this.

2939
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:21,040
Well, so, you know,

2940
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:25,920
I think maybe one of the craziest things about this entire story is just the speed.

2941
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:27,280
It's all 10 years.

2942
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:27,520
Yeah.

2943
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:34,800
From the from nothing from one location to 130 glamorous award shows.

2944
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:35,760
Kathy Griffin,

2945
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:39,760
Mike O'Malley, all of Hollywood's bid is kind of crazy.

2946
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:40,480
They have to come.

2947
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,800
They don't even seem to know what it is or why.

2948
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:46,640
Chevy Chase hanging out on the cover of the Warner Brothers catalog with bugs.

2949
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:53,520
Trumpet, a bunch of the classiest man on earth hanging out at the stores, calling them beautiful.

2950
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:56,800
And then within 10 years, it's all it's all said and done.

2951
01:57:58,480 --> 01:57:58,880
Crazy.

2952
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:00,080
And I'll just pick a why.

2953
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:01,920
I think the why is just then the merger happened.

2954
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:04,000
It's like, well, we don't really want to do real estate.

2955
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:07,840
AOL wasn't in that real estate because they knew we were all going to be living in the digiverse.

2956
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:08,080
Yeah.

2957
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:09,840
Well, they were looking for a buyer.

2958
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:11,120
Oh, really?

2959
01:58:11,120 --> 01:58:12,560
They were going to split it off somehow.

2960
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:16,560
And so there was a chance that, yeah, somebody could

2961
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:20,480
have taken it, but I assume that's a large amount of stores and

2962
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:25,040
could potentially have been on its like a downturn business wise.

2963
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:28,400
Some international locations stuck around for a while.

2964
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:30,000
There was ones in Australia.

2965
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,840
There was ones in China.

2966
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:34,960
And those stuck around a lot longer.

2967
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:39,120
I think the China ones was like 2006 to 2014.

2968
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:39,440
Oh, weird.

2969
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:40,960
That's always just like there's still a toy.

2970
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:42,640
There's Toys R Us in Canada still.

2971
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:43,840
Yeah.

2972
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:44,400
Like weird.

2973
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:45,280
It's weird how that stuff.

2974
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:46,800
Tower Records in Japan.

2975
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:47,040
Right.

2976
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:47,840
It's wonderful to see.

2977
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:51,600
But pretty dead and gone now.

2978
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:56,960
And it's a boy is it a thing that makes every mall less fun.

2979
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:01,520
Boy, do I wish I could take the kid out of Marvin's rocket.

2980
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:04,560
I think he would love it unless there was even a single other child in there.

2981
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:06,240
And then he would run out immediately.

2982
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:08,640
But if we had it to ourselves, he would love it.

2983
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:09,140
Yeah, sure.

2984
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:12,960
And so would I.

2985
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:16,160
I would insist on crawling in there myself.

2986
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:18,880
I guess one problem they would have if these were still open is that

2987
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:22,560
a number of them would end up with a full man.

2988
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:25,600
The three of us by name.

2989
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:28,640
Yes, would maybe get stuck in the rocket.

2990
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:29,440
Be like Pooh Bear.

2991
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:33,200
Getting into the house with us.

2992
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:40,880
Yeah, I just I was like, is there any way you could bring this stuff back?

2993
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:43,760
But everything is so damaged at Warner Brothers.

2994
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:49,520
It's just that the stars are not aligned for this to exist now in any capacity.

2995
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:51,440
Not that this is going to ever happen.

2996
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:54,960
But I was like, oh, man, it would be cool if they started doing some of this again.

2997
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:55,920
Because there's all chatter.

2998
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:57,200
Oh, we're going to bring Toys R Us back.

2999
01:59:57,200 --> 02:00:01,360
And now Toys R Us is like in name only back in some Macy's.

3000
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:02,880
Yeah, third floor.

3001
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:05,440
Whoever owns it.

3002
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:06,080
Take the kid.

3003
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:09,200
They're not bad, but it's not what it was.

3004
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:14,080
Sure. But there's still like chatter that, OK, eventually that's the plan is to bring

3005
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:16,160
Toys R Us back in some capacity.

3006
02:00:16,160 --> 02:00:18,640
I know that's a different thing than Warner Brothers specifically store like

3007
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:19,440
Warner Brothers stores.

3008
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:22,720
But well, I think it's just right now it's impossible.

3009
02:00:22,720 --> 02:00:28,400
Yeah, they seem to have their hands full with very successful launches and brand management.

3010
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:33,200
But I was trying to I was like, is how could you if you brought the stars back now,

3011
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:37,440
how does it reflect the current if it was the Warner Brothers Discovery Studio store?

3012
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:38,080
Oh, yeah.

3013
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:40,000
My main idea is that it's still the rocket.

3014
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,840
It's still the rocket with all the buttons.

3015
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:44,000
But this is but it's not Marvin's rocket.

3016
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:50,240
It's Zazlaw's office and all of you can use the buttons to delete shows permanently from

3017
02:00:50,240 --> 02:00:51,760
being able to be seen by anyone.

3018
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:52,480
That's good.

3019
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:55,360
Yeah, it's not pretend they actually work.

3020
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:59,440
You have just deleted Infinity Train.

3021
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:04,960
No, no.

3022
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:05,840
Yeah, yeah.

3023
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:08,880
I'm sure it'll like exist somewhere, you know, and to live somewhere.

3024
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:09,440
I'm not sure.

3025
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:10,960
As long as someone has copies.

3026
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:12,240
That's all you need.

3027
02:01:12,240 --> 02:01:18,000
As I learned, if you make a show and then it's gone for a while from any streaming platform,

3028
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:22,080
just make your own streaming website and put it all there and have people DM you.

3029
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:25,680
I think it's the most it's the most streamlined way to do this.

3030
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:32,400
As far as I know, the handbrake software still free and separate USB DVD,

3031
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:35,520
RW drives very inexpensive.

3032
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:39,200
So if you need to rip stuff like if you have a DVD of that,

3033
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:41,440
I think they only released the first two seasons on DVD.

3034
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:42,880
No, I'm thinking about it.

3035
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:43,680
Not all four.

3036
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:46,880
I just mean if I just mean as long as somebody involved in the show.

3037
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:49,360
This goes to any listeners out there and it's very possible.

3038
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:53,840
There are even Club 3 listeners who've been part of a show that's been deleted forever.

3039
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:56,400
I'm sure just make sure someone has a hard drive.

3040
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:59,280
Get to be friends with those editors, those post people.

3041
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:00,960
All you need is to have it.

3042
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:02,720
I see people like, but the show is gone.

3043
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:09,760
Not not not as long as you have a shady streaming site and private DM links.

3044
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:10,400
That's all you need.

3045
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:15,520
In this case, take a little sidle over to the Internet Archive or Daily Motion,

3046
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:17,680
our friends in media preservation.

3047
02:02:17,680 --> 02:02:18,000
Yes.

3048
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:22,480
Yeah, the true kings of media today with no offense to David Zaslov.

3049
02:02:24,160 --> 02:02:24,960
Closing thoughts.

3050
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:25,360
Anything?

3051
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:26,320
Do we get it all out?

3052
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:30,560
Yeah, I just I'm obsessed with just the catalogs in general.

3053
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:32,960
There's just so much stuff if to get.

3054
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:35,280
I mean, that's that would I'm not saying we're doing another episode,

3055
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:36,240
but that's the stuff, right?

3056
02:02:36,240 --> 02:02:37,840
I keep finding fun stuff.

3057
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:40,400
I'm interested in like things like they have a picture called

3058
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:44,560
or a picture that's titled Monumental Characters with a Mount Rushmore of

3059
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:46,880
Warner Brothers at the time and their characters on.

3060
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:48,320
Did you see you just get a spoil?

3061
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:49,600
Jason, did you see it?

3062
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:50,240
No, I haven't seen.

3063
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:54,000
Do you want to guess who the four monumental characters are?

3064
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,920
Do we understand the brand or not?

3065
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:56,240
Right.

3066
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:58,480
So this is this is probably a couple years in.

3067
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:00,160
This is after the Hanna Barbera.

3068
02:03:00,160 --> 02:03:04,880
So that should be a hint of who could be on your Warner Brothers Mount Rushmore.

3069
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:05,120
Yeah.

3070
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:08,720
So you're guessing right now what this is, but then we can say our own as well.

3071
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:13,440
Yeah, I will say this one probably Bugs Bunny.

3072
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:13,920
Correct.

3073
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:15,760
Fred Flintstone.

3074
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:16,320
Correct.

3075
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:17,680
OK, Taz.

3076
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:19,120
No.

3077
02:03:19,120 --> 02:03:19,760
Superman.

3078
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:21,280
No.

3079
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:22,080
Batman.

3080
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:22,640
Yes.

3081
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:24,960
OK, so we got one more.

3082
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:25,600
One more.

3083
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:26,480
One more.

3084
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:27,200
Yogi Bear.

3085
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:28,500
No.

3086
02:03:29,460 --> 02:03:31,380
Real life or cartoon?

3087
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:32,260
Cartoon.

3088
02:03:32,260 --> 02:03:32,760
OK.

3089
02:03:35,940 --> 02:03:37,700
Sylvester or Daffy?

3090
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:38,200
No.

3091
02:03:38,660 --> 02:03:39,940
Oh, Tweety Bird.

3092
02:03:39,940 --> 02:03:41,060
No, I'll just tell you.

3093
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:42,260
It's going to be do.

3094
02:03:42,260 --> 02:03:42,820
Oh, OK.

3095
02:03:42,820 --> 02:03:44,820
Oh, yeah, that was kind of obvious.

3096
02:03:44,820 --> 02:03:48,660
And there's a trick question because unlike the real Mount Rushmore, there's a fifth and

3097
02:03:48,660 --> 02:03:52,580
it's Casey Ryback from Under Siege.

3098
02:03:52,580 --> 02:03:56,340
Some of these stories did have a mural of executives.

3099
02:03:56,900 --> 02:03:57,700
What?

3100
02:03:57,700 --> 02:04:04,660
Like paintings of like I'm assuming it's Jack Warner and company like it seemed like very

3101
02:04:04,660 --> 02:04:05,220
old men.

3102
02:04:06,260 --> 02:04:13,860
Jack Warner kind of regarded as a mean guy, like not a great guy in terms of like.

3103
02:04:13,860 --> 02:04:14,980
Ahead of a movie studio?

3104
02:04:14,980 --> 02:04:16,100
Hollywood moguls.

3105
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:16,660
Right to me.

3106
02:04:16,660 --> 02:04:16,900
Yeah.

3107
02:04:17,780 --> 02:04:18,260
But right.

3108
02:04:18,260 --> 02:04:18,420
Yeah.

3109
02:04:18,420 --> 02:04:22,740
Well, who's your for who you're for on Mount Rushmore if you had to pick now for right

3110
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:22,900
now?

3111
02:04:22,900 --> 02:04:23,620
It's Aslov.

3112
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:24,900
Yeah, yeah.

3113
02:04:25,540 --> 02:04:26,020
Warner.

3114
02:04:26,740 --> 02:04:28,020
Jack Warner's Aslov.

3115
02:04:30,900 --> 02:04:32,580
Dearly departed, gone too soon.

3116
02:04:32,580 --> 02:04:34,260
CNN had Chris Licht.

3117
02:04:34,260 --> 02:04:34,900
OK.

3118
02:04:34,900 --> 02:04:39,780
And the it's one.

3119
02:04:40,420 --> 02:04:41,380
And Great Gazoo.

3120
02:04:42,180 --> 02:04:42,580
Oh, sure.

3121
02:04:42,580 --> 02:04:43,780
We'll get Great Gazoo on there.

3122
02:04:43,780 --> 02:04:47,540
I was going to say one is like it's a panel that flips over and over and over again.

3123
02:04:47,540 --> 02:04:52,820
And as every single Batman and Superman, just like the end of my favorite film.

3124
02:04:52,820 --> 02:04:53,140
Got it.

3125
02:04:53,140 --> 02:04:53,380
Got it.

3126
02:04:53,380 --> 02:04:54,340
Of the century.

3127
02:04:54,340 --> 02:04:54,660
Got it.

3128
02:04:54,740 --> 02:04:56,260
Of any century, the Flash.

3129
02:04:56,260 --> 02:04:56,500
Right.

3130
02:04:56,500 --> 02:04:56,900
Right.

3131
02:04:56,900 --> 02:04:57,220
OK.

3132
02:04:57,220 --> 02:04:58,100
Yeah, that sounds good.

3133
02:04:58,100 --> 02:04:59,060
Yeah, great.

3134
02:04:59,060 --> 02:05:01,140
Well, RIP.

3135
02:05:01,140 --> 02:05:02,020
We missed the store.

3136
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:06,340
Bring it back and we'll forgive you for all the other stuff.

3137
02:05:07,700 --> 02:05:09,140
You survived podcast the ride.

3138
02:05:09,140 --> 02:05:10,820
Thanks for subscribing to Club 3.

3139
02:05:10,820 --> 02:05:12,260
Your bravery saved the podcast.

3140
02:05:12,260 --> 02:05:13,940
Well done, freedom fighters.

3141
02:05:13,940 --> 02:05:15,060
Suggestions, please.

3142
02:05:16,020 --> 02:05:17,220
Some Vegas, some not.

3143
02:05:17,220 --> 02:05:18,100
Throw it all out there.

3144
02:05:18,100 --> 02:05:19,780
If we don't use Vegas now, we'll use them next month.

3145
02:05:19,780 --> 02:05:21,300
But maybe we just maybe do a lot of Vegas.

3146
02:05:21,300 --> 02:05:22,260
We're excited about Vegas.

3147
02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:29,540
And Mike's video, Mike's container store chokehold video coming soon.

3148
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:30,020
Choke out.

3149
02:05:30,020 --> 02:05:32,180
I'd rather call it a choke out video.

3150
02:05:32,180 --> 02:05:34,180
Yeah, that's just a little piece of it.

3151
02:05:34,180 --> 02:05:35,780
Container store choke out.

3152
02:05:35,780 --> 02:05:37,220
That's just a quick gag.

3153
02:05:37,220 --> 02:05:38,580
OK, that's what it is in my head.

3154
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:42,660
That's the primary videos that mine has stockpiled.

3155
02:05:42,660 --> 02:05:45,620
I'm going to have to get people approving this.

3156
02:05:45,620 --> 02:05:48,340
There's so many friends of mine from high school in it.

3157
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:48,740
Oh, yeah.

3158
02:05:48,740 --> 02:05:49,460
You need releases.

3159
02:05:49,460 --> 02:05:50,740
I'll need a bunch of releases.

3160
02:05:50,740 --> 02:05:50,980
Yeah.

3161
02:05:51,700 --> 02:05:52,660
To monetize this.

3162
02:05:52,660 --> 02:05:57,620
Well, no, you just got to find out how just like, you know, like they're trying to keep AI

3163
02:05:57,620 --> 02:05:58,500
out of all the contracts.

3164
02:05:58,500 --> 02:05:59,460
That's one of Zazlov's.

3165
02:05:59,460 --> 02:05:59,940
Oh, right.

3166
02:05:59,940 --> 02:06:02,180
So, you know, the current spirit is just use them.

3167
02:06:02,180 --> 02:06:02,980
That's a good point.

3168
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:03,940
And say it's not you.

3169
02:06:03,940 --> 02:06:07,060
AI recreated you, which is illegal.

3170
02:06:07,060 --> 02:06:07,540
Yeah.

3171
02:06:07,540 --> 02:06:08,980
So it's all good.

3172
02:06:08,980 --> 02:06:10,980
I'm doing it as well as Zazlov too.

3173
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:13,620
OK, well, yeah, if they ask, they don't know.

3174
02:06:13,620 --> 02:06:15,460
They don't probably know about this podcast.

3175
02:06:16,260 --> 02:06:18,180
Some friends they are and I'm checking in on them.

3176
02:06:18,260 --> 02:06:21,460
I was in second level with some of these guys.

3177
02:06:21,460 --> 02:06:22,900
My band in high school.

3178
02:06:22,900 --> 02:06:24,500
Second level doesn't subscribe.

3179
02:06:24,500 --> 02:06:25,300
I don't think so.

3180
02:06:26,500 --> 02:06:30,340
But once you're in a band of brothers, that brotherhood lasts forever.

3181
02:06:30,340 --> 02:06:31,860
Well, you have a brotherhood of rock.

3182
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:33,540
Yeah, Joe Perry and Steven.

3183
02:06:33,540 --> 02:06:41,140
Yeah, but they were at odds at certain points, but luckily they're getting along perfectly now.
