1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Theme Park fans are a passionate sort.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,840
Check any of their favorite message boards like MouseWeb or ChurroChat and you'll see

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,600
they're always debating what's the best ride, what is the superior treat, which Theme Park's

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,640
corporation is best at lobbying the government.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,000
But one topic is missing from these spirited debates.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
A topic that this podcast takes very seriously.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
A topic worthy of 150 minutes of discussion and a well thought out tournament style bracket.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The topic?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Fake Rocks.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,080
On today's show, 16 fake rocks will compete in a knock down drag out fight to crown the

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,920
fake rocks champion.

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,000
Which fake rocks will reach the top of the mountain and which fake rocks will landslide

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
in an avalanche of humiliation?

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,520
It's the Fake Rock Final Four.

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,520
On Podcast The Ride.

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,520
Welcome ladies and gentlemen to a once in a lifetime historic Podcast The Ride gimmick.

19
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,120
Today's the day we've talked about fake rocks, our love of fake rocks in many an episode

20
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:34,360
for many a week and today once and for all we will determine which fake rock is the most

21
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,680
great fake rock in the Fake Rock Final Four.

22
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,120
I'm Scott Garner joined by Mike Carlson and Jason Sheridan.

23
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,120
I'm here.

24
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,120
I'm nervous.

25
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,120
My name is Mike Carlson.

26
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,720
This is important is really what it is.

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,680
That's the word I would put.

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,600
I was in my car, pulled up out front, beating my chest, getting psyched up.

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
You were beating your chest?

30
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,080
Beating my chest raw and bloody.

31
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,560
As I was going through today, just revisiting all the pictures of all of these and I started

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,480
to get very worked up.

33
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,520
Like, oh well I know who's going to win this.

34
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,040
Were you psyching yourself up to argue with us or were you just sort of in general getting

35
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,160
your brain ready to like figure a question out?

36
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,640
I guess a little of both.

37
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
I took a steroid.

38
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
I took one steroid.

39
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,640
Single steroid?

40
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,640
Yep.

41
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
A couple hours ago.

42
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,920
So hopefully it'll time out and kick in and I will be at my peak of rage when we are determining

43
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,160
the last two or so.

44
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,400
But it was just like three months old and you had bronchitis.

45
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
It was that kind of steroid.

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
Yeah, yeah.

47
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
It's not really going to do anything.

48
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,160
No, it's not like I got one from some, you know, MMA guy or something.

49
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,760
No, it was doctor prescribed.

50
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,800
But still, you know, my body's not accustomed to it.

51
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,120
I'm hoping that I like rage out to where I look like a rock monster as we're doing this.

52
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,040
I should have been on HGH for this.

53
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,040
Human growth hormone.

54
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
You've talked about that for years.

55
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,960
I do want to go on HGH.

56
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
That's true.

57
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
We haven't talked about that on the show yet.

58
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,200
But I feel like that's good to go on.

59
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,080
You mean like the thing that people, it's like, you've talked about celebrities aging

60
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,400
weird and taking this crazy stuff.

61
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Yes.

62
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
OK.

63
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,960
Like, like, look, maybe I'm going to get him mad at us.

64
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,800
He's never come on the show, but like Stallone probably does.

65
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
He's an older gentleman.

66
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,800
But look how damn it we blew it.

67
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,160
I mean, well, it's fine.

68
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,440
Perfect guest for Planet Hollywood.

69
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,720
I'm also not saying it's bad.

70
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
I'm saying it's good.

71
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,800
I think there's a lot of older guys specifically that take it.

72
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,240
And I think it's you admire.

73
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,200
You're not bad for taking it, but it doesn't always have good effects.

74
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Sure.

75
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,480
I think it usually has good effect.

76
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,120
I think it usually makes you look cool and you're stronger and maybe your joints hurt

77
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,120
a little less as you go.

78
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,720
It makes you think it's a good thing.

79
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Oh, I do.

80
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,080
I think I think I mean, I think you got to take it safely.

81
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
You know how to do it.

82
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,320
I don't know how to take it safely.

83
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,880
I wouldn't just go do it.

84
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,880
But I'm saying I think in the right safe way.

85
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,880
It's fine.

86
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,880
Yeah.

87
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,600
Like in the movies, superheroes get their powers through accidents.

88
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,960
But in real life, I mean, those superpowers, superheroes don't just spring up overnight.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,320
You got to go to a superhero store, get some super items and like slowly adjust your body

90
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,320
to them.

91
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,320
Because I don't want to get too off track here.

92
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,680
But my also my thinking with this is like, I want to be able to go on these rides into

93
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,360
my seventies and eighties and God hope nineties.

94
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,120
You know, I'd like to go on the newest roller coaster in my nineties, my mid nineties.

95
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,520
And you know, your neck hurts, your back hurts, your knees hurt sitting in these cars, these

96
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,440
vehicles and I want to feel good.

97
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:42,400
So yeah, I think HGH or whatever is going to be around, you know, in 50 years.

98
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,400
That's what I'll be taking.

99
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,720
I want the same thing.

100
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,280
And I want the ability to get pregnant as well.

101
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,680
So I'm going to take whatever wide net of hormones I need to where I can be 90 and pregnant

102
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,520
and on all the rest.

103
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,000
My baby will be jacked.

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,320
Like they'll be like they'll be I've been ingesting nothing but HGH.

105
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
That's good.

106
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,320
So they'll be fine.

107
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,600
They'll be more equipped than me.

108
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,120
So whatever William Gibson, Warren Ellis, body hacking, cyber future shit.

109
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
Sure.

110
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,520
Yeah, let's let's go for it.

111
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,400
Yeah, we're talking the few our future, which involves like whatever is going to be done

112
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:24,120
to genetically modify meat and whatever, like any like any like DNA CRISPR, the gene editing

113
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
technology.

114
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
Right.

115
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,120
It'll be totally fair game for me to get pregnant in 10 years and go on all the roller coasters

116
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
I want.

117
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
Sure.

118
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,800
I think it's a good idea if you want your baby to have a six pack or an eight pack when

119
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,200
it comes out, which I think one on his front and one on his back.

120
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Wow, that'd be great.

121
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Very cool.

122
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,840
You could say like, yeah, you could literally like set on a computer how much you can bench.

123
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,600
You could have a baby that looks like that creature that that someone CG modeled like

124
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,040
this is what the human body would have to look like to survive a car wreck.

125
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,040
Have you ever seen that?

126
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
Oh, that's right.

127
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
Yes.

128
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
Yeah.

129
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,040
Yeah.

130
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,780
Really bizarre, exaggerated, just disproved.

131
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:04,260
Like you took a photo of a regular person and like did Photoshop like smudging all over.

132
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,260
Yeah, yeah.

133
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,260
Huh?

134
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,260
Yeah, I'm going to do that.

135
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,580
I'm going to have a baby that looks exactly like when they show what Homer would look

136
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,140
like if he was a real person.

137
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:19,300
You know, that's the real life Homer that 90 and take it on a roller coaster.

138
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,820
I think that that's that also gives me the idea that at a certain point, you know, because

139
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,900
you'll see those things where people get plastic surgery to look like famous people.

140
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,300
No, yeah.

141
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,460
So certain person would look want to look like Angelina Jolie and they would get the

142
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,920
same lips or whatever.

143
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,260
But I do think we're soon we're not far away from fictional character plastic surgery.

144
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,860
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

145
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,620
Where you will get that terrifying real life Homer plastic surgery.

146
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,340
I don't know if it's Homer.

147
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,340
That's the one that will be the most sought after.

148
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,340
But then I'll get surgery to look like what's his name?

149
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,220
Hondo from from Star Wars Rise of the Resistance.

150
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,220
Yeah, sure.

151
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,420
Hondo Anaka.

152
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,580
Yeah, I'm going to look like Hondo Anaka at 90 years old.

153
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,300
I'm going to have face tentacles and stuff.

154
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:12,180
I will be I will ask for Davy Jones from the Pirates movies who also has tentacles on his

155
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,780
face. Oh, sweet. We'll get along great.

156
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,500
Yeah. So people are going to freak when they see us together.

157
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,140
Sure. Walking around.

158
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:22,380
But they'll have a lot of people have tentacles on their face in 50 years.

159
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,740
If you're also like if you're a big Futurama fan and you get Zoidberg surgery.

160
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,340
Of course. Oh, sure.

161
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:33,140
Futurama will be brought back 25 times in 50 years, I think, too.

162
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,100
So there'll be new versions of Futurama to keep it fresh.

163
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,700
The IP fresh in people's minds.

164
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,580
Yeah. So there's a big family members.

165
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,540
Are you going to look like a face tentacle?

166
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,700
Yes. Mine will, of course, be hot dogs.

167
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,260
My tentacles will be hot dogs.

168
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,580
Will they like grow and regenerate and be snacks for you?

169
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,500
Oh, sure. They can't always be like Nathan's all the time.

170
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,940
Sometimes I'm going to want to Polish.

171
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,580
Sometimes I'm going to want a little smoky like you have at the Christmas.

172
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,660
That is so disgusting.

173
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,980
Hey, I got those Trader Joe's pastry pups, the little mini ones in the fridge

174
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,300
right now, make my way through a package of those delightful.

175
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,180
How do you portion those out? How many serving size is four at a time?

176
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,980
I had five last night and four today with a side of baked beans.

177
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,660
I got some baked beans to have with them.

178
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,540
And yeah, maybe I'll have the rest tomorrow with some chips

179
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,460
or the rest of the baked beans like a hobo with a home. Yeah.

180
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,060
I mean, maybe that's the best description of Jason ever heard.

181
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,500
We correctly correct it.

182
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,860
Yeah. I mean, he goes on vacation. He takes a bimble.

183
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,700
Yeah. And the chalk so I can leave messages for the ones who come after

184
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,620
and to LAX friendly house.

185
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,100
Yeah. This security line is very good.

186
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,820
And an old beat up hat.

187
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
Well, back to fake rocks

188
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,860
in the sports of fake rocks that we're doing.

189
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,900
So we've talked about do it.

190
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,820
We had the idea to do a final four about something brackets for something.

191
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,940
And Mike, you came up with the fake rock notion.

192
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:11,460
And that's it's perfect because it's it's an extremely competitive category.

193
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,020
It's jammed.

194
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,580
I don't know how we're going to be able to narrow it down to just one.

195
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,500
And also, I don't think is did anybody Google.

196
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
I don't think anyone's because with theme park stuff,

197
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,100
we're not the first theme park podcast.

198
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,340
We're not the first person, the first group of people to do like a bracket

199
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,740
for rides or something.

200
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,980
But I think as far as fake rocks, this is the first in the world.

201
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,580
I think this is we've never there's never been a tournament

202
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,420
to determine the best fake rocks before.

203
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,140
There's maybe listicles of like ranking the Disney Mountains.

204
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,060
Sure. That's not exactly what this is.

205
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,100
And there's mountains that don't qualify in this.

206
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,540
Absolutely. And I want to say, just because you are a mountain,

207
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,740
don't think you're making it to the final rounds.

208
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,460
I want to say that right at the top.

209
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,300
That's an interesting point.

210
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,220
But, you know, I might have been a little mountain centric in my thinking so far.

211
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,580
So that's a good challenge already to make me question.

212
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,940
I have not really we're saying I haven't really picked these out of the 16

213
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,460
that we had narrowed down to 16.

214
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,460
And just that was very tough.

215
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,420
But I do not have my choices within this.

216
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,500
And you might have shifted my thinking already.

217
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,060
Yeah, because I mean, we're going to see.

218
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,220
I think it's going to become apparent as we start talking about it.

219
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,780
Now, I've got my favorites and I've got some dark horses.

220
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,380
But I don't, you know, who knows how it's going to shake out.

221
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,900
Like you might kind of like be pushing for one that is

222
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,060
maybe more of a personal preference than a like

223
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,700
board of directors would determine.

224
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,700
It's the best. Yeah, I think that should.

225
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,820
Yeah, I think some of these are going to be more personal than others.

226
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,860
Some of these none of us have ever seen in person.

227
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,740
Yeah, that's going to that's going to hurt it.

228
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,820
We can admit some bias there.

229
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,380
But I think including them shows that we have a good

230
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,900
vista of what's out there, fake rock wise. Right.

231
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,420
And we're representing the international parks.

232
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,140
Even if we haven't been there in person.

233
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,020
I want to say this is not about the rides.

234
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,500
Yeah, I want to be very clear.

235
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,380
This has nothing to do with the rides themselves.

236
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,820
This is all about the fake rocks that are outside of the ride, inside.

237
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,340
They're like part of the ride.

238
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,100
It depends depending on what attraction we're talking about.

239
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,220
But my liking of the rides has nothing to do with me choosing.

240
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,340
What's the better fake rocks? Yeah, absolutely.

241
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,740
It's possible that like a lesser ride, it's possible that a if

242
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,380
if you went into a crazy fake rock facade

243
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,860
and it was essentially it was like superstar limo in there

244
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,060
and the ride itself has some problems.

245
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,580
But if that outside is beautiful and the transition inside is beautiful,

246
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,580
there's no reason it shouldn't be able to compete against like a top tier ride.

247
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,500
Yes, exactly.

248
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,660
And I think that's a great example, because I think it universally agreed

249
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,500
upon the superstar limo exterior.

250
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,420
Beautiful.

251
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,060
Folks, look it up if you haven't seen it.

252
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,740
Oh, boy.

253
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,860
When any time when pop art was part of the parks, when it was just, you know,

254
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,700
when like the postcard come to life and.

255
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,780
Yeah, I it was a phenomenon.

256
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,660
I don't remember Disney and Universal quite doing this,

257
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,260
but I remember going to your your smaller, but you even Six Flags

258
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,740
or the Paramount Park stuff like that.

259
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,340
You would get your free maps.

260
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:30,580
But there was a fun souvenir map suitable for hanging or framing

261
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,060
that had some real kooky characters on it that you could buy for a.

262
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,300
That's sort of what Superstar limo is like. Yeah.

263
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,060
Yeah, it was like a weird.

264
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,340
It was like like lobby art come to life or something. Yeah.

265
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,340
We'll get to it. That's maybe a potential.

266
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,420
That's a future Final Four.

267
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,900
It could be worst facade. Right. Sure.

268
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,100
And Superstar limo obviously would be nowhere near it.

269
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,780
It's it's great. It's perfect.

270
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,900
It's kooky. It's the California spirit.

271
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,940
Yeah. I mean, best lighting, lighting or colored lighting setup.

272
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,340
That's a potential future Final Four, I think.

273
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,580
Oh, absolutely. Right.

274
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,780
Another point I had within this is like,

275
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,020
I mean, well, you know, I figure we should talk a little too about just like

276
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,660
why fake rock.

277
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,140
We've talked about fake rocks a lot and why we then that we love them.

278
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,420
I don't know if we've really said why we love them.

279
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,180
I don't know that I have a good answer for that.

280
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,420
But as you mentioned, Superstar limo, you know, think about early days

281
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,580
of California adventure.

282
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,460
There were some fake rocks, but not a ton, not as many as there are now.

283
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,700
Think about the cheapo era of Disney.

284
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,500
When California Adventure opened, then it was a little underwhelming.

285
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,940
Disney Studios Paris, the worst Disney theme park, probably still.

286
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,820
And and then compare those to Tokyo Disney

287
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,860
Sea, which opened around the same time, one full of fake rocks

288
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,140
flourishing with fake rocks.

289
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:58,340
The other is just sound stages and hangers and just flat walls.

290
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,220
I think those are some of the least fake rocks.

291
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,140
I don't think there was a single fake rock in Disney Studios Paris,

292
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,420
and I think they paid the price.

293
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,060
Yeah. So I think fake rocks are crucial to a theme park success out of the gate.

294
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,540
I agree. I know there's not.

295
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,060
I'm trying to think of like a good example of where you need it.

296
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,660
I mean, it's like it's essential. You're right.

297
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,900
It's it's something that I don't know what it does.

298
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,940
It just gives a texture.

299
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,060
It gives you a feeling of being somewhere that you're not,

300
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,260
which is just really just in a parking lot somewhere.

301
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,020
And people build a bunch of fake stuff.

302
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,340
But fake rocks transport you.

303
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,300
Yeah. In a way that a lot of things don't.

304
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,100
I wonder if even subconsciously, too, you go like, oh, they took the time.

305
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,620
This is a they had to make this.

306
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,660
It is a fake rock.

307
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,740
They didn't just buy a bunch of big rocks.

308
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,660
They constructed this.

309
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,780
They designed it. They constructed it and they painted it like there was some care.

310
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,340
There was some attention to detail from whole cloth.

311
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,020
And I bet we'll get into this that I think I would have to think

312
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:01,340
that some criteria would be the the depth of the painting work,

313
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,820
because there's like very slow,

314
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:12,020
deliberate gradients and like so much texture and variety within certain fake

315
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,340
rocks. And a fake rock that just has one color, the front to back,

316
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,260
is probably not as good of a fake rock. Right.

317
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,180
I you know, I actually I'll save this for one of the rounds.

318
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,660
One of them, I think my best argument for fake rocks is in a round,

319
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,460
but I won't do it here. Oh, OK.

320
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,820
Because I think I can make I can illustrate it better.

321
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,580
I have another little argument that I don't think applies to a specific thing,

322
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,900
but I think this might impact it as we go on.

323
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,460
I think there's some fake rocks that are very impressive to look at the entire

324
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:47,780
tableau. But I think some fake rocks have a brand to them.

325
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,980
And if you saw a close up of one of the rocks, you'd know exactly where that's from.

326
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,300
Now, does that matter?

327
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,420
I think there's excellent fake rocks where that test would not apply.

328
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,940
The forest for the trees test.

329
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,780
But I think something about, you know, that you could take the pattern of a fake

330
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:08,860
rock and use it as like a cell phone wallpaper or something that it's

331
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,500
instantaneous. The shade is iconic.

332
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,820
That's got to be. Yeah, I see what you're saying.

333
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,060
A big step for one of these rocks to be pulling in. Right.

334
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,940
I hear a guy. Yeah, I didn't even think about that.

335
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,100
There's a lot of things that we're going to explore.

336
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,820
We're going to discover, I think, too.

337
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,260
I think that really what this is about is discovering more about

338
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,420
why we love them and what makes one great.

339
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,100
Yeah. So it's like it's kind of a thinking man's

340
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:41,380
it's a sensitive man's bracket because we aren't just saying like you lose next.

341
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,580
We're going to we're going to stop and we're going to talk and we're going to

342
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,300
pontificate. Right. And I think I mean, look, there's going to be probably

343
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,020
arguments. There's going to be disagreements.

344
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,700
And I think at a certain point we will have to go two to one if that happens.

345
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:59,060
We're maybe not always all three of us going to agree on what moves forward.

346
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,140
So we'll have to go with two versus one.

347
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,740
But I think we'll do it in a cordial way.

348
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,020
We won't be upset about it.

349
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,740
And we will reflect.

350
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,140
If I were to lose one round, I would just go into some self reflection.

351
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,980
I wouldn't be angry. And some of them might not be anger inducing, but some of them.

352
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,540
Yeah. Some of them we might have to like stop and argue, which to that end, do we

353
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:23,060
just like say or do we do we say the competitors and then we pick or do we is

354
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,740
there a discussion beforehand?

355
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,180
Maybe it's a case by case.

356
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,780
I think it's case by case.

357
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,620
All right. We're going to be sure.

358
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,180
Yeah, we might as well just launch in.

359
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,340
Very interesting if any round is immediately unanimous.

360
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,100
That would be the most shocking thing to me.

361
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,220
What if like all of it was and this wasn't interesting and we were just all reciting

362
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,260
like song lyrics together, essentially?

363
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,220
Well, then there might be a mysterious unheard second half of this episode called

364
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,420
We Have a Late Dinner.

365
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:56,500
Well, yeah, well, we just put an old I'll just tack half of an old one on

366
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,100
second half of this.

367
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,700
Absolutely. Yes.

368
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,740
I just like a question from the past.

369
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,940
Or we just start talking about Batman's stunt show like 45 minutes in.

370
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:12,860
Sure. Yeah. Or we just do like we just like it's the best of HelloFresh ads.

371
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,460
We just have like 10 in a row.

372
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,060
Yeah. Yeah. A walk down HelloFresh memory lane.

373
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,380
We'll see. We'll see. We don't know.

374
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,900
This is new territory for all right.

375
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,860
Well, let's get into it.

376
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,100
And if you go well, like we'll figure out on Twitter how to post this.

377
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,340
There's got to be a way to do like a spoiler free post of the list.

378
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,380
Well, we'll post the brackets first.

379
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,500
Just the empty bracket so you can fill in your own bracket as well.

380
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,620
That'll be fun. You can post your own bracket.

381
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,100
Oh, yes. Send us your bracket.

382
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,540
Yeah. Do do one with your friends.

383
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,380
Yes. See if you can reach an agreement.

384
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,220
See if you do.

385
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,620
Yeah. Do one before you've heard our choices and see how much it lines up.

386
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:54,220
Record a podcast and then post send it to us and then we'll review all of the podcasts.

387
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,380
And then there'll be a final four of the podcast.

388
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,060
We will determine the best fake rock final for Jason.

389
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,340
We'll send it right to Mike.

390
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,020
Mike Jason will review all of them.

391
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,580
And then well, you have the idea.

392
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,660
You're the idea man.

393
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,100
You always have these good ideas.

394
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,620
You love executing them.

395
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,780
Now, do we mean I was going to say that maybe the hashtag

396
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,940
PTRFRF4.

397
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,340
OK, TRFRF4.

398
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,860
Got it. So anything related to this?

399
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,540
And that's where you can go to see our brackets and to participate.

400
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,580
And I think and what you'll find, I had a I had a revelation.

401
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:35,620
So we determined that it's we're going to we're going to do 16 will down to one.

402
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,940
We couldn't think of a reason to put them into conferences.

403
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,500
So it's not going to be eight to eight meeting in the middle.

404
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,980
It's going to be that other style of bracket that nears down to one.

405
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:49,180
And, you know, I turn this thing on its side, 16 narrowing down to one.

406
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,740
You flip it on its side.

407
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,380
It looks like a mountain.

408
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,140
It's a mountain.

409
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,820
So we're not just narrowing down into a funnel.

410
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:00,220
We are going to start at the base camp with our 16 competitors.

411
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:04,260
And they're all going to race to the peak and see who plants a flag

412
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,940
on fake rock mountain. Right.

413
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,980
It's very exciting. I don't know.

414
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,660
I don't know who will ascend and climb.

415
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,220
I won't say Everest, because that would be biased because Everest.

416
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,940
Maybe it's on the list.

417
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,100
And what if it's not in in the 16 at all?

418
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,420
Anyway, anyway, let's get to the first round.

419
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,580
All right. First round, first round.

420
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:33,340
Expedition Everest versus the Matterhorn, Matterhorn Mountain,

421
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,300
Matterhorn Mountain. So this is a tough one.

422
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,700
One is kind of a spiritual heir to the other.

423
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,740
Do you reward a classic?

424
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:44,020
Do you reward the the one that improved on the formula?

425
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,020
And this is, I think, another conflict that's going to come up

426
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:53,540
like old school versus new school, because we have, you know, Everest.

427
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,260
We did an Everest episode not too long ago, and they were talking about

428
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:01,260
using lasers and computers and everything to like map it

429
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,180
and how to paint it and all that.

430
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,140
They didn't have that technology when they were building the Matterhorn.

431
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:11,900
Yeah, they just had like soup in a can and like a legal pad

432
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,260
with a bad pencil. And somehow they built a mountain.

433
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,180
Yeah, yeah. But you got to give them credit for that.

434
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,900
You do. So what do we think?

435
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,500
How do we do? Do we do we always do it in the same order?

436
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,700
Do we just we just throw them out?

437
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,100
We get we got to develop some order.

438
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,220
What's what's everyone's does everyone have a strong opinion?

439
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,300
Let me say this.

440
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,260
Well, this is actually what I was referring to alluding to before.

441
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:42,180
I like these fake rocks because and my favorite fake rocks are ones that

442
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,420
make you feel like you're somewhere like maybe a geographical place.

443
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,500
That's interesting. But are a little off or a little strange

444
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,420
because that's where we are.

445
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,060
We're not in the real world, but we're in a heightened reality.

446
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,620
We're in somewhere special. We're in a storybook.

447
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,660
We're in another movie, something like that.

448
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:05,060
So those tend to be maybe my favorite fake rocks,

449
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:10,660
which is why I choose for this the Matterhorn over Expedition Everest

450
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,340
is my favorite fake rock of fake rocks of these two.

451
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,660
That would be my choice for this round.

452
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,780
I think I'm leaning towards that as well,

453
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,180
because you come to the end of a turn of centuries street

454
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,900
and you look to your right and there's a giant snow cap mountain.

455
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,100
Then there's a medieval castle.

456
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,020
And then there's, I don't know, trees for adventure land.

457
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,460
But yeah, that Matterhorn is so striking,

458
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,740
and especially after a childhood of going to the Magic Kingdom in Florida

459
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,500
to come to Disneyland and go like, holy shit, there's a fucking mountain

460
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,940
at the end of this main street.

461
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,180
I don't care if the ride went away forever.

462
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,500
The ride itself, I think, is fine. It's old. It hurts.

463
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,100
I love the new effects they put on it. I like going on it.

464
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,900
But the mountain itself, I think, would be more of a casualty than the ride.

465
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,100
And Expedition Everest, I like way better. It's incredible.

466
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,900
It's one of the best rides.

467
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,180
But if we're just going fake rocks, I got to go.

468
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,060
I got to go Matterhorn.

469
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,460
Well, and you know what?

470
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,140
It's a pioneer

471
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:17,020
within the world of fake rocks, potentially the first major fake rock landmark.

472
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,180
You know what I'm going to do?

473
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,740
I'm going to cast my vote for Expedition Everest

474
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,940
just to acknowledge it, because that is where I was leaning.

475
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,260
But that does not affect. I just want it to get a vote.

476
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,900
In a way, like this pairing is insane.

477
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,540
There's another world where Expedition Everest moves on handily.

478
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,780
But the category does make sense to me.

479
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,180
I see what you're saying. And tough choices have to be made.

480
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,780
So I'm going to give it a vote to acknowledge it, because it is a great one.

481
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,900
But I but dancing to the next round is the Matterhorn. Great.

482
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,300
That's what you said. That's what I said. Yeah, to to matter.

483
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,420
So Expedition Everest done, not going to win, not the best fake rock.

484
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,460
Oh, my God. An embarrassment.

485
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,020
That's a surprise. That's a quick right out of the gate.

486
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,460
I feel like. Well, I like that we're starting with it with a controversial one.

487
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,740
Not an easy one. UCLA gets knocked out early sometimes, you know? Right.

488
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,700
Yep. True. It's yeah.

489
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,980
Something some guys come in cocky. Yeah.

490
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,740
I would imagine I don't watch college basketball,

491
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,140
but that seems like something that would either guys are cocky

492
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,540
and then they don't play good in the basketball game. Sure.

493
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:26,300
Um, round round to Splash Mountain versus Seven Dwarfs Mind Train.

494
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,260
I don't need to rationalize this if somebody wants to go for it.

495
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,860
I got it. OK.

496
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,260
I'm throwing my hat in the ring for Seven Dwarfs Mind Train

497
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,540
because Splash Mountain, despite being a mountain,

498
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,940
I largely associate with dirt and the Briar Patch.

499
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,900
I don't think of fake rocks when I look at Splash Mountain.

500
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:52,180
There are really rocks in the in the facade of Splash Mountain.

501
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,340
But it's a lot of the Briar Patch. I'm looking at it's brown.

502
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,260
It's a lot of brown that you are.

503
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,540
I associate with like plant life, not rock work.

504
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,620
But Seven Dwarfs Mind Train, you go in a mine.

505
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,980
There's beautiful rock works outside.

506
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,740
You go under a bridge. Really good rocks.

507
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,780
They're good rocks.

508
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:18,020
But do they have the character of the rocks on Splash Mountain?

509
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,060
I would argue no. I see what you're saying.

510
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,660
That's certainly the obviously the water in the Briar Patch

511
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,460
are the big highlights of Splash Mountain.

512
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,540
But when you start on the ride and you're outside and you see those weird,

513
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,260
ugly, but good like they're brown, but they're, you know,

514
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,380
I can't even describe the color exactly of them.

515
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:39,460
That is like that is cartoon. You're in cartoon land.

516
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,860
Those are so specific to Splash Mountain.

517
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,780
And the rocks on Snow White are very beautiful,

518
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,220
but I feel like they lack character.

519
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,620
I feel like they don't have the quite the character that Splash Mountain itself

520
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,540
and the fake rock have. I agree with you.

521
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,300
I think if you put any of these other rides up against Splash Mountain,

522
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,740
you have a good some of these other fake rocks up on the list.

523
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,260
Yes, Splash Mountain might lose, but to me, it's Splash Mountain still.

524
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:10,300
Jason, the the the argument of the argument that you made

525
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,420
was an argument that was in my head.

526
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,660
The that when you think Splash Mountain, you think of a big log

527
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,300
because the top of it is a big log as logs going through it.

528
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:25,100
There's there's grass and roots and weird wood and tree houses and stuff.

529
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,780
But how are we to punish fake rocks for having other elements

530
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,500
as part of them for supporting other elements?

531
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,340
And I was going to use that argument to knock Splash Mountain out of another

532
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,820
pairing. But the fact that it ended up with seven dwarfs, Mind Train,

533
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,980
I do think that those actual rocks are big boulders.

534
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,100
I think they're I think they're cool. But I

535
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,980
I do think that the I think we're underselling the rocks.

536
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,460
I think the rocks have some character.

537
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,460
I think they're big and odd and bulbous, and they still strike fear into my heart.

538
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,020
You know, I started going on it.

539
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,060
I still get a little afraid.

540
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,580
I got to go with Splash Mountain.

541
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,660
It's a mangled, crazy structure.

542
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,660
It's so it is menacing and cute all at once.

543
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,380
You know, character is important and not really a thing I was considering.

544
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,780
In this round.

545
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,860
So I am going to gracefully bow out and accept that Splash Mountain clear.

546
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,660
Well, it's all this is a polite.

547
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,820
I also want to say we didn't.

548
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,060
There are no bad fake rocks on this list.

549
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,340
No, we did not choose any pity fake rocks.

550
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,460
Certainly, we are.

551
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,340
These are all great.

552
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,780
So if I say something bad about a fake rock, just know I still love it.

553
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,940
You also you've got a variety as I'm looking at a photo.

554
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,220
There's also like, you know, there's there's gray rocks

555
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,860
intermingling with the brown.

556
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,540
It's there's a tapestry of fake rock there.

557
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:48,180
And yeah, those those odd, you know, like, yeah, the bulbous

558
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,500
rotunda like curving on top.

559
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,620
This is I'm going to show how like not eloquent that I am.

560
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:00,460
This is not going to be like Thoreau or a poet who's good at describing nature.

561
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:05,820
You think that Splash Mountain, the whole the whole of it is very unique and beautiful.

562
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,740
But I don't think fake rocks are still the number one.

563
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,740
I don't disagree.

564
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,340
And that's I don't disagree with what you're saying.

565
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,060
I'm just saying that if you take away Briar Patch and you take away any

566
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,060
like little shed or whatever, you'd call it.

567
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:25,300
I still think this structure is more interesting and is speaks to me more

568
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,940
than just the fake rocks and seven dwarf, which again are beautiful.

569
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,420
But they're a little too almost a little too realistic for me.

570
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,100
Mm hmm. It's not.

571
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,460
That's a bit of a problem.

572
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,540
I think sometimes you might find that realism is what's cool about a fake rock.

573
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,180
But I but I think inventiveness is going to be key.

574
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,340
We are talking theme parks here, and I think that is going to be key

575
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,780
for any fake rocks moving forward.

576
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,420
That's the thing.

577
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,060
You know, that reminds me of like a recent Disney venture,

578
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:56,060
the the animated sequences in Mary Poppins Returns, like they did

579
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,260
try to do it in the style of the original Mary Poppins.

580
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:04,380
And I believe brought back some of the hand hand drawn animators to do it.

581
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,020
But there were times in that where I was like,

582
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,340
this is a little too clean, a little too.

583
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,860
Yeah, I agree. It's not dirty enough like the Mary Poppins animation,

584
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,500
the Robin Hood animation, Aristocats, there's a there's a grit to them.

585
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,820
That's hard to duplicate with the after effects or whatever.

586
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:27,300
Which is that's a philosophy that might favor older fake rocks.

587
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:33,580
That's a nice as opposed to an actual athletic event in which certainly

588
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,100
a 65 year old is going to lose to an 18 year old.

589
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,620
Not well, not the case in the final four.

590
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,180
Also not the case in like a WWE.

591
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:43,980
Oh, yeah.

592
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,900
Every time a six year old man beats up a 30 year old man.

593
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,540
What's the most exciting? Yeah.

594
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,300
Yeah, it's a little more populous.

595
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,300
So we got all right.

596
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,860
So Manhattan, Manhattan.

597
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,380
I wrote down the word Manhattan.

598
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,460
I think I got drinks on the brain.

599
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:58,980
I do.

600
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,300
And I always think like for my private

601
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,580
final four of different childers.

602
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,780
That's my number one.

603
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,340
We both wrote Manhattan and Mike, you're just always thinking of NYC.

604
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,540
That's why you wrote it, too.

605
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:16,020
So we know our first second round pairing will be Matterhorn versus Splash Mountain.

606
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,020
Yes. Tough one.

607
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,060
Wow. Tough one.

608
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,700
Yeah, boy.

609
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,300
Yeah.

610
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,260
So what's what's round number two?

611
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,940
He keeps advancing up the peak.

612
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,420
Well, this is three.

613
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,540
Oh, I'm sorry.

614
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,780
Who will end up in round number two?

615
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,780
Oh, that's what he just said.

616
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,220
It's splash. I think it's Splash Mountain and Matterhorn.

617
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,020
Yeah.

618
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,700
Oh, I'm saying entering into the next.

619
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,860
I mean, I'm incredibly inarticulate here.

620
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,460
Who are the next two that we're talking about?

621
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:48,940
The next pairing, Mount Apu Taku from Shanghai, Disneyland's Adventure Isle versus

622
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,260
Grizzly Peak from Disney's California Adventure.

623
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,660
This is a clash of the rapid rides.

624
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,020
The one from 2001, one from 2016.

625
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:04,100
These are a new century rapid rides, but we aren't talking about the rides,

626
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,540
which are almost identical.

627
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,700
We're talking about the the mountain peaks and the rocks.

628
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,940
Right. Insane to think about these rides

629
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:18,180
built in the 20th 21st century, that one of Disney's greatest blunders

630
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:23,060
and then one of Disney's people were concerned it was going to be a great

631
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,180
blunder, but seems to be doing OK like Shanghai seems to be doing all right

632
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,140
in terms of reviews and ticket sales and stuff.

633
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:34,820
I think it's slowed a little, but I think most parks fall into that after a year or

634
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,300
two of grand opening excitement.

635
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,780
It's great if you watch ride throughs and stuff, which I have because I can't

636
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,540
imagine I'm going to go there anytime soon.

637
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,540
There's some really inventive stuff over there and this is among them.

638
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,860
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's very cool.

639
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,900
Yeah. If you haven't seen this, but this

640
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,580
might be the fake rock that you are the least familiar with.

641
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:59,260
So Google Image just do Adventure Isle Shanghai.

642
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,460
And that'll show you what we're talking about.

643
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,540
It's a big, glorious waterfall.

644
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,780
It's very large.

645
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,500
I think it's in the in the the 200 foot range.

646
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:14,620
I have to say I was pulling photos and putting them into a note on my phone for

647
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,420
this. And when I looked this one up, this is probably the one I was least

648
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:23,940
familiar with. I audibly gasped like I was even on a tiny little iPhone screen.

649
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,980
I was amazed at the scale of this thing.

650
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:35,060
And I think it gets a little bonus of a favorite of one of my fake rock

651
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,460
types, which is fake rocks with real water.

652
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,940
Yes, that is a selling point of seeing

653
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,500
the fake rocks with an actual waterfall that might come up later too.

654
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,060
And one of my my decisions.

655
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,180
Think about the engineering that goes

656
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,420
into they have to figure out how to make water flow through the thing.

657
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,500
Yeah, this this thing.

658
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,260
This is probably the most insane Disney waterfall I would have to think.

659
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,260
Yeah, I can't name another.

660
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,420
And also, like, that's a cool thing about Shanghai Disney, which we haven't talked

661
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,300
about a ton. They kind of reinvented all of the lands.

662
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,500
They said, why do we have to just especially in the wake of Hong Kong,

663
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:16,140
Disney, which was just sort of a pretty like stamped copy of of original Disneyland.

664
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,420
How do we blow it up?

665
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,660
How do we make a totally different Adventureland and Tomorrowland and

666
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,860
also how do we adjust to local taste?

667
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:30,100
Because for, say, Star Wars doesn't have the cultural cash that it does in America.

668
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,700
Uh huh. Uh huh. Sure, sure.

669
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,900
But they love the Tim Burton, Alice in Wonderland.

670
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,140
Oh, yeah. Heavily feed.

671
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,940
Yeah, it's a giant scary queen.

672
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,140
And yeah, the scope of this thing compared to Adventureland,

673
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:45,220
which is always kind of the most humble land in all of the other Magic Kingdom

674
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:49,140
parks, but hey, we can't ignore the other competitor.

675
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,140
Grizzly Peak.

676
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,180
This is especially upon opening.

677
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:59,060
This was kind of the the icon, the silhouette of the park upon its opening.

678
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:03,060
And that's an argument I wanted to bring up about what makes a fake rock great.

679
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:08,660
The ability to draw it, that Simpsons rule of that you recognize the character

680
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,460
from the silhouette.

681
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,220
I don't think it always applies, but I think that's a cool facet of a fake rock

682
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:18,340
that you could do a bad little sketch of it and and you recognize it.

683
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,100
I think Grizzly Peak has that.

684
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,940
Yeah, it does.

685
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,900
For sure. And here's my thing with Grizzly Peak.

686
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,900
And I don't actually know what I'm going to choose yet for the between these two.

687
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,180
Yeah, this is a tough pairing.

688
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:33,300
Grizzly Peak. I didn't that maybe this is call me an idiot.

689
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,860
Didn't notice the bear until like maybe visit 20.

690
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,940
I agree with you 100 percent.

691
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,260
I'll go a step further.

692
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,020
For a long time, I thought it was a wolf.

693
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,300
Aaron thought that until a couple of visits ago.

694
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,540
And if you Google this issue, many, many people believe that.

695
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:54,260
And I think maybe people don't even know it's called Grizzly River Run.

696
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,100
And they haven't put that or they know that.

697
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,980
And they still are like, that's a wolf.

698
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,860
That's a piece. That's a nature thing.

699
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:05,900
Exactly. And when bears like a heart, the heart of California, beautiful bears.

700
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,260
We have a bear on our flag.

701
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,220
And yet still you missed that.

702
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,940
But I don't a lot of people did.

703
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:12,740
I don't blame you.

704
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:18,900
I think the problem, though, is I don't know if I should blame the rocks

705
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,860
for this or the location of the rocks. No, I do think I do like it.

706
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:24,940
I do think it looks good.

707
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,300
And I doubt when DCA first open, anyone was like, this looks like shit,

708
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,420
like lots of the rest of the park look like shit.

709
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,940
These fake rocks. This does look good.

710
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,820
And I like that. It's just like an aesthetic choice.

711
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,860
Like I have an issue with this.

712
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,380
We can't blame the rocks.

713
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:47,180
So the rocks are the rocks aren't babies.

714
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,260
They aren't innocent creatures who don't know any better.

715
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,420
These were made by Imagineers.

716
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,620
And if Imagineers made something, you can't tell what it looks like or if

717
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,380
there's confusion about what it is.

718
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:02,260
That like that's on them.

719
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,580
I just think if you tilt it like 45 degrees in one direction, people would notice it more.

720
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,140
I don't know which direction.

721
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:12,700
Yeah, because bears, I don't associate with bears with howling up at the sky.

722
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,420
I associate bears with like squatting on the ground or looking straight ahead or

723
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:23,020
something like the bears head should be like dipping into the river to find a

724
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,820
little more Mount Rushmore, even like you want.

725
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,540
Well, I want four country bears on Mount Rushmore.

726
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,180
Gosh, that would win.

727
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,060
That seems like a missed opportunity.

728
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,140
We would be doing the episode.

729
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,820
I would have said, you know what I pick.

730
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:40,940
And how is there not a Mount Rushmore anywhere in theme park world?

731
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,260
Is there one on whatever reason?

732
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:47,180
I immediately thought there was one in Jay Ward like rocking or.

733
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,220
Oh, yeah, you're right.

734
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,180
There is one. That's a preview.

735
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,500
I guess we can say that that didn't make the cut.

736
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,460
Did not make the cut.

737
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,060
Jay, which who's on it?

738
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,460
It's like Dudley.

739
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,980
And is it is it all of them?

740
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,900
Is it Dudley, his boss,

741
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,700
Snidely and his controller

742
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,460
is a county.

743
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,300
Her name may be someone screaming.

744
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,460
I got to look this up as I make Meg.

745
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,500
Yeah. Yeah.

746
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,980
It sounds like Meg.

747
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,500
Oh, no, I thought you said, you know, I don't think it is.

748
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,380
No, I just don't.

749
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,700
I stole the tweets of like, it's this.

750
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,420
Stress me out.

751
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,860
Meg, it sounds like that's not it, though.

752
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,820
It'd be a more Nell.

753
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,340
Nell, Nell, Nell, Nell.

754
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,900
Sorry for anyone yelling as in the lead up to it.

755
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,140
But hey, we got it this time.

756
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,060
We didn't leave it hanging like that Roger Rabbit thing.

757
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,540
We all fucked up. Yeah.

758
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,820
Yeah. Yeah.

759
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,260
I was someone on the street the other day and heard them go like, oh, hi, my name's

760
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,980
Nell, someone they were meeting.

761
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:51,220
And I was just like, that's the first time I've ever met a real life Nell.

762
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,780
Most Nell's speaking gibberish.

763
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,700
Sure. Yeah.

764
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,900
Language they made up.

765
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,220
I don't know.

766
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,340
I got to.

767
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,020
Hmm. I don't know if I even want to.

768
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,540
I don't want to like tilt it one way or the other.

769
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,460
I guess I have to.

770
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,300
I guess I have to vote against Grizzly

771
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,540
Peak, and I'm not happy about it, though.

772
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:16,180
I so I here's my justification because I'm going with Mount Apu Taku too.

773
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:20,300
So Grizzly Peak loses points for that Wolf Bear Confusion.

774
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,620
Absolutely loses points for course it does.

775
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:28,500
The fact that like the park, as much as

776
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:35,740
you know, I am I I am not nostalgic, but I like to reminisce about DCA 1.0.

777
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,620
But Shanghai Disney seems like clearly a success out the gate.

778
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:46,020
I'm also giving Shanghai the advantage because that, like I said, looking up

779
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:50,980
pictures of this, I was in awe and I think awe is a thing that will come up in other

780
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:55,340
rounds of this, and I was very impressed and kind of like,

781
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:00,540
oh, maybe I should think about visiting this, although

782
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,940
China seems like it has so much going on all at once.

783
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,300
I think I still find it an intimidating hypothetical travel destination.

784
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,780
Just going in general.

785
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,780
Sure. Oh, yeah.

786
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,860
But I think you absolutely got to dock points for that.

787
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,420
I'm going to say I don't think it is that I think I think this actually is.

788
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:20,260
I think it's a fun fake rock, but I think it's a little chintzier than other ones.

789
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,220
I think there is a more big budget version.

790
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:26,020
I could see a version where they, like the Hong Kong Disneyland Castle,

791
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:33,500
replace this, have a much taller bear that completely dwarfs its surroundings

792
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,900
and where there's no question that it's a bear.

793
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,940
But I think it's a little silly that it's a mountain that looks like something.

794
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,500
I think that's a little I think that's a little goofball.

795
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,500
Well, they were going.

796
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,580
I think what the problem is, is they were trying to go with something like you could

797
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,700
hypothetically see that that could develop in nature and, whoa, that's crazy.

798
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,260
It does kind of look like a bear.

799
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,060
So that's why they call it that.

800
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,500
But it's we're talking about a theme park.

801
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,300
And I want that cartoon bear, that giant

802
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:04,980
wooden cartoon bear in the sweater at Christmas time face on a fake rock.

803
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,540
Oh, you say push it even more.

804
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:10,220
Make it. I'm saying, I'm saying like the reason I'm struggling here is because I

805
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,340
we don't have many character rocks, if any.

806
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,180
So I want to reward it for being a character rock.

807
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,380
Yeah. But, yeah, the confusion and its placement.

808
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,820
And I unfortunately have to vote for Taku.

809
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,260
There's still time.

810
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,900
I don't know if this qualifies as a fake rock.

811
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,300
It is a real rock with a thing in it.

812
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,660
But we could insert that thing in Georgia with the Confederate soldiers

813
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,500
in Stone Mountain. Yes, I was thinking about that when you asked if there was a

814
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,180
we could knock out Radiator Springs and put in Stone Mountain.

815
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,980
If that would make you feel better next year, we'll do that.

816
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,740
But not this. We were going to do the Stone Mountain, Georgia episode.

817
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,260
We need to get there.

818
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:56,820
Bracket of real American icons and hey, put that in your PC pipe and shove it up

819
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,980
your butt. That's the name of the episode.

820
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,980
It has that full sentence in it.

821
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,420
What a weird revelation.

822
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:08,220
Like three years into a podcast is like, also, we're Confederate sympathizers.

823
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,020
I don't have to complain about Trump or whatever, but tradition is tradition.

824
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:16,100
So, yes, three childless Confederate sympathizers in their 30s.

825
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:22,700
Yeah. Also, the Shanghai one looks really nice in the lights.

826
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,980
Oh, you know what? I haven't I haven't seen the night view.

827
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,540
There's a night view that just really looks.

828
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,820
Oh, you know what? I don't think I took night into consideration.

829
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,420
Well, it's going to come up. Yeah, that's going to come up.

830
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,820
All right. All right. Come on.

831
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,140
But what's coming up next?

832
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,540
This is this is a nice one.

833
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,260
We've seen two heart warmers.

834
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:45,420
The first one we've certainly seen enough of at night and the day.

835
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,500
It is Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.

836
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:51,220
Yeah. And then the Calico Mine Ride and Outsberry Farm.

837
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,540
Calico Mine Ride and Outsberry Farm.

838
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,780
And this is an OG fake rock.

839
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,180
I think it's important.

840
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:02,060
Yes. Fake rock history, as we may have talked about.

841
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:06,140
It gave Walt Disney the idea of hiding cues

842
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,860
because some of the line was hidden within the fake rocks.

843
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:14,500
It was like the first, you know, this is a very clever fake rock.

844
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,580
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

845
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:22,020
And I think the interior of of this thing is pretty fantastic.

846
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,780
When you think about the maybe a lot of people haven't been on this one.

847
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,340
If you haven't been to L.A. and been to nots,

848
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:32,900
but great interior, the super claustrophobic tunnels,

849
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:37,660
which are very neat to be kind of stuck in and teetering along in.

850
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,060
And then that part with the

851
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,420
the the organ, what do you what do you call it?

852
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:46,340
Like when when all the lights hit it and it's it's like petrified rocks

853
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:49,340
that look like an organ, all of the stalactites stalagmites.

854
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,660
Oh, right. Right. Right.

855
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:54,020
It's sort of a rainbow caverns vibe.

856
00:42:55,180 --> 00:43:00,420
Yeah, that's, you know, like, hey, very clever interior fake rock lighting.

857
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:04,900
So I just there's a lot that I think is real nice about these particular fake rocks.

858
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:09,180
I have to agree. And, you know, I talked about the feeling of all in the previous

859
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,340
round in this one, thinking about these,

860
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:18,420
I got to give points to nots for the idea of scale.

861
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,380
Like it is so big.

862
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,940
And I have only I've only seen it at night because I've only been the knots

863
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,580
when we were there for not scary farm.

864
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:33,380
And I was shocked just at the size of this thing and that it was made in the 60s.

865
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,700
Yeah, it's been kicking around for so long.

866
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,140
And it's a park that wasn't exactly flush with real estate.

867
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:44,460
So to allocate such a huge amount to a giant fake rock structure

868
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,420
is impressive.

869
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,420
That does seem consistent inside and out.

870
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:54,620
I like when there's logic to the interior and that it isn't just I mean,

871
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,500
there's things on our list where then you essentially go into like

872
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,860
like a soundstage building, like a big industrial building.

873
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,300
It's hidden by fake rocks.

874
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:06,540
But I do think it's neat that like, oh, this entire attraction is is all fake.

875
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,580
And there has to be logic to the tunnels and what goes where.

876
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,580
Imagine getting lost in that thing.

877
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,420
That three story like middle zone is fantastic.

878
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,020
The problem is going into this.

879
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,940
I was thinking Big Thunder slam dunk because Big Thunder is incredible.

880
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,220
Yeah, sure. But this ride is all fake rocks.

881
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,860
Big Thunder, you're on top of the fake rocks.

882
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,700
You're on the side of them.

883
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,060
But like you're inside the fake rocks.

884
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,260
This might be the most fake rock ride of all fake rock.

885
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,060
Calico. Yeah, Calico. Yeah, that's a good point.

886
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,660
Yeah, I'm still not decided. I haven't decided yet.

887
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,420
I'm just thinking out loud here. I have a counterpoint.

888
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,980
Go ahead. I have I wanted this very much to be on here.

889
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:47,860
And and I'm passionate about this ride.

890
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,380
I think it's a real hidden gem.

891
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,580
But the other one is fucking Big Thunder Mountain.

892
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,780
Oh, I know Mountain is the pick for me.

893
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,580
Really? There's no argument there to me.

894
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:59,940
It's it. I mean, all those nice things I said. Sure.

895
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,460
But it's Big Thunder. These are iconic.

896
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,100
Fake rocks. But would it exist without Calico?

897
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,220
But that shouldn't be an argument.

898
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,220
That's that's that's all of them.

899
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,140
Yeah. But, you know, got to have points for the.

900
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,900
I would say if I'm working this out, though, the difference between

901
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:20,980
Everest and Matterhorn is that they're going for different things.

902
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,780
I do think Big Thunder is taking this and refining it.

903
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:28,540
Yeah. And specifically, you know, with the whatever you'd call it in the middle.

904
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,900
Is it a not a spire? Is it a spire?

905
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,100
What do you what would you call the big highest peak of Big Thunder?

906
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,500
I'm not sure. Yeah.

907
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,580
Peak spire. I guess.

908
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,380
I don't know. Nice looking turd pile.

909
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,340
Sure. They get littler as they go.

910
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,260
They're little plops. Yeah. Little plops.

911
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:47,380
I might say the most distinctive Disney Mountain.

912
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:51,380
The thing when you hear when I hear Disney Mountain, I would say Space Mountain.

913
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,900
But if we're talking fake rock mountain. Yeah. Yes.

914
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,380
Well, if you want. Yeah.

915
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,900
So so yeah, that's that is my struggle here is because of course,

916
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,660
that stuff is iconic and perfectly designed,

917
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:05,980
whereas the outside of Calico mine is beautiful.

918
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,500
And I wouldn't say even beautiful. It's impressive.

919
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,260
It's a little melty for sure.

920
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:12,860
The whole thing is a little melty.

921
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:15,780
And that's just because it's been around so long and they didn't have fake rock

922
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,100
technology. So I'm struggling here because when you go inside,

923
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,180
the fake rocks continue.

924
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:25,300
And some of the scenes, I would say, still kind of give Big Thunder

925
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:29,500
a run for their money as far as the fake rock scenes that exist on the ride.

926
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:34,340
That's true. But I think you have to take into account the all the international

927
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,380
versions of Big Thunder. It's in every part.

928
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,060
I'm thinking about it. There are different scenes within all of it.

929
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,500
And there are internal scenes.

930
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,700
There's an avalanche that blends perfectly or not an avalanche anymore.

931
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,100
But some of them have had it that blends perfectly the interior and the exterior.

932
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,180
I just think for what it does to the skyline,

933
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:52,980
to the for the way that it tributes our great national parks,

934
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:56,380
it gets that Bryce Canyon and Zion vibe in.

935
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:00,180
Right. That means Calico is one of a kind.

936
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:03,420
Is that extra points in that column?

937
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,780
It is. But, you know,

938
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:11,700
to what like here's another I'll make that silhouette argument.

939
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,340
I think you could show the silhouette of Big Thunder Mountain.

940
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:15,620
You know what it is right away.

941
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:18,740
The wild, the wild, the rocks are very cool in Calico.

942
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,180
I think it ultimately is like a blob.

943
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,980
Yeah, it is a blob. And and I will.

944
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,300
And this one I'm trying to think of this is incorrect.

945
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,860
So correct me if I'm wrong.

946
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:32,540
This one, a big thunder traveling on the rocks,

947
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,620
the iconic rocks on the outside.

948
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,260
You do that more like for sure.

949
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:39,660
Everest, Everest, you're kind of on a track through the mountain.

950
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,100
You're on a track here, too.

951
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:44,580
But you're actually it doesn't feel like you're kind of on the terrain

952
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:47,660
as much on Everest in a weird way to me.

953
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,820
It's like there's holes in Everest and you're going through it.

954
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,740
As opposed to like we're just bumping up and down and going through.

955
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,420
Oh, I see. I see what you're saying.

956
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,620
I'm not illustrating it so perfectly.

957
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:02,300
Well, you know, I don't want to I don't want to tilt it either way.

958
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:07,900
I feel like by staking claim as the guy who decided I could even be argued back.

959
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,820
I don't know. But I feel like I shouldn't.

960
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,980
I shouldn't say more. You can say as much as you want.

961
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,220
I'm not offended.

962
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:17,940
I keep giving points to Calico and part of it, I will admit, is a personal

963
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:21,740
of like a novelty of like this is still so fresh and new to me,

964
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:25,380
whereas like Big Thunder Mountain is just ubiquitous to me.

965
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,820
Like I have known it might be one of the first, if not

966
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,060
the first big roller coaster I ever went on.

967
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,180
So that's because but it's iconic.

968
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:41,380
It's like ubiquitous because you love it because it's a I'm trying right now

969
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,860
to divorce myself from the rides itself.

970
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:47,060
I'm trying to strip all the animatronics out of Calico.

971
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:47,700
Mine.

972
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,900
Ah, good point. Yes, they have nothing to do with it.

973
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:50,900
Nothing to do with it.

974
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:55,860
Yes. But OK, so I'm just thinking of that giant sort of three story view

975
00:48:55,860 --> 00:49:00,060
of the whole ride without the horribly oppressed workers.

976
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,940
Some of them will be stripped out for being canceled.

977
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,300
Yeah, right. Yes, of course.

978
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,340
And Garner Holt will replace them with beautiful, shiny new ones.

979
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,500
And it's a beautiful, a massive immersive, I guess,

980
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,540
what I'm looking at, immense space.

981
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,620
But Scott is right.

982
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,100
It's big Thunder Mountain Railroad.

983
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:23,340
Now you do see you could see a massive scene.

984
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,380
That was shocking to me.

985
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,940
You see a massive mass of low and a massive scene from above.

986
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,660
It's the same. It's the same one.

987
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:30,300
Same scene.

988
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,500
And you're seeing it from different angles from different angles.

989
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,900
But this but that's what I'm saying.

990
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:38,580
Scene wise, get rid of the minor robots, because that's what's hard to do

991
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:42,460
is because there's so many robots on that ride and it's so much so

992
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,300
such a big part of that experience.

993
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,340
If I'm just looking at it, I go, wow, this is big.

994
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:49,780
This is crazy.

995
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,900
The rocks look a little melty, but cool.

996
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:57,300
I think the cultural cache of fake rocks does matter.

997
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:02,700
You can't divorce it physically from its impact in the world.

998
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:05,740
I think these are I think this is the world's favorite fake rock.

999
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:08,340
I could not I could not knock out.

1000
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,740
I could not in good conscience knock out.

1001
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,580
I think ultimately you're right.

1002
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:16,660
But I it's it's it's not tough to make the decision,

1003
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:20,500
but it's tough because of how much I do love the fake rocks of Calico.

1004
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,500
I wanted it to be in the 16.

1005
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,180
I'm going to keep this.

1006
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:27,780
Scott has put in his vote.

1007
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:30,780
I am locking in for Calico. Nice.

1008
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:34,340
So the call is in your ball is in your court.

1009
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:37,100
But I just sort of said what I thought.

1010
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,380
I'm not totally sure.

1011
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:39,700
I'm not totally sure either.

1012
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,940
I hate it's big thunder.

1013
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:44,340
All right. Fair enough.

1014
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,180
Now, here's what I think.

1015
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,860
We had some discussion about who was going to go up against two.

1016
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,900
I think it's very possible that if these were different,

1017
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:53,380
I think it's possible that

1018
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:56,780
Calico could have knocked out Matterhorn if they were head to head.

1019
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:02,500
I think that's I think I think there's that's that's a horse race for sure.

1020
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:05,060
I think Calico could knocked out splash.

1021
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,260
I do, too. Yeah.

1022
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,380
The brackets do info.

1023
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,300
Keep in mind, everybody, this isn't a pure list.

1024
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,060
We did. These are these are pairs.

1025
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:19,380
Right. And sometimes the pairs make strange bedfellows and people leave angry.

1026
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,660
But that's just the way it goes.

1027
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,100
Also, I'm sorry for the lack of jokes on the show

1028
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,020
because just that's I'm in a different headspace right now.

1029
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:31,340
It's but this I hopefully this all in and of itself.

1030
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:32,660
Oh, it's Joe.

1031
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,300
Three of us talking about this is a joke.

1032
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,780
And we take it seriously.

1033
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:39,820
We had a it was a pretty robust text thread about it.

1034
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:45,540
I ran my choices by my wife as I do any important decision in my life.

1035
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:49,420
This is why I also buy my wife.

1036
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,860
I write it by your wife.

1037
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,780
She knows what she's doing.

1038
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,900
Very even.

1039
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,140
I thought I thought Jason was talking about like a gallon of ice cream in a wig.

1040
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,700
What do you think private selection?

1041
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:06,540
You make a little smiley face with the frost.

1042
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:10,180
Yeah. Or if she doesn't approve a frowny face.

1043
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,940
Yeah. And that's a bad day.

1044
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,220
She is tough, but fair.

1045
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,380
The frowny face when she doesn't want to be eaten.

1046
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:18,220
Well, sorry.

1047
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,540
Well, that's an argument.

1048
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,020
I do win. So.

1049
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,380
All right. Call fan art.

1050
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,820
Someone draw Jason marrying his ice cream wife.

1051
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,660
And back to the.

1052
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,300
And back to the tournament.

1053
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,180
Who's up next?

1054
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:35,060
This next round, actually, I think, you know, we're talking about interesting pairings.

1055
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,140
This one is the opposite.

1056
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,020
It makes very much makes sense.

1057
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:42,700
Mount Prometheus from Tokyo, Disney Sea and

1058
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:47,820
Krakatau from Volcano Bay at Universal Orlando.

1059
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:51,820
This is the volcano centerpiece of Volcano Bay.

1060
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,500
The clash of the volcanoes.

1061
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,780
Clash of the volcanoes.

1062
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,660
It makes sense to put them together.

1063
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:59,460
Twenty first century pairings.

1064
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,740
Kind of the opposite.

1065
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:06,340
Tokyo, Disney Sea, widely recognized as a huge success.

1066
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:11,300
Aesthetically, Volcano Bay seemed like people were optimistic about.

1067
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,500
And people may have cooled about now.

1068
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,700
Mike, you seem like you liked elements of this.

1069
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,220
I have been to both.

1070
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,420
Yeah, you are the only one.

1071
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:22,900
And I do not. So it really you can speak the most to this area.

1072
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:27,940
This year. So Volcano Bay, I think I talked a little bit about it a while ago.

1073
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,900
As far as the outer rim of Volcano Bay,

1074
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:36,420
that's sort of closer to a normal water park.

1075
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,900
The rides are the slides are a little less themed.

1076
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,660
They're fun, but it's nothing special.

1077
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:47,580
I did find that the fake rock itself, and I always forget how to pronounce it.

1078
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,100
It's Krakatau. Right.

1079
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,700
Correct. I.

1080
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:55,500
A couple, you know, Margarita type drinks in

1081
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:00,940
swam out to the middle of the wave pool and just sat at the foot

1082
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:05,340
of Krakatau and looked up and got pelted with water.

1083
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:08,140
And just I loved it. I was so there's going to be a.

1084
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:13,580
You were baptized and born in Krakatau, born, born me new.

1085
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,180
That's how you'd say it.

1086
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:20,820
So like an exhausting late period, like Neil Young album or something.

1087
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:22,460
Right. Krakatau.

1088
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:26,260
More. It would be more about like seeds.

1089
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:29,740
He's obsessed with like seeds and the farmers and seeds.

1090
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:33,140
So the song of seed would be a 2019 Neil Young album.

1091
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,660
Yes. Yeah, exactly.

1092
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:39,260
Some baby boomer 20 albums and start doing a story.

1093
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:42,660
There's a story. There's actually a storyline to this album.

1094
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,060
Yeah, it's a narrative.

1095
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,620
So Warren's Yvonne album that he threw in the trash.

1096
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,780
Go. Yeah. His second to last.

1097
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:51,580
Never mind. Let's not put it up.

1098
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:56,460
So I just sort of sat because you can get very close to this.

1099
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,500
You can't get as close to Mount Prometheus.

1100
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,100
You can get close, but you can't.

1101
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,140
So you don't go into the mountain.

1102
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:06,820
Well, you well, I guess that a spoiler for you.

1103
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,220
No, I don't care. Oh, you mean the end of Disney?

1104
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,500
See? Yeah. No, I know. There's rides in the.

1105
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:16,540
Yeah. You walk inside it and it's incredible.

1106
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,940
Well, I'm sort of inside of. Yeah.

1107
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,620
Like the area around it, it's not the actual volcano hole.

1108
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:24,180
Oh, sure. Sure.

1109
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,420
A hole, I guess, is the technical.

1110
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,820
But it's like a campus that

1111
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,260
yeah, out from the peak there.

1112
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,980
Kill me with a lava hole. I say toss me in.

1113
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,180
Jason versus the volcano.

1114
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,380
I'll tell you who's winning that fight.

1115
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,900
Kill me, volcano.

1116
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,100
I meant crack at the.

1117
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,020
Do you you don't go into it?

1118
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,580
You do. You do. Oh, you do. OK.

1119
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:46,380
Yes, you can walk into it.

1120
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,940
Yeah, I thought you were talking to me. OK.

1121
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,820
Yeah, but you can walk into it.

1122
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:52,860
You can talk to the spirit that lives inside of it.

1123
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:56,660
It's a person remotely controlling it and it'll shoot you with water.

1124
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,980
Is that all? Does that all affect?

1125
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:02,860
Do you consider that part of the rock or is that more of an experience inside the rock?

1126
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:07,980
I think you probably can't consider the spirit stuff part of the rock.

1127
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:12,260
Because we're not just judging the fake rock itself, not maybe the special effects.

1128
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:16,940
Although I did mention the lighting and those are sort of that sort of special effects, too.

1129
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,180
Sure. So lighting.

1130
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:23,340
Yeah. Both of these seem like they have very impressive nighttime lighting packages.

1131
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:24,420
Yes, they do.

1132
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:29,060
I would say just from a scope standpoint, looking at the two of them,

1133
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:31,980
Mount Prometheus looks more impressive.

1134
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:37,780
At night, they both look very impressive in Mount Prometheus,

1135
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:41,180
you know, shoots lava out every whatever hour or something.

1136
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:44,020
And as does Krakatau.

1137
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,260
But is it like fire?

1138
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,500
It's water, light, it's lit.

1139
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,700
Projection. Really?

1140
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:55,100
Yeah. And they both I didn't get to see the lava at Krakatau up close,

1141
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,580
but it does erupt.

1142
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,860
It still erupts like a volcano does.

1143
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:02,180
I need to see a photo of this to make sure I I.

1144
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,060
Oh, oh, and it glows.

1145
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:04,780
Which one are you looking at?

1146
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,900
Oof. Well, I'm seeing it glowing blue at night.

1147
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,900
Krakatau or Krakatau.

1148
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,420
Yeah, it looks great.

1149
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,860
Yeah, it's so cool at night.

1150
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:15,540
Wow. Yeah.

1151
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:18,700
It's it's it's kind of incredible when you look at it at night.

1152
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:22,900
And it does look cooler at night than Mount Prometheus,

1153
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,500
which also looks incredible at night. OK.

1154
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,340
I would kind of argue that it looks a little bit cooler.

1155
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,620
But the mountains themselves in the daytime,

1156
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:35,100
even though I've been up close to Krakatau, I think Mount Prometheus

1157
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:39,660
probably has a little more mystique because it's set back.

1158
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,740
So it's tough. It's a very tough call.

1159
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:47,220
Krakatau has like even just in pictures or video, beautiful water,

1160
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,540
that, you know, cascading down it.

1161
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:53,060
I think that that should be said.

1162
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,380
How do you feel about this?

1163
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,660
Jason, your earlier argument about

1164
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:02,700
that mountains don't get you anywhere, you just just you being a mountain

1165
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,900
doesn't make you win, but these are both mountains.

1166
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,860
Let's let's take the scale out of it.

1167
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:11,180
How about just the rock, the texture and the rocks themselves?

1168
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,780
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

1169
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:18,060
I mean, well, if we're talking about the can you draw it as an icon?

1170
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:22,740
I think Mount Prometheus has a leg in that category.

1171
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:27,420
Having not seen either of these in person, I don't know.

1172
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,980
I feel like Prometheus, the reputation precedes itself.

1173
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,300
Yeah, I mean, they're both both of them.

1174
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,580
When you go into the parks,

1175
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:39,300
because they're both basically the icons of the park.

1176
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:45,060
Well, I mean, Tokyo has got more even, but but they're both incredibly impressive.

1177
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:47,420
The first thing you go is, holy shit.

1178
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:50,180
And I don't even think crack a toe.

1179
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,580
The pictures do it justice,

1180
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:55,740
because especially when it doesn't have anything crack a toe is.

1181
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:01,420
Basically, I'm saying is like Tokyo has all of the beautiful scenery

1182
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:04,660
to add to Mount Prometheus to make it look more impressive.

1183
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,860
It's got those beautiful buildings in front of it.

1184
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:07,780
It's set back.

1185
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:11,780
And then there's a whole crazy like skyline, essentially, of different parts

1186
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:13,900
of Tokyo, Disney, and you go, this is a beautiful picture.

1187
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,540
Crack a toe. Unfortunately, that's it.

1188
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:19,140
It's alone. It's by itself.

1189
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:24,220
So it's sort of not fair because we're taking them both out and putting them alone.

1190
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:30,420
I don't know. I think I think I start to edge a little closer to crack a toe,

1191
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,180
especially and again, it's lighting and I don't know.

1192
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:38,220
We're sort of allowing lighting, especially with that nighttime lighting.

1193
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:42,740
I'm edging. I'm closing in closer to crack a toe is what I'm saying.

1194
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:49,220
Wow. Wow. But if you look at the detail, I do think Mount Prometheus has more detail,

1195
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:52,140
like the rock itself, the texture of it.

1196
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:53,780
It looks more realistic.

1197
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:59,100
It looks like that you see kind of the more like that it it goes from a fresher

1198
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:04,020
brown to a more lava burnt black and back and.

1199
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:07,460
Yeah, it's very subtly. So it's pretty incredible.

1200
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:11,220
I mean, it does look like it's a whole like letter grade up

1201
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:14,540
as far as detail in the rocks itself.

1202
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:17,380
It also I mean, I mean, this is true for both of them.

1203
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:21,020
Both of them like make the park when you hear that this park exists

1204
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:24,300
or is being built and you go and there's a giant volcano. Right.

1205
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:27,460
As part of it, that's when I've been telling people who don't know about Tokyo,

1206
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:30,140
Disney Sea, and sadly, I do know some of those people.

1207
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,740
I have to say it's this other Disneyland

1208
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:37,220
that's told it's only in Tokyo and there's this giant volcano at the center of it.

1209
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:38,620
That's like the selling point.

1210
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:40,700
You show a photo of that thing. Right.

1211
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,500
And like I said, as opposed to, you know,

1212
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:50,220
fake rock lights, Disney parks of the era, you know, the Oriental Land Company

1213
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:54,460
financing the park, let them go fake rock apeshit.

1214
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:57,700
And for going fake rock apeshit, I have to reward them.

1215
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,980
I'm casting my vote for Mount Prometheus.

1216
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:06,620
Yeah, I'm I'm going back towards Mount Prometheus, Prometheus at this point.

1217
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:12,540
But I do feel like Universal did crack a towel at disservice

1218
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:15,660
because it's the only crazy impressive thing in the park.

1219
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:17,340
Sure. And it is.

1220
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:21,500
You know, I think the top who top who payment system, the cashless

1221
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:25,300
wristwatch payment system is a fast pass system.

1222
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,900
And then you go and click and it's like the virtual line.

1223
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:30,620
90 minutes to ride one water slide.

1224
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,140
That was the first couple of months.

1225
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:33,980
So maybe they've worked it out. Maybe they've worked it out.

1226
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:38,780
So it sucks because I think the photos don't do crack a towel justice.

1227
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:42,340
And especially with nothing to bounce off of it,

1228
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:47,860
it makes it look chintzier than it is because I truly was blown away by it.

1229
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:50,900
There's a video I should have brought it out if I was really going to defend it,

1230
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:53,740
that you would go, oh, my God, that looks unbelievable.

1231
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:56,380
Night photos made that a much tougher choice.

1232
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,340
Yeah, yeah, I got to stick to my guns.

1233
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:03,620
But unfortunately, I know it's for crack a towel, not unfortunately in general.

1234
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,980
Mount Prometheus just in the day rocks itself

1235
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:11,540
versus other rocks Mount Prometheus has to win.

1236
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:13,420
I'll go ahead and give it to Prometheus, too.

1237
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:16,420
So that's, you know, unanimous that one.

1238
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:19,620
You got it. Also, that there's two rides inside.

1239
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:21,860
Holy shit. Yeah. I mean, the rides don't matter.

1240
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,780
But oh, my God. Right.

1241
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:28,220
How much of the park is this facility?

1242
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:32,260
Yes, right. Like if there was a second ride within Radiator Springs,

1243
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:33,540
how insane that would be. Of course.

1244
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:36,780
And then look, there's a nice, lazy river that goes through crack a towel.

1245
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,100
And I loved it.

1246
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:41,300
And the mist falls and you kind of go under and I'm dreaming of it

1247
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,260
in my head right now and I'm wanting to go back.

1248
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,180
But yes, it's Mount Prometheus.

1249
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:48,500
I think there's another like Calico.

1250
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,940
I think there's another pairing where crack a towel walks away with it.

1251
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:54,300
Yeah, for sure. That is not this pairing.

1252
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:58,740
So that brings us to maybe another tough one.

1253
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,980
We're we're pairing off Pandora,

1254
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:06,900
the world of Pandora and the floating mountains, Pandora,

1255
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:13,460
with the upcoming Black Spires of Black Spire Outpost at Star Wars Galaxy's Edge.

1256
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:16,620
This one is called Where Disney's Money Has Been Going.

1257
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:22,140
Are they called the Hallelujah Mountains specifically in Avatar?

1258
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:24,740
No, it would be you.

1259
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:27,020
I believe they are.

1260
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:30,580
But I mean, not all of the fake rocks in Pandora are floating,

1261
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:31,900
but some of them are.

1262
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:33,860
And hey, that's points right out of the gate.

1263
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:37,100
Holy shit. I watched a video about the engineering of those things.

1264
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:38,980
Oh, my God. How do you make float?

1265
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:43,540
I mean, it's not a totally you don't know how they did it effect,

1266
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,620
but it's it's pretty damn impressive.

1267
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:47,780
And I've been there in person.

1268
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:50,340
But boy, pictures paint the picture.

1269
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:51,340
Yeah, I picture.

1270
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:52,740
And they are the Hallelujah Mountains.

1271
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,540
I've confirmed. OK, great.

1272
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:57,340
So just in case you want to refer to it as that, just to keep it fresh

1273
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:01,980
when we're discussing now, Black Spire Outpost, the spires,

1274
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:04,700
the tall things poking out.

1275
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:07,460
None of us have seen this yet. Let's say that.

1276
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:10,780
Yeah. Also, in the back story, we've recently learned

1277
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:14,220
that it is petrified wood, which is technically eventually

1278
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:16,420
if wood petrifies enough, it becomes rock.

1279
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:18,620
Oh, I believe that's correct.

1280
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:20,260
Is that right? That is right.

1281
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:22,540
Yes, they're boy. That hurts it. It's wood.

1282
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:25,100
Oh, no, it's fake wood.

1283
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,620
It was tall trees that died.

1284
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:28,740
So that is a strike against it.

1285
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,900
Oh, shit. But it's on its way to rock.

1286
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:35,060
And I bet part of it, at least the percentage is rock in canon.

1287
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:36,940
Fuck that. I feel betrayed.

1288
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:39,060
I'm I'm giving it to Pandora right now.

1289
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:41,860
I don't want no trees hanging around.

1290
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:45,500
I mean, I lose his points, too, because, yeah, I haven't seen it.

1291
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,820
Black Spire Outpost and

1292
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:52,020
don't know what the nighttime lighting package is going to be like Pandora

1293
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:56,540
at night. Beautiful, beautiful trees trying to sneak in there.

1294
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:58,820
This is bullshit. I feel duped.

1295
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:01,420
Is that true of all of it, though?

1296
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:05,180
Some of it has to be like there's a cliff wall outside of

1297
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:10,620
the fires itself are the ones that are the there are.

1298
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:13,540
I mean, there are fake rocks here.

1299
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:16,740
Yeah. And they see like that are this.

1300
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:18,620
This land looks unbelievably impressive.

1301
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:22,060
And seeing these things go up in the back of Disneyland

1302
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:25,700
and watching them rise from that parking structure has been a thrill.

1303
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:29,340
And I like with both of these avatar and Star Wars.

1304
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:31,860
I'm excited that fake rocks are the future.

1305
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:36,020
When Disney puts a big new facility

1306
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:40,060
based on an exciting property into their parks, fake rocks got to be there.

1307
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:41,820
And I love seeing them from the back.

1308
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:44,900
I love that we get to drive through and see the like admire that

1309
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:46,860
that framework right at Washington.

1310
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:50,820
I like seeing them from my beloved Mark Twain.

1311
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:53,180
And I pointed this out last time I was there.

1312
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:58,580
Mention it to you guys that they really do blend nicely with the rocks

1313
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:01,740
that you see from the boat, the rocks, big thunder.

1314
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:07,900
Well, no wonder the train tracks right under the train tracks like similar rocks.

1315
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,340
Everything looks copacetic.

1316
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:12,980
They need to get a few more trees in there, but they might just need to grow.

1317
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:15,460
But it's like it's not jarring.

1318
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:16,940
It's not a jarring skyline.

1319
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:18,460
Those new rocks are great.

1320
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:20,580
Yeah. That's the transitional rocks.

1321
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:21,980
I really. Yeah.

1322
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:24,620
Yeah. If those if those count, if those are those separate,

1323
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:26,740
should we have been breaking this down more?

1324
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:28,780
We should have broken it down more.

1325
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:32,500
I don't know that the transitional ones do, because I think of them

1326
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,660
more as the train track rocks.

1327
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:36,300
Like they're underneath those.

1328
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,460
They their own category.

1329
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:40,500
Should we bump something else and put in the transitional rock?

1330
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,260
No, we're too too far into it.

1331
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:43,980
I don't know. I think we can do whatever we want.

1332
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:47,940
That's a vote between us of what's left.

1333
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:49,940
No, I don't think so.

1334
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:52,060
Jason's putting his foot down. Jason's trying to put his foot down.

1335
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:53,620
Wait, what do you think, Mike?

1336
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:54,660
It's your OK.

1337
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:57,060
Let me just so I'm clear on what this proposition is.

1338
01:06:57,060 --> 01:07:01,620
We would we would put just the rocks outside of Star Wars land.

1339
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:05,060
The transition from frontier land to fantasy land.

1340
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:05,980
That's what you're proposing.

1341
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,060
That's not even the ones I'm talking about.

1342
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,820
We're talking about the ones along the train.

1343
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:12,180
The ones underneath the train tracks.

1344
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:15,380
When you go along the river by like the Indian village.

1345
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:17,180
Oh, I see. OK, OK. Yeah.

1346
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:20,460
Those are great fake rocks right by where the beaver is gnawing at the

1347
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:23,260
whatever post. Yeah.

1348
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:26,380
I think the ones you're talking about, I would need to see

1349
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:31,900
the cinematic transition of walking by those and then through the portal

1350
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:34,300
into the land to make a judgment.

1351
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,180
Yeah. Thunder trail.

1352
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,300
Well, but a judgment, we don't need to go through the rocks.

1353
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:40,140
We're just talking about the rocks that are on the one side.

1354
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:42,180
That are there already along the big thunder trail.

1355
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:45,220
You know, that big, like that big, crazy new rock pops out.

1356
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:46,860
So you can't like peer over.

1357
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:50,940
If you said that an entire category of rock encompasses both of these,

1358
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:55,940
the new rocks that have been put in to transition you into Galaxy's Edge.

1359
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:57,540
And those are different than galaxies.

1360
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,580
Yeah, they're transitional rocks.

1361
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:03,380
They you take a big thunder rock and then you just sort of more for a little bit

1362
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:05,020
into a galaxy's edge rock.

1363
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:06,420
But they're in the middle.

1364
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,180
They're trying to get you off.

1365
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:12,180
They're trying to get you to what is there a drug that transitions

1366
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:13,860
you off heroin or something?

1367
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:14,740
I'm trying to make a good.

1368
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:16,740
It's like grape juice or something. Yeah.

1369
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:19,460
OK, so well, if we're going to replace anything,

1370
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:23,980
I think we should knock out the Black Spires because we know there would now.

1371
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,740
Oh, so we're changing transitional rocks.

1372
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:30,500
I think we should change this round because I like the last few rounds.

1373
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:32,940
Well, we're not going to we're not going to get.

1374
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:35,260
Oh, I see what you're saying. OK. Yeah.

1375
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:36,780
This is too confusing now.

1376
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:38,700
I've been throwing a wrench.

1377
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,820
I don't know if I'd find support in this.

1378
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:44,100
I just wanted to make sure I was rocks.

1379
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:48,420
I'll say I'll put the river rocks and the big new rocks

1380
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:52,500
as the rocks because we have all experienced those.

1381
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,980
Forget about the Black Spires.

1382
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,980
These are the Star Wars rocks now.

1383
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:59,820
Oh, we changed the definition of what the Star Wars are.

1384
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:01,940
The Galaxy's Edge rocks are all right.

1385
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:05,940
It's the one we've actually gotten to enjoy because we have had a number of things

1386
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:08,180
that none of us have sampled before. Sure.

1387
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:10,780
Sure. Only Mike has sampled before. I see.

1388
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,980
So, OK. Wow.

1389
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:17,900
Well, we have re we've redistricted some of the rocks.

1390
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:20,620
We've changed the definition. It's not the Black Spires.

1391
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:24,580
It's the it's the existing Star Wars Galaxy's Edge rocks.

1392
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:28,500
But they are up against a pretty even with that.

1393
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:30,660
They're up against a pretty tough competitor.

1394
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:33,060
They're against floating rocks against floating rocks.

1395
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:35,100
I already none of this changes my vote.

1396
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:37,700
I wanted to be bold and say it right away. It's Pandora.

1397
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,020
I'm going to go with Pandora, too. All right.

1398
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:43,020
How would it not be the Hallelujah Mountains?

1399
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:46,540
I mean, we don't even know what you would even say.

1400
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:47,700
Oh, they're incredible.

1401
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,060
Mountain Savaco.

1402
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:52,060
We wrote we wrote smart park that they're in. Great.

1403
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:55,140
This next round, very excited for

1404
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:59,700
Mythos Restaurant at Island to Adventure versus Mount Mayday,

1405
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:02,820
the icon of Typhoon Lagoon.

1406
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:04,420
These are kind of the dark horses.

1407
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:05,980
These are the dark horses.

1408
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:09,500
And I was going to say, Mythos is my dark horse.

1409
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,620
This is my dark horse.

1410
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:15,740
And I as we were figuring out what to eliminate,

1411
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:20,100
I was like, if anyone says Mythos, I'm going to lose my fucking mind.

1412
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:23,260
I also I take it back when I said earlier, this is a character.

1413
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,220
Yep. That's the character that's left.

1414
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:26,460
And you know what?

1415
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:28,700
I we hey, this is a long podcast.

1416
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:31,700
I Jason, your enthusiasm sold me right away. Mythos.

1417
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:34,140
Yeah. I'm not even going to talk about it.

1418
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:37,140
This has a character. The character's mouth is a waterfall.

1419
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,780
This adds to the skyline of Islands of Adventure.

1420
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:43,580
When you get to the port of the entry, you see Jurassic Park straight ahead.

1421
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:48,380
And then you look to your right, you see this massive fake rock structure

1422
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:53,540
that has no right to be as good as it is in a forgotten land.

1423
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:57,500
The land they almost was an afterthought Typhoon Lagoon.

1424
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:00,220
You see a mountain. It is fake rocks.

1425
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:02,580
But you see the boat. First of all, it's the boat.

1426
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:04,500
The boat takes it. And you can't

1427
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:07,780
you can't give it to rocks

1428
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:10,700
because of what they're supporting.

1429
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:14,420
It's about the rocks, not what's on top of the rocks. Exactly.

1430
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:16,580
So that's two for Mythos. Yes.

1431
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:17,700
I'll mythos as well.

1432
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:20,140
Well, mythos restores quick.

1433
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:23,260
I mean, and we and you know, when we got a we got like a Zeus

1434
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:26,660
barfing water that's not vote for that.

1435
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:30,380
I actually remember being excited that when I found out Harry Potter was going in,

1436
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:31,940
I was like, Oh, does that mean they're taking out that restaurant?

1437
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:33,300
I kind of like that restaurant.

1438
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,940
And isn't it cool on the inside to very cool on the inside?

1439
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:39,060
I honestly think that Universal should go back to the drug,

1440
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:44,260
should take more inspiration for their food program from like Mythos

1441
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:46,940
and on Dark Horse and so on, right?

1442
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:50,820
Lombards over the original universal similar menu to mythos.

1443
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:52,500
They might even have the same menu nowadays.

1444
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,700
But it's like make more of the food like these two places.

1445
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:59,340
Well, they're like the some of the only quality in Universal Florida,

1446
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:00,900
which is it's tough food in those parts.

1447
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:02,180
It's tough. Yeah, these tough.

1448
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:03,340
So all right.

1449
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:07,020
Mythos has a tough road ahead of it because mythos is going up against.

1450
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:10,780
This is I keep calling this the crowd pleaser conference.

1451
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:12,420
Like these are big heavy hitters.

1452
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:16,980
This last, last round of the first last round of the first 16.

1453
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:20,500
And they are the rocks

1454
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:25,700
is part of the Hogwarts campus in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter

1455
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:28,340
and Radiator Springs,

1456
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:31,620
AKA Ornament Valley.

1457
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:35,500
That's maybe what you technically should, AKA the Cadillac Range.

1458
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:39,100
I don't know what you maybe the whole thing you would call Ornament Valley.

1459
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:42,140
I think it's too pretentious it up because Radiator Springs

1460
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:44,700
really is the city leading up to it.

1461
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:47,620
And I like that we have a list that has names you don't know,

1462
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:51,380
like Mount Apu Taku and Mount Prometheus, you know, maybe no offense.

1463
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:54,700
So I'm going to say as this proceeds, I kind of want to call it Ornament Valley.

1464
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:56,940
All right. Sure. Yeah.

1465
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:59,540
I'm going to toss my hat in the ring for Ornament Valley.

1466
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:04,180
Beautiful. Another scale bump looks great.

1467
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,500
Amazing in the day. Amazing at night.

1468
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:10,220
Two separate entrances, two separate like visual experiences,

1469
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:13,220
whether you come around the corner from Flo's or whether you come from

1470
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:15,420
the Pacific War food court.

1471
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:17,020
That's an incredible view.

1472
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:18,580
That is a fantastic view.

1473
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:21,340
And didn't learn about until like the second or third time I was there.

1474
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:23,940
I was like, wait, this is the better way to come,

1475
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:26,820
not through the amazing town, through the back door.

1476
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:29,220
There is no this round. There's no question.

1477
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:33,020
I think I advocated at Hogwarts, not at Hogwarts, not even be in this tournament.

1478
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:35,420
I've been thinking about it a lot.

1479
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:38,340
Actually, this is one of the choices that I've been struggling with.

1480
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:42,540
Jason, when we were saying, do we just put a second round of Star Wars in?

1481
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:44,260
That's what I wanted to bump.

1482
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:46,540
I think we maybe made a little mistake here.

1483
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:48,780
I think those rocks are good. They're very good.

1484
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:49,660
I have no problem with the rocks.

1485
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:53,380
But as the Typhoon Lagoon rule, it's about the rocks,

1486
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:54,740
not what the rocks are supporting.

1487
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:57,180
That's right. I think this was one where it's like, well,

1488
01:13:57,180 --> 01:14:01,100
if we didn't talk about some Harry Potter rocks, we were going to hear about it.

1489
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:04,420
I disagree with that. Who was going to be there?

1490
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:05,180
I don't know.

1491
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:06,620
If you're going to be there to write a letter.

1492
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:10,420
Who out there listening right now, if we hadn't mentioned the Hogwarts rocks.

1493
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:11,740
I mean, there's a lot of rock.

1494
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:14,140
There's more rock in that than Splash Mountain.

1495
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:16,500
Yes, but it's not the quantity of rocks we're talking about.

1496
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:16,980
But they're good rocks.

1497
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:18,620
We're not talking quantity. They're good rocks.

1498
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:21,260
They are, Jason, they're all good rocks.

1499
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:23,980
You don't get in the final 16 if it's not good rocks.

1500
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,500
Yeah, you're not making it here.

1501
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,660
I'm just saying this is there's no contest to this.

1502
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,420
This thing is incredible.

1503
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:31,500
I think this is this also an unfortunate.

1504
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,220
I think it's possible that Hogwarts.

1505
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:35,580
I was thinking about proposing a

1506
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:39,780
a supporting rocks category in which Hogwarts goes up against Mount Mayday.

1507
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:41,460
And then one of them is still in the race.

1508
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:43,220
But that's not the case.

1509
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:43,780
I don't think they would.

1510
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:47,100
I don't think either of them had what it takes to get into the final four.

1511
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:49,260
I agree. Can I say what?

1512
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:53,500
So we've made it through the 16 and we'll we'll recap what we're left with.

1513
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:57,060
But let's while we're talking about what didn't make it, here's what's beating me up.

1514
01:14:57,420 --> 01:15:00,620
I think that maybe Hogwarts should have been out.

1515
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:04,540
Maybe maybe even Star Wars should have been out because we don't know enough.

1516
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:06,180
Maybe even Seven Dwarfs.

1517
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:09,260
I might have bumped Hogwarts or Seven Dwarfs in order to put in

1518
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:12,620
having a lot of regrets about not putting in Catastrophe Canyon.

1519
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:15,220
I'm feeling bad about Catastrophe Canyon.

1520
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:19,340
I guess ultimately, Catastrophe Canyon, which was like part of the MGM

1521
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:25,460
studio's tram tour, their their attempt to do a universal style thing

1522
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:27,860
where everything goes awry and there's explosions.

1523
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:30,260
And then we show you that it was all just an illusion.

1524
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,740
The I Survived podcast, the ride,

1525
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:39,660
catchphrase at the end of the shirt that we made of it is based on Catastrophe Canyon.

1526
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:40,940
That is that's neither here nor there.

1527
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:43,220
We'll talk about Catastrophe Canyon one day.

1528
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:46,620
But I you know what? I think these I think these guys got squeezed.

1529
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:48,180
I think maybe they deserve to be in the 16.

1530
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:51,900
But well, they are the first not really argued.

1531
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:53,740
I put Kong Skull Island in there, too.

1532
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:56,540
We that's right. We were going back and forth.

1533
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:59,620
No character squeezed to no character character.

1534
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:04,740
Better than there's a monkey within the then there's a monkey.

1535
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,620
Yeah. But it's not scope always.

1536
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:11,620
Yeah. Yeah. I think most of that experience, it's kind of that little courtyard.

1537
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:16,260
Right. Yeah. It's not like I think that if we put that in, that is less

1538
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:19,220
fake rocks than anything else in the competition.

1539
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:22,140
I think I think mass is important.

1540
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:26,220
Scott, in the very initial list, you put down one that I was not at all familiar

1541
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:29,740
with and had to look up and I thought was very impressive.

1542
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:34,620
Yeah. And it's in Fantasia land in Europe and it's called Germany.

1543
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:37,900
In Germany. Yeah. And it's Tehran.

1544
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:43,100
Yeah. Tehran, I think you pronounce it very striking, very interesting looking

1545
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:45,980
Google image. This one, Gang Tehran is spelled T.A.

1546
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:48,860
R.O.N. Fantasia land is spelled with a P.H.

1547
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:50,980
This is pretty cool.

1548
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:55,780
I think if we like were from there had been there, maybe we would have put this in.

1549
01:16:55,780 --> 01:17:00,540
But this is a steel roller coaster that kind of twists around real like craggy,

1550
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:03,260
very Skull Island rocks and a giant wall of them.

1551
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:05,300
And it looks like a bunch of bullets stacked up.

1552
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,460
It's pretty aggressive and scary.

1553
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:09,740
I think you got to get you got to dock points for that.

1554
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:13,380
It's kind of a roller coaster that's just next to the rocks.

1555
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:15,020
The they aren't really related.

1556
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:16,740
It's not embedded into the experience.

1557
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:20,700
But yeah, there's a little like foreign dark horse that,

1558
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:24,980
you know, might have made a final 17, but not a final 16. Yeah.

1559
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:27,860
Anything else you guys regret didn't make it?

1560
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:34,820
We talked about the rocks in the Little Mermaid attraction in Orlando.

1561
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:37,300
Yeah, that's that may be pretty.

1562
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:41,420
I think that is more interesting than than Kong Skull Island.

1563
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:43,780
I agree. You're opening it up more.

1564
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:46,340
I thought we were also discussing.

1565
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:50,020
Does anything in the Indiana Jones adventure count as a fake rock?

1566
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:51,300
Are the ruins fake rocks?

1567
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,700
Is Mara in the main scene of fake rock?

1568
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:57,460
She's well, she is rock, right?

1569
01:17:57,660 --> 01:17:59,620
No, she isn't. She metal.

1570
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:00,740
I guess she is metal.

1571
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:01,860
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1572
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:03,060
Or like gold or something.

1573
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:05,220
Yeah, the original the initial one.

1574
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:07,620
But when you will the main reveal of

1575
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:10,900
and the one that shoots the bridge.

1576
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:12,660
Oh, yeah, that's a big fake rock.

1577
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:14,500
Yeah. Does that count?

1578
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:15,700
Should that have been in there?

1579
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:20,060
I mean, I think we were going a lot on the outsides of these things.

1580
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:22,340
And I think that might hurt

1581
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:26,540
Cast catastrophe Canyon in my book is that you so quickly go around the corner

1582
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:29,220
and see the iron work holding up the fake rocks.

1583
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:30,900
But that's a big fake rock here.

1584
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:34,900
I mean, that of all of these, that one, I guess maybe should have been.

1585
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:39,020
Yeah. The Mara fake rock inside of the temple.

1586
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:40,020
Maybe so.

1587
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:42,980
But I don't think anything that we just discussed would have made it.

1588
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:45,780
I don't think I don't think any of it would have made it into the eight.

1589
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:48,180
Yeah. Which I guess we can move into.

1590
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:52,140
And also let us know if we missed anything, if we eliminated your favorite

1591
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:54,980
fake rock or didn't even put it in the final 16.

1592
01:18:55,180 --> 01:19:01,700
Let us know at hashtag PTR FRF for I'm getting better at saying it as we go on.

1593
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:05,060
It's a two, three hundred empire type.

1594
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:08,220
You dug this grave and now you get to lie in it.

1595
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:10,540
F.R. for fat crap.

1596
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:16,100
OK, so just to run down the full list, the eight that are left, Matterhorn,

1597
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:20,300
Splash Mountain, Mount Apu, Taku, Big Thunder Mountain, Mount Prometheus,

1598
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:22,580
the world of Pandora, the hallelujah mountains.

1599
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:24,220
The hallelujah mountains. Great.

1600
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:25,940
Let's be we got to be proper.

1601
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:30,060
Hallelujah Mountains, Mythos restaurant and ornament valley.

1602
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:34,420
So back to the beginning, Matterhorn V.

1603
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:36,620
Splash Mountain.

1604
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:39,420
Got to give it to Matterhorn.

1605
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:41,620
You go. We don't have to discuss all of these.

1606
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:42,940
It's Matterhorn.

1607
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:46,900
Everything that we said that made me your initial argument, Jason,

1608
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:49,340
now applies. Now I feel it.

1609
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:51,900
And you're going up against Matterhorn.

1610
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:54,260
It's that's that's an icon, an icon of the L.A.

1611
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:57,140
skyline. You drive by it on the five.

1612
01:19:57,260 --> 01:20:00,420
If you if you're going somewhere on the five and you can't go to Disneyland,

1613
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:02,140
that's the little taste that you get.

1614
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:05,420
You get to see that that mountain from the freeway. Absolutely.

1615
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:07,340
It's it's so exciting.

1616
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:09,220
You see it in the Randy Newman video.

1617
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:10,740
I love the L.A.

1618
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:13,860
It's it's a part that tugs at the heartstrings for me.

1619
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:17,100
It's got to be. But you're I'm sorry to just pounce on and not

1620
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:20,020
let you know that's OK to two makes two wins.

1621
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:22,260
So what's your vote? What I say is irrelevant.

1622
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:25,860
I'm really thinking about it.

1623
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:28,980
I probably go matter on, though, because I think if you strip away

1624
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:33,300
the fun stuff of Splash Mountain, Matterhorn wins just again,

1625
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:34,460
is all the reasons you said.

1626
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:36,860
So I have to go matterhorn. Yep. Yeah.

1627
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:40,740
The original holding firm

1628
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:43,340
takes us into Big Thunder Mountain after talking.

1629
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:44,740
Yeah. All right.

1630
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:46,260
Oh, sure. This is going to wrap up.

1631
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:48,220
Hey, quicker. What?

1632
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,900
Do you have an argument against it?

1633
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:54,100
I mean, I think it's another interesting comparison of old versus new.

1634
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:59,060
I think we should, you know, embrace change, embrace the future.

1635
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:02,340
One might even say seize the future.

1636
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:07,140
And so maybe we should really consider Mount Apu Taku.

1637
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:09,140
Let me consider it.

1638
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:12,820
You know, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1639
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:15,060
OK, and there's the bit. All right.

1640
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:16,100
What's your vote, though?

1641
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:18,500
If anybody's keeping track of the of the tally.

1642
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,620
I think the P.A.

1643
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:20,860
is going to be a good one.

1644
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:23,380
I don't know. I don't know on this one.

1645
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:25,340
Really? You would vote for Mount.

1646
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:28,660
What's a very, very impressed amount?

1647
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:33,660
To Jason's credit and point, it is massive.

1648
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:36,060
It's insane. It's a crazy facility.

1649
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:40,020
And I think if we'd seen it and if we were more familiar with it prior,

1650
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:43,380
I mean, look it up. It feels like it's a little bit more of a

1651
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:45,680
a little bit more of a

1652
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:47,340
a little bit more of a

1653
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:49,500
more familiar with it prior.

1654
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:52,380
I mean, look it up. It feels it's almost going to feel silly.

1655
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:55,860
If you looked at that and said it was eliminated from a fake rock competition.

1656
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:59,180
Yeah. How could that be the case next to these puny

1657
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,500
Big Thunder mole hills?

1658
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,420
That being said, here's where I really go to the silhouette.

1659
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:06,260
A big thunder iconic.

1660
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:10,900
Ultimately, Mount Apu Taku is a big, you know, it's a big it's a big wall.

1661
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:12,940
It's a big cliff. It's a very good one.

1662
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:13,900
It's an incredibly good one.

1663
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:16,420
But hey, it's Big Thunder Mountain we're talking about.

1664
01:22:16,420 --> 01:22:17,260
Yeah, that's true.

1665
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:20,460
Should we have included the aggro crag from?

1666
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:21,860
Oh, yeah.

1667
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:23,220
Should should the aggro crag?

1668
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:26,900
I know it was it was technically on Universal Studios property.

1669
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:28,660
Yeah, we should replace.

1670
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:33,620
Let's see, mythos with I'm going to kick your ass.

1671
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:42,380
Let's well, unfortunately, the aggregate was not open to the public.

1672
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:45,420
It was only open to snooty good at sports kids.

1673
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:46,020
I wanted to.

1674
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:47,380
Scott was excluded.

1675
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:49,780
I was trying to climb with audiences. Yeah.

1676
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:51,300
Dreamed of climbing that.

1677
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:55,540
As opposed to mythos, open to the public and serving delicious meals on the daily.

1678
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:57,940
Yeah. But that's not where we're at right now.

1679
01:22:57,940 --> 01:23:03,140
We're at Mount Prometheus versus the Hallelujah Mountains.

1680
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:07,660
This is really tough, because if this was the final two, you'd go.

1681
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:09,660
That makes sense.

1682
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:11,820
But we're way ahead of it.

1683
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,780
Oof. I'll let somebody else talk.

1684
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,100
I don't think I can.

1685
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:21,660
I mean, OK, Mount Prometheus is it is a very incredible realistic,

1686
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:25,620
I would say, too. I haven't seen too many mountains in my life in person.

1687
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:28,060
But it is that realism.

1688
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:33,700
It's it's obviously a little stylized and they have the lighting stuff is amazing

1689
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:36,540
and exploring it is amazing.

1690
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:41,540
But but is it more impressive to

1691
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:46,660
recreate the realistic or make the fantastical look realistic?

1692
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:49,220
That's what I'm trying to grapple with right here.

1693
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:54,420
Yeah. I will say, is the effect of the mountains

1694
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:57,620
as incredible as you'd want it to be?

1695
01:23:57,620 --> 01:24:01,740
Maybe not of the of the flying of the of the mountains.

1696
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:04,740
And you who's been you only you've been and I only I've been to, yeah,

1697
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:08,300
Pandora as well to see the Hallelujah Mountains in person.

1698
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:10,820
Have you written on the back of the mighty Akron?

1699
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:12,260
The mighty Akron? Yeah, of course.

1700
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:13,500
OK, great. Yes.

1701
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,340
Just check it. I forget.

1702
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:17,020
I tamed the beast. You tamed it.

1703
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:19,940
The banshee. You guys been to the Grand Canyon?

1704
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:22,180
You've been to a real no, never.

1705
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:22,820
No, no, no, no, no.

1706
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:25,180
I have been to the Petrified Forest National Park.

1707
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:26,540
Mm hmm. Oh, yeah.

1708
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:29,620
That's a well, is there any sort of like simulator ride at the Grand Canyon?

1709
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:32,660
You could also go on that could be there's like a reason for me to go.

1710
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:36,380
There is. Well, there's a helicopter and you could buy a ticket from

1711
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:40,500
that convenience store in Vegas that is covered in fake rocks

1712
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:41,780
right next to the MGM.

1713
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:43,660
Now I'm sold. It looks like a fake.

1714
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:47,020
It's like it's like where you it's where you buy expensive waters

1715
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:52,980
outside casinos and like novelty mugs that say like sluts party hard in Vegas.

1716
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:55,660
And and it looks like the Grand Canyon.

1717
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:59,700
So so, you know, in that pairing, Grand Canyon versus

1718
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:04,020
Casino Mini Mart that looks like the Grand Canyon.

1719
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:06,220
We're giving it to the casino mini mart. Yeah, for sure.

1720
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:10,380
Now, Scott's just looking at things in the room because I'm drinking from a swell

1721
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:13,020
official swell sluts party hard in Vegas.

1722
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:15,740
Water bottle here. I thought I was inventing.

1723
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:17,460
So you're right. I was. Yeah.

1724
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:21,540
Yeah. Usually come in and the slut swag. Yeah.

1725
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:25,980
You can't you got to make it clear. You love sluts. Yeah.

1726
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:31,180
So back to the back to the world of.

1727
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:35,980
I mean, I've only visited these places in my dreams and flights of whimsy.

1728
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:40,180
So, yeah, like as far as just the presentation of Mount Prometheus

1729
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:43,820
and any any angle you look at it, whether you're back by.

1730
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:46,860
I can't remember if you can completely see it when you're in Cape Cod

1731
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:52,380
with Duffy and friends, but you can see it in many different points of Tokyo,

1732
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:56,580
Disney, and it feels like so many of those places were curated perfectly

1733
01:25:56,580 --> 01:26:00,180
to make it look like that amazing radiator springs view.

1734
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:03,180
The second entrance to Cars Land.

1735
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:07,460
Also, I'll second you there, having not been there.

1736
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:11,100
When you Google image Mount Prometheus, Disney, see

1737
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:16,540
every photo is different as opposed to I think that does hurt like crack a towel

1738
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:19,780
that you're looking at a similar view over and over again.

1739
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:25,580
And that this encompasses like so many different vantage points

1740
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:28,100
can be your Mount Prometheus. Yes.

1741
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:31,060
And that's a thing I probably said on the episode about Tokyo, Disney,

1742
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:35,300
where it's like, oh, every single place you're standing is like

1743
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:37,860
the second entrance to Cars Land.

1744
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:42,940
God damn. Like, like there's so many times you go, oh, my God, look at this view.

1745
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:45,060
And then you're just standing on exactly the opposite.

1746
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:46,540
You're like, oh, my God, look at that.

1747
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:49,860
Like you start seeing things in different contexts as we record this.

1748
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:52,060
I'm really close to going. So I'm flicking.

1749
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:54,540
Yeah, that that cars I view.

1750
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:58,020
Yeah, but you're just like you'll be in Cape Cod and then you'll be like,

1751
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:00,300
look at New York over there and you'll be like, wow, it's beautiful.

1752
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:01,700
Like, it's unbelievable.

1753
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:04,100
Then you'll be like down the New York street and you'll see like the big boat

1754
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:09,300
and you'll be like, oh, my God, like everything is like feels so perfectly

1755
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:13,140
designed to make you go, whoa, especially at night.

1756
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:15,460
It seems like you spend.

1757
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:18,540
Does this sound like you haven't been there?

1758
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:19,940
Does this seem accurate about Disney?

1759
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:24,380
See that it's like looking at other Disney theme parks,

1760
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:27,420
but you have glasses now, so you have perfect 20, 20 vision.

1761
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:30,140
You see all these details you could never see before.

1762
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:33,820
That's that. That does make sense to me because I don't think

1763
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:37,100
this is too much of a spoiler, but going through just the New York section,

1764
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:42,900
the amount of little things you notice and just like

1765
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:48,300
an imagineer spent what feels like a day on a little poster

1766
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:51,780
with a bunch of jokes and a bunch of silly crap.

1767
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:55,740
And I'm sure I got we saw like five percent of it.

1768
01:27:55,940 --> 01:27:58,260
Geez. Like you just go like, hey, look at this billboard.

1769
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:02,620
Or you write the script for that Pinkerton beating up a union striker.

1770
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:03,980
Right. There's a joke.

1771
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:08,060
There's a joke about like there's a there's a little like warning sign.

1772
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:10,900
I think I think I believe I have this right for train sickness

1773
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:13,060
and warning you about train sickness.

1774
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:14,300
And it's just a goof.

1775
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,860
It's just a silly little thing.

1776
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:19,500
Some imagineers docked up to make like an old time like warning thing,

1777
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:22,380
warning sign. But there's just full of stuff like that.

1778
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:25,220
That might be real when trains were still invention.

1779
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:27,460
But there's some funny there's funny stuff.

1780
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:30,380
And if that and I'm sure people have gotten sick on a train before.

1781
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:33,860
But if indeed it is a thing, they were having fun with it like they

1782
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:35,300
you can just feel it.

1783
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:39,300
If you feel like a voice, you can feel like their voices in the land.

1784
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:41,220
And especially like New York land.

1785
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:43,300
So I got to stop and read every sign.

1786
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:45,060
Well, that's why. Yeah. Trouble.

1787
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:47,100
You got to do whatever you're doing days wise.

1788
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:48,340
And we don't know how many days.

1789
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:49,940
No. Yeah. Big reveal.

1790
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:51,980
Come on. You got to double it, I think.

1791
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:55,460
So if you decide to do four, now you're doing eight.

1792
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:58,820
God. I texted Aaron before this and she agreed with me.

1793
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:00,380
So she has already done it.

1794
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:02,940
Oh, no. We all see.

1795
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:05,380
Mike also runs his decisions by. Yeah.

1796
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:08,020
Guys, so you're not wrong.

1797
01:29:08,020 --> 01:29:10,300
Aaron runs her decisions by Mike.

1798
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:12,820
So basically, Mike is running all of our lives.

1799
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:16,220
And I ask Jason's ice cream wife to

1800
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:20,660
give me a final like declaration on any of these decisions,

1801
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:24,740
which means Mike's just constantly helping ice cream escape from my house.

1802
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:28,340
So I have a real parasitic relationship with him.

1803
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:29,780
You don't even like sweets.

1804
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:32,140
Mike just tricked you into liking it for his amusement.

1805
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:35,140
He tricked me into painting that white picket fence he got.

1806
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:37,340
Still mad about that. He said it was fun.

1807
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:42,100
It is fun. I also there's another fence I do have outside here

1808
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:44,740
that's actually a little bit more of a fun fence to paint.

1809
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:46,860
If you wouldn't mind.

1810
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:48,700
I just want you to try it out.

1811
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:49,660
But this one's fun.

1812
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:51,100
This was more fun than the other one.

1813
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:52,220
All right. That one was a bummer.

1814
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,060
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1815
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:55,140
OK, put your stuff down and we'll finish this while you go and.

1816
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,460
OK, well, I'll.

1817
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:57,420
Fun thing for me.

1818
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:58,860
Give me give me the other recorder.

1819
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:01,820
I'll do a second gate episode about painting the fence. OK.

1820
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,780
This is more fun than any ride.

1821
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:06,580
So let me dive in. It's like.

1822
01:30:06,580 --> 01:30:07,780
Hold on. Hold on.

1823
01:30:07,780 --> 01:30:10,060
Boy, I don't think I'm not exactly sure where it's going.

1824
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:11,180
So Tokyo Disney.

1825
01:30:11,180 --> 01:30:13,340
I mean, every spot you see it.

1826
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:15,340
Beautiful. Perfect.

1827
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:20,620
However, if we're taking the mountain out itself

1828
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:23,100
and comparing it to the fake rocks.

1829
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:26,540
So you take the fake rocks out and compare it to the other fake rocks.

1830
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:30,940
These in these rocks in Pandora are floating.

1831
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:33,580
You don't see them anywhere else.

1832
01:30:33,820 --> 01:30:35,020
They're cool.

1833
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:37,900
They they're they certainly are realistic.

1834
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:42,260
But this there's no fake rocks anywhere

1835
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:46,740
that are above your head like this, that if you're at the right angle are floating.

1836
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:51,900
I think just purely for that fact and for the innovation

1837
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:56,140
and for how unique they are, they beat Mount Prometheus.

1838
01:30:57,180 --> 01:31:00,140
Jason, whatever you have to say, just take take your time,

1839
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:03,940
because I need to I need to like think about this for another second.

1840
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:07,820
If you have any if you have any thoughts, because I'm like, this is a really tough one.

1841
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:10,180
I mean, I think it is unique.

1842
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:14,100
I, you know, to peel back the curtain a little bit, the support beams

1843
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:17,780
for holding up those fake rocks are like built into the giant vines

1844
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:20,900
sort of connecting them all,

1845
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:24,420
which is like, yeah, they really had to think outside of the box.

1846
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:28,060
James Cameron is very high standards, high expectations.

1847
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:31,660
So building these fake rocks, they were kind of dealing with that.

1848
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:35,700
Although that said, the Oriental Land Company also very high expectations.

1849
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:38,820
The Japanese people are very high expectations for their Disney parks.

1850
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:41,300
Yeah, I don't know.

1851
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:45,060
I mean, both are real hypothetical for me, but that floating

1852
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:47,780
might be the thing that tips it.

1853
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:51,580
And I also haven't seen Avatar.

1854
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:55,940
I don't think I've ever finished a Jules Verne book.

1855
01:31:55,940 --> 01:31:59,260
I think it's very funny that there's a whole generation of imagineers

1856
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:02,660
who are just tickled pink by Jules Verne, like

1857
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:07,260
well after he was dead.

1858
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:12,620
Once and once an artist dies, you have to disavow their work forever.

1859
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:14,260
They're dead. And so is there.

1860
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:16,100
But I think specific

1861
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:20,380
idiosyncratic to Jules Verne that he was like he was an originator of sci fi.

1862
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:24,260
But back then, like sci fi, everyone was still wearing high starched collars

1863
01:32:24,260 --> 01:32:26,420
and four different jackets at a time.

1864
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:30,020
But everyone's still amazed of like he thought he had the idea to

1865
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:33,420
shoot a gun at the moon.

1866
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:34,820
Yeah, that is cool.

1867
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:35,660
That is cool.

1868
01:32:35,660 --> 01:32:36,620
That's cool.

1869
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:40,900
You know, does James Cameron have that sort of thing?

1870
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:44,020
So you're now you're comparing Cameron to Verne,

1871
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:47,620
which is cool. Cameron might be our Jules Verne.

1872
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:51,180
He could be. I mean, and he actually he has these ideas.

1873
01:32:51,180 --> 01:32:55,260
And then sometimes he just goes and does them like by wetting a tiny can

1874
01:32:55,260 --> 01:32:56,380
to the bottom of the sea.

1875
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:59,380
He has his own Jules Verne submarine.

1876
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:03,020
Yeah. So we're going to be like there's going to be theme park attractions

1877
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:05,180
in 100 years where some actors playing.

1878
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:08,540
Why, I'm James Cameron.

1879
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:12,340
I know you're going to say there's 100 years there'll be podcaster attractions.

1880
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:14,140
It's like, oh, certainly, yes.

1881
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:16,220
Yeah. You'll be able to ride our logo.

1882
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:19,180
It'll be a functional ride. Yes.

1883
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:22,780
Yeah, I don't know.

1884
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:26,820
This is so, so close this round.

1885
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:30,820
This may not be the closest round, but we're stuck on it and avoiding.

1886
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:32,700
I think we need to keep moving.

1887
01:33:32,700 --> 01:33:35,980
And I think Mike has convinced me with that floating argument.

1888
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:40,020
So I'm going to lock in for Pandora.

1889
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:41,980
Yeah. I mean, I can't.

1890
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:44,620
I think this is a little

1891
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:47,020
I think it's a little insane that we're getting to the end.

1892
01:33:47,020 --> 01:33:49,860
And if Mount Prometheus and Expedition Everest are not

1893
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:52,980
this they have not made, I think that's bizarre.

1894
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:58,260
But you know what your initial it's Mount it's rocks, not mountains,

1895
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:01,500
Jason, which I think has been a lot of nice sayings

1896
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:02,380
that have come out of this.

1897
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:04,300
Sure. It's rocks, not mountains.

1898
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:07,580
It's about the it's about the rocks, not what the rocks are supporting.

1899
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:10,820
Yeah. So I have to

1900
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:12,940
I have to I have to agree with this philosophy.

1901
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:15,940
And yeah, just like literally the because like,

1902
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:18,820
I don't know.

1903
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:22,260
Maybe maybe maybe you have to call them different classifications in a way of

1904
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:24,300
is a volcano a rock?

1905
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:27,620
I guess so. I guess these are like several.

1906
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:31,740
These are like more distinctly a bunch of big rocks.

1907
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:34,100
Yeah. And the rocks are instantly iconic.

1908
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:35,340
They instantly take you to a place.

1909
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:38,540
It's a place that I want to go, even though I don't like the Avatar film

1910
01:34:38,820 --> 01:34:41,100
too much. But I would like to go there.

1911
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:43,500
I'd like to see that rock.

1912
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:46,900
I just quietly whispering.

1913
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:48,220
That's weird.

1914
01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:50,940
It's very funny.

1915
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:54,940
So am I the first maybe to have the opinion

1916
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:58,500
that Avatar is not the finest film in the history of man?

1917
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:00,340
I mean, everyone has an opinion about it.

1918
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:02,140
I sit down and watch that movie one of these days.

1919
01:35:02,820 --> 01:35:04,100
Have you not ever watched?

1920
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:09,580
You know what? I've seen a lot of clips on on in-store

1921
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:14,020
demo TVs and every I feel like every time I fly now,

1922
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:16,820
it's an option to watch on my iPad.

1923
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:20,940
And I just never want to make the whatever three hour commitment or whatever.

1924
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:22,820
And I know that it's not.

1925
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:24,460
It's so funny to see it that way.

1926
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:26,620
But Avatar, that's not a movie.

1927
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:28,180
We do have Repertory Cinema.

1928
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:30,580
We have the new Bev and the downtown independent.

1929
01:35:30,580 --> 01:35:33,260
We do have places that play

1930
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:37,780
older movies, but you don't see Avatar on that circuit very much.

1931
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:39,380
So I don't know. I'm kind of stuck.

1932
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:43,580
I think I just need to watch it on my normal 30 inch TV at some point,

1933
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:44,780
if I'm ever going to see it.

1934
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:47,420
That is how I ended up seeing it. Yeah.

1935
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:52,100
People who saw it in the perfect clarity are probably angry at this point.

1936
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:56,500
But hey, don't tell me what conditions I need to see a movie.

1937
01:35:56,500 --> 01:36:00,500
And it's also like I remember to think and like, what the fuck is going on?

1938
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:01,980
It's the height of the recession.

1939
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:06,220
And everyone's like, you got to pay the twenty five dollars to see it in IMAX,

1940
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:07,700
but three DI Max.

1941
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:10,300
And it's like, are you out of your fucking mind?

1942
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:12,540
Were you really upset about that?

1943
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:13,820
It was weird.

1944
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:18,140
It did seem like an out of like it seemed out of step with the culture

1945
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:20,780
at the time that you had to pay thirty dollars to see.

1946
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:22,940
You have to see this movie anyway.

1947
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:26,300
How's the job hunt coming? Like this is not something.

1948
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:29,340
I mean, I was not making any money in 2009.

1949
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:30,460
But I wasn't.

1950
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:33,780
I was like, oh, the filmmaker said it would be good to do it in the way

1951
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:35,180
he made the movie.

1952
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:38,180
It wasn't like, what a disgusting.

1953
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:41,420
Says like that is also a thing that every filmmaker says, like,

1954
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:42,980
well, you should see it in the theater.

1955
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:45,380
It's like, yeah, no shit. It's a movie.

1956
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:49,140
Like, I know you were so bothered by like Peter Jackson

1957
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:51,220
telling you to see something in like a different frame rate.

1958
01:36:53,620 --> 01:36:54,740
Does he say that?

1959
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:58,020
I don't have it was shot in what's what's the double forty eight.

1960
01:36:58,060 --> 01:36:59,300
Yeah, yeah.

1961
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:01,380
I did see that in his frame rate.

1962
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:03,020
And I mean, those were Peter.

1963
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:05,220
You'll listen to Peter Jackson, but not James Cameron.

1964
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:06,900
I don't know that you had an option.

1965
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:08,380
And there was a resumption.

1966
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:10,460
The economy was booming at that time.

1967
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:12,660
That is true. I did see all the hobbits.

1968
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:14,100
My family likes Tolkien.

1969
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:15,580
So that was I did see.

1970
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:18,300
I have seen all of those during the recession.

1971
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:21,660
You only went to you only did Nickelodeon's.

1972
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:23,900
You only went and all right into.

1973
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:30,260
I watched a great movie about a guy doing the wash.

1974
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:35,260
Maybe it was also the added caveat of like, if if if you can't see it

1975
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:36,900
that way, don't see it at all.

1976
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:39,980
And it's like, well, how's the script and how's the acting?

1977
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:43,540
Not a lot of people coming in hot for like, oh, the story is really good.

1978
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:45,940
The script's really good. The acting is really good.

1979
01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:48,780
The song and the credits is much better than My Heart Will Go On.

1980
01:37:49,060 --> 01:37:52,020
But you'd only know that if you heard it in the movie theater,

1981
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:55,460
if you did it on your on your iPod, you'd probably think it was worse.

1982
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:57,340
But you're wrong. The song is better.

1983
01:37:57,340 --> 01:37:59,700
The artist is an artist I can name.

1984
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:02,700
Yeah, there's like that's something.

1985
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:04,860
I mean, that's it. I kind of agreed with.

1986
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:07,940
I do think that is a very funny clip of David Lynch going like,

1987
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:11,620
you got to be a fucking idiot if you're going to watch a movie on your phone.

1988
01:38:11,620 --> 01:38:13,660
And like, that's pretty funny.

1989
01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:16,660
It seems like you just want it's coming from the right guy or girl.

1990
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:20,060
Maybe I did you see the hateful eight road show version?

1991
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:24,740
Did I? I saw it at the dome at the Arclight Dome.

1992
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:25,980
Was there like a road show?

1993
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:27,860
Sure was the overture and the intermission in it.

1994
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:29,460
And did you get a book like a book?

1995
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:32,300
I know. I don't think I saw that. I'm already tired.

1996
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:35,980
We I mean, I have we saw it in Burbank here a couple of years ago with the full

1997
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:39,100
intermission and that was like a night at the theater.

1998
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:40,220
I know it was fun.

1999
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:44,700
Mm hmm. I mean, I do have the movie bill for Mission Impossible

2000
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:46,860
Fallout. We got a program. We saw that.

2001
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:48,100
We saw that.

2002
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:50,180
Hardly. Yes. Christopher McCrory demand.

2003
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:52,020
We see that in a certain.

2004
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:57,020
No, no, no. We volunteered to see it in both IMAX and 40 and 40.

2005
01:38:57,340 --> 01:39:00,260
Yeah. Madness. Yeah.

2006
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:01,780
All right. We'll see. We'll end up spending.

2007
01:39:01,780 --> 01:39:04,580
We'll all end up spending it like personally.

2008
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:07,660
Two hundred and two dollars on the next Avatar.

2009
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:11,060
Oh, yeah, for sure. There's going to be like only one theater that is up

2010
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:13,140
to the standards of James Cameron.

2011
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:16,380
Well, we got to figure out who's bearing those seeds.

2012
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:18,780
Or who's in the water.

2013
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:21,500
James Cameron and Neil Young both love seeds.

2014
01:39:22,340 --> 01:39:24,540
For kind of thing about that.

2015
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:26,140
Neil Young should do a song.

2016
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:28,700
He's our new Jules Verne and our new Neil Young.

2017
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:32,340
Yeah, that'd be great if there was like a credit song for Avatar

2018
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:36,580
and Neil Young song about seeds, but he still tries to squeeze an anti

2019
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:38,700
Monsanto here. Oh, yeah.

2020
01:39:40,220 --> 01:39:43,260
The Monsanto years is one of his new album, newer albums.

2021
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:45,940
Really? I saw it bad.

2022
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:49,060
George Bush saw it. He just did the song. Let's impeach the president.

2023
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:51,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He he is.

2024
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:54,860
I saw him a couple of years ago and it was at the forum. This real quick.

2025
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:59,940
He came out. He played after the gold rush, which is maybe top

2026
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:03,100
10 songs in my mind of all time.

2027
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:05,180
He played Old Man.

2028
01:40:05,180 --> 01:40:08,980
He played, I think maybe, oh, love can break your heart.

2029
01:40:08,980 --> 01:40:10,100
No, maybe not that one.

2030
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:13,220
He played like five classics sounded amazing.

2031
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:15,460
Just him and the piano, him and the guitar.

2032
01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:18,860
And then all of a sudden he had theatrics

2033
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:22,540
and people in hazmat suits came out Starbucks.

2034
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:25,980
Doesn't he have like a Starbucks? He might make you go.

2035
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:29,140
That sounds crazy. But go to hell, Starbucks.

2036
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:32,540
Yeah. He then had theatrics and people came out in hazmat suits

2037
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:35,860
and like sprayed down the stage and it was an environmental message.

2038
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:40,380
And then he did a bit where like there was some law about like not being able

2039
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:42,900
to like distribute seeds in California.

2040
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:45,860
He's like, so we're going to be distributing seeds here tonight.

2041
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:49,700
And then like people came into the audience with like seeds.

2042
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:51,660
And I was like, what the hell is this?

2043
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:54,340
Whoa. People with baskets.

2044
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:56,380
It was the embarking for Neil, especially you.

2045
01:40:56,380 --> 01:41:00,780
You don't think of as like a theatrical guy always just looks like shit.

2046
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:03,820
Are they part of the crew or they like TaskRabbit people?

2047
01:41:03,860 --> 01:41:07,260
The seed people? No, I'm not sure if he was doing this at every stop.

2048
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:11,140
Who are the seed people? Yeah. What can we learn from them?

2049
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:15,860
But Neil, yeah, he did some theme park theatrics in the middle of this concert.

2050
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:18,540
Well, what did you do with your seeds? I didn't get any seeds.

2051
01:41:18,660 --> 01:41:21,500
I was in the pit and it was mostly up in the seat.

2052
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:22,700
People with the seats.

2053
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:25,300
OK, because it was harder for a person to go through the pit, probably.

2054
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:27,140
Oh, sure. All right.

2055
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:28,660
So let's close out.

2056
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:32,940
I feel like this is going to be another fast one as much as I stand for universal

2057
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:35,260
mythos versus ornament valley.

2058
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:38,340
Yeah, I can't. Yeah.

2059
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:39,940
Sorry. Sorry.

2060
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:42,100
I'm glad I'm really glad mythos made it.

2061
01:41:42,340 --> 01:41:45,940
Yeah, I am, too. But I think we have.

2062
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:49,940
I think we have a really good final four.

2063
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:50,980
I don't know.

2064
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:55,940
In the final four, no universal entries, all domestic.

2065
01:41:55,940 --> 01:41:58,540
You didn't make they they need to step up the fake rock.

2066
01:41:58,540 --> 01:42:00,460
I think that is the biggest thing they need to do.

2067
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:04,540
We'll see what happens in that fantastic worlds or maybe not,

2068
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:06,740
depending on what the lawyers say.

2069
01:42:06,740 --> 01:42:08,020
Fantastic World's Park.

2070
01:42:08,020 --> 01:42:12,700
Are there any prominent rocks in Nintendo like will Donkey Kong have good rocks,

2071
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:14,540
even though they're like our two blocks?

2072
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:18,820
Potentially. If they make the rumor was they were going to like demolish

2073
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:21,060
and maybe mythos to make Zelda.

2074
01:42:22,060 --> 01:42:23,380
Right. Isn't that the rumor?

2075
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:25,260
Or no, no, no, no, no, no.

2076
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:27,540
I think they would probably demolish the side.

2077
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:29,020
Yes. Sorry. It's over by there.

2078
01:42:29,020 --> 01:42:30,980
Not in the front of the park. OK.

2079
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:32,140
Yeah. So that's the rumor.

2080
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:36,140
So Zelda might have some great, great fake rocks if they do a full high rule area.

2081
01:42:36,180 --> 01:42:36,980
I hope so.

2082
01:42:36,980 --> 01:42:40,540
And especially Universal Hollywood could use some better fake rocks.

2083
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:42,580
Yeah, but that's very lacking in them. We'll see.

2084
01:42:42,860 --> 01:42:46,060
But with the but we oh my God, I think this is a great pairing

2085
01:42:46,060 --> 01:42:49,340
because it's kind of like traditional and original and yeah,

2086
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:52,220
old school imaginary versus new school.

2087
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:54,500
You know, I could not have planned this better.

2088
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:55,780
We ended up in a great place.

2089
01:42:55,780 --> 01:43:00,460
Just to say it, we will now be figuring out Matterhorn versus Big Thunder Mountain

2090
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:04,220
and Hallelujah Mountains versus Ornament Valley.

2091
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:07,020
That is pretty wild because, yeah, Hallelujah and Ornament Valley.

2092
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:11,460
Those are the two biggest, newest lands, themed lands

2093
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:13,340
that Disney has built domestically.

2094
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:17,540
And I like that old like like classic

2095
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:20,580
has to face off against classic and newest face off against new

2096
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:23,900
because one might trump the other just by being new.

2097
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:27,780
Yes, right. But it's but there will then be a showdown between old and new.

2098
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:29,420
I really like this.

2099
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:32,460
All right. So two classics here,

2100
01:43:33,460 --> 01:43:37,700
two titans of the Disneyland skyline.

2101
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:42,060
And I will say it is a boy like looking, looking out from the parking

2102
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:47,460
garage these days of now of the black spires, be they lyre trees or not.

2103
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:51,460
I'm being able to see Splash and Matterhorn and Big Thunder.

2104
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:55,620
It's just so that the mountain range is becoming more robust.

2105
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:57,580
Yeah, it is. It's great.

2106
01:43:57,580 --> 01:43:59,220
I'm very fond of both of these.

2107
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:03,260
And it's hard to make a decision where you you knock out one of them.

2108
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:06,500
OK, I've got an argument that I don't think has come up yet

2109
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:09,220
that might be able to help turn it.

2110
01:44:09,220 --> 01:44:12,580
What do you guys think it's easier to do when it comes to fake rocks?

2111
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:17,140
Paint them gray or paint them earth tone like orangey brown earth tone?

2112
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:20,420
Because that's a big deciding.

2113
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:22,420
There's a big distinction between these two.

2114
01:44:22,420 --> 01:44:25,300
My knee jerk is orangey earth.

2115
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:28,420
But why and why would gray be to you mean like

2116
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:29,700
simulating snow?

2117
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:30,820
What do you think?

2118
01:44:30,820 --> 01:44:36,980
Well, no, because I think the rocks are more more gray kind of rocks and the

2119
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:42,660
at the Matterhorn and Big Thunder is more orangey

2120
01:44:42,660 --> 01:44:45,860
like in the National Park kind of canyons and stuff.

2121
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:47,660
Why would one be harder?

2122
01:44:47,660 --> 01:44:50,740
I guess my question is just do you think one looks better?

2123
01:44:50,740 --> 01:44:52,900
Was one than the other? OK, it comes down to that.

2124
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:55,980
I think a lot of what's on our list has been more earth tone.

2125
01:44:56,380 --> 01:45:01,300
And for some reason, I think it's a little more difficult to to capture.

2126
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:03,060
I think there's more like

2127
01:45:03,940 --> 01:45:07,460
subtlety texture in the more the earth tone range.

2128
01:45:08,980 --> 01:45:11,980
Matterhorn, I don't think the word kitsch has come up yet,

2129
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:14,260
but Matterhorn has kitsch.

2130
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:16,260
You think so? Is that a good thing or bad thing?

2131
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:18,500
I think it's a good thing.

2132
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:22,540
I like it. I mean, it's it's everywhere in the shit we like.

2133
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:23,700
Kitsch is everywhere.

2134
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:29,100
And I will say that that is it's a kitschier look than all the other things,

2135
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:34,860
I think, on this list, maybe on the whole on almost all of the original 16.

2136
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:36,540
Yeah.

2137
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:40,500
Let me say this is very difficult.

2138
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:41,580
I used to you go ahead.

2139
01:45:41,580 --> 01:45:45,620
Well, let me say a couple nice things about the about the Matterhorn.

2140
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:48,940
Hey, it's the only it's the only one of these

2141
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:52,980
one only one of these fake rocks where there are real rock climbers.

2142
01:45:53,940 --> 01:45:54,900
That's that's true.

2143
01:45:54,900 --> 01:45:56,740
That's not a thing about it.

2144
01:45:56,740 --> 01:45:59,140
But I think it's what a nice little like,

2145
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:03,940
I don't know what a nice tribute to it. A treat.

2146
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:07,860
And then that it's it's realistic enough that

2147
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:10,500
people wanted to climb it like it was real.

2148
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:15,820
Remember back when the sky the skyway went through it also?

2149
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:18,260
Oh, yeah. Before either of our times,

2150
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:19,620
to be able to come out here.

2151
01:46:19,620 --> 01:46:23,180
But man, I always loved those kind of sky buckets.

2152
01:46:23,580 --> 01:46:25,580
Correct. OK, here, correct me if I'm wrong.

2153
01:46:25,580 --> 01:46:33,020
But Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is the pinnacle of a certain type of theme park rock.

2154
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:35,940
It doesn't get any better than that.

2155
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:40,140
Like at the like we've seen that we've seen it at nots.

2156
01:46:40,140 --> 01:46:41,540
We've seen it in other parks.

2157
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:43,540
We've seen it in other Disney parks.

2158
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:48,340
But it's sort of it's the it's iconic.

2159
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:52,540
It's obviously a little whimsical, like some of the different, you know, whatever we saw.

2160
01:46:52,540 --> 01:46:55,340
What did you say about the plops, the different plops?

2161
01:46:55,780 --> 01:46:57,540
I said they were like poops. Yeah.

2162
01:46:57,540 --> 01:47:00,380
So they're like a big stack of turds.

2163
01:47:00,380 --> 01:47:06,460
I think for me, just because it seems perfect,

2164
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:10,140
I guess I can't divorce completely the ride from my mind,

2165
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:12,020
because I think we called the ride perfect.

2166
01:47:12,020 --> 01:47:19,260
But I think probably of this type of rock, it's the perfect version of it.

2167
01:47:20,060 --> 01:47:26,340
So for my decision for being the pinnacle of this type of fake rock,

2168
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:31,060
I think I know Big Thunder Mountain is my choice.

2169
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:36,340
I'm going to throw a thing out, which is like

2170
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:40,580
I what holds up when you get when you get up close,

2171
01:47:40,580 --> 01:47:43,340
you know, we haven't talked about is touching these rocks.

2172
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:45,060
OK, that's all of them.

2173
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:47,900
Can you touch? And it's fun to touch them.

2174
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:52,180
It's fun whether you're a kid or a grownup, feel that that scaly texture.

2175
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:57,020
Some of them, some fake rocks, I think you touch and you feel the more

2176
01:47:57,020 --> 01:47:59,220
that they are metal, you feel the fakeness.

2177
01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:01,980
They certainly none of them feel like real rocks, because those would be

2178
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:03,340
those would be dusty.

2179
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:05,940
Those would have, you know, more of a coating.

2180
01:48:05,940 --> 01:48:07,780
And they don't they don't have that.

2181
01:48:07,780 --> 01:48:11,460
But just when you think about that cue at Big Thunder,

2182
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:16,980
how it's not just what what rises up and forms the Big Thunder skyline.

2183
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:20,420
It's also that you're winding around and into that town

2184
01:48:20,420 --> 01:48:22,580
and running your hand along all of those.

2185
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:27,300
Right. And if you like that, every every one of them has has character.

2186
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:32,860
If you know, it's weird as saying we're doing fake rocks.

2187
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:36,220
But these are some of these things are roller coasters with many rocks.

2188
01:48:36,220 --> 01:48:38,860
And some of them are one giant rock.

2189
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:40,860
It's a little weird to quantify.

2190
01:48:40,860 --> 01:48:45,100
But I think if we're grouping by attraction, there's so many unique,

2191
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:47,220
specific, fake rocks.

2192
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:49,020
Yeah. That's big thunder. Yep.

2193
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:51,580
And I would also say.

2194
01:48:51,580 --> 01:48:52,620
I don't know.

2195
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:56,380
I'm sure there's like a different, interesting way to make a big thunder.

2196
01:48:56,380 --> 01:48:59,940
I'm sure some new, young, innovative, innovative, innovating mind

2197
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:02,220
could come in and prove to me that this is a better way.

2198
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:04,900
And these are cooler fake rocks.

2199
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:07,180
I don't know. I can't imagine that.

2200
01:49:07,460 --> 01:49:12,780
I can imagine the kitschy, better 2019 version of the Matterhorn.

2201
01:49:13,060 --> 01:49:17,860
I can imagine a cartoonish mountain like that for the year 2019.

2202
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:21,660
It's not the pinnacle in my mind of kitschy mountains.

2203
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:24,140
I think you could do it better.

2204
01:49:24,140 --> 01:49:26,100
I know part of it is just because it's old.

2205
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:28,060
That's fun. And that's kitschy.

2206
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:32,580
But I could see a version that improves on the Matterhorn

2207
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:35,180
and keeps its cartoonish elements.

2208
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:39,660
Is it possible that within this and this might

2209
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:43,900
there's a phrase that I should I should throw in.

2210
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:48,420
Is it possible that within our decision making that there is a Baxter bias?

2211
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:51,980
I think that's definitely in play.

2212
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:57,020
Everybody, people listening know how we feel about Tony Baxter and his baby.

2213
01:49:57,060 --> 01:50:01,620
I listened to at 2 a.m. last night, just an old season pass episode,

2214
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:04,420
I think it was a part five interview with Tony Baxter

2215
01:50:04,700 --> 01:50:07,300
just because I needed to go to sleep and I needed a pleasant voice.

2216
01:50:08,300 --> 01:50:11,700
And I just wanted to hear him like describe like the Sleeping Beauty

2217
01:50:11,700 --> 01:50:14,020
ride that didn't get built or.

2218
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:15,820
Yeah, no good voice. That's true.

2219
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:19,620
His philosophy about lands and rides.

2220
01:50:19,620 --> 01:50:22,140
And he wins the voice competition. Yes, he does.

2221
01:50:22,340 --> 01:50:28,620
But like, does does our mythologizing of him color you of the actual?

2222
01:50:28,620 --> 01:50:29,700
And are we?

2223
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:31,660
Well, how is your vote going to go?

2224
01:50:32,660 --> 01:50:35,580
I don't really want to. I regard.

2225
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:40,020
I'm just wondering, do we like are we are we are we throwing

2226
01:50:40,260 --> 01:50:43,780
the problem is me off the cliff and what is it?

2227
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:45,980
He this was he wanted a rock.

2228
01:50:45,980 --> 01:50:50,140
He wanted a big mountain in his park and he pioneered this whole area.

2229
01:50:50,780 --> 01:50:54,580
I love it. But is against it like an insane, that insane,

2230
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:58,900
apocryphal story of him sending a postcard that just says, build this,

2231
01:50:59,340 --> 01:51:04,260
you know, but it's Louie Louie better than Golden Slumbers by the Beat.

2232
01:51:04,260 --> 01:51:05,340
Like, you know what I mean?

2233
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:09,580
Like, sure, that matter was first and Walt did something very crazy,

2234
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:10,900
cool and impressive.

2235
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:13,060
But we can't just go by the past.

2236
01:51:13,060 --> 01:51:14,940
We have to say we have to stack them up

2237
01:51:14,940 --> 01:51:17,620
unobjectively, take them out of the past.

2238
01:51:17,620 --> 01:51:21,300
Yeah. First of all, Louie Louie is definitely not better than Golden Slumbers.

2239
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:23,860
I agree. I'm just saying that was an earlier rock and roll song.

2240
01:51:23,860 --> 01:51:25,940
I understand. I say I should have picked.

2241
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:28,460
You know what? I should have picked something a little more innovative.

2242
01:51:28,460 --> 01:51:31,740
Well, I think this might be counter to your point,

2243
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:34,660
but I think rappers delight is still the best rap song.

2244
01:51:35,340 --> 01:51:37,300
It's all been downhill ever since then.

2245
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:41,100
And all of these swears and gang stories have gotten in the way

2246
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:43,660
of fun stories about trying to hide your food at your dinner.

2247
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:47,140
You know, you really got to you really got to every time rap

2248
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:51,540
comes up in your comedy, you just go off on that long rant like that.

2249
01:51:51,540 --> 01:51:52,820
You really got to open up.

2250
01:51:52,820 --> 01:51:55,060
Got it right the first time. OK.

2251
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:57,380
And we have just been treading water.

2252
01:51:57,380 --> 01:51:59,220
And then I'll talk about that for a little bit.

2253
01:51:59,220 --> 01:52:01,380
And then I'll do a kind of like my name is Scott.

2254
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:03,980
Well, that's you love the my name is black.

2255
01:52:03,980 --> 01:52:05,780
Yeah. Motif.

2256
01:52:05,780 --> 01:52:06,780
They they do.

2257
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:09,300
I wouldn't I wouldn't comment on it if they didn't do it.

2258
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:11,020
It wasn't right. Yeah.

2259
01:52:11,020 --> 01:52:14,060
These rappers punch a junk.

2260
01:52:14,180 --> 01:52:18,380
Uh, anyway, old conservative like Dean.

2261
01:52:21,380 --> 01:52:23,420
Like this is not nonsense.

2262
01:52:23,420 --> 01:52:26,380
They just talk over the music, not even music, you know,

2263
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:30,940
which is funny because now a lot of those old old rappers are rich

2264
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:33,340
and probably conservative and old. Yeah.

2265
01:52:34,700 --> 01:52:38,300
There is. There's no way to completely remove our biases.

2266
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:39,180
That's the problem.

2267
01:52:39,180 --> 01:52:41,420
So we have to try our best to do it.

2268
01:52:41,580 --> 01:52:44,860
And then ultimately, whatever is in there, whatever is baked into our brains,

2269
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:46,140
it's just there, I think.

2270
01:52:46,140 --> 01:52:50,700
But the maker of the of the rock, I think, is I think if some of these,

2271
01:52:51,180 --> 01:52:53,420
among other you associate with a person,

2272
01:52:54,620 --> 01:52:58,860
a specific person more than others, and that can be a cool facet to a fake rock.

2273
01:52:58,860 --> 01:53:03,180
Do I see Tony's smiling face as we round the bend a couple of times?

2274
01:53:03,180 --> 01:53:07,020
Yeah, of course, I see his face in all the rocks, but I can't not see it.

2275
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:09,020
I can't not see the man.

2276
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:14,700
And you just see stars on the Matterhorn because of the blood vessels

2277
01:53:14,700 --> 01:53:16,700
bursting in your eyes and skull.

2278
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:17,980
Yeah, it's a rat one.

2279
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:21,420
Me. Yeah. Well, just like in the next category, you know, you can't help

2280
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:24,300
but go on these rides and think about the directors of the films

2281
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:26,380
that they're based on, Avatar and Cars.

2282
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:31,100
You can't help but just see the smiling face of the directors.

2283
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:32,700
Smiling man. Nice way.

2284
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:34,860
And said, Joe, Rhodey's smiling face.

2285
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:37,740
I don't know. One round at a time.

2286
01:53:37,740 --> 01:53:39,020
OK, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2287
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:39,900
Let's go. Let's go back.

2288
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:42,460
I don't know. Do you have more?

2289
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:43,660
Do you have more to parse that?

2290
01:53:43,660 --> 01:53:46,780
I almost feel like I don't want all of these to be like I almost sometimes

2291
01:53:46,780 --> 01:53:48,220
I'm like, should we just both say it?

2292
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:51,980
You should say the same time, but maybe you haven't decided.

2293
01:53:51,980 --> 01:53:53,900
If you've decided you should say it at the same time.

2294
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:58,620
No, I'm stuck and I think I just need to make a decision and go go with it.

2295
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:00,460
OK, all right.

2296
01:54:00,460 --> 01:54:01,580
Let's do same time.

2297
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:02,220
All right.

2298
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:05,420
One, two, three, go after go.

2299
01:54:05,420 --> 01:54:08,140
Then you guys both say it at the same time.

2300
01:54:08,140 --> 01:54:09,820
I messed it up already unless you didn't hear me.

2301
01:54:09,820 --> 01:54:12,300
I can't. All right.

2302
01:54:12,300 --> 01:54:13,100
One, two, three, go.

2303
01:54:13,100 --> 01:54:14,540
And after go, then you say it.

2304
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:15,420
All right, here we go.

2305
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:16,940
One, two, three, go.

2306
01:54:16,940 --> 01:54:17,740
Big Thunder.

2307
01:54:17,740 --> 01:54:19,260
All right.

2308
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:20,780
We're friends again.

2309
01:54:20,780 --> 01:54:23,980
Mike's passion to argument about a certain type of rock.

2310
01:54:23,980 --> 01:54:26,380
And could we do Kitsch better now?

2311
01:54:26,380 --> 01:54:28,140
I mean, it was worth raising.

2312
01:54:28,140 --> 01:54:29,820
I mean, I think it's worth raising.

2313
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:33,820
I mean, it was worth raising, but I always knew.

2314
01:54:34,540 --> 01:54:38,700
And I'd be sad if Big Thunder wasn't still alive in this competition.

2315
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:41,980
This is a tough one, too.

2316
01:54:41,980 --> 01:54:48,220
I'm leaning towards Ornament Valley, I got to say, not just because it's the one I've seen in person.

2317
01:54:52,220 --> 01:54:54,220
Yeah, this is I don't want to just get air on that.

2318
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:56,220
Mike, forget about the mighty Akron.

2319
01:54:56,220 --> 01:54:58,380
Or it's hard to divorce.

2320
01:54:58,380 --> 01:54:59,020
Think about all that.

2321
01:54:59,020 --> 01:55:04,460
It's hard to divorce from Jake Solly and all of his travels and trials and tribulations.

2322
01:55:05,020 --> 01:55:06,860
But I will remove myself.

2323
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:09,740
I will move that part of my brain while I'm deciding this.

2324
01:55:10,860 --> 01:55:16,060
OK, Jake Solly, Johnny working class, Johnny Regula.

2325
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:21,260
There are so many fake rocks in Ornament Valley.

2326
01:55:22,140 --> 01:55:30,140
So like you could almost say it's just the thing that you're at, the big like trapezoid that you

2327
01:55:30,140 --> 01:55:32,380
go that you round the band on.

2328
01:55:32,380 --> 01:55:33,900
You could just do the back wall.

2329
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:35,980
You could.

2330
01:55:35,980 --> 01:55:37,500
I feel like I'm forgetting one.

2331
01:55:39,580 --> 01:55:42,220
Yeah, there's a lot of good specific.

2332
01:55:42,220 --> 01:55:44,860
There's like there's the waterfall when you're around the bend.

2333
01:55:46,220 --> 01:55:50,300
And there's the Cadillacs, the Cadillac range.

2334
01:55:50,380 --> 01:55:53,660
The Cadillac range is so and that's a very good character.

2335
01:55:53,660 --> 01:55:55,340
That's a little character in there.

2336
01:55:56,300 --> 01:55:58,780
And the arch that you go through from.

2337
01:55:58,780 --> 01:56:00,060
Yes, yes, of course.

2338
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:02,380
So here's so I'm thinking because this is what I'm thinking.

2339
01:56:02,380 --> 01:56:06,540
I go, OK, if Halou Yamans beat Mount Prometheus, would Mount Prometheus versus

2340
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:09,340
Ornament Valley, would I say Ornament Valley beats it?

2341
01:56:09,340 --> 01:56:10,860
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

2342
01:56:10,860 --> 01:56:16,540
And I will go back to my original argument that Mount Prometheus, beautiful, is also dressed up

2343
01:56:16,540 --> 01:56:18,940
by the most beautiful theme park in the world.

2344
01:56:18,940 --> 01:56:21,100
Everything around it is amazing.

2345
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:22,540
All of the views are perfect.

2346
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:26,620
When we're talking about Ornament Valley, it's just Ornament Valley.

2347
01:56:26,620 --> 01:56:29,260
There's nothing around it, plussing it up.

2348
01:56:29,260 --> 01:56:33,180
It's just when we're looking at it, we're just looking at this massive structure,

2349
01:56:33,180 --> 01:56:34,940
these massive fake rocks that they built.

2350
01:56:35,660 --> 01:56:36,540
I'm saying there's nothing.

2351
01:56:36,540 --> 01:56:39,420
You're saying it's that's a positive because it stands on its own.

2352
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:40,540
Yes, it stands on its own.

2353
01:56:40,540 --> 01:56:45,820
All we're assessing is Ornament Valley, whereas Mount Prometheus, it's almost impossible to

2354
01:56:45,820 --> 01:56:47,900
divorce it from the rest of the park in my mind.

2355
01:56:48,460 --> 01:56:51,420
So does that continue to Pandora?

2356
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:53,660
Because that's in a very beautiful park as well.

2357
01:56:53,660 --> 01:56:54,140
It is.

2358
01:56:54,140 --> 01:57:01,260
But as I said before, I was a bit underwhelmed for just sort of the placement.

2359
01:57:01,260 --> 01:57:06,060
Like when you walk in, it's not sort of the wow you get from Cars Land, either entrance.

2360
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:06,860
It's cool.

2361
01:57:06,860 --> 01:57:11,260
I would argue that sort of the best place to be in Pandora is sort of under the

2362
01:57:11,260 --> 01:57:14,620
under the mountains and then in the queue for Flight of Passage.

2363
01:57:14,620 --> 01:57:16,940
That to me is sort of the most special part of it.

2364
01:57:17,900 --> 01:57:20,300
And it's great fake rock stuff.

2365
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:26,860
But if you're over by the Saul's Canteen, not as beautiful of a view when you enter the land.

2366
01:57:26,860 --> 01:57:28,460
Not as beautiful either entrance.

2367
01:57:28,460 --> 01:57:28,940
The second entrance.

2368
01:57:28,940 --> 01:57:29,820
Saul's Canteen?

2369
01:57:29,820 --> 01:57:30,380
Whatever it's called.

2370
01:57:30,380 --> 01:57:30,940
So Tully.

2371
01:57:31,660 --> 01:57:33,340
I always call it Saul's Canteen.

2372
01:57:33,340 --> 01:57:34,380
Yeah, that's embarrassing.

2373
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:35,100
Come on down to Saul's Canteen.

2374
01:57:35,100 --> 01:57:38,060
That's embarrassing for a big Pandora head like me.

2375
01:57:39,260 --> 01:57:41,900
But look, my brain is fried from this too.

2376
01:57:41,900 --> 01:57:43,500
So please forgive me.

2377
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:48,540
So that being said, I think I have to give it to Ornament Valley.

2378
01:57:48,540 --> 01:57:50,700
I want to live in Ornament Valley.

2379
01:57:50,700 --> 01:57:51,020
Yes.

2380
01:57:51,020 --> 01:57:51,420
Yeah.

2381
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:51,740
Yeah.

2382
01:57:51,740 --> 01:57:54,700
Like that's a beautiful place to live.

2383
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:56,060
Yeah.

2384
01:57:56,060 --> 01:57:58,940
And that may be more than almost anything else on this list.

2385
01:57:59,660 --> 01:58:03,100
I'm trying to look and see if there's another place I would want to live.

2386
01:58:03,980 --> 01:58:05,820
I mean, I want to live all of these places, but.

2387
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:07,500
That's a good question.

2388
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:08,380
Ornament Valley.

2389
01:58:08,380 --> 01:58:10,380
I want to live on the top of the Matterhorn.

2390
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:11,580
Hogwarts, I guess.

2391
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:17,100
But there's always like, what if you just wanted to go to school?

2392
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:21,020
Like, what if you just want to get your degree and didn't want to deal with all this

2393
01:58:21,020 --> 01:58:24,780
fucking adventures and there's Nazi wizards outside and people keep dying?

2394
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:28,940
Like, what if you're just like, I just want to get a degree and work a job.

2395
01:58:28,940 --> 01:58:29,580
It depends, though.

2396
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:32,620
There's got to be there were like peaceful decades at Hogwarts, right?

2397
01:58:32,620 --> 01:58:33,180
I presume.

2398
01:58:33,180 --> 01:58:35,820
There wasn't a Voldemort kind of hanging around.

2399
01:58:35,820 --> 01:58:36,460
I don't know.

2400
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:36,940
I guess.

2401
01:58:36,940 --> 01:58:38,300
Yeah, I guess that's accurate.

2402
01:58:38,300 --> 01:58:39,980
I assume, though, that maybe we would.

2403
01:58:39,980 --> 01:58:40,860
Times a piece.

2404
01:58:40,860 --> 01:58:42,700
Yeah, we just saw a tumultuous period of it.

2405
01:58:42,700 --> 01:58:44,780
But then all the mischief.

2406
01:58:44,780 --> 01:58:46,620
I bet the mischief never went away.

2407
01:58:47,340 --> 01:58:48,460
There was always mischief.

2408
01:58:48,460 --> 01:58:51,660
There was always whimsical English English mischief.

2409
01:58:51,660 --> 01:58:55,180
And since it is a British boarding school, something a lot more sinister,

2410
01:58:55,180 --> 01:58:56,620
probably under the surface, too.

2411
01:58:56,620 --> 01:58:57,660
But let's move on from that.

2412
01:58:57,660 --> 01:58:58,140
Yeah, sure.

2413
01:58:59,180 --> 01:59:01,740
So I hate to vote orally again.

2414
01:59:02,540 --> 01:59:03,980
No, that's no, that's where I was heading.

2415
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:05,500
But it's Ornament Valley.

2416
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:06,000
Yeah.

2417
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:12,080
You know, hey, let me throw in the alcohol argument.

2418
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:17,920
The ability to, you know, hey, this is unfair to Big Thunder or other things.

2419
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:24,880
And I can't enjoy, it's a crime that I can't enjoy a big old beer in the line for Big Thunder.

2420
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:26,400
I can in Ornament Valley.

2421
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:31,840
And it's one of my favorite places to have a beer in the world.

2422
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:36,800
It makes that single rider go by so fast and so smooth.

2423
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:40,560
It's already a fast single rider.

2424
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:42,240
So you must be spilling it out.

2425
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:45,600
Oh, there's times where, you know, I've had like 45 minutes.

2426
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:46,720
Oh, it's long.

2427
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:48,720
Hanging out there with Erin.

2428
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:53,280
And we've had good deep conversations and just getting lulled into it.

2429
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:53,760
Yeah, yeah.

2430
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:55,680
It's real nice.

2431
01:59:55,680 --> 01:59:57,520
And yeah, she's, you know.

2432
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:58,800
Patio flows.

2433
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:03,360
Yeah, if you want to really leisure, you drink the beer on the patio flows looking at the valley.

2434
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:04,640
I guess.

2435
02:00:04,640 --> 02:00:05,120
I don't know.

2436
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:05,920
I want to be in it.

2437
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:08,880
I want it to envelop me.

2438
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,920
And I like a good amber.

2439
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:17,600
I like more like red beer there to match the red hue of the valley.

2440
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:23,120
And especially if I like to, I don't buy, I buy a beer in the, in Pacific War from Karl

2441
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:26,400
Stress and then walk that through the arch, get in the line that way.

2442
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:27,520
The more scenic route.

2443
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:31,680
That's that's that's maybe the best way to drink in the park.

2444
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:36,000
And what I do when I drink in Cars Land is go to one of the cones,

2445
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:39,600
one of the big cones and get the vodka lemonade.

2446
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:44,080
And there is an amazing sugar like cream they put on top of it.

2447
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:44,960
You know, that is good.

2448
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:47,040
Yeah, it's really good.

2449
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:48,480
And it's not even that overwhelming.

2450
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:51,120
It's like a subtle sugar cream, believe it or not.

2451
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:54,880
And I like getting that and going into the line for Cars Land.

2452
02:00:55,680 --> 02:00:58,320
That is I like this is the only place I found this.

2453
02:00:58,320 --> 02:00:59,600
And maybe it was just one person.

2454
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:01,200
Maybe if I go back, they won't do it.

2455
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:07,680
If you get the soft serve in the cup at the cozy cone, they will do the dip.

2456
02:01:07,680 --> 02:01:08,960
They will dip the cup.

2457
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:14,080
And what happens with that, if you dip the soft serve in the cup, then when the ice cream,

2458
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:18,400
then when the chocolate hardens and starts breaking off, it just goes into the cup.

2459
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:21,680
So then you got all this chocolate at the end with the cone.

2460
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:23,280
It's a race against time.

2461
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:26,720
But they thought I was crazy when I asked for that at one of the other places.

2462
02:01:26,720 --> 02:01:29,280
Now, I'll say that last sentence in Peter Laurie's voice.

2463
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,200
They thought I was crazy.

2464
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:33,680
It's one of the other say they all thought I was crazy.

2465
02:01:33,680 --> 02:01:34,720
They thought I was crazy.

2466
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,560
A cop is mad, they say.

2467
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:44,080
I like we all I mean, we all just said something that we should all repeat in Peter

2468
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:48,640
Laurie's voice because we're all maniacs who are like, yeah, then we get a beer and then we go

2469
02:01:48,640 --> 02:01:50,960
in the line and we relax.

2470
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:52,640
I had a single beer.

2471
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:54,240
I must be mad.

2472
02:01:55,280 --> 02:02:00,720
But like I'm just saying drinking by the fake rocks and imagining it's all well in that we,

2473
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:05,360
if you listen to the full two hours leading up to this point, only that was the craziest.

2474
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:10,880
That is a perfect gradient, though, from me, me, me, pure alcohol, you, alcohol with a lot of sugar

2475
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:12,080
and Jason, pure sugar.

2476
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:17,840
That kind of describes the types of the transition like the much like I was going to say,

2477
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:21,280
like the rocks in ornamental valley.

2478
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:22,320
Well, it's not ornamental.

2479
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:23,840
It's not an ornamental valley.

2480
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:24,400
Oh, God.

2481
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:26,400
Ornament valley.

2482
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:28,400
I'm doing this for too long.

2483
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:30,560
So we got to final two.

2484
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:31,040
Final two.

2485
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:32,240
I love the final two.

2486
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:36,880
I don't think like a not worthy one snuck in.

2487
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:37,280
Yeah.

2488
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:40,640
And there's not one in the back that I'm wishing was in there.

2489
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:44,240
Maybe some people listening feel a different way, but let us know.

2490
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:46,400
Hashtag PTRF for four.

2491
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:48,800
But I love what's in here.

2492
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:51,120
And we're we're very southwest, aren't we?

2493
02:02:51,120 --> 02:02:57,360
We're very because the various there's I forget which is which, but there's a big thunder that

2494
02:02:57,360 --> 02:03:01,600
is Bryce Canyon and there's a big thunder that's Zion and then ornament valley is very

2495
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:08,640
California off road or like Route 66, like between cities and roadside attractions.

2496
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:11,280
So we're covering the southwest.

2497
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:12,640
They're similar types.

2498
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:14,160
It's funny that we landed.

2499
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:21,040
And you know what I think is it's probably not an accident because it's very warm colors

2500
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:27,760
earthy colors back down towards the base camp in the beginning 16, but they're a little more

2501
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:28,640
unfriendly.

2502
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:34,400
Maybe you don't want to reward like lava rocks or like scary rocks.

2503
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:40,160
I think that the like not even realizing the pleasantness of both of these rocks.

2504
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:40,640
Yeah.

2505
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:42,240
Overruled everything else.

2506
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:47,680
Maybe a darker person would have picked darker rocks, but these are all these are joys to hang

2507
02:03:47,680 --> 02:03:48,240
out in.

2508
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:56,560
I also know while while you can't enjoy a beer in this line, not a bad place to hang out.

2509
02:03:57,200 --> 02:04:03,600
Big Thunder is a place where I'll do a standby line that is a little longer because you get to

2510
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:05,520
and I think it is the rocks.

2511
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:07,440
That's my rule with with the lines.

2512
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:09,680
If I can hang out with a bunch of rocks, I'm great.

2513
02:04:09,680 --> 02:04:12,560
But if I'm in some boring building, I'm upset.

2514
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:14,960
It also moves that line moves.

2515
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:15,360
It does.

2516
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:19,280
It always has views, different perspectives, maybe a little less.

2517
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:20,400
It's a little more claustrophobic.

2518
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:24,240
The line for radiator strings, but I don't know.

2519
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:31,760
But you do get different vantage points and sort of see more as you nestle into the attraction.

2520
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:35,920
Here's something to talk about.

2521
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:43,600
There's multiple specific landmarks in both of these in the final two.

2522
02:04:44,080 --> 02:04:46,720
Say like, what's your favorite rock?

2523
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:48,000
Maybe that would help tilt it.

2524
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:48,720
That's a good point.

2525
02:04:50,080 --> 02:04:51,120
My favorite rock.

2526
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:53,040
I'll go first.

2527
02:04:54,080 --> 02:04:58,880
While you're tempted to just say like it's the tall rock and Big Thunder,

2528
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:03,680
you know what's real nice is that that kind of overhang with the dinosaur bones.

2529
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:04,160
Oh, yeah.

2530
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:09,040
I guess that's cool because the dinosaur bones, but you got to give credit to the rocks for

2531
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:13,040
supporting the yes, but it's not about what's supporting.

2532
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:18,640
I think like the big choice for me might be that sort of like speed,

2533
02:05:18,640 --> 02:05:23,680
whatever you call that in a car, the like the ornament in the center of ornament valley.

2534
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:30,480
But in terms of like subtlety, I really like the yeah, where you can see the different

2535
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:36,000
gradients as if time has passed, time or water has passed on the walls.

2536
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:38,320
Yeah, that's beautiful.

2537
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:44,320
I mean, nighttime, nighttime on both these rides are great, but it's I don't know.

2538
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:45,360
It's so hard.

2539
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:52,720
I mean, I know it's so easy to go the new one with all the new stuff, but yeah,

2540
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:53,200
I don't know.

2541
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:55,120
I think I'm leaning towards ornament valley.

2542
02:05:57,600 --> 02:06:06,400
Yeah, I'm trying to like favorite the rocks are so like I'm trying to think of other than that.

2543
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:07,600
Yeah, the big famous one.

2544
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:09,520
What's my favorite favorite on Big Thunder?

2545
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:15,520
I think yeah, there's so many is the goat standing on a rock or is he standing on a crate?

2546
02:06:17,680 --> 02:06:18,320
I don't think I know.

2547
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:19,120
I'm a fan of Jason.

2548
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:19,600
Do you know this?

2549
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:22,320
No, let me see here.

2550
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:25,920
He's on a rock.

2551
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:26,400
Okay.

2552
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:27,040
Yeah.

2553
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:29,280
And he's on a cool ish, a cool rock.

2554
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:31,520
Yeah, nice little nice little stump.

2555
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:35,760
Hey, the fact that they brought think about this, the fact that they brought

2556
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:40,720
beloved property Star Wars into the parks and they had to think about how to like we

2557
02:06:40,720 --> 02:06:45,760
have to make this perfectly Nestle next to this Disneyland stalwart.

2558
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:49,680
We have to like build an in between of of Big Thunder.

2559
02:06:49,680 --> 02:06:53,920
We're tying together the mythology of Big Thunder Mountain and Star Wars.

2560
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:55,120
They are says something.

2561
02:06:55,120 --> 02:07:00,960
Yes, they were for sure when they were making this like those black spires mirror Big Thunder

2562
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:03,920
because they didn't want to ruin the skyline.

2563
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:08,480
It doesn't matter at Hollywood studios because no one gives a shit, but they were very specific

2564
02:07:08,480 --> 02:07:13,040
to be like, we want to make sure this sort of fits in when you're like looking far back

2565
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:16,080
that if you're just sort of seeing Big Thunder and Black Spire, you go,

2566
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:18,960
maybe those are all sort of the same thing.

2567
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:22,960
So you could say Black Spire is sort of like a tribute in a weird way.

2568
02:07:23,680 --> 02:07:25,440
I mean, would it have that?

2569
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:28,640
Would it have the mountain range if not for what was going to go?

2570
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:33,200
It might not even be called Black Spire outpost because obviously the spires are

2571
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:37,120
the iconic thing, but they needed to put those spires there.

2572
02:07:37,120 --> 02:07:42,160
I think if they were going to build something that massive to make it sort of fit when you're

2573
02:07:42,160 --> 02:07:45,440
looking at the Disneyland skyline, anything for Florida.

2574
02:07:46,240 --> 02:07:48,720
No, no, because they're just it's a big empty area.

2575
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:50,560
Yeah, it's next to the Muppet thing.

2576
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:51,920
Yeah, paint the Muppets off.

2577
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:53,920
Just paint the Muppet stuff people like.

2578
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:58,560
I think you guys should take into account.

2579
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:02,480
I think I think you should look at if you haven't already look at Big Thunder Paris.

2580
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:08,400
Oh, oh, oh, because it's bigger, it's grander, it replaces Tom Sawyer Island.

2581
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:14,960
You're more in and out like this bigger show scenes, you're inside tunnels for longer.

2582
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:21,280
It's it's it's something if we're if we're struggling to make Big Thunder seem grandiose

2583
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:25,840
next to the pure size of Radiator Springs, Paris might do it.

2584
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:27,120
That feel like tricks, though.

2585
02:08:27,680 --> 02:08:28,720
Oh, it's an island.

2586
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:29,680
Oh, it's real big.

2587
02:08:29,680 --> 02:08:30,800
Oh, it replaces this.

2588
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:32,640
Doesn't that feel like a cheat code?

2589
02:08:32,640 --> 02:08:35,600
You can say that's not part of the decision, I guess.

2590
02:08:35,600 --> 02:08:38,240
But I don't know that it's a I don't think the fact that it's not.

2591
02:08:38,240 --> 02:08:41,520
I just think the actual like look at look at this version.

2592
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:46,800
It's just like a it's a more grand version and probably one of the most successful

2593
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:51,200
upgrades in a way that happened in Disneyland Paris.

2594
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:54,560
Yeah, I mean, that's neat.

2595
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:59,760
But like but we're in a valley as like two of the greatest eyelines like ever,

2596
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:06,080
like not just the one coming through the town, like and in the background of the town.

2597
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:08,560
It's got the back entrance.

2598
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:09,920
So difficult.

2599
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:15,360
Every view when you're on the ride itself, you wish you could be snapping photos the

2600
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:21,840
whole time, but it's going too fast when you go in with that final drop down like under a big rock.

2601
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:28,800
The big straightaway, the views are so grand where you curve into the rocks.

2602
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:29,440
Yeah.

2603
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:30,160
Yeah.

2604
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:32,320
Oh, yeah, this sucks.

2605
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:33,360
This decision sucks.

2606
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:34,400
I'm going to lock it in.

2607
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:36,400
I think I'm locking in my vote for ornament Valley.

2608
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:37,200
Hang on one minute.

2609
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:37,920
I mean, do that.

2610
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:39,280
Feel free to do it.

2611
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:43,040
I'm actually I'm going to I'm going to throw a little diss at Ornament Valley.

2612
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:44,720
OK, go ahead and see if that changes.

2613
02:09:44,720 --> 02:09:45,600
Does this ring a bell?

2614
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:47,120
Really likes Tony Baxter.

2615
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:52,000
It's that yes, Tony didn't build the other one.

2616
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:52,240
No.

2617
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,960
OK, it's a it's a space issue, right?

2618
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:01,520
That ride is so backed up right to Cotella.

2619
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:02,000
Yes, it is.

2620
02:10:03,200 --> 02:10:09,120
And the very back wall where it's sort of the rocks are a little more faded to make it look

2621
02:10:09,120 --> 02:10:10,000
a little more distant.

2622
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:17,280
I feel the flatness of the of the like like what you know is right against the street.

2623
02:10:17,280 --> 02:10:18,720
Does this sound familiar to anybody?

2624
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:23,600
You're talking about the ones that look like the the the the back of a car.

2625
02:10:23,600 --> 02:10:24,560
Yeah, the Cadillac.

2626
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:30,960
I you know, I you're saying that doesn't have the dimension.

2627
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:32,160
I agree doesn't have the dimension.

2628
02:10:32,160 --> 02:10:36,720
I think they did a good job like facadeing it, like making it look like it has shape

2629
02:10:36,720 --> 02:10:37,440
and depth.

2630
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:37,680
Right.

2631
02:10:37,680 --> 02:10:40,880
I think it's I mean, it's it's remarkable, but we're being picky here.

2632
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:42,320
This is the final round.

2633
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:44,720
Yeah, that's something that was in my back pocket.

2634
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:46,080
Like, is that a tie?

2635
02:10:46,080 --> 02:10:48,400
I think the novelty tops it.

2636
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:49,840
I think the novelty.

2637
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:51,200
That's a fair argument.

2638
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:56,160
I don't think the I don't think I I don't think about Catella being right there,

2639
02:10:56,800 --> 02:11:00,640
but I know what you're saying that it doesn't have a tremendous amount of dimension.

2640
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:05,040
If you can, my phone is far away from you, but this is what I'm talking about.

2641
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:08,480
Like, just can you look at that and feel or maybe you can't?

2642
02:11:08,480 --> 02:11:11,280
Well, that's a that is a particularly bad picture of it.

2643
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:12,480
Well, that's what I was trying to find.

2644
02:11:12,480 --> 02:11:16,480
Because as you get a bad, I'm not going to show you the nicest photo.

2645
02:11:16,480 --> 02:11:20,160
But I think that's one of the best parts of it.

2646
02:11:20,160 --> 02:11:22,480
Is the fact that it is different?

2647
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:24,800
No, that that is like such a distinct thing.

2648
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:27,120
I think regular people go like, oh, yeah, that's awesome.

2649
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:28,800
Like the band like a Cadillac.

2650
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:32,320
I think that that novelty outweighs what is the thing about it?

2651
02:11:32,320 --> 02:11:37,760
It's really it is like it's five Cadillac what hood ornaments?

2652
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:40,240
The tail.

2653
02:11:40,240 --> 02:11:40,740
Yeah.

2654
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:45,760
And it's like they represent all different years of classic.

2655
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:50,080
I just want to like this is this is a very specific facet.

2656
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:51,520
I would like to get it right.

2657
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:53,920
Yeah, I don't know.

2658
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:57,520
That's that is the code, the Cadillac range.

2659
02:11:57,520 --> 02:12:04,640
OK, and they all represent different years of that's that's cool to use rocks.

2660
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:06,560
You know what, Mike, you're talking character.

2661
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:08,880
Yeah, we're not sure that it's a word.

2662
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:12,560
You know, you can maybe grizzlies to.

2663
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:16,160
Maybe grizzlies to there.

2664
02:12:16,160 --> 02:12:17,520
Maybe they're too subtle with the grid.

2665
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:22,400
This is like a subtle aspect of that back wall that if you know it, you know it.

2666
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:24,240
And if not, they just look like the rocks.

2667
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:26,000
I have a long Easter egg.

2668
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,440
I will say I started this.

2669
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:29,360
I was sure I was going to vote one way.

2670
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:31,840
And then I switched in my head of like, no, you know what?

2671
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:33,040
I think I'm voting the other way.

2672
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:35,920
And now I think I'm voting back the first way.

2673
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:36,640
Oh, boy.

2674
02:12:36,640 --> 02:12:40,960
I've gone like it's been a roller coaster in my head is what I'm saying.

2675
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:41,840
And I'm still not sure.

2676
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:44,400
But this is Jason.

2677
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:45,120
You're locked in.

2678
02:12:45,120 --> 02:12:46,000
You're locked in for sure.

2679
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:46,480
Ornament.

2680
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:47,520
I'm going to lock it in.

2681
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:50,080
Yeah, Scott, are you locked in in your head?

2682
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:53,760
I feel like you are.

2683
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:54,240
Yeah.

2684
02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:55,200
Yeah, I feel like you are.

2685
02:12:55,200 --> 02:12:56,400
I feel like you are.

2686
02:12:56,400 --> 02:12:58,000
I think I think so.

2687
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:59,680
So Scott, just say it.

2688
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:01,040
I'm not locked in.

2689
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:02,240
Oh, wait a minute.

2690
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:04,320
But maybe we both need to make a decision.

2691
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:05,840
Maybe you can't be in a time breaker.

2692
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:06,960
This makes it interesting.

2693
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:10,640
I think here's I think I think insist that we both say it at the same time.

2694
02:13:10,640 --> 02:13:12,320
If you're going to vote the same as Jason.

2695
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:14,160
And if you're not, say it now.

2696
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:17,120
I got lost in there.

2697
02:13:17,120 --> 02:13:20,640
So if you're going to vote with the ornament valley, just say it.

2698
02:13:20,640 --> 02:13:22,560
Because then it wins.

2699
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:23,280
It's over.

2700
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:26,400
But if you're going to vote against Jason and it's going to break it down to me,

2701
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:27,520
then we increase the tension.

2702
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:32,000
Maybe you just maybe you just need to make a decision without me.

2703
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:32,560
That's fine.

2704
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:37,440
I'm just saying if you know, you can just end it or you can increase the tension.

2705
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:40,560
I think you I well, I think the best way to increase the tension is for you to

2706
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:45,440
go. Well, I just have to figure out that the best way would be for one of you to

2707
02:13:45,440 --> 02:13:46,800
go because I'm getting hungry.

2708
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:50,320
The tension inside your stomach is growing.

2709
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:53,360
Yes. I mean, OK, I guess I can decide here.

2710
02:13:55,440 --> 02:14:02,880
I think when you're divorcing yourself from all of it, the history, who made it,

2711
02:14:03,600 --> 02:14:06,080
the ride itself, they're both great rides.

2712
02:14:06,240 --> 02:14:16,560
I think I'm going to say just because of that goddamn second entrance ornament valley.

2713
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:19,040
I am also going with ornament.

2714
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:25,760
And when's wow ornament valley is taking the final round.

2715
02:14:25,760 --> 02:14:26,400
Incredible.

2716
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:28,240
I thought exciting upset.

2717
02:14:28,240 --> 02:14:32,000
I thought for sure Big Thunder was going to win when we were going into the round.

2718
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:36,000
I thought about it because I was trying not to think about it to get to the final round.

2719
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:41,760
And I think if you think about it, it was a good idea to just get some discovery.

2720
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:45,360
No, we needed to we needed to delay it.

2721
02:14:45,360 --> 02:14:47,840
But yeah, I know it's weirdly.

2722
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:49,520
It's not even the dead center of it.

2723
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:50,320
It's the arch.

2724
02:14:50,320 --> 02:14:51,120
It's the arch.

2725
02:14:51,120 --> 02:14:51,760
It's the arch.

2726
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:54,400
The many layers of rocks behind it.

2727
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:59,840
It's that's like got to be one of the most Instagram locations I don't know offhand,

2728
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:02,320
but in my who I follow on Instagram.

2729
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:03,200
Yeah, for sure.

2730
02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:06,480
California Adventure, the landmark that it needed.

2731
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:14,160
I think it saved California Adventure in a way it went so far beyond a film that a lot of us

2732
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:15,280
don't really care about.

2733
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:15,920
That's true.

2734
02:15:15,920 --> 02:15:16,960
Made by a pervert.

2735
02:15:21,360 --> 02:15:21,760
Correct.

2736
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:25,200
It's just transcended pervert.

2737
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:29,760
Um, it's a, it's had so many calling this an underdog somehow.

2738
02:15:30,640 --> 02:15:32,880
Yeah, this is very expensive.

2739
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:34,960
Theme park ride is the ultimate underdog.

2740
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:38,720
Yeah, it seems like it though, when you think about the other famous mountains,

2741
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:42,640
because it's not sort of talked about in the same breath as they are.

2742
02:15:42,640 --> 02:15:44,080
It's not a mountain.

2743
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:45,200
This goes back to Jason's point.

2744
02:15:45,200 --> 02:15:46,960
I keep forgetting rocks first.

2745
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:47,440
My brain.

2746
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:50,320
And a young buck young 2012, right?

2747
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:51,440
Yeah, yeah.

2748
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:56,560
Yeah, new on the scene, but not but like clearly it feels like it was always there.

2749
02:15:56,560 --> 02:15:58,880
You can't even imagine the park without it.

2750
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:02,320
And not even just because the ride is so good.

2751
02:16:02,320 --> 02:16:07,520
I really think that it added what California Adventure did not have was beauty.

2752
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:10,320
And I think they added a moment and a reveal.

2753
02:16:10,320 --> 02:16:14,400
It's maybe more beautiful than anything in Disneyland, arguably.

2754
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:19,440
Yeah, I think there's a lot of cool in Disneyland, but like the grandeur,

2755
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:22,240
they just blew up a parking lot and filled it with fake rocks.

2756
02:16:22,240 --> 02:16:22,740
Yep.

2757
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:25,600
The stature is staggering.

2758
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:27,360
It's the it's huge.

2759
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:27,920
It's great.

2760
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:28,160
Yeah.

2761
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:30,880
In a way it's like, how could we not have seen this coming?

2762
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:32,960
How could we not have known?

2763
02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:35,600
I think the sentiment towards Big Thunder.

2764
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:36,480
But you know what else?

2765
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:43,600
Isn't it in a way a tribute to Big Thunder that it's playing in that same southwest

2766
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:45,040
type of rock?

2767
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:49,360
I think all of the warm feelings we have about Big Thunder we have with this as well.

2768
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:54,160
To Pick Horniman Valley also acknowledges Big Thunder,

2769
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:56,800
which and to pick Big Thunder acknowledges Matterhorn.

2770
02:16:56,800 --> 02:16:59,760
I think our lineage was great.

2771
02:17:00,480 --> 02:17:02,480
It's kind of like we did it perfectly.

2772
02:17:02,480 --> 02:17:03,680
We nailed it.

2773
02:17:03,680 --> 02:17:07,920
The one thing that's inarguable is that our order is exactly right.

2774
02:17:08,320 --> 02:17:13,280
And even if you use hashtag PTRFRF4, you're wrong and we're right.

2775
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:14,240
Yep, that's true.

2776
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:16,240
We did such a good job at our podcast.

2777
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:19,440
We do a good job all the time.

2778
02:17:19,440 --> 02:17:20,960
We just need to acknowledge that.

2779
02:17:20,960 --> 02:17:22,320
It's okay to be proud.

2780
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:23,440
It is okay.

2781
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:24,720
And let's be proud.

2782
02:17:25,360 --> 02:17:26,160
I'm proud.

2783
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:27,120
Yeah, I'm proud.

2784
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:29,280
Yeah, let's all be proud boys.

2785
02:17:30,720 --> 02:17:32,720
Hashtag proud boys.

2786
02:17:32,720 --> 02:17:33,220
Yeah.

2787
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:35,200
Let's stick to that PTRFRF4.

2788
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:39,280
I'm very curious.

2789
02:17:39,280 --> 02:17:40,400
You can watch.

2790
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:42,400
We'll post every step of this.

2791
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:46,080
Go to that hashtag PTRFRF4 on our Twitter.

2792
02:17:46,080 --> 02:17:46,880
We'll show you.

2793
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:51,280
We'll also post a blank bracket and you can see how the how

2794
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:55,600
Horniman Valley ascended from base camp up to the peak, though it is not a mountain.

2795
02:17:55,680 --> 02:17:56,160
You're right.

2796
02:17:58,560 --> 02:17:59,920
It's the Cadillac.

2797
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:00,400
I'm sorry.

2798
02:18:00,400 --> 02:18:01,520
It also has the most names.

2799
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:02,640
You gotta be prepared for that.

2800
02:18:02,640 --> 02:18:06,320
Raider Springs, Horniman Valley, which features the Cadillac range.

2801
02:18:06,320 --> 02:18:07,040
Yeah.

2802
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:07,540
Cool.

2803
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:09,520
And if it's not complicated.

2804
02:18:09,520 --> 02:18:12,240
If you wanted to list all those out, you'd use a few commas.

2805
02:18:12,240 --> 02:18:14,560
And you know what makes a great attraction?

2806
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:16,240
Lots of punctuation.

2807
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:16,880
Punctuation.

2808
02:18:16,880 --> 02:18:18,000
Punctuation, baby.

2809
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,960
That's a future Final Four is the theme park.

2810
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:24,000
That's actually pretty good.

2811
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:24,240
Wow.

2812
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:25,840
Convoluted theme park name.

2813
02:18:26,880 --> 02:18:28,400
Because there's a lot more of those coming.

2814
02:18:28,400 --> 02:18:28,960
We know that.

2815
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:29,600
Oh, for sure.

2816
02:18:29,600 --> 02:18:31,920
They haven't even named the Guardians Coaster in Epcot yet.

2817
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:32,880
That's going to be a nightmare.

2818
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:33,360
Oh my gosh.

2819
02:18:34,080 --> 02:18:36,640
Imagine what a full sentence that will be.

2820
02:18:36,640 --> 02:18:41,440
Guardians Coaster colon James Gunn is back colon.

2821
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:46,080
Rockets rocket to the moon.

2822
02:18:46,080 --> 02:18:48,480
Parentheses maybe figments in it.

2823
02:18:48,480 --> 02:18:50,560
Parentheses figment and buzzier in it.

2824
02:18:50,560 --> 02:18:50,800
Point.

2825
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,480
And then that's only like 25% of it.

2826
02:18:54,480 --> 02:18:54,980
Yeah.

2827
02:18:56,240 --> 02:18:57,040
I love this.

2828
02:18:57,040 --> 02:18:57,920
This is great.

2829
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:59,840
I think it worked out perfectly.

2830
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:01,280
No fights transpired.

2831
02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:04,960
And I hope if you were listening for that, if you wanted us to get at each other's throats,

2832
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:06,480
it almost didn't happen.

2833
02:19:06,480 --> 02:19:11,280
But that's kind of our podcast in a nutshell, I think.

2834
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:14,720
Sometimes we fight, but it's about things that probably aren't theme park related.

2835
02:19:14,720 --> 02:19:17,920
Usually I just need to eat a Snickers because I'm not me when I'm hungry.

2836
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:22,160
You turn into the Honda.

2837
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:22,640
Anyone?

2838
02:19:22,640 --> 02:19:27,760
Danny Devito, Hondo Anaka, Elton John, Jackie Mason.

2839
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:28,800
Jackie Mason.

2840
02:19:29,600 --> 02:19:30,800
That's not a real one, is it?

2841
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:32,560
From my favorite movie, Caddyshack 2.

2842
02:19:32,560 --> 02:19:32,720
Yeah.

2843
02:19:32,720 --> 02:19:33,440
Oh yeah.

2844
02:19:33,440 --> 02:19:34,000
We watched.

2845
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:35,360
Is Jackie Mason still alive?

2846
02:19:35,360 --> 02:19:35,840
Yes, he is.

2847
02:19:36,400 --> 02:19:38,640
We watched, I think we watched 10 minutes of Caddyshack 2.

2848
02:19:38,640 --> 02:19:44,560
I think we watched the first 10 minutes of Caddyshack 2 at Thanksgiving in 2010 in my apartment.

2849
02:19:44,560 --> 02:19:45,200
Something like that.

2850
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:45,920
Yeah.

2851
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:46,240
Wow.

2852
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:48,480
You get a lot going on.

2853
02:19:48,480 --> 02:19:49,200
What a story.

2854
02:19:50,640 --> 02:19:51,760
Well, anything else to say?

2855
02:19:52,720 --> 02:19:53,760
I really want to hear.

2856
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:54,880
It'll be exciting when we pause this.

2857
02:19:54,880 --> 02:19:56,320
I want to hear everybody's...

2858
02:19:56,320 --> 02:19:57,040
Takes.

2859
02:19:57,040 --> 02:19:57,760
Takes and thoughts.

2860
02:19:57,760 --> 02:20:00,880
And also, what's our next Final Four?

2861
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:03,440
Next April, what should we be getting into?

2862
02:20:03,440 --> 02:20:07,440
We have ideas already, but what do you want to see us narrow down?

2863
02:20:07,440 --> 02:20:11,040
What are the hot button issues that we can solve definitively?

2864
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:11,920
We will do it.

2865
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:12,480
Let us know.

2866
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:14,160
Great.

2867
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:15,120
I think we got it.

2868
02:20:15,760 --> 02:20:20,800

2872
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:41,280
But don't email us something bad for us.

2873
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:42,480
Just email us a note.

2874
02:20:42,480 --> 02:20:46,880
And draw a picture of Jason and a gallon of ice cream.

2875
02:20:48,240 --> 02:20:51,120
A gallon is not usually how they measure ice cream, but a gallon.

2876
02:20:51,120 --> 02:20:52,720
No, you get a gallon of ice cream.

2877
02:20:52,720 --> 02:20:53,120
Can you?

2878
02:20:53,920 --> 02:20:54,400
Yeah.

2879
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:54,880
Don't you?

2880
02:20:54,880 --> 02:20:55,440
I believe so.

2881
02:20:55,440 --> 02:20:55,760
I think that's common.

2882
02:20:55,760 --> 02:20:57,280
You can buy a gallon?

2883
02:20:57,280 --> 02:20:57,780
Yeah.

2884
02:20:58,720 --> 02:21:00,080
I mean, usually go pint, pint quart.

2885
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:01,760
I just think it's a pint and a quart.

2886
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:03,040
Next size up is a gallon.

2887
02:21:03,040 --> 02:21:04,240
I guess I just don't think about it.

2888
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:05,520
I guess you're right.

2889
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:06,880
I guess it has to be that way.

2890
02:21:08,160 --> 02:21:09,520
Email us at podcasttheride.gmail.com.

2891
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:10,800
Have you bought a gallon of ice cream?

2892
02:21:10,800 --> 02:21:12,240
Email us and let us know.

2893
02:21:12,240 --> 02:21:12,640
Yeah.

2894
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:13,520
I bet you can do it.

2895
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:14,320
Yeah, interesting.

2896
02:21:14,320 --> 02:21:15,360
Tell Mike where to do it.

2897
02:21:16,720 --> 02:21:21,120
You survived the podcast the ride, fake rock, final four.

2898
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:22,000
That was harrowing.

2899
02:21:22,800 --> 02:21:23,680
We sent it to the peak.

2900
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:24,160
We did it.

2901
02:21:24,160 --> 02:21:24,720
I'm exhausted.

2902
02:21:24,720 --> 02:21:25,360
I'm exhausted.

2903
02:21:25,360 --> 02:21:26,880
I'm physically tired.

2904
02:21:26,880 --> 02:21:27,680
This might be the most tired.

2905
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:28,880
I want to do a more wrap up.

2906
02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:31,200
I think let's strike a silence as long as we can.

2907
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:32,000
All right, bye.

2908
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:32,720
Forever.

2909
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:35,360
