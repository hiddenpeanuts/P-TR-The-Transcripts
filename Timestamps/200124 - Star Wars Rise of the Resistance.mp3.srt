1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,840
Recruits, thank you for joining The Cause.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,960
A podcasting team has infiltrated a highly anticipated ride

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,040
that has arrived in the Anaheim system.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,900
Our mission is to tell you about it,

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,240
but first we'll have to navigate

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,480
through Jason's poor opening day dietary choices.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,760
We'll regroup with you after the theme song.

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,960
Welcome to The Cause.

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,760
It's Rise of the Resistance on Podcast The Ride.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,760
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, or as it's known today,

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,160
two hours of breathless gushing.

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm Scott Gerdert joined by Jason Sheridan.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,880
Bright suns, Scott, bright suns.

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,960
And Mike Carlson.

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,560
Yes, bright suns as well.

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,080
I assume it'll be rising moons

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,400
by the time we're done with this.

20
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,200
I think so, yes.

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,840
I had a question regarding the runtime of the episode

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,120
because if, all right, if our standard ratio

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,320
is about two hours for a three minute ride,

24
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,320
would we be forgiven for doing 10 hours on a 15 minute ride?

25
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,240
Oh yeah.

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,600
That's a fair point, yeah.

27
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,080
I think the audience would have to allow it.

28
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,080
And it might be what you get.

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,120
You're looking at the runtime now.

30
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,960
We don't know.

31
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,920
You know more than we know.

32
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,320
Could be 10 hours, and if so,

33
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sure it's all essential and compelling.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,040
Sure is riveting.

35
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,080
We're talking Rise of the Resistance,

36
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,920
which is the new ride based on the Star Wars franchise.

37
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,960
Yes.

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,600
Oh my God, we got to do it.

39
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,560
It rules, it fucking rules.

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,400
Holy shit.

41
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,220
Yeah, yes.

42
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,260
Long awaited, delayed six months, eight months.

43
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,180
We don't know exactly when it was supposed to originally open

44
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,500
because they pushed up the opening

45
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,700
of Star Wars Galaxy's Edge, but it's here finally.

46
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,660
We did it at Disneyland.

47
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,140
We did not go out to Orlando.

48
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,580
Some people I think were questioning our cred.

49
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,180
Like we should have gone to Orlando

50
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,260
to have done it first day, but we waited.

51
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,340
Questioning the amount of credit card points we have.

52
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,780
Yes, I said credit card points.

53
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,860
Yeah, I finished the whole phrase.

54
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,340
Yeah, sorry, that's what I call it.

55
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,900
Yeah, I just kept replying by retweeting graphs

56
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,900
of cost of living increases in Los Angeles.

57
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,300
But yeah, we did it at Disneyland.

58
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,180
Opening day, we made it opening day.

59
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,540
Opening day, a real adventure.

60
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,220
It really was, and I think there was definitely a question

61
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,460
at the beginning of the day if we would even get on.

62
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,140
I think there's been that question for everybody going,

63
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,620
and there probably are some tales of woe of people

64
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,220
who did not get on and did not win the boarding pass shuffle.

65
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,100
My buddy, I felt really bad, my buddy Avery

66
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,580
went down on Saturday and the app crashed at 8 a.m.

67
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,140
And by the time they all got back up, it was gone.

68
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,420
Like the people had gotten them.

69
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,220
Sheesh. What a mess.

70
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,780
Yeah, and I think they went faster on Saturday maybe

71
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,620
than they did on Friday.

72
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,500
I think so, well, people off work, you know?

73
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,180
People off work.

74
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,180
People maybe knew how it worked by then.

75
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,340
People had realized that camping out from,

76
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,900
one of the parking lots, the Toy Story lot was open at midnight.

77
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,180
So people were there and camping out.

78
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,740
And then it was determined that by 8 a.m.

79
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,060
you did not have to do that.

80
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,860
That didn't help you in any regard.

81
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,900
No. Yeah.

82
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,060
So basically what it what it happened was, my understanding is in Florida,

83
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,860
you had to like have a very similar

84
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
app situation as the one in Disneyland.

85
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,380
But the way they were doing it is that first person in would immediately

86
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,140
get to join a boarding group.

87
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,540
So I don't know when those would start.

88
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,980
Maybe they started like at seven.

89
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,020
They started earlier.

90
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,940
So essentially it was first come first serve.

91
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,420
And as soon as you went through the turnstile, you get on your app

92
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,900
and find your slot and it would obviously go through sequentially.

93
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,860
So there was an incentive to being there first.

94
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,100
You would get a little more fair.

95
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,940
Yes, it is. It is more fair.

96
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,940
The most fair to insane people.

97
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,460
Yes. So the people at midnight would have benefited, at least

98
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,460
they would have been like the first people on.

99
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,060
But now they've randomized it on both coasts.

100
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,500
Yes. And I think we have a leg up because I saw one Twitter user

101
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,620
post about this and I text you about it of like the system

102
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,300
for doing it is built on the backbone of MaxPass, which we are familiar with.

103
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,620
We have it out here.

104
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,900
But it's they don't have it in Florida and everything in Florida.

105
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,820
The digital fast passes work a little differently.

106
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,460
Yeah. So I was I had that question.

107
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,620
So basically when we say it's randomized now, quote, unquote,

108
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:47,140
it means that everyone who has gone through the turnstile at 8am

109
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,500
gets on their app right at that time and gets added to a boarding group.

110
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,580
Now, I don't think it's actually randomized.

111
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,260
I think it's still doing first come first serve.

112
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,180
It's just that since it's a giant clusterfuck of a bunch of people

113
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,180
trying to get on, it's essentially randomized because there's so many people

114
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,180
doing it, you're not going to have second difference.

115
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,540
Right. More like, yeah, parse it even more.

116
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,140
0.000. Yeah.

117
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,700
I think it also helps if you have the fastest phone

118
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,740
and whoever has the best data providing in.

119
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,580
Yes. And where and what?

120
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,380
Yeah. What data received the best in that specific spot in Disneyland?

121
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,980
Let's start out with a hack.

122
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,300
Let's start out with what we believe to be a hack.

123
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,020
Really? A little bit of a hack.

124
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,460
Well, I don't use the Wi-Fi.

125
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,780
Don't use the Wi-Fi.

126
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,580
Don't use the Disneyland Wi-Fi.

127
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,380
Now you can leave after you go through the gate.

128
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,100
That's what we're talking about here.

129
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,220
Yeah, I see.

130
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,620
So the idea would be maybe go a day before you're going to do it

131
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,420
and test out where your phone gets the strongest signal.

132
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,820
Even you could do it before walking around the park.

133
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,380
I disagree with this step.

134
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,460
This is madness.

135
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,820
I need to do a prep day.

136
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,100
I yes. It's very funny you use that word.

137
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,060
The Twitter account is Madness Kingdom.

138
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,660
They write some.

139
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,260
They have some very interesting essays on Medium.

140
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,980
Check them out.

141
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,540
But you also could go to the Grand California.

142
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,300
You could go through the turnstile at Disneyland at 7am, leave,

143
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,620
go to Grand California and get on the Wi-Fi in the lobby

144
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,580
or somewhere, sit comfortably in a chair and then at 8 o'clock

145
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,820
try getting on.

146
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,660
If you live close enough, you could go to your damn house.

147
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,500
Sure.

148
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,180
So the hack is become an Anaheim homeowner.

149
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,140
Yes, that would definitely help.

150
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,260
Or just go have a nice breakfast.

151
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,620
A hack for every day.

152
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,460
You got to start off the good breakfast.

153
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,460
If Captain Kids Buffet on Harbor has Wi-Fi, which I don't know

154
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,580
the answer to because we haven't reviewed it for the podcast yet.

155
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,580
Go over there. Snip that word yet out of the sentence.

156
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,500
Yeah, for sure.

157
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,580
Do you mean for sure?

158
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,820
When we for sure?

159
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,180
Hey, let's not add any words.

160
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,940
It was a tidy sentence up until the end.

161
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,980
The moment you say, oh, hey, I'm going out of town for a little while.

162
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,220
Mike and I just start salivating like Captain Kid.

163
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,820
Captain Kid, Captain Kid.

164
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,980
Yeah, the first day.

165
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,220
That bastard's not holding us back anymore.

166
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,020
He's trying to have dessert for breakfast.

167
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,740
He's trying to have dessert for dinner.

168
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,700
Reviewing the by far the worst reviewed restaurant

169
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,100
in the vicinity of Disneyland Park.

170
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,580
You will have to come back from that trip because we have

171
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,460
we will list you as our emergency contact for Anaheim General Hospital.

172
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,980
We check in for any number of bacon, the poor and illness.

173
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,340
Scott pulls the plug on both of us who are in the.

174
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,940
I'm taking it one step further than Nick Mundy,

175
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,620
who yanked your microphone cord out.

176
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,340
Yeah, I'm yanking your living cords out.

177
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,260
They say that was a saline drip.

178
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,740
We were just trying to hydrate them.

179
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,140
Close enough. They'll die slowly over months.

180
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,780
So, yes. So to finish up the hack, essentially don't

181
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,700
find a spot where your phone has either good hotel

182
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,260
Wi-Fi or a good strong signal in the park vicinity somewhere.

183
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,180
And you don't necessarily need to because we walked over by the land.

184
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,060
I think that was maybe a mistake because it wasn't the strongest signal.

185
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,180
And we had problems getting right in and getting a group on the app.

186
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,500
But I watched some people.

187
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,260
People were counting down to 8 a.m. inside Galaxy's Edge.

188
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,460
There was a mass in Galaxy's Edge who all jumped on.

189
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,780
And some of them got earlier groups than us.

190
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,380
I will say that. So.

191
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,420
So some of them didn't get through on the app,

192
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,260
but they did accidentally get a transmission from a long dead emperor

193
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,780
and discovered he's still alive on a secret underground plant.

194
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,820
I didn't know I would have liked to have gotten that transmission.

195
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,740
Would have been cool. Very surprising.

196
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,780
I'll be honest, it sounds confusing.

197
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,060
No, I think it's pretty clean what I'm what I'm setting up.

198
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,180
It sounds like excess people die and then they come back to life years later

199
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,900
and have them like are kept alive by a big like cord tree,

200
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,820
but a big like group of dongles.

201
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,820
And they've built any number of country bear shows,

202
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,580
like hundreds and hundreds of country bears.

203
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,460
So you're saying I'm saying my theme park.

204
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,340
Yeah, the theme park equivalent.

205
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,980
Exegol has 20 country bear shows.

206
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,820
OK, so I see some of the ones.

207
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,580
So in this bit, Exegol is the Sith planet,

208
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,900
but the country bears are being built.

209
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,180
The bears live, the bears speak.

210
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,540
So the bears are the emperor.

211
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,140
OK, since Return of the Jedi,

212
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,860
the emperor has been building animatronic shows under that ocean,

213
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,220
that exegol ocean for 30 years,

214
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,140
and then they will all rise up at a certain point.

215
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,540
His favorite music, bluegrass.

216
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,180
He loves Steve Palpatine's favorite music is bluegrass.

217
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,060
The same name as that woman from Succession.

218
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,940
Yes. Yeah, that's where I mean, I look,

219
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,380
I would have loved it. They got the exegol.

220
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:53,980
It was shit.

221
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,380
Voila.

222
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,900
A different cinematic baddie.

223
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,740
So, yeah, so we got on the app at 8 a.m.

224
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,540
We had three of us trying.

225
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,100
So that's also another tip.

226
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,500
If you have multiple people in your group,

227
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,260
put your passes on each person's phone and have everybody try because,

228
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,900
you know, God knows the thing crashes.

229
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,940
It doesn't work.

230
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,780
I didn't. I look, I'm a masterchecker.

231
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,020
I'm not a master code breaker, but I'm a masterchecker.

232
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,220
And I didn't get the reservation. My phone kept crashing.

233
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,300
Cover the spread. Cover the spread.

234
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,500
That's what we're saying.

235
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,620
Wow. But this this was and I posted this on Instagram,

236
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,820
the moment of you preparing for your most

237
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,940
like the check of your life, basically.

238
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,260
Yeah. And I must have been thrilling.

239
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,500
It was. But sometimes you fail when you check.

240
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,860
You failed. But by enacting the plan

241
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,820
by which other people succeeded, it was still your victory.

242
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
That is true. Thank you for saying that.

243
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,180
Because I really hadn't thought about it.

244
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,820
I just sort of had felt bad about not being the one to get like a really high

245
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,340
because I you know, I wanted to get like, oh, I pulled Group three. Sure.

246
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,500
That's what I wanted for for my ego.

247
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,940
You win the game by one point or 30 points.

248
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,620
It doesn't matter. You still want to get one.

249
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,700
Yeah, you're right. Yeah.

250
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,420
And we did. And we did make it.

251
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,260
And just so it's like so for people who are going and trying to do this.

252
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,180
And hopefully it is still the boarding pass system.

253
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,020
But the time this episode comes out or all of this is irrelevant advice.

254
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,180
But with our sort of randomized and with Mike

255
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,060
having us all covered the spread, we got on.

256
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,180
We were 87, which as the day played out

257
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,220
and we know that there were several short breakdowns of the ride,

258
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,940
maybe 45 minutes to an hour.

259
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,220
This was 8 a.m. Group 87.

260
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,340
We got on at 7 p.m.

261
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,980
And that includes breakdowns.

262
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,620
So let that be kind of your guide.

263
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,300
If you get before 80, you're probably in for sure.

264
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,820
After 80, you're dancing on the line.

265
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,060
But maybe the app says like, you'll get in if you're 82 or under

266
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,540
where they don't want to promise it. Right. I see.

267
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,020
And I think Saturday they went over the amount they went on Friday.

268
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,700
So ideally it's getting better.

269
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,220
I checked on Saturday.

270
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:14,580
I know on Friday they capped it at like one like in the early one hundreds.

271
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,660
They gave it out to 120.

272
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,260
I think they capped it around 110, 111 by Saturday night at 740.

273
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,740
Second day of operation.

274
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,140
They were at groups 109 to 111.

275
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,420
So get a little faster. OK.

276
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:32,220
And closing the window to of like the the amount of groups that.

277
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,140
So if you're post 100, don't despair. Still possible. Yes.

278
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,500
And then you get a full day in the park.

279
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,140
But I think don't expect to go

280
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,780
and check out the ride in the morning and be on your merry way in the afternoon.

281
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,300
If you get there at 8 a.m., you are committing to potentially being there

282
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,660
all the way till midnight. Yes, for sure.

283
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,580
Unless you can find like the highest speed Internet

284
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,780
in the park and you can get right on.

285
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,900
But yeah, that's I wouldn't count on that. Yeah.

286
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,460
It's a and even then sort of like finger dexterity is

287
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,940
part of the issue and probably the biggest, probably the newest phone.

288
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,860
Making sure it's the newest version of the app.

289
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,460
Go a lot of factors. Go and upgrade your phones.

290
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,780
Go get the hottest new phone.

291
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,220
I don't know what it is.

292
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,220
Get the one with the best processing speed,

293
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,860
with the best network coverage.

294
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,700
You know, this is all prep you need to get on a ride.

295
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,660
And maybe know somebody who has fast fingers.

296
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,820
Maybe if you have a friend who's like a court stenographer

297
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,380
or something that requires or a pianist.

298
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,100
Yes, that's a good one.

299
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,220
Or pickpocket like Liberace.

300
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,700
Yes, if you know any Anaheim pickpockets.

301
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,420
For sure.

302
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,940
Although, you know, is that fingers or is that wrist is pickpocketing?

303
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,700
What is the what do you need?

304
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,140
It's applicable.

305
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,620
And I think I think quick fingers would have to help

306
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,100
because you have to make sure they aren't felt. Yeah, that's true.

307
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,900
They're in and out of a pocket without impact.

308
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,900
Well, when you think about close up magicians, when you think about that's another.

309
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,620
Yes. Yes. Good category. That's good.

310
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,540
That that is good.

311
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,060
But I'm saying when you think of because all I can think of is

312
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,620
the man who was playing Liberace in behind the candelabra,

313
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,300
which wasn't like they put Michael Douglas's head on that guy.

314
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,140
I am standing his hands.

315
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,060
I'm thinking that guy's got fast fingers.

316
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,780
Yeah. I think even if you're a pianist, probably get practicing.

317
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,260
Probably like make sure you can do Liberace double time.

318
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,820
Yes. Just like being like being able to play a nice little dirge

319
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,260
isn't going to help you. You got to be a fast pianist.

320
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,540
Yeah. So you got to be a piano kind of guy.

321
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,700
Did you do that today? Did you do that today?

322
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,580
Ragtime. If you can play if you.

323
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,180
Ragtime will be helpful. Play multiple different rags,

324
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,420
different type of rags where you can play would be helpful.

325
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,700
Guitar is applicable to if you know anything, Hale.

326
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,340
You get him in. Oh, yeah.

327
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,700
If you can shred, keep shredding, shredding also valuable.

328
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,980
You know, I really we mentioned Liberace before.

329
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,060
I'm realizing now like Liberace needs to come up up on the show.

330
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,940
I think a little bit more. Sure.

331
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,620
So I just want to throw that out there.

332
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,340
Well, there's not a museum anymore. Is there?

333
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,860
I mean, that weird thing you can visit when I'm scared of visiting.

334
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,220
The weird thing that Eva Anderson told us about where you just pay some money

335
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,180
to a guy in a limo who picks you up and then he takes you to some

336
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,980
like undisclosed location and you look at stuff.

337
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,540
He was like room temperature champagne in his limo.

338
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,140
Yeah. And I'll I'll do it.

339
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,420
I'll do it.

340
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,900
So we can talk about it, at least in that.

341
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,180
That's like the themed experience with Liberace, essentially, as far as I know.

342
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,820
I think there was a more committed museum at one point in time.

343
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,700
But for some reason, kids aren't going to the Liberace Museum

344
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,700
and they had to shut it down for whatever reason.

345
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,260
Dumbasses. I know what's happening to the kids.

346
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:51,620
Yeah. OK. But so fast fingers required.

347
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,940
Yes. We made it.

348
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,580
I think it's interesting to this.

349
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,740
A lot of playing with your expectations, training you.

350
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,300
The Disney parks training you.

351
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,580
This is training people how to use advanced features of the apps

352
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,580
because you have to link all of your party's tickets into, in theory,

353
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,220
just one app.

354
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,020
But like, I haven't done this a lot.

355
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,220
Like, Mike, you know, the ins and outs of this app, you know,

356
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,100
you know, the Max Pass system back and forth.

357
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,060
I feel like not a lot of people are on an X.

358
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,540
You know, it left and right.

359
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,180
Yeah. The Disneyland app is like my X wing.

360
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:35,260
You have no control over how fucking buggy and weird this app is

361
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,540
in terms of signing you out and making you log back in and just crashing

362
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,700
when you try to use one of its features.

363
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,300
Yeah. Make sure activate touch ID so that the footprint goes through

364
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,060
so you don't have to retype your password because you'll get signed out randomly.

365
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,180
Yes. Or face ID.

366
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,740
OK. I don't have that, but I get that.

367
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,500
Yeah, it is.

368
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,140
I don't know how many people were in the park in the morning

369
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,540
because I wonder if it's like,

370
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,020
I don't even know how to guess because there were a ton of people.

371
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,220
There were thousands. Yeah.

372
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,740
Oh, was it 10, 20? Maybe.

373
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,860
It was kind of crazy.

374
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,780
We're at like a super packed main street.

375
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,060
It was only half open.

376
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,340
And then dramatically, they opened it all the way to the hub.

377
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,180
And we were crouched over by the the plaza in or the other.

378
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,820
No, the Jolly Holiday.

379
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,020
Yeah, yeah. We're crouched over there for a while.

380
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,700
It's kind of exciting.

381
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,260
I hadn't been to Disneyland in the morning when it's dark,

382
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,860
probably since the high school grad nights I got to do.

383
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,700
That's a that's a fun way to do it.

384
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,620
There was a lot of excitement.

385
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,340
You know, you guys convinced me to come to the opening day of this

386
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,500
and of Galaxy's Edge. Great time at both.

387
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,700
I assume both were going to be a zoo.

388
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,660
I was still picturing what I know about when Indiana Jones

389
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,740
adventure opened in the 90s.

390
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,020
And it is clear how much Disney has learned since then.

391
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,420
It is so much more than just getting a big line,

392
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,620
which Hagrid's that we just talked about seems to just be getting a huge line.

393
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,780
Big line. But Disney has created these systems where you could

394
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,740
you could be shit out of luck.

395
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,420
You might not to get it might not get to get on the thing at all.

396
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,980
But, you know, in both of these cases are like the board.

397
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,780
The digital boarding groups worked great.

398
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,540
You know, we had to wait all day, but that's a whole day.

399
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,620
You get in Disneyland. Yeah, it was a blast.

400
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,820
Yeah, I wonder. Like, I don't know.

401
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,580
Now that they have the system figured out, I guess they'll just employ it

402
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,340
with most things they open, I would guess,

403
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,060
because like, yeah, Marvel land phase one opens.

404
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,340
I assume they'll use a similar thing

405
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,900
because I don't think like you'll always have obviously people

406
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,420
like that come for the ride that can't get on the ride.

407
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,380
And it's a big pain in the ass.

408
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,540
But it's not going to be like

409
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,700
what you're saying, where it's just like the line is all the way down

410
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,340
to Captain Kid's Buffet or something for like Indiana Jones.

411
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,300
You're in the line.

412
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,260
You might as well grab a handful of eggs since you're right there.

413
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,940
Yeah. Pay your force into the room.

414
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,380
Pay your four or five dollars for the buffet and get the eggs

415
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,660
and you get them to go and eat them as you go.

416
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,500
If a line ever forces you into a unrelated

417
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,980
buffet establishment. Yeah. Yeah.

418
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,620
But so I mean, anything else in terms of like

419
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,020
tips to do it or can we talk about the the ride?

420
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,220
The actual ride? I'm trying to think.

421
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,700
I think that's really all it is.

422
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,140
I mean, I would also just keep an eye on Disney social media

423
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,340
because they do change things from time to time.

424
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,940
So we're recording this a few days before this comes out.

425
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,300
But by the time this comes out, that could also be have changed.

426
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,460
All this could be irrelevant.

427
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,980
So but as it stands, if it's still the boarding pass system,

428
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,940
just make sure you're in the park at 8 a.m.

429
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,700
It's all matters. Don't do any camp outs unless unless you want.

430
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,780
Unless that's just for a fun bonding experience.

431
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,380
Just give yourself enough time

432
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,220
so you're not like cutting it close to 8 a.m.

433
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,060
because like you just want to be going to be crowded.

434
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,820
You want to be such like you want to be like in a spot

435
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,820
and you want to know where your Wi-Fi or your

436
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,780
you will lose at 8 or 5, 8 or 5.

437
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,700
You're you're done. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

438
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,500
So you got to be like firmly in the park, not like

439
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,900
like, oh, shit, at turnstiles at seven fifty nine.

440
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,980
Yeah. Like, no, don't be in the Starbucks line at seven fifty.

441
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,180
And like, like really, like, make sure you get in there with enough time

442
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,660
and 15 minutes to sort of

443
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,780
zoom around and see where your phone has good signal.

444
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,420
It seems like in Florida,

445
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,620
the window is starting to open up a little more. Yeah.

446
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,020
Like they're still get like 30 minutes in 40 minutes in.

447
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,540
You could still get into group here.

448
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,940
I don't know. I mean, I think these boarding groups will be in play

449
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,100
on both coasts for at least a couple of months, if not long.

450
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,740
Probably. Yeah, it seems like that.

451
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,580
And stuff's going to be buggy. Stuff's going to break down.

452
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,100
We've been told, expect this ride to break down

453
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,700
like four or five hours up, one hour down.

454
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,060
But like, there's a lot of staff.

455
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,860
There's a lot of people working on it to get it back up quickly.

456
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,020
But it made it pretty good opening day, seemingly.

457
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,940
I don't it certainly was not some PR.

458
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,060
We're talking about that with Paul Scheer last week, who joined us,

459
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,380
who was with us for the day.

460
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,140
And he was he said in our episode last week, they need Disneyland needs a win.

461
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,780
This has to go great. And I think it went great.

462
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,460
I don't know any bad PR out there.

463
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,180
Yeah, I'm sure there's a few people in groups that didn't get on.

464
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,180
But that's it.

465
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,460
Like, which, of course, sucks.

466
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,220
But it's not like people were in line for seven hours.

467
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,340
I saw Disney. I think even in Florida, they're going so far to try to may

468
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,780
still make it a win that they like.

469
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,260
I think there was a long amount of time that the ride was down

470
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,100
and they were handing out free chips and like water.

471
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,100
And then they made Ray walk through the line

472
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,940
to take photos with everybody.

473
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,660
So like we can't make the campy man.

474
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,340
We can't have like people being like our three in line on Rise of the Resistance

475
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,500
or anything. So they're even hypersensitive, I think.

476
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,660
Hyper. Yeah, like it's true.

477
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,620
Everybody was cheered up once they were like once Ray passed through

478
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,740
and everybody got to shout, no, no, your last name.

479
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,860
What's your last name?

480
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,540
She answered every single person what her last name is.

481
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,820
Yeah, they all wanted to know. Yeah. Yeah.

482
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,580
Really, actually, you talk about PR and Disney and Star Wars.

483
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,860
This is of the two products in the last month with rise in the title.

484
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,780
One of them has been incredibly well received.

485
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,380
That's and it's nice to see.

486
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,020
I don't want to say which one it is on your own.

487
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,060
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

488
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,300
It is that is funny that they're both rise.

489
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,380
They're both first.

490
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,260
Yeah, the resistance had to rise in Florida

491
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,420
so that Skywalker could rise on the movie screens.

492
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,620
And then the resistance had to rise again in Los Angeles. Yeah.

493
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,140
That's the getting back up.

494
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,860
Like this is the second second and like not.

495
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,420
No, it's not down now.

496
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,620
It hasn't been knocked out yet. Still rising.

497
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,420
Still rising.

498
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,660
Although we talked about, I think one of you pulled it.

499
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,860
I described it.

500
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,820
Carly had found the had taken a screen grab of the picture

501
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,780
that was briefly posted on the official Disneyland account,

502
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,860
which is like a beautiful Renaissance painting of like a child

503
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,540
and her dad seemingly running away from Galaxy's Edge and R2D2.

504
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:14,100
And in the middle of the photograph is just Bob Iger looking confused.

505
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,540
And it does look like they not know when they posted it.

506
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,740
What's that? Do they not realize that?

507
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,380
Iger is there.

508
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,860
I think they'd probably just were like, oh, this is kind of a cute picture.

509
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,300
And then maybe like enough comments were like, huh, this is kind of weird.

510
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,060
This is weird. And then people like, oh, we've got to get away.

511
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,980
Got to get it out of there.

512
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,900
He looks like he looks mad.

513
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,900
It does look like a little girl is upset running away from an angry Bob Iger.

514
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,900
Rob Iger and R2D2.

515
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,620
But it is like a beautiful, confusing painting.

516
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,500
It is like an abstract work.

517
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,420
Yeah, yeah, I finally caught it.

518
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,420
Yeah, it's very good.

519
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,380
I'm trying to think of things we can say because I think just out of necessity,

520
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,780
this will become a spoilery episode and will certainly

521
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:00,340
alert the firm, you know, point of no return on that.

522
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,500
But what can we say in terms of just what I was thinking of things to say

523
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,220
before we talk about it?

524
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,580
Clearly, a lot of credit has to be given to Scott Trowbridge.

525
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:16,260
I think this going on the ride is where it has registered with me

526
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,780
that he is the Tony Baxter of today.

527
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:24,220
I think he is the 2020s or the 2010s and has been for a while because

528
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,060
for people who don't know all the mythology, he's responsible for it.

529
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,860
He's been in charge of this entire project of all of Galaxy's Edge.

530
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,780
And if you watch the Imagineering story,

531
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,660
which we talk about on the second gate, he's kind of the most prominent

532
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,860
imaginary in episode six and the final episode of it.

533
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,020
And clearly with good reason, they like that he stacks up

534
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,380
with your your gurrs and your Baxter's.

535
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,740
He was a universal person

536
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:54,220
where his magnum opus over there was the Spider-Man ride.

537
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,260
The amazing adventure.

538
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,340
Yeah. And heavily involved with all the Harry Potter stuff.

539
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,580
Yeah. Seemingly like laid out the plans, like figured out

540
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,100
the all like the basics of it and the immersiveness of it.

541
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,660
And then before it was built,

542
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,340
got snatched by Disney and right over there.

543
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,580
And it doesn't seem like he's had like a super public.

544
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,580
What's his amazing Disney project until Galaxy's Edge?

545
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,300
But boy, that's worth the wait.

546
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,500
Obviously, he's been working on it forever.

547
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,060
And he's like, I think he's technically he's the head of Imagineering now.

548
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,420
OK, I believe isn't that no, isn't that God Bob Weiss,

549
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,020
the head of Imagineering?

550
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,540
Or is that like president?

551
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,540
All right. Yeah, I know.

552
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:38,020
I shouldn't know, because these titles are so confusing.

553
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,820
Portfolio. He's he's like in there.

554
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,660
It's like the top of some aspect of Imagineering.

555
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,060
I'm almost positive.

556
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,260
So it might be a different name than what I said or what you.

557
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,820
Yes. So Rodie, I don't know what anyone is.

558
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,220
Yeah, because Rodie's been there forever.

559
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,580
And he has to have.

560
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:57,500
He's he's like lead explorer of Imagineering.

561
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,180
He's head of the pack of Imagineer of Imagineer.

562
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,140
Which doctor?

563
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,300
Yes, he's chief witch doctor.

564
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,500
But I think when you this ride without giving a lot away yet

565
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,340
shares a lot of DNA with the basic adventures of Spider-Man.

566
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,340
And I don't know how much he had to do with the actual ride

567
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,180
Harry Potter and Forbidden Journey.

568
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:26,180
But it's like it's akin to those where it's

569
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:31,780
a really rewarding mix of physical things and screens.

570
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,660
And it's truly surprising at every step.

571
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:39,100
It rearranges types of rides into new configurations

572
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,540
like you've never seen. Great third acts.

573
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,420
I think these all have very similar third acts.

574
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,660
These rides with big surprises.

575
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,380
Yeah. And with really satisfying screen sections,

576
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,020
which if you're on a pure screen ride, you can just get like,

577
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,940
All right, sure. I think I get all your moves.

578
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:00,020
And he all of Trowbridge's rides have like surprising

579
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,020
just like something up its sleeve at the end screens

580
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:10,580
molded into sets and used more gracefully than some other attractions.

581
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,380
Yeah. And I think this is like the most of anything.

582
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,500
Like you would never and never ever would you call this a screen ride,

583
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,540
despite the fact that it probably has like 100 screens in it.

584
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,380
Yeah. It's like doing surprising things that are supporting

585
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,180
like the big headlines are the physical sets and the tangible things.

586
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,820
And there there was one and I'm sure we'll get to it later,

587
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:35,660
but there is an effect that combines the screens and physical

588
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,380
stuff in the location that I didn't realize when we were first in it,

589
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,460
because I was so affixed at the physical set in the animatronic

590
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,620
where I was like, oh, my God, that happens because something happened

591
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:53,180
on the screen. And it's so and there's a big audio cue,

592
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:58,260
but it's so of a one of one piece that I was like,

593
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,180
oh, I was just impressed by the one piece.

594
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,580
I didn't even see until later on. There's other things.

595
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:07,900
As we're saying, they're like we'll get a hardline spoiler in a little bit.

596
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,580
Who knows? It could be another hour before soon, I assume.

597
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,180
But there's stuff where stuff where I was like, I don't know how they did this.

598
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,780
And then it's so clear how they did it.

599
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,260
You just miss it when you're on the ride because you're

600
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,780
you're immersed in the story. Yeah.

601
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,500
Yeah. I also had to give credit to Disney.

602
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,380
I don't know what is again, I don't know his title creative executive.

603
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:32,740
John Lorena comes up in a lot of the longer articles about this.

604
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:37,340
He is talking to Trowbridge in the rise section in Imagineering Story,

605
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,980
which I went back and watched.

606
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,300
But they're looking at like the the, you know,

607
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:49,260
rehearsal runs of some sequence, like not fully 100% there yet.

608
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,380
But like, OK, this is what it looks like when you do this.

609
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,980
And he him and Trowbridge are like walking through stuff,

610
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,660
sharing little notes. Yeah.

611
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:02,300
A thing I didn't know about Trowbridge till I looked it up this morning,

612
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:07,100
his first job in theme park world, Sanrio Puroland.

613
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,980
Wow. I didn't know.

614
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,580
Wow. Me so happy now that I've been there and really enjoyed it.

615
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,380
Like there is some real unique spirit and energy.

616
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,420
And he was there in the very beginning.

617
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,660
I think he went in eighty nine for them for the opening.

618
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:24,580
So there's like original bones DNA at Sanrio Puroland of this guy.

619
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,660
Now clearly one of the theme park greats.

620
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,500
And the most wonderful thing about all this, we had been on the ride.

621
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,820
We were blown away by the ride.

622
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,060
We went to cool down with some some milk at the milk stand.

623
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,580
And who should walk by in a Star Wars cast member crew jacket?

624
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,940
But Scott Trowbridge, I love the fact that we recognize him.

625
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,220
Yeah. So shows the level.

626
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:49,060
So I hear Scott goes, is that Scott Trowbridge?

627
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,300
And I turn around and I go, oh, yeah, for sure.

628
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,580
It's Scott Trowbridge.

629
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,900
Yes, we're good. I'm glad we found each other.

630
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,260
And we said hi to him.

631
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,620
In my mind, we're like, well, let the television, let the famous man

632
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,300
kind of follow. Let's let him get out front. So.

633
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,300
I yeah, I went and asked, are you Scott?

634
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,060
He said yes. And I was like, I just have to shake your hand.

635
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,340
I just want to shake your hand on this day.

636
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,700
And we were gushing about the ride.

637
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,740
And all he wanted to know was about the new type of milk that we had.

638
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,260
Yes. Yeah. What's the type of milk? What's the milk?

639
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,740
Yes. He very home. Oh, yeah.

640
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,220
We'll get to the milk.

641
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,420
We'll get to the milk in the section where we talked before.

642
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,860
Sith artifact that may have been my undoing.

643
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,940
Well, why are we? Why do we have to wait on that one?

644
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,220
You're right. It's a true toy.

645
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,660
Dairy. Yeah, right. That's the milk from Toy Dairy.

646
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,020
Dairy and swirl. The toy.

647
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,300
Dairy and swirl.

648
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,980
Or is it not a ride spoiler?

649
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,980
So might as well.

650
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,260
You're right. Dairy and swirl.

651
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,060
Is it Toy Dairy in or Toy Dairy us?

652
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,180
World. Is there an end at the end?

653
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,940
I I wrote down an end, but I could be just double check.

654
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,420
I may have misread it.

655
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,020
It's from Watto's planet.

656
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,500
Then, yes. Yeah.

657
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,940
But it's like it's like it looks like spiced milk.

658
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,460
There's like something at the top.

659
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,220
There's an imagine.

660
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,340
He's the chili lime seasoning to heat.

661
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,860
There is an imaginary mango jelly inside.

662
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,860
There is an imaginary who loves Wado.

663
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,820
Yeah, because there's a toy.

664
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,580
Dairy and toy not shop.

665
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,700
What is it? Toy stall.

666
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,060
Toy. Yeah, it is with an end.

667
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,540
Toy Dairy and Swirl Green.

668
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,340
Someone wrote it wrong and I read it.

669
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,460
OK, so a couple of us had this milk

670
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,900
and he mainly wanted to know how the milk was, which was a nice

671
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,540
it felt like him deflecting.

672
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,060
He reminded me of when we met Tony Baxter and he just said,

673
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,540
have you guys done Guardians yet?

674
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,620
He didn't want to accept all this praise about his life and bodywork,

675
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,540
which he knew we were probably going to try to do.

676
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:41,180
He's like deflecting and let's talk about the greater good.

677
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,060
Like what else is happening?

678
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,300
Yeah, he wanted to talk about the cosplay.

679
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,060
He was like, oh, some great cosplay.

680
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,540
He didn't want to be like, oh, that's great.

681
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,460
Thank you so much.

682
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,500
What else did you like about my ride or anything?

683
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,340
He wasn't going to he wasn't going to be like he just wanted to.

684
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,500
Yeah, deflect and talk about everyone else. Pretty cool.

685
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,740
That's a that's a cool way to be.

686
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,460
Now let's talk about your stomach.

687
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,740
What happened, Jason?

688
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,460
So, OK, so we all got and the rise coming up to this.

689
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,860
So the rise coming after this after this 45 minutes.

690
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,780
First, we'll transport you to Jason's stomach.

691
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,660
You know, it was a long day.

692
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:16,660
It was like I woke up at 4 a.m. that day.

693
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,780
I think I went to bed at 11 p.m. that night.

694
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,260
A good portion of that spent at Disneyland.

695
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:26,220
Jason and I Jason and I Jason and I had seen Doolittle and IMAX

696
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,540
the night before, so we had a wild ride.

697
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,380
So still a little wound up.

698
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,260
It's OK to be sleepy.

699
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,420
I couldn't get to sleep.

700
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,820
I was just thinking that.

701
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,980
Did that sound like Doolittle's Welsh?

702
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,660
No, not at all. It's OK to be scared.

703
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,780
This is my if I had to do my Doolittle, it's OK to be scared.

704
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,420
It's OK to be scared.

705
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,220
Maybe the E is OK to be scared.

706
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,460
I mean, I don't want to drop a spoiler for Doolittle,

707
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,540
but the exit is not consistent.

708
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,340
I don't want to drop a spoiler.

709
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,460
And I didn't see Doolittle, but and I don't want to drop a spoiler for it.

710
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,300
But Dragon's asshole.

711
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,020
I did just drop a spoiler.

712
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,780
But I won't say how a dragon does.

713
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,180
Wait, wait, asshole, Scott.

714
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,420
Seat hole. Seat hole.

715
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,260
I think that's a word. I think.

716
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,420
So seat is more innocent than ass.

717
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,020
I think seat hole is more disgusting than asshole.

718
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,180
I don't know. Let the audience decide.

719
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,780
That's just me, though. Yeah.

720
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,460
Me and the dragon both having intestinal issues that day.

721
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,140
Jason was a lot like the dragon.

722
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,300
I was a lot like the dragon for Doolittle.

723
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:33,220
OK, I mean, I should have account.

724
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,340
I always forget that when it's cold out,

725
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,540
I'm going to spend a lot of time in the cold and I'm going to be up for a long time.

726
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,580
I need to watch what I eat.

727
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,460
And starting the day at 430 a.m.

728
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:46,540
with a large coffee and a donut from 7-Eleven, maybe didn't put me on the best footing.

729
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,100
So I wrote down what I ate to try and figure out where I went wrong.

730
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,460
Coffee and donut at 430 a.m.

731
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,940
around 11, 1130, a vegetarian Ronto wrap in Galaxy.

732
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,660
Very good. Delicious.

733
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,780
Then the Aloha Sculpin, the guava and pineapple

734
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,540
infused IPA at Ballast Point.

735
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,500
Not grapefruit, not grapefruit.

736
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,620
How did you find the price point on that?

737
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:15,260
Actually, I find I think it's fair at micro microbreweries,

738
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,300
usually because you're buying it right from the source.

739
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,340
How much was it? Pretty well priced.

740
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,940
Seven dollars for an eight ounce pour.

741
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,140
Not a full pint still.

742
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,180
And then we had some press.

743
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:26,220
If you buy the bottles from the store, it's much cheaper per bottle.

744
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,260
But that's just you're buying it at a bigger. OK.

745
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,900
We had some pretzel bites with beer cheese for the table.

746
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,180
I really like that beer cheese.

747
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,300
Before the Sculpin, that's where I had the toy

748
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,380
dairy and swirl. And I was like, this is interesting.

749
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,060
I'll try it for the sake of it being interesting.

750
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:50,500
But like spicy cold goo drink, because it had like mango jelly,

751
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,220
like boba kind of jelly in there, too.

752
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,580
That may have been undoing.

753
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,180
Then about three or four, we all got coffees.

754
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,780
I had a tall coffee at Starbucks.

755
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,940
Then I had a granola bar.

756
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,860
And this is where it's I think that many weird

757
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,020
that meant that combination of beverages without food.

758
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,540
And it's not like a firm meal in there, not like a firm meal,

759
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,900
which didn't come until about at nine p.m.

760
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,860
Mike and I stopped at Portillo's and I had a hot dog on the way home.

761
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,500
You had Portillo's. I needed actual food.

762
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,660
The hot dog was fine.

763
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,900
The hot dog helped because you needed actual food, not hot dogs.

764
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,380
It was a Chicago dog.

765
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,220
So the guard, I had the garden and the vegetables.

766
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,300
There was vegetable.

767
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,620
There's any number of pickled vegetables.

768
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,020
Basically like a salad.

769
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,180
It was like a salad, basically, with a little kind of like a salad.

770
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,100
But I thought about getting a Caesar salad and it made the thought made me ill.

771
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,140
Like, I don't know.

772
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,740
Can Caesar salads can be real dicey of like, is this a real Caesar salad

773
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,900
or is this the goo dressing?

774
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,020
Well, most places, it's just the dressing.

775
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:53,500
And so, I mean, by the time you get going to dock on,

776
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,580
you went to docking Bay seven, you ate a dinner dinner,

777
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,620
which had its own calamity of like the restaurants were just crushed.

778
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,700
That's something to watch out for.

779
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,380
We kept experiencing that people were waiting forever for Star Wars food,

780
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,540
just because everybody wants it while this ride is open. Right.

781
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,420
Did you say your Ronto rap?

782
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,860
I said the Ronto. You did. I missed it.

783
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,380
And that was fun, I think, like because it was like, well,

784
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,700
if I had breakfast at 4 a.m., lunch would come six or seven hours later.

785
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,700
That makes sense.

786
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,140
Did you have the veg? I forget.

787
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,100
Did you have vegetarian vegetarian and I really like Michael?

788
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,380
I'm sorry. I zoned right out.

789
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:28,020
I really like the list of what he ate for some bizarre reason.

790
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:32,100
I was like, honestly, and that is weird because I'm usually right along with.

791
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,460
So that is very tuned.

792
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,700
But I came back from the bar and everyone had ordered iced tea.

793
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,380
Well, Scott, you had a glass of wine.

794
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,660
Sure did. And I was like, oh, yeah, maybe I shouldn't have gotten a beer.

795
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,140
It like knew that was the other thing.

796
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,620
I was like, God, I am exhausted.

797
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,660
And it was 1230 p.m.

798
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,140
So I don't know. Getting up that early.

799
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,740
I need to force myself to go to bed a little earlier when I have to get out that early.

800
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,220
I was dressed warm. I was plenty warm.

801
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,140
What do you think cold has to do with it?

802
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,620
The cold just wears on me.

803
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,460
It just I do much better in heat.

804
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,620
I mean, I don't disagree with that.

805
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:08,100
But as far as like your stomach being concerned, like, I don't know.

806
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,340
The cold makes your stomach more stressed out.

807
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,980
You get stressed because it's cold.

808
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:18,100
I think maybe I'm not like mentally stressed, but I feel like I feel very flushed

809
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,420
pretty quickly.

810
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,100
And also, I was pretty like,

811
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,620
but while we were just killing time, waiting for 8 a.m.

812
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:27,300
to roll around, I was starting to lag a bit just because there was no

813
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,980
there wasn't really any. We weren't walking around.

814
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,260
We just kind of hang around, chit chatting, fiddling with our phones.

815
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:37,220
And I think that was like, oh, God, I need to, you know, once we start

816
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,220
going on stuff and walking around, I perked up a little more.

817
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,860
So what happened? You barfered you a lot.

818
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,860
No, I wasn't doing anything for a while.

819
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,940
I was just like stuck.

820
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,460
So we're talking Saturday. You were backed up Friday night.

821
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,300
I was Friday.

822
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,620
Like, finally, once the hot dog got the gears.

823
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,540
And we don't get too gross.

824
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,020
Maybe this is a lot of people's first time listening to podcasts.

825
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,820
All right. If it is. Oh, boy. Yeah.

826
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,460
Just skip ahead like 20.

827
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,460
Yeah, I also don't want to get too gross.

828
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,780
We'll say what's in the right contributor.

829
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,980
But I will say like this is a big part of the podcast.

830
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,740
You know, I just have to get used to it.

831
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,940
Yes. Saturday. I was fucking weird.

832
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,060
I was like, that's not how that's where I'm going.

833
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,700
But I also want to say, like, it is when you're at theme park,

834
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:24,260
it throws off the way your body gets rid of waste.

835
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,780
Like indicated, like if you would, it'll like stop.

836
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,620
It'll stop you from going to the bathroom because like you're on a move

837
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,660
so much. Yeah.

838
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,300
Because you're it's like, you know, you're always in flight.

839
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,700
And I think you're trying to avoid those.

840
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,220
But I think your body does not want to go sit on a theme park.

841
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,300
Well, and yes, I know where the good ones are, but it's never the convenient ones.

842
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,020
Good ones usually good because they're off the beaten path.

843
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,180
You said there is a bathroom in the line for Rise of the Resistance.

844
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,220
That's what I heard. I didn't see it. I didn't see it.

845
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,940
There was one kind of alcove hallway where I was like, maybe it's around there.

846
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,980
Yeah, I'm not sure where it is.

847
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,740
I don't know if I don't know if you asked the R5 droid nicely.

848
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,060
He might have driven us all to a restroom.

849
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,140
Let you to the bathroom.

850
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,100
And then yes, yeah, the bathroom and gotten us off of the ship.

851
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,180
There's a bathroom droid, I assume. Yeah.

852
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,020
You should. Yes, you should.

853
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,700
You should into the bathroom droids head.

854
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:19,500
It's let's see, is there like a dirty number letter situation

855
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,980
we could come up with with the Star Wars bathroom droid is got to be.

856
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,460
Oh, it's just number two.

857
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,340
B.M. two. Yeah, I was going to say like

858
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:33,980
P zero zero P like oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

859
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:38,500
Oh, that works for P zero dash zero P P OOP.

860
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,980
Yeah, that's good.

861
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,980
P OOP is here. Open your head, please.

862
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,820
Master Windu needs to use you.

863
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,980
Master Joe's Mace Windu.

864
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,020
I don't know.

865
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,380
Beep boop boop boop boop.

866
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,140
I like he says thanks.

867
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,980
It's what he lives for.

868
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,060
This is the best.

869
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,180
I kind of took it. Yeah, I think all of Saturday.

870
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,900
Building a bathroom droid instead.

871
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,620
Or no, Anakin was building a bathroom droid instead of C3P.

872
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,460
See, there is the first ready built that wasn't for pooping in. Yeah.

873
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,500
Welcome to podcast right if it's your first time.

874
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,820
So try to just just yeah, your bodies act in differently at a theme park.

875
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:25,180
So I messed up by not having trying to like have three square meals

876
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,140
because every now and then at the parks are like, try this new snack.

877
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,060
And I'm like, well, I guess I kind of want to try.

878
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,180
You don't know if they're going to keep it around for a while.

879
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,700
But like, be careful of that. Just be careful.

880
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,660
Don't go to a hot dog place after all this.

881
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,580
Try the pump that got that put me back on equilibrium

882
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,660
because that was a real real food.

883
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,940
I again question your use of I didn't.

884
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,500
I felt better after the hot.

885
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,820
I felt better out of the hot.

886
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,780
And like Saturday, I just I had like a granola bar.

887
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,420
I drank a lot of water at night.

888
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,580
I had a couple small slices of like cheese pizza, like very simple food.

889
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,260
How much did you sleep?

890
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,420
Because we were obviously we didn't get enough sleep.

891
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,060
How much did you sleep Saturday?

892
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:06,020
Like 10 hours or so, like Friday into Saturday, like 10 hours.

893
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:09,260
Yeah, OK. And then probably a similar.

894
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,860
I was wiped out on Saturday.

895
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,220
I took a nap on Saturday. Yeah, for sure.

896
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,780
It took it out of me.

897
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,780
But my stomach wasn't screwed up, although I didn't.

898
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,260
I did not have any alcohol.

899
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,660
And yeah, anyway, good boy.

900
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,540
I didn't want to get sleepy. Yeah, yeah, it did.

901
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,340
Yes, it did make me sleepy.

902
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,660
So are we there? Do we do it?

903
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,540
Yeah, I think unless you have any more stomach updates.

904
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,660
No, but I do recommend that veggie ronto wrap. Try that.

905
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,860
It is. Yeah, the veggie ronto wrap really good.

906
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:42,340
Sometimes like, yeah, like a veggie sausage or vegan sausage.

907
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,220
Kind of weird. But no, I really liked it.

908
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,020
Yeah. And the veggie thing in Docking Bay also very good.

909
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,660
Oh, it seemed to beat the enduring yip yip.

910
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,380
Which our friend Matt was kind of displeased with.

911
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,660
Right. You warned him, Jason.

912
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,940
So maybe stay away from that yip yip.

913
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,460
It was not like outstanding.

914
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,540
Which is funny because I half mile away

915
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,740
at the Plaza is like amazing. Very good.

916
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:09,660
And I think it's safe to say that the ronto has ronto wrap is very quickly

917
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,500
entered. It's come in hot as one of the best food yet.

918
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,220
Disney parks. Welcome, brother.

919
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:18,020
Welcome to the Sausage Society.

920
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,220
Just need a little more going on.

921
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,740
I needed my jerky and my fancy slaw and my cheetah.

922
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,020
It's very it's a very mature hot dog entry.

923
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,540
And they and I believe they ran out the first day.

924
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,580
People so wanted to pair their rise of the resistance with a ronto wrap

925
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,740
that they they ran out of them.

926
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,980
Then they had more rontos.

927
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,860
I want to try that.

928
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,380
I haven't tried the breakfast one yet either. Yeah.

929
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,820
So, yeah, they keep the variations coming.

930
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,860
Also, I say, yes. Yeah.

931
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,180
Yeah. So rise the resistance.

932
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,700
Yeah. Y'all.

933
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,340
Fuck. We're only two minutes into the podcast.

934
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,140
Yeah. We're so screwed here. God damn it.

935
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:05,220
So, yeah, I mean, I don't think

936
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,460
I don't think anybody was disappointed.

937
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,540
I think all of the speculation we've done over many episodes.

938
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,900
Is this going to be the missing piece?

939
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:17,380
Yeah. Makes the whole galaxy's edge picture work completely.

940
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,900
I know it's it's wonderful. It's it is.

941
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,140
It's really so good. It's really, really amazing.

942
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,180
It's really impressive.

943
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:27,700
I at the end, I have some nitpicky thoughts, but they're all, you know.

944
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,100
I mean, I think, yeah, any attraction, you're going to like

945
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:33,340
there's one or two things, but they like I can imagine

946
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,980
whoever worked on this would be right to tell me to fuck off after I say it.

947
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,900
But I will, because, you know, we have to.

948
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,340
This is what, you know, yeah, that's what we're doing here.

949
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,780
I said when we were there, I was like, it's such a flex.

950
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:51,140
Oh, yeah. I mean, of like what imagineering is capable of with the time and budget.

951
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,380
Yeah, I was trying to think of what is the closest thing even to it?

952
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:59,780
I mean, there's obviously it's it takes elements from every other ride.

953
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,940
Yeah. Yeah. That's the cool thing about it.

954
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,740
Maybe now we say spoiler.

955
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,100
Yeah, I guess we can refer to scenes. Yeah. All right.

956
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,700
You survived. I guess, right.

957
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,060
I hope you enjoyed all the stomach detailing and listen to it.

958
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,780
I have to listen to this after you go on the right.

959
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,940
And I don't also all of those individual items I had.

960
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,420
I think they were all fine.

961
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,860
I don't think any of those were bad.

962
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,980
The combination and the timing is what I'm pissed at that granola bar.

963
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,100
Fuck you, granola bar.

964
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:27,620
I will not have disparaging the fine people in the Nature Valley.

965
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,420
You said, OK.

966
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,620
Wait, you said the items are OK.

967
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:35,500
Yeah. Yeah. You live and you live mostly on kind bars

968
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,260
and I live mostly on nature.

969
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,700
Yeah, that's right. I do have one in my pocket currently. Yeah.

970
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,660
So, yeah.

971
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:47,020
OK. In terms of elements, yes, there are like

972
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,900
it is this bizarre.

973
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,700
How do you even describe the recipe?

974
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,020
It's there's there are definite.

975
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:59,220
I think Indiana Jones is probably the closest analog in terms of scale,

976
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,660
in terms of that it's not a roller coaster, but it's very exciting

977
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,100
in a surprising ride vehicle way.

978
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,780
It does things you don't expect it to do.

979
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:12,780
It's whipping around the biggest scale sets you've ever seen.

980
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:16,500
Yeah. Just I think the the height it is.

981
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:19,780
There are plenty of wonderful attractions that are not tall.

982
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:24,060
All of the Fantasyland dark rides are very short and they're all delightful.

983
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:29,300
But oh, my God, the like, I think not since Indiana Jones

984
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,540
has there been something so multi story

985
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:36,860
and we are exploring every possible corner of this massive building.

986
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,900
You know, I saw an imagine you're referring to like you have to

987
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,220
if you think back to Pirates of the Caribbean, this is a natural

988
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,980
evolution or extension, because that also similarly

989
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,380
puts you right in the middle of a battle.

990
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:54,100
Now you're a kind of an observer, an outside observer to it.

991
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,260
You don't really affect what's going on in pirates.

992
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:00,740
But yeah, pirates in Indiana Jones, kind of the natural.

993
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,900
Yeah, yeah. And there's yeah, definitely pirate component.

994
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,820
And that way, yeah, like here's the zone that kind of eases you into it.

995
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,260
And then it gets super exciting.

996
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:13,100
And then Haunted Mansion components, obviously, in that the cast members

997
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,500
have stuff to do.

998
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,380
There's finally I guess Jungle Cruise, too.

999
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:20,380
There's finally like a third answer to where do you where would you want to work?

1000
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,500
Probably Jungle Cruise and Haunted Mansion, because you get to like

1001
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,820
do the personality choices.

1002
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:28,660
And now you've got this ride with this.

1003
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,420
This is a wonderful role, I think, for a cast member.

1004
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,780
Yeah. Yeah.

1005
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:36,620
The biggest I mean, I guess I shouldn't say the biggest change, because, yeah,

1006
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,620
we're talking about Haunted Mansion and Tower of Terror rides

1007
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:42,340
where the cast members get to do a character if they want

1008
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:46,580
and get to be weird or rude or mean, which is fun.

1009
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:50,500
But this really felt much more because we've you know,

1010
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,420
we've done a couple of immersive things in the last year.

1011
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:54,300
And those are on the rise, I feel like.

1012
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,140
And escape rooms are popular.

1013
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:01,020
And like it felt so very much like one of those things.

1014
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,260
Yeah, it feels like a mega budget immersive experience.

1015
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:07,740
Like I wasn't even expecting it to feel like that much.

1016
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,500
But it is like that's what it is.

1017
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:13,940
Yeah. And the people they have opening this attraction,

1018
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:16,020
the cast members are so on it.

1019
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:20,980
They are so they're like they're performing great while doing just basic.

1020
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,580
How many people in your party?

1021
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:28,060
Yes, you could see a world in 20 years where the performance isn't like

1022
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:29,860
I could see this decaying a little bit.

1023
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,620
And it's a little more like how many how many.

1024
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:36,660
But like opening day doing this in January, 2020,

1025
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,900
you've just got top of the line people.

1026
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:39,900
Everybody's doing a great job.

1027
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,860
Everyone's psyched probably to be there still.

1028
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:46,180
And two different varieties, because half of them are like resistance fighters

1029
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,980
going like, come on, come on, we need your help.

1030
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:52,980
And then the other half are like, Fasci first order, like stand in the line.

1031
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:57,700
Like a British character actor, like you're going to be interrogated momentarily.

1032
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,500
There was one man.

1033
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,620
This guy can't really control how tall he is.

1034
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,540
There was what I will describe as one of the tallest men I have ever seen.

1035
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,620
And he was a first order guy and he was so good.

1036
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:13,620
And he was like menace to small.

1037
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:18,420
Like it was one of the best performance moments I've ever seen in a park

1038
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:21,460
where like there was a kid going like, no way.

1039
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,660
And this guy is like, you're going to get extra interrogation.

1040
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:27,100
And I was like, this is incredible.

1041
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,220
This is so good.

1042
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,580
Yeah, they'll get they'll pick on specific people.

1043
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,980
They'll get right in people's faces.

1044
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:34,980
I mean, how do we do that?

1045
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:38,180
Should we kind of kind of go back a little bit yet to the start?

1046
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,220
I mean, all right.

1047
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:45,140
The line, which in its current state, there may be a point in time

1048
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,700
where you just you get in this line, you're in this line for a long time.

1049
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,540
But right now, it's more like Indiana Jones, where they're holding you outside

1050
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:55,820
and then you just breeze right through it, which is cool because getting to just tear

1051
00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:01,500
through this long series of hallways and not even really perceive everything

1052
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,540
that's there is kind of neat.

1053
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,620
I kind of like just getting to zip through all that.

1054
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:11,260
But clearly, there's amazing details in the line, which is how would you describe it?

1055
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,500
It's a resistance base. It's like a hidden.

1056
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:18,060
It's like hollowed out of like a mountain or of like everything.

1057
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,100
Like you go mind.

1058
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,100
It feels like blown up.

1059
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:23,820
Yes. Form the like the room base in 1917 or something like it is.

1060
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,060
I mean, that's kind of what it is.

1061
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:30,260
Like in a story explanation is that these are like ancient caves,

1062
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,340
like hollowed out ancient caves.

1063
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,860
And the rebels have ad hoc set up a base

1064
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,700
that you can see like stuffs in temporary cages.

1065
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,100
Wires look rigged up like there's a lot of hanging.

1066
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,140
The equivalent of hanging clamp lights.

1067
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,900
So they had to get out of here quickly. They could.

1068
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,380
And then there's yeah, there's weapons and there's weapons or uniforms,

1069
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,020
like computer consoles.

1070
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,980
And it's it's a cousin to

1071
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:01,940
Smuggler's Run in that both clearly start and end that.

1072
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:06,940
But to they keep the general story of the two going.

1073
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:11,060
And it's not like Star Tours, where once you enter the Star Tours building,

1074
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,100
it's just, well, I guess, where are we now?

1075
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:16,700
I don't know. And you end in indoor on whatever other planet.

1076
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,460
And then why are you back in Disneyland?

1077
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,540
Nothing that's ever bothered me about Star Tours.

1078
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:25,300
But it's just cool that they both like to keep but to the live.

1079
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:29,900
It's like it can be one long story going on all these attractions. Right.

1080
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,620
Yeah, that's very cool.

1081
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:35,460
And then, of course, as we know, we've said before, they tie in Star Tours

1082
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,060
to but to in ways as well.

1083
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,340
You see it in there, which is really great.

1084
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:43,580
Yeah, because that because obviously, like they were so gung ho

1085
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:47,380
about making sure all of this story wise made sense

1086
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:53,100
and fit into the official Lucasfilm timeline for the movie.

1087
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:56,380
Super strict, like it's kind of timeless, but it plays

1088
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,860
sometime after Last Jedi before Rise of Skywalker. Right.

1089
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:03,620
Some of the characters have been killed since this ride.

1090
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:07,540
And some of the characters have been killed off screen

1091
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:12,380
on by Wikipedia entries and then specifically nine numb.

1092
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,260
Is that how you say it? Yeah.

1093
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:20,580
The little little dude who drives you around, who operates a vehicle in this.

1094
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:24,660
What in the world? I credit Mike Mitchell with the kind of helping blow that up.

1095
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,900
He died in the battle in Resco, off screen.

1096
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,980
And that guy, he's dead now.

1097
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:33,620
Why? Why did he have to go? I don't know.

1098
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,700
Everyone likes him.

1099
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,140
You would think at least show him getting blown up.

1100
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,820
Happy to see him here.

1101
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:41,260
Somebody that I feel like somebody tried to dispute that

1102
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,500
that he actually died off screen.

1103
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,540
I feel like that's a debate maybe now, but I don't know.

1104
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,860
Was somebody on a Wikipedia making a big leap?

1105
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:51,260
I have no idea. Yeah.

1106
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:52,140
The whole.

1107
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:55,380
Do you know the story of the voice?

1108
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,780
Do you remember this being talked about in a panel a long time ago?

1109
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,580
Familiar. It's this is this was the case with

1110
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,420
this guy. The guy who did it was his name is Kip Singh.

1111
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,780
Rodech, that's the voice of this little pilot guy and I know.

1112
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:16,340
And he he did he did those lines in Return of the Jedi

1113
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:19,060
in a mix of Kenyan dialects.

1114
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:21,540
Oh, I don't know this. Who he was,

1115
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,340
was a he was interning.

1116
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:29,860
He was like he had traveled from Kenya and was interning at Skywalker Sound

1117
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,660
and had been helping out Ben Burt, who did all who did like design

1118
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:36,300
the Sanford Star Wars and ultimately did Wally. Right.

1119
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,900
That's the same guy. Yeah, I think. Right. That's right.

1120
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,580
I think so. So he was.

1121
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,980
Yeah, he was around.

1122
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:48,860
And I think the way he made it over is that he met on a safari.

1123
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:53,420
Pat Welsh, the old lady who voiced E.T.

1124
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,980
Wow. Like a kind of a husky, raspy voice

1125
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,220
that lend itself to E.T.

1126
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:02,940
And they connected in Kenya and that caused him to come learn about making movies.

1127
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,420
Oh, my God. In the Bay Area with Ben Burt.

1128
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:09,460
So he had these couple lines and this was that character wasn't like anything

1129
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,780
anybody was thinking about then.

1130
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,340
So just like, I don't know, could you do it?

1131
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:14,300
And he like, well, maybe it'll sound like an alien language

1132
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,460
if I combine a couple dialects.

1133
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,340
And then he goes back to Kenya.

1134
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:21,500
This becomes legendary on the way to Force Awakens.

1135
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,180
And this is last minute.

1136
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,460
They cut to that character and nobody was thinking about dialogue.

1137
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:29,980
And then in the sound step of it, they're like, we should give him some lines.

1138
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:31,300
But how do you even write lines for that?

1139
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:33,660
Because who knows these dialects? Right. Where's that guy?

1140
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,860
And it was incredibly hard to track him down.

1141
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,820
And Pat Welsh had died.

1142
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,500
So that connect was out the window.

1143
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,300
And it's as long as you can read it on Star Wars dot com.

1144
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,700
The story of finding this guy.

1145
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,180
And then eventually he was going by a different name.

1146
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,540
And they did track him down in Kenya.

1147
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:52,380
But this came up in a star in a panel with Trowbridge,

1148
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,340
where they got him back for the ride, too.

1149
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,740
And they went and recorded him in Nairobi.

1150
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:58,140
Whoa. Wow. Yeah.

1151
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:02,780
So this so when you hear his dialogue in this ride, that was recorded in Kenya.

1152
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:07,020
And this man was just off the no one had like had eyes on this guy

1153
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,820
through the 80s, 90s and 2000s.

1154
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,300
And now he's back doing this character again.

1155
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:15,180
And he hasn't like obviously he wasn't like going to conventions cashing in.

1156
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,700
No. Yeah.

1157
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,820
I don't think he realized the degree to which it had taken off.

1158
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,340
I think he was surprised to be contacted.

1159
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:27,220
And he also apparently when they got a hold of him, he told a story that he was also

1160
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,860
he was around Skywalker when they were doing ET.

1161
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:33,940
And Ben Burt wanted him to do ET.

1162
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:39,220
Whoa. And he deferred to his friend, Pat, who thought like she deserves it.

1163
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:42,580
She's the one who she brought me here and she should do it.

1164
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,460
Like there was like, which one's going to do it?

1165
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,060
And he gave it to her. Selfless.

1166
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,700
He could have been ET to this.

1167
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,100
This is all the strangest. That's wild. I didn't know any of that.

1168
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,100
That's great. Shout out to tonight.

1169
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,140
It was wonderful to see in this thing.

1170
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:57,220
It's like it's a great trick of he's on monitors doing a lot more,

1171
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:00,500
but you really only see the back of his head in the in the attraction.

1172
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,140
A lot of animatronics in this.

1173
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,460
Some very complex, some kind of simpler,

1174
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:09,220
but works because they're either far away or they only have to do one thing.

1175
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:14,180
Yeah. So there's many, many pre shows. Yes.

1176
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,460
It's like five pre shows. It's funny.

1177
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:20,260
I think we didn't know the amount of we'd always heard,

1178
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,540
like it's kind of this pre rides and then the ride.

1179
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,940
We didn't know in what order and how many.

1180
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:28,580
It's interesting now, because I've been reading rumors about this for five years.

1181
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:29,660
Five years. Yeah.

1182
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,100
And at a certain point, there was a rumor, which I'm sure I excitedly said

1183
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:37,940
to somebody in my vicinity, that you would get off in the middle of the ride.

1184
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,780
Obviously, that was like a telephone.

1185
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,980
I mean, I don't know if maybe that at a certain point was the idea,

1186
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,220
but that that feels like a telephone thing

1187
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:48,020
because there's so many different pre shows and then a bigger pre show

1188
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:50,300
and another pre show and another pre show. Yeah.

1189
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:55,460
And so that I could see where that kind of feels like you get off of a ride

1190
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:59,260
and then you go on another ride, which is what kind of happens. Yeah. Yeah.

1191
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,340
It's just not that the main ride

1192
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:04,820
causes for you to like literally step off. Right.

1193
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:06,180
Once you're on the right, you're on the ride.

1194
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,020
But yeah, it is this multi room.

1195
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:10,940
And even though there's there's a ride component

1196
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:15,220
and then things you might consider lines in that you're not in it for very long.

1197
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:18,300
Right. It's like and it makes story sense.

1198
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,740
They've figured out a story reason why a bunch of people would be lined up.

1199
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,020
And those are very interesting rooms to be in.

1200
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,860
I'm just delighted talking about it.

1201
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:30,420
It could be telephone or as we were told by someone that day,

1202
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:34,140
every now and then, cast members will purposely feed outlets.

1203
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:38,300
Oh, disinformation either for any number of reasons.

1204
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:43,020
Either to protect stuff or because they're mad about something or just for fun.

1205
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,060
What we were told was, yeah, maybe it was just like just for fun.

1206
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:51,540
Sometimes there will be cast members trying to disrupt the flow of rumors.

1207
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,140
That's so great.

1208
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,820
Yes, because I'm watching you like a hawk now.

1209
00:56:55,860 --> 00:57:00,340
So is it possible that that rumor that Galaxy's Edge will be replaced by Aladdin

1210
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:03,780
and that and as the website that I read it on,

1211
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,900
where Aladdin is misspelled in the article is.

1212
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:10,780
So is it possible that Disney isn't going to replace Galaxy's Edge

1213
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,460
with a misspelled Aladdin?

1214
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,300
Well, no, because that's been debunked.

1215
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:17,820
It is going to become Lord of the Rings. Oh, OK.

1216
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:22,460
Lord of the Rings will exist in two different parks after they bulldozed

1217
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:23,820
Toon Lagoon.

1218
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:27,060
Rise of the Ring. It'll turn to rise of the ring.

1219
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:30,340
They're just going to put a beard on Hux and he will be. Yeah.

1220
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,060
So not Gollum, who has a beard?

1221
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,020
I missed that.

1222
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:39,020
And number of our dear friends on Middle Earth.

1223
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:42,460
Yes. OK, so

1224
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,140
hologram room.

1225
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:47,820
Oh, yeah. So the first room is

1226
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:50,500
you're getting your first of many briefings.

1227
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:54,820
Yes. And you first see BB8, who's sort of in a similar spot

1228
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:56,980
to like where Rocket is a similar height.

1229
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,420
But it's a little around a little shelf.

1230
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,180
And he's rolling around, doing a ton.

1231
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:05,900
And clearly, there's like some extra business of beeps that can fill delays.

1232
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,900
And you're delighted to see him beeping.

1233
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,900
You know, this is probably a stall, but it's wonderful to see.

1234
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,620
You watch him talk for as long as possible.

1235
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:16,820
Gasping in so many of these rooms, there's so many surprising elements.

1236
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,580
And even I would say it takes a lot to surprise us.

1237
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,620
Yeah. But there was one or two things where I went, oh, yeah,

1238
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,060
I kept doing it throughout.

1239
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:27,180
And even that first BB8 appearance, I don't think I was ready for something

1240
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:31,380
that I wasn't ready to like see a friend already.

1241
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:33,420
It's still unassuming.

1242
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,700
There's two doors, and you're like, is this where it kind of kicks in?

1243
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:38,500
But you don't expect to walk in the room and he's just there saying hi to you.

1244
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,500
Yeah, because even there's a delay with Rocket.

1245
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,460
He doesn't he's not immediately there. Yeah.

1246
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,420
And he is like and they, you know, they have him.

1247
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:48,620
He is like doing the things he does in the movie.

1248
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:51,100
Like he wrote. Yes, Jason said he's he's rolling around.

1249
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,940
He's beeping. He's doing all the adorable stuff.

1250
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:57,220
Yeah. The only thing it misses is him doing the little thumbs up

1251
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:59,140
that he does in Force Awakens.

1252
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,860
They already looked expensive.

1253
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:03,060
So I could only imagine what that would cost.

1254
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:06,100
Yeah, really. And there's multiple of him because that's a point where you go.

1255
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,580
I think you get to room.

1256
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:10,060
There's a split off at that point. Yeah.

1257
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:13,260
And then you get briefed by a ray hologram.

1258
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,980
And that's a high quality hologram.

1259
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:20,860
Yeah. Holograms have been portrayed and they like in many iterations

1260
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:22,060
of Star Tours now.

1261
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,540
But that's a boy that is a clean, good looking hologram.

1262
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,700
And it's projected on a mirror.

1263
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,100
Well, it's like there's a mirror and it's on an angle.

1264
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:32,220
And it looks like the thing.

1265
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:36,260
And I know there's multiple rooms that have the same pre-show and it looks like

1266
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,020
like a lot of cave is behind her to.

1267
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:40,540
But it's a mirror.

1268
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:46,260
And as if there is like the hologram is just coming from the machine,

1269
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:49,340
like up and down, like there's not a hidden thing behind it.

1270
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:50,540
Yes. Right. Right. Right.

1271
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,660
So it's a very effective effect.

1272
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:56,740
I think the only way you can really like kind of see what's going on

1273
00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:00,860
is if you really get up on the side of it, you can kind of you can see that she

1274
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:02,340
doesn't it isn't as three dimensional.

1275
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:05,260
But like that's obviously a who's going to do that.

1276
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,220
People were excited when that appeared.

1277
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:12,860
People were excited when a second later Poe Oscar Isaac shows up on screen.

1278
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,940
Yeah. This is we were talking about this in last week's episode with Paul

1279
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:21,260
about people not wanting to maybe do actors, not wanting to do rides

1280
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:23,540
based on, you know, the movie or whatever.

1281
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:28,180
But I think we are in a new a new world where every actor does it now.

1282
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:31,140
For the most part, because like Guardians, the whole cast is on it.

1283
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:33,460
And the whole cast is here. Yeah.

1284
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:37,380
And a few of them who had appeared in Star Tours previously

1285
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:39,820
and kind of get more to do here.

1286
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:41,260
And I think everybody does a great job.

1287
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:46,420
I think particularly John Boyega doing all of the narration throughout,

1288
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:50,860
like especially him, like the elevator part.

1289
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,540
He's a lot of fun. Oh, yeah.

1290
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:54,500
It's bad. Up is very bad. Yeah. Yeah.

1291
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:55,620
They're all giving it their all.

1292
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:56,740
They all feel like the characters.

1293
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:59,780
And I think all of these things, all these scenes were shot between.

1294
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:03,900
I heard that somebody somewhere that I think the Poe Dameron

1295
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:08,340
part was shot in a rare moment of downtime on Last Jedi

1296
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,860
because Rian Johnson was going to his sister's wedding.

1297
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:14,260
So they had a tiny window where he'd been working.

1298
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:16,180
It wasn't even like they didn't especially

1299
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:19,820
they they got to the set and found a rare window where

1300
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,980
everybody wasn't super busy.

1301
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:24,580
OK, I will drop a nitpicky thing here right now

1302
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:26,780
that took me out of it a little.

1303
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:30,540
It the Poe footage is a little too clear,

1304
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:35,220
like shot on iPhone level clear compared to the Chewbacca footage

1305
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:39,820
in Smuggler's Run, which looks like the kind of 70.

1306
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:43,740
You know, Star Wars is kind of stuck in 70s version of the future.

1307
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:47,180
Sure. That that kind of I was like,

1308
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:51,020
did they shoot him on a video camera real quick?

1309
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,180
Like, I don't it wasn't a huge thing.

1310
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,180
It was only a beat of like, wait, something.

1311
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:56,500
You want a dirty lens.

1312
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,780
I wanted it all a little grainier.

1313
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:00,860
But again, who cares?

1314
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,020
But that was my only thing.

1315
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:05,780
And Nyan Nub is a CGI in this part, too. Yeah.

1316
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:09,980
And this character, what we're about to talk about was his robot, I believe.

1317
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,460
Or a facsimile of I don't know if it was the exact robot

1318
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,660
or some of the video. Yeah, I don't know.

1319
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:19,580
Because like Hondo in Millennium Falcon is

1320
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:24,620
he's an actor with a suit on in the video, the pre-ride video. Yeah.

1321
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:27,060
And then he's the robot you see in the pre-show.

1322
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:28,060
Could be the same deal.

1323
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:30,260
It could be a similar situation with kind of funny.

1324
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:33,100
We don't know. But we should talk about him. Sure.

1325
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:36,980
Yeah. So you walk outside, you see Poe Dameron's X wing

1326
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:40,940
with BB-8 also moving around on the top, which is very cute. Yeah.

1327
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:43,020
Oh, yeah. And she raised sends him off.

1328
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,020
Like, shouldn't you be working on the plane?

1329
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:47,580
And that's a payoff when you go outside. Oh, wait.

1330
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:49,580
Well, and gasp moments.

1331
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:52,500
The doors opening and realizing you're going back outside

1332
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:56,460
because you are accustomed on any ride to think, especially in the line.

1333
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:58,700
Yeah. When you were in an indoor part.

1334
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,380
That right now, we're in the show building.

1335
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:03,220
It is such a surprise that you're in this this alcove

1336
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:07,460
that I'm sure is not that big of a footprint, but feels huge.

1337
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:08,660
Yeah, it's really grand.

1338
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:12,340
And probably the people are walking by on the other side, not that far.

1339
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,220
But boy, does it feel like a massive hangar.

1340
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:18,140
And you can't. Yeah. And you can't see it from outside.

1341
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,820
It's only it's like a big reveal.

1342
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:24,340
And it's a it's some sort of Karelian freighter. Right.

1343
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:26,460
Is that the name? It's like a transport ship.

1344
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:28,940
And then you have a black X wing.

1345
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:32,420
I honestly, in all the reading about what this ride was going to be,

1346
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:34,700
I thought this would be a longer queue area.

1347
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:37,180
I thought you would hang out here for a while.

1348
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,140
You go through it pretty quick.

1349
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:42,140
I had to watch a few videos to catch a few little to realize like, oh, BB-8

1350
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:44,420
Yeah, is moving in the X way.

1351
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:46,900
Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of saying hi to you. Yeah.

1352
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:51,780
Yeah. There's several points of this where you want to stay behind

1353
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:54,020
and take pictures, but you kind of got to keep moving.

1354
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:56,900
So it all it all leaves you wanting more, which is great.

1355
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:59,580
It makes you want to come back and like hope there's a stall.

1356
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:01,420
So you can take pictures of everything.

1357
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,940
But you're pretty quickly in that transport vehicle,

1358
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:08,980
which is going to take you to another planet where the First Order can't get to you.

1359
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:11,060
Yes. Yes. That's not how it works out.

1360
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:15,180
But when you when you are in there, when you walk into that ship,

1361
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:18,540
I think one of our new favorite friends

1362
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:21,260
and all of Disney theme park, yes. Yes.

1363
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:24,540
Beck, Lieutenant Beck, the monk calamari

1364
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,580
because Admiral Ackbar

1365
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:32,740
coldly killed in Last Jedi, at least it was on screen, I guess.

1366
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:34,340
It was referred to.

1367
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:35,500
It was referred to.

1368
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,820
But I would have liked a bigger send off, I will say, for Admiral Ackbar.

1369
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:40,580
I would have liked a big stream send off.

1370
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:43,820
But since he is gone yet, that would have been good.

1371
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:48,660
Since he has gone a new monk calamari, I guess they're just very good captains.

1372
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:52,020
They can pilot ships very well or they can give commands.

1373
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,180
He's not really he's just kind of sitting in there.

1374
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:58,380
He's sitting in a little rotating chair while Nyan does the actual driving of it.

1375
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:01,020
So he's like we were talking about Gilligan's Island recently.

1376
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:06,500
He is he is the skipper and Gilligan is like Nyan. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1377
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:10,340
But Lieutenant Beck, he is he is a full animatronic.

1378
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,740
He is. Yeah. He does a lot.

1379
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:14,740
He can move. He can. Yeah.

1380
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:17,180
And you can get so close to him.

1381
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:20,020
You can be right next to him. It's amazing.

1382
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:22,060
Really? Just like, no.

1383
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:26,180
I mean, is it I think any way you board, he's on the right.

1384
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:28,220
So go to the right. Yeah.

1385
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:31,260
And there's also if you get crammed in and can't really see,

1386
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:35,780
there are screens everywhere of you can see communications between characters

1387
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:39,740
and stuff. And then there's a screen at the back of the vehicle

1388
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:41,380
and a screen at the front of the vehicle.

1389
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:43,140
And there's only OK.

1390
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:44,260
So this is OK.

1391
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:47,940
So I don't know if anyone is actually interested in this, but there are two different.

1392
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,260
I just said this.

1393
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:53,140
There are two different rooms with Ray and BB8 and they're reversed.

1394
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:54,500
So there's two different presure rooms.

1395
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,340
And then you all load out into the same area,

1396
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:59,620
which we're talking about the outside area with Poe Dameron.

1397
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:02,500
And then the two and then you reform with one in this one group.

1398
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,540
And you reform into this one group with this ship.

1399
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:09,700
Now, I heard I read that there are three different

1400
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,740
insides of this ship.

1401
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:14,740
OK, that rotate. Yeah.

1402
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:17,620
Turntable, turntable style. Yeah, I see.

1403
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:20,700
So so you'll always get yeah, you'll always get Lieutenant

1404
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:24,260
back and I and on the right and on and the back area

1405
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:26,540
where you can see like you're where you're flying out of.

1406
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:29,460
Which means there's three sets of animatronics. Yes.

1407
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:32,060
This amazing among calamari.

1408
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:34,860
There are three of them in the back of nine's head.

1409
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:37,500
That's so cool.

1410
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:41,980
And you're the turntable effect is so surprising

1411
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:45,580
because you really think you have this thing figured out.

1412
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:50,660
You think that this is haunted mansion elevator.

1413
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:54,220
You think it's like kind of a false moving room

1414
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:59,060
that's like that's because it's supposed to be a spaceship.

1415
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,900
So you are you're shaking around.

1416
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:02,060
It's vibrating.

1417
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:04,100
And but you're like, well, it's maybe it's like haunted mansion

1418
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,820
or it's like a journey to the center of the earth has in Japan

1419
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:09,460
has something like this, like an elevator

1420
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:12,460
that's taking you way down into the earth.

1421
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:15,420
And so like I think I thought, all right,

1422
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:18,140
so it's a stationary thing like Star Tours and I'll get out the other side.

1423
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:22,220
Yeah. So you yeah, you walk in and there's a door where you obviously where you come in.

1424
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:24,820
And then on the other side of the transport, there's another door.

1425
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:29,060
So obviously everyone assumes I know how rides work.

1426
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:30,820
That's the door we're leaving.

1427
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:34,260
Whenever whatever happens, happens, because of course it does.

1428
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:36,700
This is as you're saying, this is stationary.

1429
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:38,620
We know how this type of thing works. Yeah.

1430
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:42,580
But yeah, you go through the whole pre show and it's like, you know, as you imagine,

1431
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:46,020
like you're going and all of a sudden the first order is there and they're shooting at you.

1432
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:50,860
And what's really fun is that everywhere you are in the transport,

1433
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,860
you can see different kind of stuff.

1434
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:56,460
There's little screens with different like pictures of the

1435
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:59,180
or the X-Wing pilots.

1436
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,500
There's different like radar.

1437
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:05,300
You can see yourself taking off from the planet and going into space.

1438
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:07,620
Which it it stays.

1439
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:11,420
The screen is consistent with the outdoor area that you just left.

1440
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:16,260
So if you left during the day, then what's behind Beck is during the day.

1441
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:17,660
And if it's night, it's night.

1442
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:18,900
Which is insane. Yeah.

1443
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:22,500
That's a whole other set of footage they had to create.

1444
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:28,380
And then time of like, OK, the sun has set, switch over.

1445
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:32,140
Yeah, there's probably multiple versions for like bright sunlight.

1446
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:34,060
Well, that's what I want to know. Yeah.

1447
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:39,540
I want to know, like on a rainy day, how does it look on a on a very bright day?

1448
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,340
How does it look at dusk?

1449
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:43,900
How does it look when it's dark? How does it look?

1450
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:47,220
I don't know. There's also

1451
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:51,900
the person who is kind of showing us around knew the ropes.

1452
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:57,740
Showed pointed out there's a skylight that also is a point of consistency

1453
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:00,780
where if it's during the day, it's not a full window,

1454
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:03,380
but natural light is coming into this vehicle.

1455
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,580
And then once you're in space, there's no more natural light.

1456
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:07,020
Yes. Very, very cool.

1457
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:09,300
Yeah. Delineates the time of day.

1458
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,980
Because, yeah. So, yeah, we were looking at that.

1459
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:14,860
And then, yeah, getting up close to Lieutenant Beck.

1460
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:21,260
Yeah. Which just I feel like we were like I'm imagining like a like

1461
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:25,380
like when someone's infatuated with somebody and they have their hands up

1462
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:28,780
under their chin, you know, and I'm so how would you describe the motion I'm making?

1463
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:30,220
Yeah. You know what I mean?

1464
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:32,820
Smitten like if you have a crush on the teacher.

1465
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:35,740
Yeah, there you go. That's exactly what I'm looking for.

1466
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:36,780
That's what we were like.

1467
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:39,500
I love run of Lieutenant Beck. Yeah.

1468
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:42,700
Yes. Just kind of like because you can really post up on there and you try

1469
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:45,300
not you can't you shouldn't get in the way because there's a lot of people

1470
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,180
in the transport. Mm hmm.

1471
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:49,100
But we were just like, oh, look at this guy.

1472
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:53,260
So cool. You get close enough to see his little tentacles wiggle.

1473
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,460
Yeah. When he moves around.

1474
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:57,460
And this whole thing is it's like a subway car.

1475
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:00,700
Basically, they found a way to do a simulator where you don't have to sit

1476
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:01,700
or be in seat belts.

1477
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:03,620
Right. There's rails you can grab on to.

1478
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:05,020
You don't really need to.

1479
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:07,020
But sometimes you feel like you need to.

1480
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:08,380
Yeah. Yeah. Here and there.

1481
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:11,820
Like, yeah, you're on a cruise ship or a bus like in your standing up.

1482
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:14,300
It was more than I thought there would be, honestly.

1483
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:15,460
Yeah. Bump wise.

1484
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:16,860
So, yeah, you get it going.

1485
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:20,020
I think, yeah, if I was a kid, as I've said before, I got scared

1486
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:24,740
because I wanted this weird UFO thing at Santa's or not Santa's Pirates Cove Park

1487
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:28,060
as a child and there were there was light coming out of the door

1488
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:29,780
and I still thought we were in space.

1489
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:33,860
So as a kid, I would have been fully believing that this was going on.

1490
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:37,260
Oh, also, two characters die horribly in this.

1491
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:39,180
Oh, yeah.

1492
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:41,660
Downs to X-wing pilots blow up

1493
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:43,740
as they often will do.

1494
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,460
Yeah. Oh, I don't know.

1495
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:47,500
What do we have their names or do we not know?

1496
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:49,060
Can we pay proper tribute to them?

1497
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:51,380
Red and blue. Red and blue.

1498
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:52,860
Yeah. Poor red and blue.

1499
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:56,860
Yeah. So you encounter some trouble.

1500
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:58,580
We don't get to the safe planet.

1501
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:02,740
The First Order intercepts us and we are told, prepare to be boarded.

1502
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:05,500
And because you think you know how things work,

1503
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,540
everybody looks out the other door. Right.

1504
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:13,020
And then in many it really felt like there was full whiplash.

1505
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,380
Everybody staring into the wrong place.

1506
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:19,340
And you hear a voice and you look back out the door.

1507
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,100
You came in. Yeah.

1508
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:23,820
And an audible scream from the crowd.

1509
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:27,540
Everyone just went, ha, like everyone was like

1510
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:31,180
the one of the biggest pops I've ever heard in a theme park.

1511
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:34,460
One of the biggest surprises. Yeah, absolutely.

1512
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:37,220
Partially because there's a person there and the effect freaked you out.

1513
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,900
Mostly because the last time you looked out that door,

1514
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:42,300
it was real world outside.

1515
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:46,380
And now you're looking out that door and you are in a First Order ship.

1516
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:48,260
Yeah, it's it's crazy.

1517
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:51,660
And I swear, I read this because there were there were people,

1518
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:55,420
I think, when the press happened initially for Galaxy's Edge

1519
01:11:55,540 --> 01:12:00,060
that did this part of the ride, like leading up to just this next part.

1520
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:04,100
Yes. And I believe this illusion was given away.

1521
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:08,300
And I'm sure because I'm spoiler hungry and I read a lot of stuff

1522
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:10,500
that I knew it, totally forgot it.

1523
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,940
And I was just as shocked as everyone else was.

1524
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:18,020
And because the room you open to the docking bay you open to is so large.

1525
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:20,380
It's so big. Yeah.

1526
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:23,580
So, yeah, what we were saying before is there's a turntable

1527
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:26,380
with three of these things on it, apparently.

1528
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:30,860
And yeah, there's one that's docked in the Star Destroyer.

1529
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:37,180
There's one that's docked outside on the Resistance planet or whatever the base.

1530
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,620
And then there's just one like in motion sort of.

1531
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:40,780
So you can in transit.

1532
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:45,980
So every every part of this, you can see how they keep the lines moving

1533
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:50,460
and you can keep people going through it because it's so it's it's

1534
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:52,500
it seems like what we were told, I forget the numbers,

1535
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:56,020
but it's going to be when it's running a very efficient

1536
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:58,700
kind of people eating experience.

1537
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:01,900
Even though it feels like no one's on the ride.

1538
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:04,700
Yes. Yeah. You think this is like Spider-Man or something

1539
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:07,580
where you can't imagine there's like not that many people going through.

1540
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:10,620
Like you feel like the line should it should be three hours to wait for it.

1541
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:15,700
It's estimated like at full when this starship is at full capacity,

1542
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:18,020
whatever they say in New Hope. Yeah.

1543
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:20,460
Fully operational.

1544
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:24,380
Estimated, they were saying, estimated at pirate approaching

1545
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:30,260
Pirates of the Caribbean levels, which is usually estimated at 2800 people an hour.

1546
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:32,580
Wow. Yeah. And yeah, of course.

1547
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:35,340
Yeah. So and as you were saying, the difference is here,

1548
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:38,860
they've done it and they've chopped it up in pre shows

1549
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:43,420
to try to make it feel much more intimate.

1550
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:45,860
Obviously, when you're in the line and when they when they're

1551
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:49,380
just maybe having a standby queue, you'll be in line

1552
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:52,860
up until the ray room for with a bunch of people for 45 minutes.

1553
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:57,020
But once you hit the ray room, the idea really is supposed to make you feel like

1554
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:00,740
it's kind of you and like 30 people, you and 25 people are on this.

1555
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:02,940
And you shouldn't see more than that.

1556
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:06,500
Yeah, you should probably want you shouldn't feel like you're being dumped

1557
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:09,980
into just an endless line like almost every other ride it has.

1558
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:14,260
Being given so many treats, you don't realize you're like you're already in it.

1559
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:16,860
Like you're still being herded through. Yeah.

1560
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:18,580
And everything's cool. Yes.

1561
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:22,100
And all the pre shows it's because and you can see it in like

1562
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:25,180
their their way of thinking with the tickets with Avatar,

1563
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:27,100
because there are a lot of pre shows.

1564
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:29,620
You could argue they're not quite as fun as this.

1565
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:31,860
The scan scanning.

1566
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:36,140
But you can see that they're they've they're slowly perfecting

1567
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:41,140
mega e tickets that can really absorb a lot of people.

1568
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:46,260
Yeah. And what's funny is it's all distraction and stagecraft

1569
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:48,780
and little tricks.

1570
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:52,420
It's all the like tenons of the actress,

1571
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:56,500
like classical theater tricks and magic tricks.

1572
01:14:56,500 --> 01:15:02,900
Like it's all very old school, just done in different ways

1573
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:04,220
and with a lot of technology.

1574
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:06,260
There's so much technology in this.

1575
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:11,180
Yeah. And there's a lot of technology like there's so much stuff

1576
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:13,500
that isn't in your face technology, too.

1577
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,820
I mean, we'll get there, I think, one more or more on the ride itself.

1578
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:20,220
For it's like little tiny stuff happens.

1579
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:23,140
And you again, you wouldn't like notice it really.

1580
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:24,700
It's just sort of in the background.

1581
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:26,740
So much technology is just used to like

1582
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:29,820
help a little piece of something else along.

1583
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:32,580
But if you really look at it, you're like, oh, that's an impressive illusion.

1584
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:35,100
That's an impressive little piece right there.

1585
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:37,100
Illusions, details Easter.

1586
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:41,420
Like there's stuff I only caught rewinding like ride through videos of like,

1587
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:45,620
oh, my God, I just realized the question I had of like,

1588
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:49,380
where did that character end up is explained in the distant.

1589
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:52,460
The deep background of a video is justified.

1590
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,660
Geez. Wow. Wow.

1591
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:57,820
And then I guess also presumably when you enter this transport

1592
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:59,980
and you exit the transport, you when you're in the

1593
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:03,860
Star Destroyer is at the when you're when you're in the Star Destroyer,

1594
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:06,180
you see the outside of the of the ship.

1595
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:08,220
But that's a facade probably. Right.

1596
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:11,100
Like that never moves. But the interior. Yeah.

1597
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,260
It's just yeah. So yeah.

1598
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:13,380
Basically what is it?

1599
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:16,860
Is it a Karelian transport? Am I wrong with the distinction of the craft?

1600
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:22,780
So yeah, they just have a set like exterior for that spaceship

1601
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:25,980
inside the Star Destroyer and then outside by the base.

1602
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:30,660
Looks very similar to the transport ship Leia is on in the very first scene

1603
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:34,020
of A New Hope. Yeah. The blockade runner. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

1604
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:35,580
Yeah. Oh, sure.

1605
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:37,500
So yeah, that's just that's obviously always sitting there.

1606
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,500
That doesn't move at all. That's really cool.

1607
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,180
That's what I'm really thinking about that.

1608
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:44,060
So yeah, you get you get boarded.

1609
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:48,180
You were told to proceed off to the right for interrogation.

1610
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:52,740
You're trying to move you through clearly, even though you are brought out

1611
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:57,540
onto one of the most jaw dropping sets you've ever seen.

1612
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:59,740
One of the tallest sets you've ever seen.

1613
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:05,260
And this is where much documented the 100 storm troopers are standing.

1614
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:07,140
Yeah. And I think they're 50, actually.

1615
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:08,820
It's OK. It's not 100.

1616
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:12,220
But that was another the rumor was because I was again five years ago

1617
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:14,740
was reading like then you there's 100 storm troopers.

1618
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:15,620
And I think I don't know.

1619
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:18,540
Maybe it was in blue sky or something, but I think it's closer to 50.

1620
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:22,420
And they're standing in front of

1621
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:25,820
the biggest screen I've ever seen, maybe outside of like when I was at

1622
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:28,980
I was at WrestleMania and Santana.

1623
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:31,740
Yeah. At the whatever stadium, Levi's Stadium.

1624
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:34,300
But that's the biggest screen I've ever seen.

1625
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:38,020
Disney, the Guardian screens and the screens in this attraction.

1626
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:41,220
I'm like, well, these screens, how are these so clear?

1627
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:43,180
Like, how are these so good?

1628
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:46,940
And Guardian screen, which is very big, but Guardian screen, you know,

1629
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,780
isn't nearly as big as the thing is.

1630
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:50,860
No, certainly not.

1631
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:53,980
So that was just very impressed because that's just looking out into space.

1632
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:59,420
And I just yeah, this how do you think this is a two story room?

1633
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:01,220
How tall do you think this is?

1634
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:02,140
Three and a half, three.

1635
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:03,260
It's a scaled down.

1636
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:06,940
I mean, it's not full stop, but there's a there's an X swing in here.

1637
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,060
Or not a tie fighter. Yeah.

1638
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:12,180
A giant tie fighter, which I didn't even notice at first.

1639
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:14,140
That's very funny because, yeah, yeah.

1640
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:16,700
There's so many things I didn't notice until later.

1641
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:20,500
And then the stuff that I noticed that you guys hadn't seen.

1642
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:22,700
Sure. There's a transport.

1643
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:27,500
There's the vehicle that you end up on later in the ride with an R5 droid.

1644
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:31,140
Yeah. And I hadn't put together till later that that is that's showing you

1645
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:34,060
there's vehicles we have in this

1646
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:36,420
in the Star Cruiser.

1647
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,780
And these guys are we have bad droid.

1648
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,260
We have evil droids.

1649
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:42,620
So register this. These are bad.

1650
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:45,860
I believe that's also there for I could be wrong,

1651
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:48,500
but I believe that's also there for

1652
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:52,100
you taking a photo in it, because people sometimes want to take photos

1653
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,700
when you actually load onto it.

1654
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,460
And that is not a good time to know.

1655
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:58,700
Oh, interesting. So if you do a quick one, like it's funny because

1656
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:02,740
the people in there are playing first order officers and they're being mean to you.

1657
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:06,460
But they also know that like everybody in here wants to take a bunch of pictures

1658
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:07,740
and hang out for a second.

1659
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:10,500
So it feels like you need to leave quickly.

1660
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,900
But they give you a minute or two.

1661
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:12,780
But they give you a minute or two.

1662
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,980
I think three or four minutes, they start to bug you.

1663
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:18,100
It would be funny to I don't know what their directive is.

1664
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:22,180
If it's like if somebody asks, can I can you take a photo of me in this vehicle?

1665
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:23,700
What they do?

1666
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:27,460
I found a video where the picture taking is justified.

1667
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:32,060
A cast member says document your capture if you must, but proceed to the right.

1668
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:34,220
That's good. Nice. Yeah, really like that.

1669
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:36,820
That is good. Yeah, because that's a hard thing to justify.

1670
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:38,340
Taking cell phone. Sure.

1671
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:41,660
And they and I think on one of the times we went, somebody says,

1672
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:45,420
like, what is the line?

1673
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:48,740
Oh, I just I've never seen people so excited to be taken prisoner.

1674
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:51,540
Yeah, that is funny.

1675
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:53,020
The stormtroopers twitch.

1676
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:54,460
Do some of them twitch?

1677
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:55,780
Which are all of them.

1678
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:58,060
Some of them are more static than others.

1679
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:01,460
Mm hmm. Enough to keep it alive. Enough to keep it alive.

1680
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:06,620
Yeah. And then there's like a bar like you between those stormtroopers.

1681
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:10,540
It would have been nice for 100. Sure.

1682
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:12,940
But, you know, this is working.

1683
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:15,100
The trick works. Sure. Like, yeah, yeah.

1684
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:19,540
Around this point, Jason, you mentioned maintenance issue,

1685
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:23,060
which is very true that like they are going to have to buff these floors.

1686
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:28,260
The floor is so shiny and everything looks so sterile

1687
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:32,180
because it's supposed to be like the fascist first order.

1688
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:37,100
So, you know, very tight Hugo Boss ask uniforms and very precise.

1689
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:39,460
You know, everything's got to be clean and not dirty.

1690
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,740
And yeah, I mean,

1691
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:47,180
I don't know how much they'll care about that.

1692
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:50,460
I think in certain parts it it makes sense.

1693
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:53,100
In other parts where like the ride vehicles would be going over,

1694
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:57,420
you can't puff out every, you know, rubber scratch or whatever.

1695
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:59,540
Yeah, yeah. But boy, the upkeep in this room.

1696
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:02,340
Yeah, I wonder because like on the actual ride itself,

1697
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:06,820
you can see that there's just marks where the vehicles are going over.

1698
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:09,460
So I wonder. Yeah, I wonder what their buffing plan is.

1699
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:11,180
Yeah. What is the procedure?

1700
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:12,940
How much buffing needs to be done?

1701
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:14,820
Somebody can message us if they know.

1702
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:15,820
We should have asked that.

1703
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:17,020
We should have figured that.

1704
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:19,100
What's the buffing plan? What's the buffing budget?

1705
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:22,540
It's got to be high. Buffing alone.

1706
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:25,260
Do they buff in the middle of the day or is it just end of the day?

1707
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:28,180
Yeah. But yeah, they're going to buff it.

1708
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:29,980
How will they buff it?

1709
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:31,380
How will they buff it?

1710
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:35,380
Like a place I would describe as like impossible architecture.

1711
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:39,020
Like I if you walk through that, I don't quite know.

1712
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:40,980
I'm sure there's blueprints or stuff somewhere.

1713
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:44,420
But it's like the full on Winchester mystery house where like,

1714
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:46,420
well, you have to go up to go down.

1715
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:50,140
And this hallway is a dead end, but it gets you to this endless hallway.

1716
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:51,620
And it's like so crazy.

1717
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:53,180
If you try to think about it.

1718
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:55,540
Somebody has it. I saw on one of the videos I was watching.

1719
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:58,340
Somebody does have the layout and it's interesting. Yeah.

1720
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:02,140
But yeah, I had no I couldn't have drawn a map after doing.

1721
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:03,900
Oh, you're so confused. You're so turn around.

1722
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,500
And this is the true on the ride part, too.

1723
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:08,940
You feel like you're in a confusing spaceship.

1724
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:10,580
Like, where am I now? Yeah.

1725
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:12,980
Is this a safe place to be? No, it's not at all.

1726
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:17,820
Yeah. Even when I got off the you get off into the room,

1727
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:23,820
the big Star Destroyer room and you look back and my brain wouldn't fully

1728
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:27,980
it knew that right outside was outside where we just were.

1729
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:32,060
It knew that. But I that when I it didn't fully accept. Yeah.

1730
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:34,020
So you were like, well, I am on a ship now.

1731
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:36,020
So then I'm very disoriented. Completely.

1732
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:38,500
You get into a part that's a little more line ish.

1733
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:41,500
They just said, I think we saw it with a big backup.

1734
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,260
We saw it not with a big band.

1735
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:46,300
I've now outed maybe that we got to do it a second time. Yes.

1736
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:51,180
And so we are our main group when it's the way the regular way we did it

1737
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:54,220
when around seven p.m., we got to do it another way.

1738
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:56,980
Once again, I will say podcast privilege.

1739
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:58,900
I admit it. I cop to it.

1740
01:22:58,900 --> 01:22:59,980
I apologize for it.

1741
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:04,300
And I think the person are our spy on the inside who are more in the

1742
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,140
in the first.

1743
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:08,060
Was it a toy? Darien?

1744
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:10,580
That it was it a monk, El Mari?

1745
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:12,740
I don't know. Podcasts are built on hope.

1746
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:15,060
So, you know, was it gin or snow?

1747
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:17,740
Gin or so is dies on that beach planet.

1748
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:18,940
So it's not gin or so.

1749
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:21,100
Was he quickly shot like Hux?

1750
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,340
We don't know. We don't know.

1751
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:23,340
No, we don't know.

1752
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:24,940
We don't know what became of this brave soul.

1753
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:27,140
No. Hopefully it's OK. Hopefully.

1754
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:30,700
So, yeah. So where were we?

1755
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:32,220
We're in the are we in the line?

1756
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:33,820
All right. The more line, right?

1757
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:35,620
Isn't guaranteed to have a big backup.

1758
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:36,900
But then you're kind of so you're in a line.

1759
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:39,940
But it is now a plot justified line.

1760
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:42,940
Perhaps the first time this has ever happened in theme park history.

1761
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:46,460
You are lining up for process and you're going to jail. Yes.

1762
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:51,220
And it's I will say in that big room with all the stormtroopers at the holidays,

1763
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:54,780
I saw pictures where they had set up rope queues in that room.

1764
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:57,900
And that for me would break the illusion a little.

1765
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:00,980
But if you're getting record Christmas, like giant Christmas crowds,

1766
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:02,580
they could get it. You'd get them.

1767
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:04,500
So it's like, but you are being processed.

1768
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:06,580
You are prisoners being processed. Yeah.

1769
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:07,580
Yes, you're right.

1770
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:09,340
Diagetically, make sense for a line.

1771
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:12,940
Amazing. And then you've got mean people saying how many in your party?

1772
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:15,140
Proceed to the left. Proceed to the right.

1773
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:18,940
We've found a re a plot reason to ask how many in your party.

1774
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:21,740
It's the first is the first time this makes sense.

1775
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:25,460
Like to have like the I mean, they don't ask how many in your party

1776
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:28,180
on the man on the Haunted Mansion, but like on Tower of Terror,

1777
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:31,340
like how many in your party for the for the elevator?

1778
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,780
That doesn't quite make sense.

1779
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:37,020
Yeah, yeah. I guess Indiana Jones, I guess, you know, Salah

1780
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:39,140
had people to go through the thing.

1781
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:42,260
Yeah. And you would have people helping him out in a limited amount of space

1782
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:43,980
in those transports. Sure.

1783
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:48,900
But this is we're in a this for sure is an experience where nobody

1784
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:52,580
if pretending we the audience don't know anything and the first order

1785
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:55,380
people don't know anything, nobody knows a riot is coming.

1786
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:58,140
The point of this part is you're going to jail.

1787
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,340
Yes, you are.

1788
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:04,140
This is a simulator for processing at a jail,

1789
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:09,100
which is what a great we talk about how I kind of love the theme park trips.

1790
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:12,580
I kind of love you're getting on this thing and but something's going to go wrong.

1791
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:15,340
You're going to test the thing at the special facility.

1792
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:17,740
But oh, the real thing from the movie happens.

1793
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:18,660
I kind of love it.

1794
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:21,140
But certainly it has been done a gazillion times.

1795
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:23,700
And boy, this is not that there.

1796
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:26,900
You don't know there's a ride until you see the vehicle.

1797
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:32,540
I mean, I am so I I read rumors, but I didn't watch any ride throughs

1798
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:34,380
and I tried to go cold on a lot of stuff.

1799
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:38,660
I wish I didn't know a lot of this because

1800
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:42,420
I can't imagine totally going in fresh.

1801
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:44,380
Imagine you didn't know anything about it.

1802
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:47,500
Yeah, I didn't know a lot of the big set pieces.

1803
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:50,500
I didn't either. Yeah, I knew I was legitimately.

1804
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:52,980
I didn't know how they got you in and out of places.

1805
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:54,980
Yeah, I didn't know stuff like that.

1806
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:58,100
And I knew, you know, there was ATATs and stuff.

1807
01:25:58,140 --> 01:26:01,140
But if you're listening to this and you have someone in your life,

1808
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:04,580
you have a kid or a parent or a friend who doesn't know any,

1809
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:06,940
who doesn't pay attention to this stuff, but enjoys Disneyland.

1810
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:10,260
If you can get somebody on without telling them anything, do it,

1811
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:11,740
because they will lose their shit.

1812
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:13,060
Yeah, that's what it really seems.

1813
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:16,300
Honestly, that I was like, oh, yeah, I'm trying to think of who I know

1814
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:20,980
that I can take. Yeah, because I'm very interested to see everybody's reaction

1815
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:23,580
to it, because yeah, because they have most.

1816
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:26,540
Even if they've heard me drone on about rumors,

1817
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:29,020
there's no way anyone retained any of that garbage from me.

1818
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:31,460
So like they'll be fresh going on this.

1819
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:34,220
It's funny. It's very fun.

1820
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:36,460
Surprising. Sets the bar high.

1821
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:40,260
Certainly, very that Avengers ride.

1822
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,780
Although we've been told.

1823
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:44,380
Yeah, it's set your bar.

1824
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:47,380
I go ahead. Yeah, they know they have to match.

1825
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:50,700
Yeah, you would think because with the Avengers being like the number one

1826
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:52,500
franchise. Yeah, yeah.

1827
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:55,940
Moment, you were sort of I think I think we don't without saying

1828
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:59,340
any type of we'd not that we were really told much, but I think it's

1829
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:02,460
if you've watched an engineering story or you've been to this thing in person,

1830
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:03,700
it's maybe the scope.

1831
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:06,740
Maybe it's our version of Shanghai Pirates.

1832
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:08,900
There's any they are an element.

1833
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:12,140
Yeah, yeah, something of that and the scale of this kind of.

1834
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:15,380
But it seems it also seems like it's far away.

1835
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:18,540
It seems like it's very far away and anything can change.

1836
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:21,700
Yeah, so I was just so and this is this is

1837
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:24,020
this might sound like a wrap up thought I could say to the end.

1838
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:28,380
But while we're talking about scale and everything, I mean, like I remember

1839
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:32,700
how this this whole experience flashed me back to being 10 and going on

1840
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:36,500
the Indiana Jones adventure and thinking it's never going to get topped.

1841
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:40,540
And then it wasn't topped for a long time because the dark ages

1842
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:43,340
set in and they did a bunch of off the shelf shit.

1843
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:46,780
And I was really wondering, I was like, I guess I experienced the peak

1844
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:50,140
of Disney Imagineering and how wonderful to be around

1845
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:52,940
25 years later and they set the they reset.

1846
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:54,900
Yeah, I don't.

1847
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:59,180
That's an interesting thing, because with Galaxy's edge in the whole land,

1848
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:04,420
it feels like they can't keep doing this, though, because a lot of a lot of stuff

1849
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:07,860
is coming. No, but there's just no way that's not.

1850
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:09,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1851
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:12,460
I think, you know, we're going to do an episode soon of the Slinky Dog Dash,

1852
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:14,420
and that is not a bar topping.

1853
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:17,380
But it's wonderful and it's cool that it exists. Yeah.

1854
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:18,660
And they need to do those things.

1855
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:20,780
But it's like they need to do it every once in a while.

1856
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:23,580
Just as Jason said, to flex to show that they can.

1857
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:26,740
And I think Universal's been doing all the flexing until this.

1858
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:29,420
Well, and it's funny because the experience you're describing

1859
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:34,940
I had at 13 in 1999 on Spider-Man,

1860
01:28:35,220 --> 01:28:39,140
which, again, 20 years later, Scott Trowbridge still going strong.

1861
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:44,380
And that does feel like that was like for the time.

1862
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:49,900
Very doing new stuff, using simple tricks, using sets,

1863
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:55,060
using real explosion, using practical stuff, meld it with screens

1864
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,340
and an interesting cue.

1865
01:28:57,340 --> 01:29:00,100
There's nothing there's nothing ever that you've never felt anything like that.

1866
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:01,820
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

1867
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:05,020
And that's it, which is that's a tough there can be very, very good rides.

1868
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:07,260
But you go, oh, it's kind of a version.

1869
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:10,860
You might even say, though, I would rank this as one of the greatest rides ever.

1870
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:14,820
Radiator Springs racers, you recognize the bones as being test track,

1871
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:17,300
and that is no slam against it because boy does it rule.

1872
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:19,420
It doesn't reinvent the reinvent the wheel.

1873
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:20,940
Not what it's trying to do. Right.

1874
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:23,740
But it's how cool to get a reinventing the wheel.

1875
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:24,860
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1876
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:28,100
I mean, for me, this was baby's first trackless ride vehicle experience.

1877
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:29,180
Yeah, that's true.

1878
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:31,740
Well, except for Luigi.

1879
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:34,820
Luigi's. Yeah, yes.

1880
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:36,660
It's your first room to room.

1881
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:39,460
First. Yeah, I haven't done Ratatouille or Mystic Manor.

1882
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:41,260
Pooh's Honey Hunt, like,

1883
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:47,140
you know, which I mean, I think it's the best one of those.

1884
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:51,500
And I made the complaint that I thought the Ratatouille ride was like a little dopey.

1885
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:52,540
It's a little you're going.

1886
01:29:52,540 --> 01:29:56,460
You're kind of just it's not you don't have like the whipping around.

1887
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:59,140
It doesn't feel it didn't feel madcap to me.

1888
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:01,060
And this completely does.

1889
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:04,540
This was like exciting ride vehicle travel.

1890
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:06,900
Yeah. Pooh's is awesome.

1891
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:07,860
Yeah. Yeah.

1892
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:08,940
Pooh's is really great.

1893
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:09,820
Good to do it.

1894
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:14,700
I mean, hopefully the Ratatouille in Epcot is like draft two.

1895
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:17,420
I think I wonder, I think because I mean,

1896
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:22,420
apparently here at Disneyland, they were able to fix some stuff

1897
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:25,900
that were bugging, like nagging issues from Florida.

1898
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:32,060
And we also found out that we have like twice as many vehicles as Florida does.

1899
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:37,180
So apparently, yeah, maybe going a little smoother, a little quicker out here.

1900
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:38,020
Maybe so.

1901
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:41,500
I mean, the little extra time we had to wait might have might have helped.

1902
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:46,020
So as we said, cast members are being mean.

1903
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:47,180
They're lining you up.

1904
01:30:47,180 --> 01:30:50,580
They tell they really warn you not to step on this glass behind you.

1905
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:52,260
And we were told that's for real.

1906
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:53,900
And you feel it if you step on the glass.

1907
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:55,060
Don't step. Yeah.

1908
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:59,180
Like they do need to like haunted mansion, keep you away from the sides.

1909
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:02,100
That seems like, yeah, somebody's going to break that with their heel.

1910
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:04,460
Yeah. If a woman on the line, not the glass.

1911
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:08,860
If someone is wearing like a spiked high heel, this is going to be a big problem.

1912
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:11,180
Yeah. Or just a long high heel.

1913
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:13,340
That's going to be you're going to go right through that glass.

1914
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:17,500
It feels like a second later, you do need to stand on a colored oval

1915
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:20,460
that looks very similar to the color white lights.

1916
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:21,980
I was confused by colors.

1917
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:23,340
I didn't know what color I was on.

1918
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:24,820
I don't know where I was looking for that color.

1919
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:26,140
Yeah, that's a confusing aspect.

1920
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:28,860
I will say when it's like you're orange and then like you need to know it

1921
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:30,620
two rooms from now. Yeah.

1922
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:34,420
And I didn't realize till the second time that they then it correlates

1923
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:36,580
with the color that's in the vehicle. Right.

1924
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:38,780
I told you I was very that's confusing.

1925
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:43,780
I see the logic, but expecting people to remember after like a couple

1926
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:45,900
of very impressive moves.

1927
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:49,740
Yeah, I think that's a little too much to expect from gas.

1928
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:52,220
If you tell me I'm orange, then you say go there.

1929
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:53,700
That's all you're going to get.

1930
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:56,660
Like, yeah, my memory. Yeah.

1931
01:31:56,660 --> 01:32:00,580
But so after this wonderful cast member business and boy, great job, everybody.

1932
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:01,980
Keep it up.

1933
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:04,740
Then you are brought into the cell.

1934
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:07,060
You're brought into a detention cell. Yes.

1935
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:09,060
And you are on the bottom of it.

1936
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:11,060
It right. It rises up very high.

1937
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:15,140
There is like a cage above you that really kind of restricts

1938
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:18,420
your vision of the storm trooper that's watching you.

1939
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:21,500
And there's a little bit of stall there.

1940
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:24,460
I like the second time where we could just there was just animation of like

1941
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:26,980
helmet clacking. Yes.

1942
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:30,420
Yeah. Just to fill the space.

1943
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:33,260
And then Hux comes in.

1944
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:35,220
Yeah. General Hux.

1945
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:37,740
He's in this in multiple forms. Yes.

1946
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:40,660
And then the big bad Kylo Ren himself.

1947
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:42,980
Mask on mask on.

1948
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:45,780
Yeah. Driver did just had to do a voice. He did the voices.

1949
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:47,860
Yeah. But there's been questions about that. It is him.

1950
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:49,260
Yeah, I think it's him.

1951
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:53,340
Although there's a very funny there's there's a line that stuck out to me later

1952
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:55,540
on, and I'll point it out when we get to that.

1953
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:57,340
OK, sure, sure.

1954
01:32:57,380 --> 01:33:01,260
But he uses some force threat on you.

1955
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:04,420
Room shakes a little bit.

1956
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:08,020
I also around this point, I mean, I thought this the whole ride,

1957
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:12,180
not to just complain about a thing that a lot of people

1958
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:14,380
have done a lot of complaining about.

1959
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:18,340
It was nice to be in a Star Wars experience where what where the motivation

1960
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:20,300
is very clear.

1961
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:23,060
If there's one thing, there's one thing.

1962
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:26,140
You know, the location of the base, Kylo wants it.

1963
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:27,980
He's going to kill you if he doesn't get it.

1964
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:31,820
Right. And we don't have gadgets and dude heads of plenty.

1965
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:35,500
We don't have knives and compasses and galore.

1966
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:37,820
Well, yes, knives and compasses galore.

1967
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:41,260
No thingamabobs, not 20.

1968
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:46,380
I think Rises, there's Rises Skywalker definitely had 20 thingamabobs, if not more.

1969
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:49,900
I want to shout out one of my favorite actors, Domnoglison.

1970
01:33:49,940 --> 01:33:53,860
I think as General Hux, consistent throughout doing a great,

1971
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:59,060
I think, gets that like this is there is a fine tradition of imperial

1972
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:04,340
first order people played by like British actors being very stern.

1973
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:07,060
And I think he does a great job at it.

1974
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:08,660
I think it's very kooky.

1975
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:11,820
And this is a spoiler for like Rises Skywalker.

1976
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:16,820
But when he yells, I was the spy, like I was very funny.

1977
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:19,060
I thought that was a great delivery.

1978
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:22,740
Like he just go be a little silly.

1979
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:25,060
And Martin Short would play it.

1980
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:27,780
Yes. Yeah, it was me.

1981
01:34:27,860 --> 01:34:29,060
But I just got a look.

1982
01:34:29,060 --> 01:34:31,060
Could have used Martin Short.

1983
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:32,820
Yeah, sure. Throw him in.

1984
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:34,820
He's busy on the morning show.

1985
01:34:36,620 --> 01:34:39,140
And why wouldn't you be Domnoglison and in Rises

1986
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:40,340
Skywalker, Richard E.

1987
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:43,380
Grant, I mean, just doing great job doing that part.

1988
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:45,660
Makes you think, wait, didn't he do this in?

1989
01:34:45,660 --> 01:34:47,620
Was he an empire?

1990
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:49,220
I'm surprised that hasn't happened already.

1991
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:52,660
Yeah, it seems like I was like, oh, he was in the other two.

1992
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:53,860
At least right, Force Awakens?

1993
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:55,700
No, no. Yeah.

1994
01:34:56,180 --> 01:34:58,340
No, similar to like Karl Weathers and

1995
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:01,020
John Carlyle Esposito.

1996
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:04,580
Both feel like they're so like hasn't this happened already?

1997
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:07,540
Yeah, they're so like made to be Star Wars people.

1998
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:09,860
Yeah. Yeah. And Werner.

1999
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:11,260
Werner Herzog. Oh, yes.

2000
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:12,940
Yeah, he's a lot of fun.

2001
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:15,180
So room travel is a force.

2002
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:17,500
You're stuck. How are we getting out of here?

2003
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:19,900
And then one of the coolest and this was a spoiler.

2004
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:21,260
I didn't know this. I didn't know this.

2005
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:22,820
I didn't know this either. I didn't either.

2006
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:23,620
Oh, great. Yeah.

2007
01:35:23,620 --> 01:35:25,780
It's you don't know how you're getting out of here.

2008
01:35:25,780 --> 01:35:31,660
And then Orange Glow around an arbitrary spot spot on the wall,

2009
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:37,180
which reveals itself to be a door, which slides backwards in this very clever way.

2010
01:35:37,180 --> 01:35:40,020
And so, yeah, so they like burned through the door.

2011
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:42,580
Yeah, they blow torch through the wall.

2012
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:44,940
There's a projection inside the wall.

2013
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:47,780
I don't know where it was coming from that makes it look like, yeah,

2014
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:49,740
they're like searing through it.

2015
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:52,260
And then like if you look on the sides of the door, it looks like, yeah, like

2016
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:57,660
it's still glowing, a jagged cut because they whatever instrument they use.

2017
01:35:57,660 --> 01:36:00,020
Just this. We haven't even gotten to the main ride.

2018
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:01,660
We haven't been on the ride yet.

2019
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:03,180
Is. Yeah, we're doing our own.

2020
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:05,300
This is like our haunted mansion series.

2021
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:06,540
Just in the one.

2022
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:11,740
This is the second time the whole room went, ha, like, they're so surprised by it.

2023
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:15,580
And I'll say this, depending on which room you're in, it might be the one wall.

2024
01:36:15,580 --> 01:36:16,900
It might be the other.

2025
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:18,740
Oh, oh, that changes.

2026
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:20,340
There are four of these.

2027
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:22,060
There are four of these. Oh, that's right.

2028
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:23,420
And they all go to different places. Yeah.

2029
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:24,860
Yeah. Yeah.

2030
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:29,180
And I think one of the in a day of many great Star Wars actor

2031
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:34,780
cast members, maybe my favorite one just goes combined with the surprising effect.

2032
01:36:34,980 --> 01:36:38,380
Then a guy coming in and saying, I'm with the resistance. Follow me.

2033
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:42,700
He gets like, yeah, like whoever this was nailed it.

2034
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:45,620
It's so exciting. Yeah.

2035
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:48,660
This guy, he said this ride operator saved you.

2036
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:52,140
And they're waiting are the the right vehicles.

2037
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:55,860
Now, I know this, but I don't know that they spell it out narratively too well.

2038
01:36:55,860 --> 01:36:58,860
The idea that they reprogrammed the evil droids. Yeah.

2039
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:02,860
As I said, back in the room you saw earlier, these droids are not friendly.

2040
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:05,940
They're here to watch you and make sure you go into your detention room.

2041
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:09,180
But now these ones that you're in front of are good.

2042
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:11,180
Yeah, they don't. It's a lot.

2043
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:14,340
That's an info dump that is I don't know how you get it out.

2044
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:17,780
Yeah, because like it's supposed to be very urgent this moment.

2045
01:37:18,020 --> 01:37:21,380
This moment is supposed to be like, you got to get out of here fast.

2046
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:24,460
It's so urgent that you're getting like, please keep your hands and arms inside

2047
01:37:24,460 --> 01:37:25,540
while you're moving.

2048
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:28,220
Like, yeah, you're throwing so much at you and like, OK, make sure you're OK.

2049
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:30,900
Bye. They have Lieutenant Beck say it to you.

2050
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:34,460
Yeah. A friendly voice, a friendly voice and pretty funny.

2051
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:37,860
Like in this part of the raw, like there's a moment where he goes like, did it work?

2052
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:41,100
OK, great. Like the resistance is great.

2053
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:42,460
He's great. He's great.

2054
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:46,100
The resistance, the resistance force wants to make sure

2055
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:48,420
that you tug on the dirty yellow strap.

2056
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:51,420
Yeah. Before you get out of here, they do want safety.

2057
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:53,780
They want safety because they're a force for the first order would let you

2058
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:55,140
fly out of the thing. They don't care.

2059
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:58,860
And the and the Empire First Order, whatever you call it, first order.

2060
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:03,940
They do have dirty yellow straps on the seatbelts as well, just like a theme park.

2061
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:06,740
So that one's a tough one to justify.

2062
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:10,980
But they have to make that strap yellow, I think, because it's easy to see.

2063
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:13,460
There's a lot of you know, they should explain that there's a lot of

2064
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:16,020
ton of wills in the strap.

2065
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:20,420
Oh, yeah. Of wills, the little creatures that make up the force.

2066
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:26,420
Yes. Yeah. George wanted in these yellow as a high concentration of wills.

2067
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:30,100
So once you're officially loaded into your ride vehicle,

2068
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:34,060
one of the computer displays starts to play a video from Finn.

2069
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:37,300
And this video, I thought this looked pretty good.

2070
01:38:37,300 --> 01:38:40,700
He shows you a schematic of like, all right, you're going to get to escape pods.

2071
01:38:40,820 --> 01:38:43,060
You're going to take these elevators to escape pods.

2072
01:38:43,060 --> 01:38:44,740
Yes, it's funny. This is all I was saying.

2073
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:47,220
Like, there's it feels chaotic. Yeah.

2074
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:49,580
Yeah. I feel where to look.

2075
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:50,780
Yeah. Lots happening.

2076
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:54,100
So I like the idea that he's showing you like where you're going, but there's no way.

2077
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:57,740
Yeah. You know what you're looking at or will remember in two seconds.

2078
01:38:57,740 --> 01:39:00,260
Oh, yes. So yeah. So quick. Observe all this. OK, here we go.

2079
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:01,300
Got it. There's a plan.

2080
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:03,460
Whatever you you know, you know, you're doing.

2081
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:07,620
Turbo lifts. A lot of people say turbo lifts for the rest of the attraction.

2082
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:10,780
Turb does he say turbo lift? Yeah.

2083
01:39:11,020 --> 01:39:13,660
OK, because I always think of that as a Star Trek thing.

2084
01:39:14,420 --> 01:39:17,500
Oh, but I guess is that maybe actually a term?

2085
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:19,700
I'm not sure.

2086
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:21,620
I don't know. There's somebody will have to chime in.

2087
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:23,100
And technology of.

2088
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:25,860
Yeah. So yes, they're shouting at us.

2089
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:27,900
Peep cast members are shouting at us.

2090
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:30,740
Yeah, we're tugging on yellow straps that are dirty.

2091
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:34,060
And then Lieutenant Beck tells us to what?

2092
01:39:34,060 --> 01:39:35,500
Keep our hands in the vehicle.

2093
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:38,180
Yeah. Your hands, arms and children. Yeah.

2094
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:42,700
Oh, and then you're then you're on your way.

2095
01:39:43,660 --> 01:39:48,460
You know, not to shoot past the just that it is trackless.

2096
01:39:48,460 --> 01:39:51,300
I feel like I'm talking to people who have never been on a trackless.

2097
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:53,260
They was your your first trackless. Yeah.

2098
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:57,020
Ride. I think it probably will be a shock to a lot of people

2099
01:39:57,020 --> 01:39:59,660
who haven't been to overseas ones that you go into this room.

2100
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:01,180
And like, what is that? How is this going to work?

2101
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:04,380
I should also point out that the room you're loading in the vehicles,

2102
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:08,460
like almost every other like traditional dark ride,

2103
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:12,500
you see where the vehicle came in and you see where it's going.

2104
01:40:12,820 --> 01:40:16,420
This is the smallest room other than maybe like the Tower of Terror.

2105
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:18,700
It's like bedroom size. It's tiny.

2106
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:20,780
Yeah. There's two vehicles in there.

2107
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:24,740
And my thought, of course, first was, how do these get in here?

2108
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:27,540
Because there's and there's no like it's just a wall behind them.

2109
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:29,620
So they didn't come in from behind.

2110
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:33,180
They're not loading like that, which is how almost every other ride.

2111
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:35,300
Like Pooh's Honey Hunt.

2112
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:36,940
They come from behind.

2113
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:40,340
It's it's still like a standard load unload process.

2114
01:40:40,420 --> 01:40:42,260
It's not it's not the cars ride.

2115
01:40:42,260 --> 01:40:44,620
It's not like it's the ones in front of you and the ones behind.

2116
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:46,660
It's just a conveyor belt for most rides.

2117
01:40:46,660 --> 01:40:47,620
Private room.

2118
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:50,300
And you pointed this out after the first time we went on it.

2119
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:54,180
And the second time you gave everybody the mission.

2120
01:40:54,380 --> 01:40:57,620
Let's figure out how those vehicles get in there the next time.

2121
01:40:57,620 --> 01:41:00,380
Never felt dumber because I saw it.

2122
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:02,860
I saw it the first time because it's two things.

2123
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:04,180
It solves two problems.

2124
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:08,860
One, you go out of this room, you see two empty ride vehicles and Lieutenant Beck

2125
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:11,420
This is where he tells you, play it cool. OK.

2126
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:13,100
And the droids talk to each other.

2127
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:16,060
Yes. Like Lalo is just tell them it's a prisoner of transport.

2128
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:20,500
And you get by them and they're going backwards into the room.

2129
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,620
And you are going forwards out of it.

2130
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:25,060
And that's how vehicles get in and out of the room.

2131
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:26,180
Yes, I had no clue.

2132
01:41:26,180 --> 01:41:31,700
I went by it. I was like, OK, these empty ride vehicles got it narratively.

2133
01:41:31,820 --> 01:41:35,140
Those are just they're they're just, you know, on their way to get somebody.

2134
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:38,780
And we're just supposed to not be weird in front of those other droids.

2135
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:40,980
The next vehicles are right in front of you.

2136
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:42,980
So funny. The very beginning of the ride.

2137
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:45,020
And you don't really realize what's happening.

2138
01:41:45,020 --> 01:41:48,940
Yes, I had no idea because I I was thinking like maybe the maybe the back wall

2139
01:41:48,940 --> 01:41:50,540
opened up or something.

2140
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:51,900
But I was like, that doesn't really make sense.

2141
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:53,900
Find the spot where it has so funny.

2142
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:57,700
They just yeah, you turn around to and there's going in back into the room.

2143
01:41:57,700 --> 01:41:59,260
It's not even like it's that hidden.

2144
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:02,220
Yeah, it's just that your attention is directed in such a way

2145
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:04,140
that you don't even really notice what's happening.

2146
01:42:04,140 --> 01:42:08,340
And it sells the idea that these vehicles are flying around this star cruiser.

2147
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:10,780
They're like these guys are going in and out.

2148
01:42:10,780 --> 01:42:13,540
This is how you take people around this ship.

2149
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:14,900
So nothing weird about that.

2150
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:17,980
So if you see other people, this place is full of them. Yes.

2151
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:20,220
And you start moving.

2152
01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:23,940
And the track, you realize that the trackless ride vehicle

2153
01:42:23,940 --> 01:42:27,540
is the perfect way to do this idea

2154
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:32,260
where the droid is driving you and it doesn't know where to go.

2155
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:34,220
It has just been reprogrammed.

2156
01:42:34,220 --> 01:42:36,540
It doesn't know left from right.

2157
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:38,380
It doesn't know the lay of the land.

2158
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:42,340
So you're trying to find ways out of rooms and you you don't know.

2159
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:45,740
You don't know what's around what corner and the spinning.

2160
01:42:45,740 --> 01:42:48,220
Like I think the trackless vehicles are very good at spinning.

2161
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:51,020
And it lends itself to that nicely.

2162
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:52,420
Like, no, no, no. Get out of there.

2163
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:54,220
You have to whip out of a corner really fast.

2164
01:42:54,220 --> 01:42:58,420
Yes. You keep getting caught or you keep running it and you have to fix on fly.

2165
01:42:58,620 --> 01:43:02,020
Yeah. So you the very first thing you come around, you go down some hallways

2166
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:06,020
and you hit a dead end, which looks like, OK, you'll get on the elevator

2167
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:10,060
right by this and then a full size probe droid drops down

2168
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:15,420
a full size like an empire strikes back probe droid lowers down.

2169
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:17,740
Yeah, the one that tortures Han.

2170
01:43:17,740 --> 01:43:19,660
Or the one they shoot on Hoth.

2171
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:21,380
It reminded me of the one that they.

2172
01:43:21,380 --> 01:43:22,340
Oh, oh, yeah.

2173
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:23,820
Oh, I see. No, it's not the you're right.

2174
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:24,940
It's not the interrogation, right?

2175
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:26,580
It's a pro. Right. You're right. You're right.

2176
01:43:26,580 --> 01:43:28,940
But it's lens is turned away from you.

2177
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:31,740
So it misses you and you barely get out of its sight.

2178
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:34,860
All right. So obstacle one. OK.

2179
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:37,660
But then you get into the next room.

2180
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:40,300
Stormtroopers, they spot you.

2181
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:43,620
Here is the first firing of the ride

2182
01:43:43,820 --> 01:43:47,460
and the little bits of laser damage throughout.

2183
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:49,580
Yeah. Yeah. One of the coolest things I've ever done.

2184
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:52,380
So, so cool. Yeah, they they.

2185
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:57,100
I'm I read about it and I'm still confused a little

2186
01:43:57,940 --> 01:44:02,860
because is it is a projection covering up the damage and then it goes away?

2187
01:44:03,660 --> 01:44:05,460
Or are they projecting the damage on?

2188
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:07,060
They might be projecting the damage.

2189
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:08,420
Maybe that makes more sense.

2190
01:44:08,420 --> 01:44:09,620
It's a mix.

2191
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:13,100
Well, it's a mix later on when there's bigger damage, I know for sure.

2192
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:18,060
But yeah, it's it's hard to spot exactly what's happening.

2193
01:44:19,660 --> 01:44:21,900
There's there's like they use

2194
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:24,460
like little bursts of lasers because like it's hard.

2195
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:27,740
Like you can't do a straight laser because they're trying to mimic the way

2196
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:31,220
that the blaster shoot in Star Wars, which is a little bursts.

2197
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:36,060
So it's like they can't shoot a real laser because that would be an unbroken beam.

2198
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:36,980
Yeah. Yeah.

2199
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:40,180
So like they do these little like bursts and then it shoots and hits the

2200
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:42,460
like walls and stuff.

2201
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:43,540
You really can't tell where things are going.

2202
01:44:43,540 --> 01:44:46,540
The screen that the troopers are on looks fantastic.

2203
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:48,940
Yeah. They it feels very real.

2204
01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:52,900
And yeah, you're avoiding laser.

2205
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:55,500
You're avoiding lasers for a little bit.

2206
01:44:55,500 --> 01:45:01,180
And then pretty quickly, you end up in this hanger with the ad ads.

2207
01:45:01,740 --> 01:45:06,540
I think you see I thought this might have been more of like the climax of the ride.

2208
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:08,540
Yeah, I think so. I see it so early.

2209
01:45:08,820 --> 01:45:11,500
And here again, one of these big gasps.

2210
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:13,060
That's where they go into this.

2211
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:17,260
This ride is like being at a baseball game or something like people are

2212
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:21,180
just like you'd be on your feet if you didn't have to stay seated.

2213
01:45:21,180 --> 01:45:23,220
Yeah. Yeah. People are screaming.

2214
01:45:23,380 --> 01:45:25,620
It was so wonderful doing this opening day.

2215
01:45:25,740 --> 01:45:30,140
Yeah. And this is this is the full top to bottom of this building,

2216
01:45:30,140 --> 01:45:34,220
which is three stories and which many a time on a parking garage in the last four

2217
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:38,540
years, I've made someone walk up to the top and gone, look, it's the skeleton.

2218
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:41,820
It's the ATAT that's going to be or ATATs that are going to be in there.

2219
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:44,460
Yeah. And yeah, it is building around.

2220
01:45:44,740 --> 01:45:47,940
It is incredibly impressive in scope.

2221
01:45:48,340 --> 01:45:50,020
How cool to finally be there.

2222
01:45:50,020 --> 01:45:52,780
You're staring at it from so far away from the stairs.

2223
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:54,500
And now you are at its feet.

2224
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:57,220
Yes. Also, I didn't notice this.

2225
01:45:57,380 --> 01:46:02,260
There's a giant mirror in the back of the room that if you look,

2226
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:05,500
it gives it another sense of like there's more back there.

2227
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:08,340
It's a mirror. So if you look through the look of the mirror,

2228
01:46:08,620 --> 01:46:10,660
it's the back of one of the ATATs.

2229
01:46:11,020 --> 01:46:15,060
And but it gives you the sense that there's more ATATs if you keep going.

2230
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:21,180
Which is crazy. And I'm sure like I didn't notice it when we were on there both times.

2231
01:46:21,180 --> 01:46:24,100
But like subliminally, you're kind of absorbing everything.

2232
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:26,660
And I'm sure it's giving you the sense that this room is even bigger.

2233
01:46:26,820 --> 01:46:28,300
Yeah. Yeah, it actually is.

2234
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:30,260
And this is where you get a little variation.

2235
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:32,580
There's a few moments of variation throughout the ride,

2236
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:36,260
because the way the building is designed,

2237
01:46:36,540 --> 01:46:39,780
you could not have two elevators next to each other

2238
01:46:39,780 --> 01:46:44,420
where you take them both up and look at the ATAT like cannon

2239
01:46:45,380 --> 01:46:46,660
cockpits head on.

2240
01:46:46,660 --> 01:46:49,420
So one goes up an elevator and you're looking head on at the ATAT.

2241
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:51,020
The other goes to the side.

2242
01:46:51,020 --> 01:46:55,260
And like you see a bunch of scurrying first order guys pull out a heavy gun.

2243
01:46:55,740 --> 01:46:57,940
And in both cases, you get fired upon.

2244
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:00,420
And in both cases, you see Finn.

2245
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:03,820
Yes. There's two Fins hidden in this room.

2246
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:07,260
Yeah, which are a little easy to miss initially.

2247
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:10,620
He's talking. But you've heard voices just pumped in.

2248
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:12,420
So you're a little surprised when you find him.

2249
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:16,500
And they I love that he's a little he's not like super presented in front of you.

2250
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:17,780
He's crouched. Yeah.

2251
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:21,540
The person who took us around, like who told us some secrets said how the,

2252
01:47:21,540 --> 01:47:24,540
you know, they had to limit the amount of like incredibly.

2253
01:47:24,580 --> 01:47:27,180
This couldn't be all Hondo level animatronics.

2254
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:30,420
So if you look close, he's his body is perfectly still,

2255
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:34,180
which makes sense with him being in a crouch and it's just his head moving.

2256
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:36,860
But great. Clever. That's awesome.

2257
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:39,940
And he and another soldier are blasting at stormtroopers.

2258
01:47:39,940 --> 01:47:44,220
There's stormtrooper projections in here or the digital peppers goes kind of things.

2259
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:46,100
Yeah. And there is a firefight.

2260
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:50,460
You're in the middle of a firefight and like I one thing I think is wonderful

2261
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:54,660
is how also with the ground that the track list can cover.

2262
01:47:54,820 --> 01:47:58,940
It's cool that I was always wondering, OK, so you're in a room with the AT-ATs,

2263
01:47:58,940 --> 01:48:01,780
but I bet those things can't move, especially because we saw them.

2264
01:48:01,780 --> 01:48:03,300
They're made out of like steel.

2265
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:08,180
So what's the like, is it exciting to go between their legs and stuff and the vehicles?

2266
01:48:08,260 --> 01:48:09,700
I mean, there's so much other stuff happening.

2267
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:11,220
You're you're in crossfire.

2268
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:14,180
But the vehicles are really what's making it exciting because now we're

2269
01:48:14,180 --> 01:48:15,460
zooming in between their legs.

2270
01:48:15,460 --> 01:48:18,060
You get to see them from down below and see the degree of detail.

2271
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:20,260
And then you zip around.

2272
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:21,940
You really see so many angles of the thing.

2273
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:25,060
And then you back up into these elevators and shoot way up.

2274
01:48:25,060 --> 01:48:28,780
And suddenly you're looking at them in one case straight down the barrel.

2275
01:48:28,820 --> 01:48:31,900
Yeah, that elevator. So exciting.

2276
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:34,060
It's like a little mini tower terror.

2277
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:37,020
You get a little like just enough of a little like,

2278
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:40,940
yeah, you know, a little stomach lift, whatever you want to call it.

2279
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:44,260
I think the ride throughs don't do this justice.

2280
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:44,860
I've been watching it.

2281
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:48,380
I'm like, that feels dopey, the rise up if you watch it just on camera.

2282
01:48:48,380 --> 01:48:52,020
I think when you feel it, it's it's rad.

2283
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:56,460
And I guess I knew there were elevators and drops, but I didn't know when.

2284
01:48:56,820 --> 01:49:00,260
And truly, this is the moment where you realize, oh, my God,

2285
01:49:00,260 --> 01:49:02,380
this is a multi story ride fast.

2286
01:49:02,700 --> 01:49:04,300
Yeah, very fast.

2287
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:08,300
Yeah. Yeah. This is maybe my favorite section.

2288
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:11,620
Yeah, because I think like they were trying to figure out, I think,

2289
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:16,100
how to differentiate blasts between like stormtrooper blasters

2290
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:18,420
and then the big AT-AT cannons.

2291
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:20,260
And they do a very cool effect.

2292
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:24,820
And correct me if I'm wrong, but they make it look like you're getting blasted

2293
01:49:24,820 --> 01:49:28,940
out by the AT-AT cannons by just sort of changing the already

2294
01:49:29,220 --> 01:49:33,380
like the already lit up lights sort of on the ceiling, completely red.

2295
01:49:33,940 --> 01:49:36,460
Yeah, it's a big thick tube. Yeah.

2296
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:37,180
Lights up. Yeah.

2297
01:49:37,180 --> 01:49:41,420
But it tricks your eye into thinking this giant red blast has come.

2298
01:49:41,420 --> 01:49:43,780
It's like a pulse of color along a string.

2299
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:47,980
And I found that more effective in tricking my brain

2300
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:50,020
into being like we're being shot at. Yeah.

2301
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:53,380
Because like it's because all the effects on the walls and everything before

2302
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:55,580
are really cool with the stormtrooper blasts.

2303
01:49:55,580 --> 01:50:00,420
But it's not as it's not quite as effective as this is

2304
01:50:00,820 --> 01:50:03,140
in making you really feel like you're being shot at.

2305
01:50:03,140 --> 01:50:04,420
So I like this might be my favorite.

2306
01:50:04,420 --> 01:50:06,540
Have your heavier duty, probably.

2307
01:50:06,540 --> 01:50:09,100
And sound is real weighty. Yeah.

2308
01:50:09,140 --> 01:50:11,820
And so I think it was just like they had to differentiate between

2309
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:14,260
this has to be more powerful than a stormtrooper.

2310
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:17,100
So they do use this effect for all the stormtroopers.

2311
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:20,340
And it would probably be too hard because they're like shooting wildly. Yeah.

2312
01:50:20,820 --> 01:50:24,380
This is when I realized you realize there's like an I'm in an attic of the

2313
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:26,780
and I know this building footprint is huge.

2314
01:50:26,780 --> 01:50:30,140
So I'm going to we're now going to go explore a whole other.

2315
01:50:30,420 --> 01:50:33,980
Yeah, it's like it's like now we realize there are essentially two

2316
01:50:33,980 --> 01:50:36,180
giant show buildings, one on top of the other.

2317
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:37,980
It's crazy.

2318
01:50:38,780 --> 01:50:41,540
And then where do we head?

2319
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:44,540
Oh, you know, side note,

2320
01:50:44,540 --> 01:50:48,700
going back and watching the Imagineering story, some of your episode on Patreon,

2321
01:50:49,380 --> 01:50:53,420
but we're going to do part two soon and we just kind of gloss over

2322
01:50:53,420 --> 01:50:54,500
the Star Wars stuff.

2323
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:57,780
Now, I haven't gone back and rewatched that the previs is that you do

2324
01:50:57,780 --> 01:51:00,260
the computer simulations of these rooms are perfect.

2325
01:51:00,260 --> 01:51:04,140
Yeah. You go back and watch like that is exactly the memory I have.

2326
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:06,820
That is precisely the POV. Yeah.

2327
01:51:06,820 --> 01:51:09,260
Just the speed. It's just the way it like it's.

2328
01:51:09,260 --> 01:51:12,820
It's so cool that people have been digitally going on this ride

2329
01:51:12,820 --> 01:51:16,220
for five years before it existed in. Yeah. Yeah.

2330
01:51:16,220 --> 01:51:19,740
And yeah, they were doing it all with wireframe footage and laptops

2331
01:51:19,740 --> 01:51:24,940
and VR goggles and just like and then inactive construction sites of like,

2332
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:26,300
OK, does that look right?

2333
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:29,580
Like how many degrees the technology is wild.

2334
01:51:29,780 --> 01:51:34,740
And then like it's only going to get, I mean, crazier from here. Yeah.

2335
01:51:34,820 --> 01:51:39,060
As far as yeah, like what you're saying, where it's like previz down to the like,

2336
01:51:39,540 --> 01:51:43,260
who know, like whatever you would say, like a centimeter or whatever of like,

2337
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:47,700
we know exactly how big this is going to be outside of probably just like

2338
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:49,980
having to juggle all the different effects.

2339
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:53,980
I think that's what we've been told by a few different people that like

2340
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:56,700
maybe there wasn't necessarily one giant thing wrong.

2341
01:51:56,700 --> 01:51:59,900
It's just like this is just so many effects juggling things at once.

2342
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:02,740
It's like stuff will go wrong for a week or two.

2343
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:04,820
And then another thing goes wrong for a week or two.

2344
01:52:04,820 --> 01:52:06,340
And oh, that's yes.

2345
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:09,620
Our man on the inside told us that there were certain things

2346
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:12,540
that the Internet took hold of and said they're having big problems with this.

2347
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:14,020
This is a huge problem.

2348
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:15,820
And we'd say, now, is this accurate? Is that accurate?

2349
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:18,260
And he'd say, yeah, but it was a problem for a week.

2350
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:21,420
And then the next week is a new problem and a new problem. Right.

2351
01:52:21,620 --> 01:52:23,780
Nothing was ever stuck on for that long.

2352
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:26,700
It's just that there's 200 things in this that could go wrong.

2353
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:29,700
Well, and to say now that of like the four, you know, you always hear four

2354
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:33,780
ride systems, which I guess is think about the transport trackless vehicle

2355
01:52:34,100 --> 01:52:36,660
drop system motion simulator.

2356
01:52:37,020 --> 01:52:42,180
I guess motion simulator is both the ending and also the transport ship.

2357
01:52:42,180 --> 01:52:45,620
Sure. Sure. So four right trackless drop.

2358
01:52:45,940 --> 01:52:48,420
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2359
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:53,460
I think that's it's no, it's no one is clearly cataloged it.

2360
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:56,740
In my in my mind, I read through a bunch of articles and I'm like, wait, so

2361
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:59,300
that that that that OK, drop.

2362
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:01,780
In motion are two different ride system. OK.

2363
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:05,580
That if the only track, if you're in California and the only trackless

2364
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:09,340
vehicle you've been on is the little Luigi car, those the shiny cars that dance.

2365
01:53:09,700 --> 01:53:12,380
Imagine you're getting on one of those

2366
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:16,980
and then it drives into the Tower of Terror and goes up the Tower of Terror.

2367
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:21,460
And then drives into Star Tours and goes on Star Tours.

2368
01:53:21,660 --> 01:53:23,900
And then leaves and takes you outside.

2369
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:26,020
Yes. But also, there's a sitting Star Tours.

2370
01:53:26,020 --> 01:53:28,540
And at the very beginning, there was a standing Star Tours.

2371
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:31,020
Yeah. So

2372
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:34,220
which Star Tours and it's on a turntable just heads up.

2373
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:35,940
You are on a turntable.

2374
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:39,220
And there's and there's little hidden rooms like Rocket and like Haunted Mansion.

2375
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:42,300
And they're mean to you like haunted and the cast members do stuff.

2376
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:44,660
Yeah. And it's like a living wax museum.

2377
01:53:44,660 --> 01:53:45,700
And there's a trap door.

2378
01:53:45,700 --> 01:53:49,900
But it's not the trap door you think it is like ten types of things

2379
01:53:49,900 --> 01:53:52,060
all piled on top of each other.

2380
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:54,420
So now you're on the now you go to the bridge.

2381
01:53:54,660 --> 01:53:57,900
This is where I've been calling them like little cubbies that you like

2382
01:53:57,980 --> 01:54:00,820
tuck into this cozy little spot.

2383
01:54:01,180 --> 01:54:02,740
Under. Yeah.

2384
01:54:02,740 --> 01:54:08,460
New and now you have not seen in animatronic form Hux and Kylo. Right.

2385
01:54:09,140 --> 01:54:11,860
And it's I love that you're just you just nestle in.

2386
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:13,420
Maybe they won't notice us.

2387
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:15,020
Maybe we're fine here.

2388
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:17,420
Maybe they're just going over some mundane business.

2389
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:20,220
But no, but just roll up.

2390
01:54:20,460 --> 01:54:24,100
Well, yes, Kylo, there's a little bit beat where he says like, raise the

2391
01:54:24,220 --> 01:54:25,900
raise the shields. That's it.

2392
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:28,300
That's the line, the two line punch of he goes,

2393
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:30,100
you underestimate their conviction.

2394
01:54:30,100 --> 01:54:31,140
Raise the shields.

2395
01:54:31,140 --> 01:54:34,140
But he says raise the shields like a kids of the hall character.

2396
01:54:34,180 --> 01:54:35,620
Like, I don't know what it is.

2397
01:54:35,620 --> 01:54:40,740
It just hit me if only because I've been thinking about the report trailer

2398
01:54:40,740 --> 01:54:42,700
where he goes like everyone was scared.

2399
01:54:42,700 --> 01:54:45,740
And it's just like such an interesting delivery.

2400
01:54:46,300 --> 01:54:48,460
We did see these, I think, in bemoat

2401
01:54:48,740 --> 01:54:51,900
because they're supposed to turn around and look at you a little.

2402
01:54:52,060 --> 01:54:52,900
Oh, yes, yes.

2403
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:55,780
Yeah. I watched the video and I saw that they fully turn around.

2404
01:54:55,780 --> 01:54:56,580
But I don't either.

2405
01:54:56,580 --> 01:54:58,140
Neither time they turned around.

2406
01:54:58,140 --> 01:54:59,220
Neither one of them.

2407
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:00,700
What Kylo was was turned around.

2408
01:55:00,700 --> 01:55:04,380
Kylo's first turn around and Huck's like half turns towards you.

2409
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:09,300
But in one of Todd Martin's articles about this, he talks about how

2410
01:55:10,340 --> 01:55:13,100
the with the Imagineers talk about, like if there's a stall,

2411
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:17,700
you get to see bonus stuff because you get to see the stuff killing time

2412
01:55:17,980 --> 01:55:19,820
that you don't get to see in the regular ride.

2413
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:23,260
So we accounted for the stalls to we accounted for for wait.

2414
01:55:23,260 --> 01:55:24,780
Well, there's a big crazy.

2415
01:55:24,780 --> 01:55:27,740
Did you see what be mode at the end is? No, no.

2416
01:55:27,820 --> 01:55:29,540
Oh, we'll get there. I'll tell you.

2417
01:55:29,540 --> 01:55:32,780
I watched it. It's fun. I was crazy. It's so different.

2418
01:55:34,780 --> 01:55:36,340
How do you get out of here? Do you go backwards?

2419
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:38,260
Well, you have to go backwards.

2420
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:41,660
And then you see kind of a similar like, I don't know.

2421
01:55:41,780 --> 01:55:44,460
It's not all Peppers goes to. Oh, of Kylo.

2422
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:47,100
Kylo drops down. And when you're going backwards,

2423
01:55:47,740 --> 01:55:50,780
I think we didn't see the version he says, how brave, how ultimate,

2424
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:52,620
but ultimately hopeless.

2425
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:55,940
And then at some point he yells, there's nowhere to run,

2426
01:55:55,940 --> 01:56:00,300
which I think of as a like universal go to line on rights.

2427
01:56:01,460 --> 01:56:04,900
There's nowhere to run because I think Imhotep yells it at you.

2428
01:56:05,220 --> 01:56:07,220
Someone else at you.

2429
01:56:07,220 --> 01:56:10,620
I think maybe Trowbridge did some mummy, too.

2430
01:56:10,620 --> 01:56:12,940
I think I've got like the Florida mummy.

2431
01:56:12,940 --> 01:56:15,500
He loves yelling. There's no there's no where to run.

2432
01:56:16,420 --> 01:56:19,300
I read or I watched, I think, on a YouTube video

2433
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:24,300
that the Kylo in that section is a projection, but the lightsaber is real.

2434
01:56:24,660 --> 01:56:28,340
What the lightsaber is emitting light. And that's like real.

2435
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:30,620
I don't know what is holding it. Where he like pounces

2436
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:34,260
when he drops down and like walks toward you.

2437
01:56:34,340 --> 01:56:36,980
The lightsaber is practical. So it emits light.

2438
01:56:37,660 --> 01:56:40,580
We didn't talk a little bit about the shadows in one of the pre shows

2439
01:56:40,780 --> 01:56:42,860
in those videos, did we?

2440
01:56:42,860 --> 01:56:45,980
I don't know. You know, in the the pre show, we were being interrogated.

2441
01:56:46,660 --> 01:56:51,180
They have this crazy thing where the projections are projecting shadows.

2442
01:56:51,620 --> 01:56:53,420
Oh, like elsewhere into the room?

2443
01:56:53,420 --> 01:56:56,940
Well, on the grading that's in front of the. Oh.

2444
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:59,340
So like, that's the difference between like that.

2445
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:03,020
And I maybe I don't think Harry Potter has that one, like you see the kids

2446
01:57:03,460 --> 01:57:06,740
up there, but like when Hux and Kylo are walking,

2447
01:57:06,740 --> 01:57:08,980
there's a shadow in front of them.

2448
01:57:08,980 --> 01:57:11,980
And there's a crazy way like even I forget which YouTube video

2449
01:57:12,020 --> 01:57:14,220
there's YouTube videos about like the secrets of it.

2450
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:17,340
And there's a way they now project shadows from the screen.

2451
01:57:18,140 --> 01:57:19,540
Oh, my God.

2452
01:57:19,540 --> 01:57:24,020
So, yeah, this is a different one where it's actually the lightsaber

2453
01:57:24,020 --> 01:57:28,220
is actually some sort of practical thing that's emitting light.

2454
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:30,460
And then he's just a projection walking toward you.

2455
01:57:30,780 --> 01:57:33,740
Wow. Well, so much backwards on that.

2456
01:57:33,740 --> 01:57:35,740
A ton of great backwards moments. Yeah.

2457
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:39,700
And then you then you are cornered.

2458
01:57:39,700 --> 01:57:41,340
You're trapped. The door.

2459
01:57:41,340 --> 01:57:44,060
Again, the writers don't show you that that door

2460
01:57:44,060 --> 01:57:46,780
that closes just slam so fast. Yeah.

2461
01:57:46,860 --> 01:57:52,100
All the motion in this is just huge pieces moving really quickly.

2462
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:55,140
And now you're trying. Now you are in the commercial moment.

2463
01:57:55,380 --> 01:57:59,340
So it's even this has probably been spoiled, but still seeing it in person

2464
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:03,220
is so fantastic. And it's less the commercial makes it look.

2465
01:58:03,980 --> 01:58:06,540
It's really cool, but the commercial makes it look better.

2466
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:08,740
Hmm. That's my memory of it.

2467
01:58:08,740 --> 01:58:12,380
But that's also the Indiana Jones commercials made it look like. Yeah.

2468
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:15,860
There was a physical Indiana Jones in there. Yeah, that's true.

2469
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:17,900
That's all in their playbook.

2470
01:58:17,900 --> 01:58:21,260
Yeah. So he so Kylo's saber goes through the ceiling

2471
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:24,100
and is trying to slice into the elevator.

2472
01:58:24,100 --> 01:58:26,580
These are that and the him dropping down.

2473
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:29,020
Those are like horror movie tropes. Yeah.

2474
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:32,420
Those are horror movie go to the clip I've seen from the trailer

2475
01:58:32,420 --> 01:58:36,580
makes it look like he's slicing all like around the corners of it

2476
01:58:37,180 --> 01:58:39,340
as opposed to like there's a little section

2477
01:58:39,740 --> 01:58:42,180
that's different than the rest of it that he slices into,

2478
01:58:42,180 --> 01:58:44,300
which is still a very cool effect. Yeah.

2479
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:47,380
But yeah, they did. And I do. You guys know how this works?

2480
01:58:47,420 --> 01:58:49,020
I look I know how it works.

2481
01:58:49,020 --> 01:58:50,420
I didn't know. I couldn't guess.

2482
01:58:50,420 --> 01:58:52,780
So I had to look it up to see how it works.

2483
01:58:52,780 --> 01:58:55,980
There is a so so basically there's a little like section

2484
01:58:55,980 --> 01:58:59,020
of the top of the elevator that's different than the rest.

2485
01:58:59,020 --> 01:59:01,180
And it's just obviously different material.

2486
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:03,940
And there's almost like I don't know if it's a complete circle,

2487
01:59:04,260 --> 01:59:10,700
but it rotates like, I guess, much like the pre show the on the on the transport.

2488
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:14,340
All of a sudden, like, so like, I think this is going to be impossible

2489
01:59:14,340 --> 01:59:16,180
for me to maybe fully explain.

2490
01:59:16,180 --> 01:59:19,220
But there's like the lightsaber here and then there's this.

2491
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:24,740
And then it rotates and then a section opens up with a hole.

2492
01:59:25,380 --> 01:59:29,020
And it goes in there and it slices along like this.

2493
01:59:29,060 --> 01:59:30,620
Does that make sense?

2494
01:59:30,620 --> 01:59:34,460
Not really. OK, is it like like a bunch is turning

2495
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:36,540
that already has a whole pre-cut? Yes.

2496
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:40,860
Yes. And it only reveals itself as the saber is.

2497
01:59:40,860 --> 01:59:43,060
Yes. The front of the hole.

2498
01:59:43,060 --> 01:59:45,300
So like there's a circle that rotates.

2499
01:59:45,380 --> 01:59:47,620
It has a pre-cut section out of it.

2500
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:50,420
There's a lightsaber above it.

2501
01:59:50,420 --> 01:59:53,900
And the lightsaber goes down as soon as that hole

2502
01:59:54,180 --> 01:59:55,940
this start of the hole appears.

2503
01:59:55,940 --> 01:59:58,900
If there was no lightsaber, just suddenly you'd see a C.

2504
01:59:59,140 --> 02:00:00,860
Yes, exactly. Pre-cut.

2505
02:00:00,860 --> 02:00:03,900
OK, exactly. And the stuff inside the lightsaber is spinning, right?

2506
02:00:04,140 --> 02:00:05,340
We yes, I believe so.

2507
02:00:05,340 --> 02:00:08,700
Yes, it looks more like it's flickering. Right.

2508
02:00:08,700 --> 02:00:14,220
And in Kylo's Hilt has a very unstable and like sputters.

2509
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:18,300
So is there some projection in there, too, to make it seem like like

2510
02:00:18,980 --> 02:00:20,700
because it feels very textural.

2511
02:00:20,700 --> 02:00:22,780
I don't know the answer to that. I'm not sure.

2512
02:00:22,780 --> 02:00:24,780
But it does feel yeah, it feels

2513
02:00:25,700 --> 02:00:27,940
yeah, it feels like you would touch it and burn.

2514
02:00:27,940 --> 02:00:33,300
So cool. I think also instant iconic moment is the droid going, wow.

2515
02:00:33,900 --> 02:00:35,860
He does scream and agony. Yeah.

2516
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:37,940
It's really fun.

2517
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:42,060
And then we get into what I will declare,

2518
02:00:42,060 --> 02:00:46,380
not just my favorite part of the ride, but maybe my favorite part of any ride.

2519
02:00:46,780 --> 02:00:48,540
I think this room is incredible.

2520
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:50,100
I did not know about this.

2521
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:53,100
I also did. I had no idea that this was here.

2522
02:00:53,140 --> 02:00:56,500
Even though we all saw the teaser a long time ago, right?

2523
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:58,500
Where the ships just suddenly flash appear.

2524
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:00,940
Yes. And the woman at the console goes, what?

2525
02:01:00,940 --> 02:01:02,540
That's the. That's in this room.

2526
02:01:02,540 --> 02:01:05,100
So we were always looking at those cannons,

2527
02:01:05,420 --> 02:01:07,860
but we didn't know what they were capable of. Right.

2528
02:01:09,620 --> 02:01:13,580
I'll take Trowbridge is behind the scenes description of it

2529
02:01:13,580 --> 02:01:16,500
that you are essentially playing a game of cat and mouse

2530
02:01:16,860 --> 02:01:22,140
in your vehicle with giant cannons moving in front of you, moving backwards.

2531
02:01:22,540 --> 02:01:26,100
They're so tall. They hurt much taller than your vehicle.

2532
02:01:26,300 --> 02:01:30,580
They seem like they should weigh, you know, five tons.

2533
02:01:30,820 --> 02:01:33,220
You obviously they don't, but that's how they look.

2534
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:37,260
And you are trying to find openings as best as you can

2535
02:01:37,260 --> 02:01:40,740
when the thing is in front of you and you're nervous as you move in front

2536
02:01:40,740 --> 02:01:45,100
of the cannons, is this thing just going to spear me down the center?

2537
02:01:46,380 --> 02:01:52,260
And my thought on this for some reason, it feels extremely super Mario to me.

2538
02:01:52,300 --> 02:01:53,220
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

2539
02:01:53,220 --> 02:01:56,860
It's like, OK, wait for that, like, especially, I guess, like the ice blocks or

2540
02:01:58,060 --> 02:02:00,060
it just feels like like an odd little.

2541
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:02,220
I have to like figure out the rhythm of this.

2542
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:05,940
Obviously, you have no choice in the matter, but you are thinking about that.

2543
02:02:05,940 --> 02:02:08,100
You're like, wait, we're moving. Is that going to work?

2544
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:10,580
Is this thing just going to crash into the side? Yeah.

2545
02:02:10,580 --> 02:02:13,860
And I'll say this is maybe the only part of the ride

2546
02:02:14,580 --> 02:02:18,380
that does make me feel like it could go wrong.

2547
02:02:19,380 --> 02:02:23,580
The rest of the ride is very impressive and cool, but there's not a lot of

2548
02:02:24,780 --> 02:02:27,900
danger. I don't feel a lot of legit danger.

2549
02:02:28,060 --> 02:02:29,980
But this part does make me feel like

2550
02:02:30,900 --> 02:02:33,020
something could crush like it could.

2551
02:02:33,020 --> 02:02:35,020
I don't know how. I'm sure they can't.

2552
02:02:35,020 --> 02:02:36,740
It certainly can.

2553
02:02:36,740 --> 02:02:40,620
It's I'm sure like that's a lot lighter than you think they are.

2554
02:02:40,900 --> 02:02:42,020
As they look heavy.

2555
02:02:42,020 --> 02:02:47,100
Although apparently, if the cannon, I mean, not that the cannons would hit the cars.

2556
02:02:47,100 --> 02:02:51,060
I'm sure there's a million stopgap, like there's a million failstakes for that.

2557
02:02:51,380 --> 02:02:55,380
But apparently they are moving with such force that if they go too far,

2558
02:02:55,580 --> 02:02:57,820
they can hit something and shake the building.

2559
02:02:58,140 --> 02:03:00,860
Oh, sure. I mean, they're giant.

2560
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:05,380
Yes, man. So that is I that's the only part of the ride where I go.

2561
02:03:06,220 --> 02:03:08,740
Yeah, it is haunting.

2562
02:03:08,740 --> 02:03:10,100
It's all of the stuff.

2563
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:12,380
This is the room I can't stop thinking about.

2564
02:03:12,660 --> 02:03:14,700
I want to go back very badly.

2565
02:03:14,700 --> 02:03:17,580
Yeah, I like did you guys have dreams about the ride?

2566
02:03:18,820 --> 02:03:20,700
I don't think I had leading up to it.

2567
02:03:20,700 --> 02:03:22,220
I did. Oh, nice.

2568
02:03:22,220 --> 02:03:26,180
Nice. Like I was on the ride and yeah, but I don't think I did after the fact.

2569
02:03:26,180 --> 02:03:30,260
I think watching Jason had dream about a toy, Darius, swirl, toy, Darius,

2570
02:03:30,260 --> 02:03:32,100
chasing me. Yeah.

2571
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:33,740
And multiple hot dogs.

2572
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:36,860
Even out of also cold, you fool.

2573
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:41,100
It's a big day. Drink me anyway.

2574
02:03:41,180 --> 02:03:43,660
Yeah. Yeah.

2575
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:46,220
This room was really intense because there's also the full screens.

2576
02:03:46,220 --> 02:03:50,900
There's a full battle going on outside that the guys are firing.

2577
02:03:50,900 --> 02:03:52,580
And you want to watch that.

2578
02:03:52,580 --> 02:03:54,660
Yes. You know, that's incredible animation.

2579
02:03:54,660 --> 02:03:56,620
But the cannons are so engrossing.

2580
02:03:56,620 --> 02:04:00,180
Yeah. I had to turn back and watch it again from behind.

2581
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:01,860
Yeah, I can't believe those pieces.

2582
02:04:01,860 --> 02:04:05,580
Some of this I had to rewatch on video just to remember stuff

2583
02:04:05,580 --> 02:04:07,820
because it's so overwhelming.

2584
02:04:07,820 --> 02:04:12,740
And then we were, again, also punchy because we got up at four in the morning.

2585
02:04:12,740 --> 02:04:15,060
Yeah. So really surreal.

2586
02:04:15,220 --> 02:04:19,060
Been up for like eight hours or so by the time you finally rode it,

2587
02:04:19,060 --> 02:04:23,020
which I don't we have said you do not have to do that anymore.

2588
02:04:23,300 --> 02:04:26,620
And we also clearly didn't have to do our friend who got there

2589
02:04:26,620 --> 02:04:30,380
at seven fifteen was in the same boat we were. Yeah.

2590
02:04:31,420 --> 02:04:32,580
Which is but it's very funny.

2591
02:04:32,580 --> 02:04:34,180
It was a fun experience.

2592
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:37,700
Yeah, geez. I mean, it's such a narrow hallway, too.

2593
02:04:37,740 --> 02:04:43,700
I think some of my like my big stuff in small rooms, I think, had my my Mario

2594
02:04:43,700 --> 02:04:47,580
born fear was coming true in front of me a couple of times in this ride.

2595
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:50,420
Yeah, that was my question, because we had you had talked about it before

2596
02:04:50,420 --> 02:04:52,580
with those 80. I feel like the 80s did.

2597
02:04:52,580 --> 02:04:55,340
Did it get triggered in the 8080 room?

2598
02:04:55,340 --> 02:04:59,060
Not there. No. But here, much more because it's a much smaller room.

2599
02:04:59,060 --> 02:05:01,380
Right. The Cannon Room. Right.

2600
02:05:01,380 --> 02:05:03,580
And it's just and it's very Mario in general.

2601
02:05:04,460 --> 02:05:09,860
Now, will the actual Mario ride be more exciting than some of this?

2602
02:05:09,860 --> 02:05:11,060
Be more much.

2603
02:05:11,060 --> 02:05:14,940
I think that's now the like pressures on Mario.

2604
02:05:14,980 --> 02:05:20,020
There's a leaked there is a leaked Mario Kart track out there

2605
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:22,100
that I have again.

2606
02:05:22,100 --> 02:05:22,740
I'm an idiot.

2607
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:24,460
Looked at a little bit.

2608
02:05:24,460 --> 02:05:26,740
That is just if they can pull it off.

2609
02:05:26,940 --> 02:05:29,860
It has what this has where it's many rooms.

2610
02:05:29,860 --> 02:05:35,580
So many like eight eight different worlds, like some crazy amount. Wow.

2611
02:05:35,620 --> 02:05:38,060
Oh, boy. God bless this war.

2612
02:05:38,100 --> 02:05:40,100
Yeah. This is a wonderful war.

2613
02:05:40,100 --> 02:05:44,980
They yeah, if they could if they can pull off half of what I glanced at.

2614
02:05:45,420 --> 02:05:46,700
Yeah, it'll be in.

2615
02:05:46,700 --> 02:05:48,940
It could top. I mean, it could top this.

2616
02:05:49,100 --> 02:05:50,180
Yeah, possible.

2617
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:53,300
They have. Yes, there's one thing on the horizon that might.

2618
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:55,740
And it's opening in a few months until in Tokyo.

2619
02:05:55,740 --> 02:05:57,540
Yes. Hooray.

2620
02:05:57,540 --> 02:06:00,020
And then maybe next year.

2621
02:06:00,020 --> 02:06:01,620
What a wonderful world.

2622
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:06,060
I think really, though, if Mario Kart, the ride doesn't top

2623
02:06:06,460 --> 02:06:09,460
rise, the resistance, they do have, I swear,

2624
02:06:10,060 --> 02:06:13,380
like people might be happier with Mario more than Galaxy's Edge

2625
02:06:13,380 --> 02:06:15,260
because you can ride Yoshi's around.

2626
02:06:15,260 --> 02:06:18,220
Now, the only thing missing is that Bantha.

2627
02:06:18,220 --> 02:06:20,180
That's true. Yeah.

2628
02:06:20,180 --> 02:06:24,140
I if they have if they have it and it delivers,

2629
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:28,220
I will I have an annual pass into Universal a couple of years.

2630
02:06:28,500 --> 02:06:31,020
I will get one. And any time I'm driving by,

2631
02:06:31,940 --> 02:06:34,060
I will just like park on Lancashire.

2632
02:06:34,060 --> 02:06:35,020
I'm on Lancashire.

2633
02:06:35,020 --> 02:06:38,100
Take the shuttle up the hill, then go down the hill.

2634
02:06:38,220 --> 02:06:41,100
It's a two hour and then back up and back down.

2635
02:06:41,100 --> 02:06:43,260
Like Homer parking next to his own backyard.

2636
02:06:44,100 --> 02:06:48,460
Oh, man, I should just get like a security guard job at Universal

2637
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:50,620
to get a pass. Oh, yeah.

2638
02:06:50,620 --> 02:06:54,460
Like I just want to work three hours a week, three, 30 minutes a week.

2639
02:06:54,980 --> 02:06:56,500
Well, but they might lock that down.

2640
02:06:56,500 --> 02:07:00,380
I mean, I think once we're now that rise is open, I believe

2641
02:07:00,900 --> 02:07:04,860
passholder passes may be blacked out a little in some certain parts.

2642
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:07,140
You're right. The plan wasn't sound.

2643
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:10,940
It wasn't a good idea to become a security guard to get on Mario.

2644
02:07:10,940 --> 02:07:13,060
I mean, that might but it may be the jobs rewarding.

2645
02:07:13,140 --> 02:07:14,980
Yeah, get some connections. That's true.

2646
02:07:14,980 --> 02:07:17,740
Well, maybe maybe I'll just shift out of the entertainment industry,

2647
02:07:18,260 --> 02:07:20,820
get into the security of the entertainment industry.

2648
02:07:20,820 --> 02:07:23,300
And maybe we all will. And maybe we'll all have no choice.

2649
02:07:23,380 --> 02:07:26,340
Yep. It'll be more stable.

2650
02:07:26,340 --> 02:07:30,420
So then you still you

2651
02:07:30,940 --> 02:07:33,700
a new giant room like how are there still giant rooms to go

2652
02:07:33,700 --> 02:07:35,780
and battle damaged hallways? Yeah.

2653
02:07:35,780 --> 02:07:39,820
The cannon room in the next set piece, there's battle damage happening around.

2654
02:07:39,820 --> 02:07:41,780
This is this is cool. Battle damage.

2655
02:07:41,780 --> 02:07:46,180
It's bigger and it's like, yeah, because now they're being shot at more by the

2656
02:07:46,700 --> 02:07:49,100
the I was going to say the Alliance.

2657
02:07:49,100 --> 02:07:50,740
That's not right, right?

2658
02:07:50,740 --> 02:07:53,100
The resistance, the resistance. Yeah.

2659
02:07:53,380 --> 02:07:54,340
Not the rebels.

2660
02:07:54,340 --> 02:07:58,500
The naming the naming change between original trilogy and new trilogy

2661
02:07:58,500 --> 02:08:01,180
is so like confounding and unneeded.

2662
02:08:01,180 --> 02:08:02,500
And it's bizarre.

2663
02:08:02,500 --> 02:08:07,660
So there are people who are resistance and rebel alliance, like nine.

2664
02:08:08,260 --> 02:08:09,260
They're both. Well, yeah.

2665
02:08:09,740 --> 02:08:14,220
Yeah. And then in Rise of Skyrock, there's the last order in the first order.

2666
02:08:14,220 --> 02:08:16,780
But then it's also like old empire

2667
02:08:17,540 --> 02:08:21,060
tech in a lot like it's empire star destroyers.

2668
02:08:22,060 --> 02:08:24,380
But then there are Sith troopers.

2669
02:08:24,940 --> 02:08:28,300
But in and then in the extended universe, like books and stuff, they were like,

2670
02:08:29,060 --> 02:08:32,020
it's the New Republic and the remains of the empire.

2671
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:33,940
Go ahead. Go go for it.

2672
02:08:33,940 --> 02:08:35,420
It seems right. Yeah.

2673
02:08:35,420 --> 02:08:39,180
You know, if you were going to pull anything from what I think we can

2674
02:08:39,660 --> 02:08:43,620
now agree, there's been a I think all we can say in general, step back from it.

2675
02:08:43,620 --> 02:08:46,140
There is a mixed reaction to the Disney Star Wars.

2676
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:49,900
And I think the only thing the thing you can pull that I think nobody would disagree

2677
02:08:49,900 --> 02:08:54,260
with set design, wonderful, great production design to these movies.

2678
02:08:54,340 --> 02:08:57,820
It feels like seeing like current built in 2010s,

2679
02:08:58,580 --> 02:09:04,420
like huge versions of the Star Wars aesthetic, very like current and high tech.

2680
02:09:04,460 --> 02:09:06,500
Sure. I think I think sets have been wonderful throughout.

2681
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:07,980
And that's what the ride feels like.

2682
02:09:07,980 --> 02:09:12,860
You get to be in like the best end of the production design of the sleek

2683
02:09:13,140 --> 02:09:17,260
2015 and past and present in this.

2684
02:09:17,700 --> 02:09:21,020
In addition to that, the production design, the John Williams music,

2685
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:24,620
there's some newer John Williams themes that play throughout this.

2686
02:09:25,020 --> 02:09:26,780
Sure. Everybody agrees on to.

2687
02:09:26,780 --> 02:09:29,020
I think. Yeah, I like the thing.

2688
02:09:29,020 --> 02:09:31,420
I like the race song. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

2689
02:09:31,940 --> 02:09:34,260
And I think like people like the cat.

2690
02:09:34,260 --> 02:09:37,260
I think some of the the parsing of it, like people just don't like

2691
02:09:37,540 --> 02:09:41,180
some of what has been done with all of the chess pieces that were set up.

2692
02:09:41,380 --> 02:09:43,940
But some of the chess pieces, very promising, great productions,

2693
02:09:43,940 --> 02:09:45,940
and great music cast pretty wonderful.

2694
02:09:45,940 --> 02:09:47,580
And the cast, I think, is great in this.

2695
02:09:47,580 --> 02:09:49,900
I think you go on this, you leave this ride and you go like,

2696
02:09:50,140 --> 02:09:54,540
well, that ride like implied a better set of movies, maybe perhaps.

2697
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:58,820
At the very least, a more cohesive set of movies.

2698
02:09:58,820 --> 02:09:59,780
Yes. Oh, right.

2699
02:09:59,780 --> 02:10:02,460
It was funny in the first like Finn had some good lines.

2700
02:10:02,460 --> 02:10:04,060
Yeah, right. Yes.

2701
02:10:04,060 --> 02:10:06,180
I think this is the Finn that I liked.

2702
02:10:06,180 --> 02:10:08,740
Yeah, I assumed would be more.

2703
02:10:09,020 --> 02:10:10,100
That's not what we're here to do.

2704
02:10:10,100 --> 02:10:13,300
But and we even all of our opinions are all over the map.

2705
02:10:13,420 --> 02:10:17,060
But I like I think just like nobody's trying to hate on Star Wars

2706
02:10:17,260 --> 02:10:19,060
things just to do it.

2707
02:10:19,060 --> 02:10:22,700
And I think it's really exciting to have a thing that's like this.

2708
02:10:23,220 --> 02:10:26,220
I think this is the ultimate thing, I think, that came out of the Disney

2709
02:10:26,220 --> 02:10:28,580
Star Wars purchase. I got it.

2710
02:10:28,580 --> 02:10:31,900
After all the movies, finally, we have the ultimate thing

2711
02:10:31,900 --> 02:10:32,620
they got to do.

2712
02:10:32,620 --> 02:10:35,020
You just have to get to Disneyland at 8am.

2713
02:10:35,020 --> 02:10:36,220
Just at Disneyland.

2714
02:10:36,220 --> 02:10:40,140
Yeah. If they did a baby Yoda meet and greet in Galaxy's Edge,

2715
02:10:40,140 --> 02:10:41,860
people would lose their fucking mind.

2716
02:10:41,860 --> 02:10:42,860
I mean, it's weird.

2717
02:10:42,860 --> 02:10:45,140
I can't imagine it's not on the table.

2718
02:10:45,700 --> 02:10:47,860
I can't imagine. I heard somebody talking about it.

2719
02:10:47,860 --> 02:10:50,100
Was it Jim? It might have been Jim Hill.

2720
02:10:50,100 --> 02:10:51,940
I forget or Len or Jim were talking about it.

2721
02:10:51,940 --> 02:10:54,340
Like he would only be like 60 at this point.

2722
02:10:54,340 --> 02:10:56,020
It would only be like another six months.

2723
02:10:56,020 --> 02:10:56,980
And you know what happened?

2724
02:10:56,980 --> 02:10:59,340
It's like it's like right before the new movies.

2725
02:10:59,860 --> 02:11:01,700
It's after Jedi. Yeah.

2726
02:11:01,700 --> 02:11:03,660
I think I haven't finished Mandalorian yet.

2727
02:11:03,660 --> 02:11:05,220
I haven't gotten around to it.

2728
02:11:05,220 --> 02:11:08,620
But yeah, he I mean, they did the little baby Groot meet and greet in Florida.

2729
02:11:09,380 --> 02:11:12,180
And people love the same same basic thing.

2730
02:11:12,180 --> 02:11:14,060
Yeah. Yeah.

2731
02:11:14,060 --> 02:11:15,020
It doesn't make sense.

2732
02:11:15,020 --> 02:11:17,460
But can we just like ride on baby Yoda's?

2733
02:11:17,700 --> 02:11:20,260
Can we like, you know, like, it doesn't make any sense.

2734
02:11:20,260 --> 02:11:21,300
It doesn't. I don't care.

2735
02:11:21,300 --> 02:11:23,020
We need like a cute ride.

2736
02:11:23,020 --> 02:11:24,740
There are other creatures to ride on.

2737
02:11:24,740 --> 02:11:26,740
Yes. Baby Yoda is probably not it.

2738
02:11:26,740 --> 02:11:28,580
He could be in the car with you.

2739
02:11:28,580 --> 02:11:30,780
Old Disney, old Disney wouldn't have cared.

2740
02:11:30,780 --> 02:11:34,180
In the 50s would have been like, and then you ride a baby Yoda. Sure.

2741
02:11:34,580 --> 02:11:36,420
Doesn't matter. We're not thinking about like.

2742
02:11:36,420 --> 02:11:38,140
A rolly jumbo.

2743
02:11:38,140 --> 02:11:40,940
Baby Yoda would be like Yoshi and be different colors. Yeah.

2744
02:11:41,060 --> 02:11:42,700
Yellow, red, baby Yoda.

2745
02:11:42,700 --> 02:11:43,940
I want a magenta baby Yoda.

2746
02:11:43,940 --> 02:11:45,940
In the Trevorrow script that's leaked,

2747
02:11:46,820 --> 02:11:51,900
there was an evil Yoda that would train Kylo Ren, which I like.

2748
02:11:51,900 --> 02:11:53,580
I don't know if he looked like Yoda.

2749
02:11:53,580 --> 02:11:55,740
That's a fun idea. But that would have been a fun idea.

2750
02:11:55,740 --> 02:11:58,700
I recall before Force Awakens

2751
02:11:58,740 --> 02:12:01,500
when people were just speculating what characters were,

2752
02:12:02,180 --> 02:12:05,780
Mike Mitchell believed Snoke was an evil Yoda.

2753
02:12:05,780 --> 02:12:07,980
That was his guess. Yes.

2754
02:12:07,980 --> 02:12:11,420
Well, we also want to know how big he was.

2755
02:12:11,820 --> 02:12:15,420
Well, that was we still didn't know until the last Jedi how big he was.

2756
02:12:15,420 --> 02:12:17,580
And the answer was normal size.

2757
02:12:17,580 --> 02:12:20,820
It was not regular. Not big at all. Not big. Normal.

2758
02:12:21,180 --> 02:12:23,820
Is this still? No, I guess the timeline doesn't allow it.

2759
02:12:23,820 --> 02:12:26,340
So that's no you can ride a Snoke around.

2760
02:12:26,460 --> 02:12:29,780
Well, there's many Snokes we know from Rise of Skywalker.

2761
02:12:29,780 --> 02:12:31,500
Do we know that? We do.

2762
02:12:31,500 --> 02:12:33,620
We saw them in the tube.

2763
02:12:33,620 --> 02:12:35,300
There were multiple Snokes.

2764
02:12:35,300 --> 02:12:38,500
Waterpark, where you ride through empty Snoke tubes.

2765
02:12:38,500 --> 02:12:40,340
They're still building the Snoke tube.

2766
02:12:40,340 --> 02:12:42,300
That's good. Yeah.

2767
02:12:42,300 --> 02:12:44,660
Exegol Waterpark. Sure.

2768
02:12:44,660 --> 02:12:47,060
You go through the Snoke tubes. Yeah.

2769
02:12:47,060 --> 02:12:48,460
And you're you're Snoke.

2770
02:12:48,460 --> 02:12:50,660
It'll be like the Hulk ride where it's like your Snoke.

2771
02:12:50,660 --> 02:12:53,140
They'll have to figure out a safe way. We're turning you into a Snoke.

2772
02:12:53,140 --> 02:12:54,300
We're turning you into a Snoke.

2773
02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:57,060
Also, this is a water park with a lot of lightning effects.

2774
02:12:57,220 --> 02:12:59,420
You're going to like. Oh, yeah.

2775
02:12:59,420 --> 02:13:02,460
Your brain will think that's OK.

2776
02:13:02,900 --> 02:13:04,860
That's not a bad idea.

2777
02:13:04,860 --> 02:13:08,220
So yeah, this last room, you're and you're going towards the exit

2778
02:13:08,220 --> 02:13:10,060
and what does become the exit.

2779
02:13:10,060 --> 02:13:13,540
But then you hear Kylo Ren and you whip around and he's been in the room

2780
02:13:13,540 --> 02:13:15,380
and you didn't see him. Yeah.

2781
02:13:15,380 --> 02:13:17,620
He's well, he comes up. Oh, OK.

2782
02:13:17,620 --> 02:13:18,420
I believe he comes up.

2783
02:13:18,420 --> 02:13:22,700
There's also some blast doors in this room that I I need to ride this sequence

2784
02:13:22,740 --> 02:13:26,740
again, because in some of the videos, people were focusing the cameras

2785
02:13:26,740 --> 02:13:29,420
on other things. And I didn't they tricked me.

2786
02:13:29,420 --> 02:13:32,700
I was looking straight ahead to the more screens of the battle.

2787
02:13:33,100 --> 02:13:36,180
I was just he just was there suddenly. Yeah. Yeah.

2788
02:13:36,180 --> 02:13:38,580
They just pulled your attention somewhere like a magic trick.

2789
02:13:38,780 --> 02:13:40,940
You're looking over here and he shows up over there.

2790
02:13:41,340 --> 02:13:45,540
Now, we heard this little inside info is that this Kylo,

2791
02:13:45,860 --> 02:13:48,420
we were told to take a look at all of you.

2792
02:13:48,420 --> 02:13:52,380
But we were told that this might this may be the bones of Elsa.

2793
02:13:52,700 --> 02:13:55,740
From Frozen Ever After, or at least the offish is the same model.

2794
02:13:55,740 --> 02:13:59,980
Yeah, at least the same model and dressed it differently as the same capabilities

2795
02:13:59,980 --> 02:14:02,820
as far as like move waiving arms around.

2796
02:14:02,820 --> 02:14:06,460
Yeah, it is. It is extremely fluid. Yeah.

2797
02:14:07,420 --> 02:14:09,460
So and it does a lot. So much happens here.

2798
02:14:09,460 --> 02:14:12,940
He controls two vehicles at once with the force.

2799
02:14:13,180 --> 02:14:16,940
Then the fucking ship gets blown back.

2800
02:14:17,020 --> 02:14:18,340
Very cool. Yeah.

2801
02:14:18,340 --> 02:14:21,660
You feel that also thing that right there right there doesn't indicate

2802
02:14:22,340 --> 02:14:25,380
fill a big blast of space air

2803
02:14:26,660 --> 02:14:30,700
and then big debris falls down in front of him.

2804
02:14:30,940 --> 02:14:33,580
And that's another one of those. Those pieces are so big.

2805
02:14:33,580 --> 02:14:34,820
It really so big.

2806
02:14:34,820 --> 02:14:38,500
And it's so pieces and it covers the animatronic going back.

2807
02:14:38,500 --> 02:14:41,300
That's yeah. Oh, so he's able to reset almost immediately.

2808
02:14:41,300 --> 02:14:42,580
Yes. Wow.

2809
02:14:42,580 --> 02:14:44,780
So this is the moment I mentioned earlier.

2810
02:14:44,780 --> 02:14:49,100
The reason that blast happens behind him, because if you look to your right,

2811
02:14:49,140 --> 02:14:55,860
a tie fighter has been shot and is on fire and it comes at the screen.

2812
02:14:55,860 --> 02:14:56,380
Yeah, I miss this.

2813
02:14:56,380 --> 02:14:59,700
And it it's coming at you.

2814
02:14:59,700 --> 02:15:04,420
And in perfect sync, it goes off the screen and it hits behind.

2815
02:15:04,700 --> 02:15:06,380
Oh, it's in sync.

2816
02:15:06,380 --> 02:15:07,260
I didn't know this.

2817
02:15:07,260 --> 02:15:09,340
I we did it twice and I did not notice.

2818
02:15:09,340 --> 02:15:13,580
I didn't see it. A tie fighter in the footage explodes and comes right at you

2819
02:15:13,580 --> 02:15:16,500
and causes the corner of the ship to explode.

2820
02:15:16,500 --> 02:15:17,900
And that's why.

2821
02:15:17,900 --> 02:15:21,220
Yeah, he basically has a panel blow off behind him.

2822
02:15:21,220 --> 02:15:21,740
Yeah. Yeah.

2823
02:15:21,740 --> 02:15:25,180
And then there's a projection of like fire and or is it a screen behind him?

2824
02:15:25,180 --> 02:15:26,460
Projection to the sides.

2825
02:15:26,460 --> 02:15:29,540
And then there's a screen behind him of the vacuum of space.

2826
02:15:29,540 --> 02:15:32,060
And it looks like he almost gets blown out. Right.

2827
02:15:33,340 --> 02:15:35,900
So that's so if you knew where to look at the very beginning of that,

2828
02:15:35,900 --> 02:15:38,660
you would see the full you would see it coming at you

2829
02:15:38,660 --> 02:15:42,300
and then it would hit in correct time. Right.

2830
02:15:42,980 --> 02:15:44,380
God. Yeah, that's crazy.

2831
02:15:44,380 --> 02:15:45,700
I did not notice that.

2832
02:15:45,740 --> 02:15:48,100
So, yes, that has to be on my sixth ride.

2833
02:15:48,100 --> 02:15:50,900
I'll go back and look and see what it looks like.

2834
02:15:50,900 --> 02:15:53,060
A lot of reasons to keep going back.

2835
02:15:53,060 --> 02:15:56,020
And now so many things have happened and you've never got you're still on that

2836
02:15:56,020 --> 02:15:59,220
top level and you're thinking, well, when I keep hearing there is a drop.

2837
02:15:59,260 --> 02:16:00,300
Right. When is this drop?

2838
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:01,940
I'm tense the whole time about the drop.

2839
02:16:01,940 --> 02:16:04,060
I'm still nervous about drops.

2840
02:16:04,060 --> 02:16:07,580
Then you pull up into a star tours.

2841
02:16:07,580 --> 02:16:09,700
It's not so evident that's what's happening. Right.

2842
02:16:09,700 --> 02:16:13,540
But once the once the pod doors open, like, oh, this must be it.

2843
02:16:13,540 --> 02:16:14,340
This has got to be it.

2844
02:16:14,340 --> 02:16:17,660
You're like you're suddenly facing little screens on the screens.

2845
02:16:18,580 --> 02:16:21,980
Your vehicles are getting dropped like, like just arms open

2846
02:16:22,140 --> 02:16:24,340
and they fall a ton.

2847
02:16:24,340 --> 02:16:26,860
So you really like what am I in for?

2848
02:16:26,860 --> 02:16:28,780
Yeah. You don't have any time to think about it.

2849
02:16:28,780 --> 02:16:32,100
And there's a drop that's kind of my it's not so crazy.

2850
02:16:32,140 --> 02:16:34,340
It's maybe two stories or one and a half.

2851
02:16:34,340 --> 02:16:36,380
Yeah. And you get caught too.

2852
02:16:36,380 --> 02:16:41,420
Like it's almost like you get like the the like if you were on a plane

2853
02:16:41,420 --> 02:16:43,620
and it drops a little and then you get caught.

2854
02:16:43,660 --> 02:16:45,700
That's kind of what it feels like. Yeah.

2855
02:16:45,700 --> 02:16:47,660
Did you see this?

2856
02:16:47,660 --> 02:16:51,060
If you watch the footage in the corner of the video,

2857
02:16:51,420 --> 02:16:54,820
you see the other escape pods and Beck is in one.

2858
02:16:54,820 --> 02:16:56,980
Yes, I saw. Oh, and he drops.

2859
02:16:56,980 --> 02:17:01,580
And then I believe it's Hux and Ren go into the other one.

2860
02:17:01,740 --> 02:17:03,780
And oh, I didn't see them.

2861
02:17:03,780 --> 02:17:05,860
Hux cues the drop.

2862
02:17:05,860 --> 02:17:09,340
Hux cues the drop and you drop it's the same time as them.

2863
02:17:09,740 --> 02:17:12,740
In the distance, he holds his hand up and that's when you drop

2864
02:17:12,740 --> 02:17:14,940
as like he gives the command to drop.

2865
02:17:15,620 --> 02:17:17,740
Oh, so we're in an empire.

2866
02:17:17,740 --> 02:17:20,300
We're in a first order escape pod.

2867
02:17:20,300 --> 02:17:22,660
We snuck into them and he's just dropping all the pods

2868
02:17:22,660 --> 02:17:24,460
because there's plenty of first order people.

2869
02:17:24,460 --> 02:17:27,740
It's a little hard to tell, but I'm pretty sure that's what you see

2870
02:17:27,940 --> 02:17:32,660
because that drops and goes to another Star Destroyer to like,

2871
02:17:32,700 --> 02:17:36,340
you know, take shelter in and you go the different direction.

2872
02:17:36,340 --> 02:17:38,700
And that's Kylo getting saved.

2873
02:17:38,900 --> 02:17:40,940
Because Kylo doesn't get sucked out of the ship.

2874
02:17:40,940 --> 02:17:43,260
He has to go do Rise of Skywalker.

2875
02:17:43,260 --> 02:17:45,100
Got to end up in his pajamas later.

2876
02:17:46,140 --> 02:17:47,500
His cool black pajamas.

2877
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:50,780
So that's him escaping to go to the next movie, basically.

2878
02:17:50,820 --> 02:17:54,100
But you also see Beck escaping and then they're like, where's Beck?

2879
02:17:54,100 --> 02:17:55,140
Where's Beck later on?

2880
02:17:55,140 --> 02:17:57,860
And he's in an escape pod that is then

2881
02:17:58,860 --> 02:18:02,260
you see physically a few minutes later.

2882
02:18:02,420 --> 02:18:03,620
I didn't think about it.

2883
02:18:03,620 --> 02:18:06,060
I didn't. It didn't occur to me why he's in one of those.

2884
02:18:06,540 --> 02:18:07,300
That's really cool.

2885
02:18:07,300 --> 02:18:11,620
The only thing I want to know is did and it's probably in the footage,

2886
02:18:11,620 --> 02:18:12,740
but there's so much going.

2887
02:18:12,740 --> 02:18:14,620
How did nine get out?

2888
02:18:14,620 --> 02:18:17,780
Did he just get back to the transport ship and escape?

2889
02:18:18,220 --> 02:18:22,660
Like the only thing I mean, he maybe he's in Becks, but you can't really tell.

2890
02:18:22,940 --> 02:18:24,260
It's tilted up.

2891
02:18:24,260 --> 02:18:25,780
It is a little bit of a jump.

2892
02:18:25,780 --> 02:18:29,540
But yeah, right as you come out, you see a big practical version

2893
02:18:29,540 --> 02:18:31,700
of what you've just dropped in.

2894
02:18:31,700 --> 02:18:34,460
Yeah. And Beck is a full animatronic again.

2895
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:36,540
And he's talking to you. Yeah.

2896
02:18:36,660 --> 02:18:40,060
So it's tilted up, I feel like, to maybe hide,

2897
02:18:40,780 --> 02:18:42,900
like to say, well, there were other people in there.

2898
02:18:42,900 --> 02:18:45,300
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe that's always logic.

2899
02:18:45,700 --> 02:18:47,540
So like there could be people at the back of it.

2900
02:18:47,540 --> 02:18:51,620
But Finn is like, glad you landed like you're a little off kilter.

2901
02:18:51,700 --> 02:18:52,660
You're a little off base.

2902
02:18:52,660 --> 02:18:55,740
So yeah. So you basically take a CGI simulator ride

2903
02:18:55,740 --> 02:19:01,740
then down through another Star Destroyer into the atmosphere

2904
02:19:02,300 --> 02:19:05,420
and you land back and back in Batuu, much like

2905
02:19:05,820 --> 02:19:07,900
Millennium Falcon. Yes.

2906
02:19:07,900 --> 02:19:12,460
I think this all I think it's a great free for the day for a Spider-Man fan.

2907
02:19:12,460 --> 02:19:15,460
It's kind of this is a great sequel, I think, to the big drop

2908
02:19:16,260 --> 02:19:18,660
at the end of that, like an inventive.

2909
02:19:18,660 --> 02:19:20,700
How do you get out of here?

2910
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:22,020
I think it's a real like cousin.

2911
02:19:22,020 --> 02:19:24,340
I love that Disney has a Spider-Man now.

2912
02:19:24,340 --> 02:19:25,660
It's it's fantastic. Yeah.

2913
02:19:25,660 --> 02:19:30,180
And then you are outside and then you're delivered back outside,

2914
02:19:30,180 --> 02:19:31,860
which was very cool in the day.

2915
02:19:31,860 --> 02:19:33,340
It was very cool at night.

2916
02:19:33,660 --> 02:19:35,780
Both ways give you something cool to look at.

2917
02:19:35,780 --> 02:19:38,060
Yeah. And you you've transitioned

2918
02:19:38,740 --> 02:19:41,580
through three ride systems at that point

2919
02:19:41,980 --> 02:19:45,420
in the span of a minute trackless into a drop.

2920
02:19:45,580 --> 02:19:50,940
Drop becomes a motion simulator back to trackless and trackless outside.

2921
02:19:50,940 --> 02:19:53,260
That was just running inside.

2922
02:19:53,260 --> 02:19:57,540
Yeah, it's outside, which I'm trying to think like Alice in Wonderland

2923
02:19:57,540 --> 02:19:59,860
goes outside Guardians of the Galaxy Tower.

2924
02:19:59,860 --> 02:20:01,860
Terror open up and you see outside.

2925
02:20:01,860 --> 02:20:05,060
This is outside. Cars go cars go out in and nothing.

2926
02:20:05,060 --> 02:20:07,700
I don't think combines indoor and outdoor is surprising.

2927
02:20:07,700 --> 02:20:10,140
Yeah, that's nothing is effective.

2928
02:20:10,140 --> 02:20:11,540
And this is covered.

2929
02:20:11,540 --> 02:20:13,900
So I bet it can still run that last bit in the rain.

2930
02:20:13,900 --> 02:20:15,780
Oh, of course. Yeah, yeah, for sure.

2931
02:20:15,780 --> 02:20:20,580
I think so. And that that like atrium is beautiful with the winds

2932
02:20:20,580 --> 02:20:25,740
overtaking it and I like really like instantly iconic arcates.

2933
02:20:25,740 --> 02:20:28,540
So the way you pull up into it is so grand.

2934
02:20:28,540 --> 02:20:31,140
And then you just get you get this nice little last message from Beck

2935
02:20:31,300 --> 02:20:34,220
and you get chauffeured right to the gate.

2936
02:20:34,340 --> 02:20:37,180
Again, how it's not like a typical load area.

2937
02:20:37,820 --> 02:20:39,700
There's no cars waiting there.

2938
02:20:39,700 --> 02:20:43,140
You are just delivered straight to the end of the ride. Yeah.

2939
02:20:43,180 --> 02:20:47,900
Ratsatouille and similarly, surprisingly like, wait, do I not like getting a line

2940
02:20:47,900 --> 02:20:49,620
like when I'm getting off of pirates?

2941
02:20:49,620 --> 02:20:51,780
No, no, no. Here just here's the gate.

2942
02:20:51,780 --> 02:20:53,300
Here you are, sir.

2943
02:20:53,300 --> 02:20:54,980
It's a very, again, intimate.

2944
02:20:54,980 --> 02:20:57,740
It's you're not in a long line of folks.

2945
02:20:57,780 --> 02:21:00,340
It's just you. Yeah. Yeah. And it happened.

2946
02:21:00,340 --> 02:21:03,580
And you play the cast members still playing along like the one

2947
02:21:03,580 --> 02:21:07,180
that when we did at night, the woman went, yeah, heck of a landing, folks.

2948
02:21:07,180 --> 02:21:09,980
And I went, hey, anyone you can walk away from. Right.

2949
02:21:10,260 --> 02:21:15,060
And she I forget what her she had a good line to like, this is walking away.

2950
02:21:15,060 --> 02:21:17,380
We're like that. That's when you can walk away from it.

2951
02:21:17,380 --> 02:21:20,300
Like, it's very fun.

2952
02:21:20,860 --> 02:21:22,740
It's like I am.

2953
02:21:22,740 --> 02:21:26,540
If you work in that area, you just must see

2954
02:21:27,100 --> 02:21:29,500
such joy. Yeah.

2955
02:21:29,500 --> 02:21:31,100
Every second of the day.

2956
02:21:31,100 --> 02:21:34,860
That's where you get people applauding the end of this ride.

2957
02:21:34,940 --> 02:21:36,900
Like you saw a play. Right.

2958
02:21:36,900 --> 02:21:40,260
I suggest like euphoria in that room.

2959
02:21:40,260 --> 02:21:42,300
And we posted a picture of us there.

2960
02:21:42,300 --> 02:21:43,700
That's how we felt.

2961
02:21:43,700 --> 02:21:45,020
I just like that.

2962
02:21:45,020 --> 02:21:48,220
I just think a pure joy when I think about that atrium.

2963
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:50,500
It's wonderful.

2964
02:21:50,500 --> 02:21:53,260
This is just it's just really did it.

2965
02:21:53,540 --> 02:21:56,420
And a little cherry on top that we found out.

2966
02:21:56,420 --> 02:22:02,540
At the end, the plant life that seems very lush and older plant

2967
02:22:02,540 --> 02:22:08,620
loya at the exit is replanted from Heimlich's choo choo train.

2968
02:22:08,620 --> 02:22:11,300
Yeah. Delightful, delightful.

2969
02:22:11,820 --> 02:22:14,140
Using every part of the buffalo.

2970
02:22:14,140 --> 02:22:19,140
Do you think in Florida, it uses like the the shrubs outside of the Golden

2971
02:22:19,140 --> 02:22:22,060
Girls house that they had to tear down to build?

2972
02:22:22,700 --> 02:22:25,060
It's the empty nest greenery.

2973
02:22:25,060 --> 02:22:26,860
River countries, greenery.

2974
02:22:26,860 --> 02:22:29,220
Oh, yeah. Transported over.

2975
02:22:29,220 --> 02:22:32,580
You actually just open out into the microbe.

2976
02:22:34,220 --> 02:22:37,460
One of those wonderful Florida Galaxy's transitions.

2977
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:40,820
They just play a little like lever just like tosses you into a chair.

2978
02:22:40,820 --> 02:22:42,620
And there's a beer in front of you already.

2979
02:22:42,620 --> 02:22:44,380
Yeah, they were using overflow.

2980
02:22:44,380 --> 02:22:47,980
They were people were backed up to Muppets in Florida.

2981
02:22:47,980 --> 02:22:49,380
I just read. I believe that.

2982
02:22:49,380 --> 02:22:50,500
Yeah. Yeah.

2983
02:22:50,500 --> 02:22:52,820
Smother here, maybe.

2984
02:22:52,860 --> 02:22:55,500
I don't know. Greatest ride in the world now.

2985
02:22:55,500 --> 02:22:56,620
Does it have the title?

2986
02:22:56,620 --> 02:22:57,940
Yeah, probably.

2987
02:22:57,940 --> 02:23:02,300
It's I mean, it's crazy to think about with time and perspective.

2988
02:23:02,620 --> 02:23:06,820
This could be the like, remember the first iPhone?

2989
02:23:06,820 --> 02:23:08,500
Look how kooky this looks now.

2990
02:23:08,500 --> 02:23:09,940
I can't believe they did that.

2991
02:23:09,940 --> 02:23:13,420
You know, where it's like it keeps evolving.

2992
02:23:13,580 --> 02:23:16,220
But like next level right now.

2993
02:23:17,860 --> 02:23:19,900
Yeah, OK, here's what everyone's going to tell me to fuck off.

2994
02:23:20,420 --> 02:23:23,340
My one thing about it

2995
02:23:24,180 --> 02:23:28,060
is that and for whatever, like when you come, when it comes to e-tickets,

2996
02:23:28,060 --> 02:23:32,420
Johnny tickets, I feel like there is at least I have an expectation

2997
02:23:33,340 --> 02:23:37,580
that it's going to feel like I got like jostled around,

2998
02:23:37,620 --> 02:23:39,980
that I got like jerked around a lot.

2999
02:23:39,980 --> 02:23:41,500
And I don't have that feeling.

3000
02:23:41,500 --> 02:23:45,620
I almost felt like once we got off of it, it was more of a cousin

3001
02:23:45,660 --> 02:23:50,100
of like Fantasyland Dark Ride than it was maybe like

3002
02:23:50,580 --> 02:23:54,100
high tech ticket, because like almost every other ticket,

3003
02:23:54,140 --> 02:23:58,900
there's a thrill or like there's a thrill to it that you kind of when you're done,

3004
02:23:58,900 --> 02:24:02,460
you like shake your head because your brain has been knocked around a little bit.

3005
02:24:02,740 --> 02:24:04,540
And this doesn't have that. Sure.

3006
02:24:04,540 --> 02:24:08,300
This is almost purely like you're enjoying the scenery and you're immersed.

3007
02:24:08,700 --> 02:24:11,700
And it's got a little drop, but it's very, very mild.

3008
02:24:12,260 --> 02:24:13,780
Yeah. Up is exciting.

3009
02:24:13,780 --> 02:24:17,140
Up is exciting, but it doesn't have like whether it's, you know,

3010
02:24:17,140 --> 02:24:21,260
guardians or car, even cars, you know, you go 40 miles an hour or it's Indian,

3011
02:24:21,260 --> 02:24:23,980
Indian adjunct, you're getting knocked around left and right.

3012
02:24:24,540 --> 02:24:29,460
The one thing I felt like a little bit let down was that I just didn't feel like

3013
02:24:29,700 --> 02:24:31,700
they had fucked me up enough.

3014
02:24:31,700 --> 02:24:33,540
Like, I don't know if there's a real remedy to that.

3015
02:24:33,540 --> 02:24:35,980
And that's just a very nitpicky thing,

3016
02:24:36,260 --> 02:24:39,060
because it ends up just being a little bit more in my mind like.

3017
02:24:39,780 --> 02:24:42,260
And I don't mean this is a slam of Fantasyland Dark Ride.

3018
02:24:42,260 --> 02:24:45,980
But I think that was the intent of like, well, this is the Star Wars version

3019
02:24:45,980 --> 02:24:48,900
of a dark ride, not a thrill ride.

3020
02:24:49,300 --> 02:24:50,660
Yeah, families can do it.

3021
02:24:50,660 --> 02:24:54,820
And like, I think that was in their minds while they were designed.

3022
02:24:55,420 --> 02:24:58,620
That's the case. But I think the only thing I left being like,

3023
02:24:58,900 --> 02:25:03,180
it would have been nice for a little like something that really made your like

3024
02:25:03,180 --> 02:25:05,420
stomach drop or something. I don't know what it would be.

3025
02:25:05,660 --> 02:25:08,180
And like with these ride vehicles, it's so smooth.

3026
02:25:08,180 --> 02:25:10,700
I don't know if there's like Indiana Jones,

3027
02:25:10,700 --> 02:25:13,100
Tony Baxter's talked a lot about how they were trying to figure out that ride

3028
02:25:13,100 --> 02:25:16,140
vehicle, because that ride vehicle gives you such a sense of like

3029
02:25:16,620 --> 02:25:20,740
instability the whole time to really add to the danger.

3030
02:25:21,180 --> 02:25:21,980
Whereas like, I don't know,

3031
02:25:21,980 --> 02:25:25,060
because they have built like a thing that just rotated on top of a.

3032
02:25:25,180 --> 02:25:27,740
But then that doesn't really make sense for these type of vehicles.

3033
02:25:27,740 --> 02:25:29,620
So this is all nitpicky.

3034
02:25:29,620 --> 02:25:33,820
But that's the one thing where I was hoping there was a little bit of that.

3035
02:25:34,100 --> 02:25:38,340
But again, this is minor when we're in the scheme of the most crazy

3036
02:25:38,660 --> 02:25:42,060
scope in a ride like this ever.

3037
02:25:42,140 --> 02:25:44,900
Yeah. Yeah, I don't know.

3038
02:25:45,380 --> 02:25:47,420
I don't agree with you. That's fair.

3039
02:25:47,420 --> 02:25:49,420
I think it fucking rules.

3040
02:25:49,420 --> 02:25:52,100
I'm not saying it doesn't rule. Yeah. Yeah.

3041
02:25:52,100 --> 02:25:57,180
I think I'm just very curious to see how long this boarding

3042
02:25:57,940 --> 02:26:01,980
system, how long, how long until

3043
02:26:02,580 --> 02:26:06,820
it's just like, just wait in line, you know, just just wait in line.

3044
02:26:07,140 --> 02:26:11,180
Or is there a modified version of the boarding system?

3045
02:26:11,180 --> 02:26:14,780
Because not everyone who comes to Disneyland.

3046
02:26:14,780 --> 02:26:17,380
I mean, Scott, you bought a one day pass to do this.

3047
02:26:20,660 --> 02:26:21,980
It would have been a bummer to not get to go.

3048
02:26:21,980 --> 02:26:24,060
It would have been a bummer not to get to go.

3049
02:26:24,060 --> 02:26:28,020
And I'm wondering, like, well, is everyone are people prepared?

3050
02:26:28,020 --> 02:26:32,180
They are like, I think and I think they've been done a pretty good job

3051
02:26:32,180 --> 02:26:35,580
of preparing people like that. Not everyone's going to get to go on.

3052
02:26:35,580 --> 02:26:37,100
There is a boarding group system.

3053
02:26:37,100 --> 02:26:40,620
And if even if you get here very early, you could still get a reservation

3054
02:26:40,940 --> 02:26:42,180
for very late.

3055
02:26:42,180 --> 02:26:47,220
So I do wonder as the land evolves and grows, like how long

3056
02:26:47,220 --> 02:26:50,700
because those avatar rides still have really long waits like slinky dogs

3057
02:26:50,700 --> 02:26:52,220
still has a really long wait.

3058
02:26:52,220 --> 02:26:56,100
How long until they go like, OK, no more boarding groups.

3059
02:26:56,740 --> 02:26:57,700
Yeah, just wait in line.

3060
02:26:57,700 --> 02:27:00,420
I mean, I don't know how they decide when that shouldn't happen.

3061
02:27:00,820 --> 02:27:02,180
Yeah, I don't know.

3062
02:27:02,180 --> 02:27:04,580
It'll shift to fast pass it is a certain point.

3063
02:27:05,100 --> 02:27:07,620
Yeah, I mean, it was there's touch points set up.

3064
02:27:08,060 --> 02:27:11,300
I mean, I think they'll probably like figure out whenever the thing is running

3065
02:27:11,300 --> 02:27:15,060
at full capacity and it's, you know, whatever percentage consistent,

3066
02:27:15,100 --> 02:27:18,460
if it's like running 80 percent consistent. Yeah, that's true.

3067
02:27:18,460 --> 02:27:21,620
I'll just go like, well, this makes sense and we can run this many people

3068
02:27:21,620 --> 02:27:25,420
and they'll have plenty of data to say like how many people are coming to the park.

3069
02:27:25,420 --> 02:27:27,620
So like it makes sense. Yeah, do it.

3070
02:27:27,620 --> 02:27:29,300
But I bet it'll be a couple of months.

3071
02:27:29,300 --> 02:27:32,620
I bet it might be even be sooner than we think where it's not like this,

3072
02:27:32,820 --> 02:27:35,500
because like Galaxy's Edge had this system and they gave it up

3073
02:27:35,740 --> 02:27:38,220
the two days in really fast.

3074
02:27:38,220 --> 02:27:41,660
But that's a different story than this, because everybody is going to ride this

3075
02:27:41,660 --> 02:27:45,180
and want to ride it twice, I would imagine, or more if.

3076
02:27:45,420 --> 02:27:48,300
Yeah, yeah, that's a yeah, yeah, yeah, we're lucky we got to do it.

3077
02:27:49,860 --> 02:27:54,100
But the I think this all I think this like sets everything right, though.

3078
02:27:54,300 --> 02:27:58,740
I think now you don't have the feeling of and then the ride is this falcon ride

3079
02:27:58,740 --> 02:28:02,060
that people it's a little confusing that people have a little bit of trouble with.

3080
02:28:02,180 --> 02:28:06,620
I think it now like, OK, so that's allowed to be the slightly lesser one.

3081
02:28:06,860 --> 02:28:10,420
Like like the cousin, they the blockbuster is open.

3082
02:28:11,620 --> 02:28:14,500
I know I think I enjoyed Falcon more

3083
02:28:15,100 --> 02:28:17,660
this time with that perspective.

3084
02:28:17,980 --> 02:28:20,180
Yeah, we kind of a little bit of the pressure off

3085
02:28:21,140 --> 02:28:24,220
as far as Galaxy's Edge, like you still we still want as many aliens

3086
02:28:24,220 --> 02:28:28,700
and robots going around as possible and flash mobs and those like it doesn't fix

3087
02:28:28,700 --> 02:28:32,580
that, but it does certainly like take the pressure off Falcon being like

3088
02:28:32,740 --> 02:28:36,460
and like it needs to be like the be all end all for.

3089
02:28:36,460 --> 02:28:39,980
Yeah. Yeah. And it seems like that's coming slow and I mean, there's more

3090
02:28:39,980 --> 02:28:43,020
R2D2 sightings in the land.

3091
02:28:43,020 --> 02:28:46,300
I saw Chewbacca like three times the one day we were there.

3092
02:28:47,500 --> 02:28:50,980
And then and I think, too, this is giving us

3093
02:28:51,420 --> 02:28:56,340
I don't mind that they are kind of like with the Marvel land coming.

3094
02:28:56,340 --> 02:28:58,060
It's like, all right, you're going to restaurant.

3095
02:28:58,060 --> 02:29:00,460
You're going to get the bee ride to start.

3096
02:29:01,140 --> 02:29:04,380
Of course, Guardians Edge is Guardians of the Galaxy is here.

3097
02:29:04,700 --> 02:29:07,260
And there'll be characters and there'll be some meet and greets.

3098
02:29:07,460 --> 02:29:11,860
And then who, boy, wait until you see this Avengers thing in a few years.

3099
02:29:11,900 --> 02:29:13,460
Yeah, like they're not changing.

3100
02:29:13,460 --> 02:29:18,140
Like, oh, by the way, the big the big thing isn't coming opening day.

3101
02:29:18,140 --> 02:29:20,420
They've just taken that off the table.

3102
02:29:20,420 --> 02:29:24,660
And I think that's better because at least you've established an expectation

3103
02:29:24,740 --> 02:29:26,940
and you have somewhere to go and you have somewhere to go.

3104
02:29:26,940 --> 02:29:30,940
Exactly. But I just I think I you know, we've maybe I think we were so enthusiastic

3105
02:29:30,940 --> 02:29:32,820
right after we did Galaxy's Edge.

3106
02:29:32,820 --> 02:29:34,060
And I think it's waned a little bit.

3107
02:29:34,060 --> 02:29:35,700
And we've had our complaints.

3108
02:29:35,700 --> 02:29:38,340
We had Mike Mitchell on who had many, many, many complaints.

3109
02:29:38,660 --> 02:29:40,660
As it's how it goes.

3110
02:29:40,660 --> 02:29:45,300
And now it feels like it's like really things are things have settled.

3111
02:29:45,420 --> 02:29:48,020
And I think I enjoyed all the stuff more again.

3112
02:29:48,020 --> 02:29:51,020
I was we didn't get to the cantina, but just like having your food,

3113
02:29:51,020 --> 02:29:53,260
having your having your milk,

3114
02:29:54,860 --> 02:29:56,340
doing Falcon, seeing Chewbacca.

3115
02:29:56,340 --> 02:29:58,740
It just all like it was.

3116
02:29:58,740 --> 02:30:00,060
It is the thing that was missing.

3117
02:30:00,060 --> 02:30:02,540
And yeah, it's it's there.

3118
02:30:02,540 --> 02:30:03,660
It's nice to have it there.

3119
02:30:03,660 --> 02:30:06,540
It would be like if like you were like walking around New Orleans Square

3120
02:30:06,540 --> 02:30:09,660
and there was no pirates and you'd be like, well, this is nice.

3121
02:30:09,660 --> 02:30:12,420
But I don't I don't need to go walk through here every time.

3122
02:30:12,980 --> 02:30:15,620
But like going off like you go on pirates and then you get dumped

3123
02:30:15,620 --> 02:30:18,060
into New Orleans Square and then you walk around a little bit like

3124
02:30:18,340 --> 02:30:21,700
there is some flow to that, like when you have a land in a ride

3125
02:30:22,460 --> 02:30:25,580
like where you wouldn't necessarily go if you've like you hadn't

3126
02:30:25,700 --> 02:30:29,020
experienced something, whether it's pirates or whether it's

3127
02:30:29,020 --> 02:30:31,740
right, just little things that they're like, here's some new food.

3128
02:30:31,740 --> 02:30:33,860
Here's a new here's the veggie version of rap.

3129
02:30:33,860 --> 02:30:36,020
Here's a hot chocolate with purple whipped cream.

3130
02:30:36,020 --> 02:30:38,620
Like, you know, yeah, yeah, that stuff does.

3131
02:30:38,860 --> 02:30:42,700
Yeah, I'm starting to feel like I think I was feeling some weird

3132
02:30:42,700 --> 02:30:46,220
like like down energy of like, is this what it is?

3133
02:30:46,340 --> 02:30:49,180
And yeah, I like you feel the burst of energy, obviously,

3134
02:30:49,180 --> 02:30:50,260
with this incredible new ride.

3135
02:30:50,260 --> 02:30:53,220
But yeah, those little things, of course, I'm like, of course,

3136
02:30:53,220 --> 02:30:57,100
I want that damp of that or something or some like something that you know

3137
02:30:57,100 --> 02:31:01,460
you can just walk on or that's like a half hour wait instead of a blockbuster

3138
02:31:01,460 --> 02:31:03,140
that takes two hours.

3139
02:31:03,140 --> 02:31:05,180
I think the one thing they could do.

3140
02:31:05,180 --> 02:31:07,020
Yeah, I don't make it perfect.

3141
02:31:07,020 --> 02:31:10,860
I think it's impossible, like making the cantina a little more casual

3142
02:31:10,860 --> 02:31:13,060
like or that dinner show, whatever it is.

3143
02:31:13,060 --> 02:31:14,500
You can't do that every time.

3144
02:31:14,500 --> 02:31:19,100
But maybe they use first order area that feels a little bare as like expansion pad.

3145
02:31:19,100 --> 02:31:22,580
Maybe that ends up like, oh, we're actually we're going to do a new thing here.

3146
02:31:22,580 --> 02:31:25,420
Supposedly, the area for the restaurant is still there.

3147
02:31:25,420 --> 02:31:28,860
They could build the restaurant or they could build a more cantina.

3148
02:31:29,260 --> 02:31:31,740
Yeah, you would think that the canteen is so popular.

3149
02:31:31,740 --> 02:31:33,940
We've talked about before, like you may as well.

3150
02:31:33,940 --> 02:31:37,140
Like a full it's still crazy to me that they didn't think like this

3151
02:31:37,140 --> 02:31:39,140
is going to be the most popular thing.

3152
02:31:39,140 --> 02:31:42,140
And they wouldn't build like a kind of a cool like four room

3153
02:31:42,140 --> 02:31:46,100
cantina with different things and a different robot and like.

3154
02:31:46,220 --> 02:31:49,340
Yeah, that's such a slam dunk to get everybody.

3155
02:31:49,380 --> 02:31:52,460
Yeah, maybe they needed to test the waters to know like people would want this.

3156
02:31:52,500 --> 02:31:54,220
Right. Oh, yeah. People really want it. Yeah.

3157
02:31:54,220 --> 02:31:57,340
Well, and especially like just a few weeks ago,

3158
02:31:57,540 --> 02:32:01,540
they made the alfresco like tasting terrace APs only. Right.

3159
02:32:01,540 --> 02:32:05,660
And jacked up the lines because people here like, oh, limited opportunity.

3160
02:32:05,660 --> 02:32:08,740
And I get to do it like my precious private.

3161
02:32:08,740 --> 02:32:10,980
Precious like, yeah.

3162
02:32:10,980 --> 02:32:13,860
So but it also probably was not like

3163
02:32:14,220 --> 02:32:17,220
breaking in the dollars is a regular spot.

3164
02:32:17,220 --> 02:32:19,740
And they're like, well, how can we juice the business here a little?

3165
02:32:19,740 --> 02:32:22,060
And it seems like it has worked.

3166
02:32:22,140 --> 02:32:22,660
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

3167
02:32:22,660 --> 02:32:23,740
So you will.

3168
02:32:23,740 --> 02:32:27,260
I mean, you'll just have to settle for that beautiful patio at the Grand California.

3169
02:32:27,340 --> 02:32:29,940
And that's nice, too.

3170
02:32:29,980 --> 02:32:30,980
Yeah. Yeah.

3171
02:32:30,980 --> 02:32:34,140
The number one thing they should I don't know if it's even possible,

3172
02:32:34,140 --> 02:32:38,900
but they should have built like a two story bar overlooking the Millennium Falcon.

3173
02:32:39,420 --> 02:32:43,100
It should have been a big, expansive bar with a couple different types of rooms

3174
02:32:43,620 --> 02:32:47,700
with like, yeah, Rex and one a different band could play, could be live.

3175
02:32:47,820 --> 02:32:50,500
And there would be two stories and you'd have a really great view

3176
02:32:50,500 --> 02:32:54,100
of the Millennium Falcon and they would make so much money.

3177
02:32:54,380 --> 02:32:55,980
Yeah. Yeah.

3178
02:32:55,980 --> 02:32:59,820
I mean, maybe this will like kind of like I think this will

3179
02:33:00,460 --> 02:33:03,020
offset the narrative that it's a disappointment.

3180
02:33:03,060 --> 02:33:09,220
I think it's going to be a swell that shows people are excited about this area.

3181
02:33:09,220 --> 02:33:12,380
I think so, because there's some big shortcomings in Cars Land.

3182
02:33:12,540 --> 02:33:15,180
I mean, there's some great stuff about Cars Land, but like

3183
02:33:15,620 --> 02:33:19,660
the restaurants, they flip the menu at the restaurant a couple of times, gone downhill.

3184
02:33:19,940 --> 02:33:21,620
Had the slide rides in and out.

3185
02:33:21,620 --> 02:33:23,740
Yeah. Yeah.

3186
02:33:23,740 --> 02:33:27,020
Flat rides. And I mean, I like the restaurant.

3187
02:33:27,020 --> 02:33:28,340
I like the ambiance of the restaurant.

3188
02:33:28,340 --> 02:33:31,740
I was going to say, you sit out on the back of floors and that's one of the best views.

3189
02:33:31,780 --> 02:33:33,140
That's got different rooms.

3190
02:33:33,140 --> 02:33:36,380
But like, yeah, it seems like they they kind of flopped,

3191
02:33:36,460 --> 02:33:38,060
flip flop the menu a few times.

3192
02:33:38,060 --> 02:33:42,580
Yeah. But the cones, I'm always like, oh, yeah, let's go get a snack of the cones.

3193
02:33:42,780 --> 02:33:45,940
Yeah, you got to love the cones.

3194
02:33:45,980 --> 02:33:50,500
Yeah, I think, look, it was it put me in a better mood about Galaxy.

3195
02:33:50,660 --> 02:33:54,180
Obviously, it's it's maybe the greatest ride in the world at the moment.

3196
02:33:54,380 --> 02:34:00,780
And I think, I don't know, just like I feel like the full puzzle is finally there.

3197
02:34:01,060 --> 02:34:05,420
And I also like to say, I think it put us in a good mood, a good enough mood

3198
02:34:05,420 --> 02:34:08,900
where I really enjoyed what we were doing with our friend, Mamazani.

3199
02:34:08,900 --> 02:34:13,020
We were with the the Doc Ondar uncut gems mashup.

3200
02:34:14,020 --> 02:34:15,780
Oh, yeah, yeah.

3201
02:34:15,820 --> 02:34:18,900
We were just sort of like going from line to line.

3202
02:34:20,940 --> 02:34:23,460
Like that's real black coaxium.

3203
02:34:23,860 --> 02:34:28,820
That was a pain in the ass to get this fucking guy, Hondo Anaka.

3204
02:34:29,220 --> 02:34:31,940
He had the fucking he had to smuggle this out.

3205
02:34:32,140 --> 02:34:34,260
He had to fire it a train to get this.

3206
02:34:34,700 --> 02:34:36,700
Ondar is the handsome older gentleman.

3207
02:34:36,700 --> 02:34:38,260
How you doing, baby?

3208
02:34:38,260 --> 02:34:40,020
Come on up. I got I got the chef.

3209
02:34:40,020 --> 02:34:42,180
I got the chef from docking day seven.

3210
02:34:42,180 --> 02:34:43,020
He's coming up.

3211
02:34:43,020 --> 02:34:44,220
Friends are coming up this week.

3212
02:34:44,460 --> 02:34:46,940
We're going to want to make some food.

3213
02:34:46,940 --> 02:34:52,380
We had we had an OK riff about Joe Rody explaining what he liked about two and a half men, too.

3214
02:34:54,260 --> 02:34:58,380
Oh, right. It was a whole it was a whole of like, you know, it's actually about it's about family

3215
02:34:58,380 --> 02:34:59,900
and it's about experience.

3216
02:34:59,900 --> 02:35:02,260
That's what the comedy is about on two and a half men.

3217
02:35:02,980 --> 02:35:07,940
Every every episode of the Big Bang Theory actually is its own theory,

3218
02:35:08,180 --> 02:35:14,020
a theory about harmony, about how we interact as people, as if we are the molecules.

3219
02:35:15,220 --> 02:35:16,180
That's pretty good, too.

3220
02:35:16,180 --> 02:35:17,740
So we had a couple of great bits.

3221
02:35:17,740 --> 02:35:19,140
So we're having fun.

3222
02:35:19,140 --> 02:35:20,580
Yeah, we're having a blast.

3223
02:35:20,580 --> 02:35:21,980
They see three.

3224
02:35:21,980 --> 02:35:24,260
Say that that's real black coaxium.

3225
02:35:24,260 --> 02:35:25,180
See three.

3226
02:35:25,180 --> 02:35:26,380
Don't lean on the glass.

3227
02:35:26,380 --> 02:35:28,900
See three. That's that's going to break your robot.

3228
02:35:28,900 --> 02:35:30,220
You're strong on the line.

3229
02:35:30,220 --> 02:35:31,420
Don't see it on the glass.

3230
02:35:31,420 --> 02:35:33,140
Stand on the line quick.

3231
02:35:33,140 --> 02:35:35,340
Take the speeder to canto bite.

3232
02:35:35,700 --> 02:35:37,860
You put credits on the pod race.

3233
02:35:40,740 --> 02:35:42,180
See three.

3234
02:35:42,260 --> 02:35:43,940
You got to bring back the coaxium.

3235
02:35:43,940 --> 02:35:45,940
See three. Go get it.

3236
02:35:46,340 --> 02:35:47,700
See the shirt I'm wearing.

3237
02:35:47,700 --> 02:35:50,020
This is Lando Calrissian shirt.

3238
02:35:50,300 --> 02:35:52,100
You see the yellow and the black.

3239
02:35:52,100 --> 02:35:53,700
This is Lando shirt.

3240
02:35:53,700 --> 02:35:56,420
Look at this. This guy's an up and comers named Rex.

3241
02:35:56,620 --> 02:35:57,660
His name's Rex.

3242
02:35:57,660 --> 02:35:59,100
We got to get we can get him.

3243
02:35:59,100 --> 02:36:01,140
Yeah, he gets into a fight with the bathroom.

3244
02:36:01,140 --> 02:36:02,900
It seems the son of a bitch.

3245
02:36:02,900 --> 02:36:04,780
Rex, he's fucking my girl.

3246
02:36:08,140 --> 02:36:10,260
Oh, yeah, you should make a funnier dive video.

3247
02:36:10,260 --> 02:36:11,300
It's a really good.

3248
02:36:11,300 --> 02:36:15,300
If you want to hear this full audio play, we're we're willing to do it.

3249
02:36:16,620 --> 02:36:18,180
But until then, you survive,

3250
02:36:18,180 --> 02:36:22,460
podcast the ride, rise the resistance edition.

3251
02:36:22,460 --> 02:36:24,340
What's the runtime? Where do we end up on that?

3252
02:36:24,340 --> 02:36:26,500
I think it's about two and a half, two and a half.

3253
02:36:26,500 --> 02:36:29,300
OK, decent, decent ratio.

3254
02:36:29,500 --> 02:36:30,740
Not 10 hours.

3255
02:36:30,740 --> 02:36:32,500
If you want to hear more,

3256
02:36:32,500 --> 02:36:35,580
if you object to declaring this the greatest ride in the world,

3257
02:36:35,580 --> 02:36:38,980
what do you think, Topsy, if you've done we haven't physically been on Mystic

3258
02:36:38,980 --> 02:36:41,500
Manor and physically been on Shanghai Pirates.

3259
02:36:41,500 --> 02:36:43,540
It could be one of these.

3260
02:36:44,260 --> 02:36:46,260
Let us know. Write us on Twitter.

3261
02:36:46,260 --> 02:36:48,140

We're doing big stuff lately. Boy, Hagrid's and and rise.

3263
02:36:54,780 --> 02:36:56,020
The war.

3264
02:36:57,140 --> 02:36:59,940
Whoever whoever wins, we win too. Yeah.

3265
02:37:00,580 --> 02:37:03,780
It's it's a reverse aliens versus a reverse alien

3266
02:37:03,780 --> 02:37:06,420
versus predator in quality as well.

3267
02:37:06,420 --> 02:37:07,900
Well, yeah.

02:37:09,220 --> 02:37:12,180

Hoo boy. All right, then.

3272
02:37:22,140 --> 02:37:25,380
How do we come down from this? I don't know.

3273
02:37:26,260 --> 02:37:27,980
Well, I've seen you in a callback.

3274
02:37:27,980 --> 02:37:29,020
Oh, what am I going to go in?

3275
02:37:29,020 --> 02:37:31,340
I was thinking about going this way. Sure. Yeah.

3276
02:37:31,540 --> 02:37:33,700
I was thinking about going like one day when I don't have anything to do.

3277
02:37:33,700 --> 02:37:35,620
I'll just go down early. Yeah. Try it.

3278
02:37:35,860 --> 02:37:39,420
Let us know what you notice. Yeah. Yeah.

3279
02:37:40,020 --> 02:37:43,700
Go already breakfast, you know, try to make your reservation on a nice breakfast.

3280
02:37:43,740 --> 02:37:45,180
I could do that. Yeah.

3281
02:37:45,180 --> 02:37:48,340
And I won't I won't overload on hot dogs.

3282
02:37:48,740 --> 02:37:49,980
Yeah. Stay away from the hot dogs.

3283
02:37:49,980 --> 02:37:52,140
Weren't the issue that they had fixed?

3284
02:37:52,140 --> 02:37:54,540
They're never the problem. They're the solution.

3285
02:37:54,980 --> 02:37:57,540
And then it won't be I won't have a problem using the bathroom droid.

3286
02:37:58,380 --> 02:37:59,300
Oh, yes. Right.

3287
02:37:59,300 --> 02:38:01,700
Zero zero P.

3288
02:38:01,980 --> 02:38:03,140
B zero.

3289
02:38:03,140 --> 02:38:04,860
P.O.O.P. Thank you for your service.

3290
02:38:04,860 --> 02:38:07,460
Master Sheridan, do you have to use P.O.O.P.?

3291
02:38:07,460 --> 02:38:08,900
No, I know.

3292
02:38:08,900 --> 02:38:09,620
I use zero.

3293
02:38:09,620 --> 02:38:11,700
Too much to me, Master Sheridan.

3294
02:38:11,700 --> 02:38:14,140
Usually bring a little bag with ibuprofen and Tums.

3295
02:38:14,140 --> 02:38:15,700
And I forgot it this time.

3296
02:38:15,700 --> 02:38:18,740
But if you're having trouble, just know P.O.O.P. is there for you.

3297
02:38:18,740 --> 02:38:21,220
Did you spend a little extra money on a ballast point?

3298
02:38:21,580 --> 02:38:23,180
Drank beer?

3299
02:38:23,540 --> 02:38:25,340
Well, no, it's horrible.

3300
02:38:25,340 --> 02:38:28,140
It's actually one of the cheaper drafts down there,

3301
02:38:28,340 --> 02:38:30,100
because it's direct from the supplier.

3302
02:38:30,140 --> 02:38:31,300
Fruit beers.

3303
02:38:31,300 --> 02:38:32,140
No, that's not.

3304
02:38:32,140 --> 02:38:33,500
You found them too expensive.

3305
02:38:33,500 --> 02:38:37,060
Well, you don't have to give me Greek P.O.O.P.

3306
02:38:37,060 --> 02:38:37,660
OK?

3307
02:38:37,660 --> 02:38:39,780
No, I am C3PO explaining P.O.O.P.

3308
02:38:39,780 --> 02:38:41,180
Oh, thanks, C3PO.

3309
02:38:41,180 --> 02:38:42,340
P.O.O.P. can't talk.

3310
02:38:42,340 --> 02:38:44,540
Yeah, he just makes an electronic fart noise.

3311
02:38:44,540 --> 02:38:47,060
I wish your memory had stayed erased somehow.

3312
02:38:48,340 --> 02:38:50,740
Quiet P.O.O.P.

3313
02:38:51,580 --> 02:38:53,100
Beep beep beep beep.

3314
02:38:53,100 --> 02:38:53,860
Hard.

3315
02:38:53,860 --> 02:38:55,940
All right. More adventures of P.O.O.P.

3316
02:38:55,940 --> 02:38:56,980
coming down the pike.

3317
02:38:56,980 --> 02:38:58,420
Thanks for listening, everybody. Bye. Bye.

3318
02:39:00,940 --> 02:39:01,940
Dog.

3319
02:39:01,940 --> 02:39:04,060
