1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Rock and roll.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
For decades, human musicians have been celebrated for their remarkable contributions to this beloved genre.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We owe a great debt to the Setzers and the Joe Armstrongs of the world for their remarkable art.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But what about non-human rockers?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What about robot rockers?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
For too long, humans have overlooked their contributions to music.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That all changes today.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Today we celebrate our animatronic friends for their jerky guitar solos, their noisy jaws, and their tinny pre-recorded voices.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We break down and determine which robots rock the hardest.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The performers may be fake, but their ability to move us is very real.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's the fake rock music final four on today's podcast, The Ride.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:24,000
In 1988, when asked why he shot John Lennon, Mark David Chapman said it was because the former Beatle was, in his eyes, a fake.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We believe so-called fakeness in rock and roll is, of course, no cause for murder, what word could be, but in fact, cause for celebration.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Today we reclaim the word fake and show our appreciation for fake rock and rollers who create very real moments of joy.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This is the fake rock music final four. I'm Scott Gertner, Mike Carlson, hi.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Thank you. Thank you.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It was important to everyone was thinking, obviously the specter of Mark David Chapman had to be, everyone was thinking about it.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Had to be invoked on the start of this podcast where we review, I guess, or rate children's robots.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Bands that flap around. Absolutely. Jason Sheridan and Lockstep with this opinion.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah, I mean, coincidentally, every time we record, I have a copy of Catcher in the Rye on my person somewhere.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
All of our biggest influence, yes.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, so here we are, another final four, and we're back to fake rock, but a different kind of rock.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's rock music, and basically what this is, is a fancy way of saying animatronic musicians.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's really what we're, just to clarify, because there is a lot of rock music out there in theme parks.

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
There are live performers. We're fans going way back of the bare metal family from Hard Rock Park,

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
but they don't appear in this because those are suited characters.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Could that be another competition down the road? Of course. Yeah.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But you have to put up your boundaries and set up your rules.

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So we agreed on, this is an animatronic competition.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes. So yeah, there are going to be animatronics as always.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We always give these different qualifiers at the start of these because obviously things are going to be left out,

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
but we did our best to pare it down to some of the most elite rock and roll robots that are out there.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah, and there are a number. There's a lot of them.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And I think another clarification, as many clarifications at the top as we can do, rules.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Set them up, and I'm sure we'll find more as we go.

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But also when we say fake rock, I think this is the rock and roll Hall of Fame definition of rock,

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
which of course includes blues and hip hop and country in the case of Dolly Parton who rejected her nomination.

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Something we might run into. Somebody might, one of these robots, if there's some, we might put this up on Twitter

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and whoever owns that copyright might say we don't want them to be any, that's a very nice thank you, but no.

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah, so all music genres are included in this definition of rock.

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So yeah, we will get a little bit. One of the things we'll do as we assess is think about what Jan Winter might think about one of these robot bands.

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Or Wenner?

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Wenner?

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Wenner? Shoot. I think I've said his name wrong every time I've ever brought it up on the show.

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And it's happened before?

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I think it has. I think I've mispronounced Jan Wenner's name once before.

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's one of those, why are we still in this, why are we still affected on a daily basis by Jan Wenner and Irving Azov, is that what it is?

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. These like, these like never ending boomer strangle holds on boring rock events.

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Not a day goes by where I'm not talking about an article from Cream magazine. Still.

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Rock and roll changed the world. I don't know if everybody knows that.

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's important that all these people get the chance to reassert that every single year.

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Now let's burn an hour talking about who's America's Beatles are.

55
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If we don't correct this.

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
CCR is the band, you know.

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
They might be in this very final four.

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
They might be.

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I think so, yes. We're going to, because what symbolizes American ingenuity more than robot making, along with rock and roll, you put these things together.

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's an incredible combination as we're going to find. We're going to talk about some of the best musicians out there, some of the best music, I think, that's ever been made.

61
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Clearly. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

62
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The sheer, the power of the songs that we're going to discuss.

63
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Is there anything we want to say at the top in terms of what we think we might be looking for?

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I think that like, yeah, as we're saying, like rock and roll now is such a broad definition, especially when it comes to the Hall of Fame.

66
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So rock and roll for me, you know, it becomes more of sort of the essence of rock and roll.

67
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's not doesn't mean it has to be a certain tempo.

68
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It doesn't mean it has to have certain instruments.

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It has to be a vibe, a cool vibe, a vibe that makes, I would say, usually young people interested.

70
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But now, because how long rock and roll has been around, maybe it has to get dad interested, you know?

71
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So these are the things I'm thinking about.

72
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm not saying I'm going to lay down a hard and fast criteria for a winner in a bracket.

73
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But I want to say, like, our definitions, I think really what we're going to do here is unpack what we actually think rock and roll is.

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You know what I'm saying? It's a larger sort of idea.

75
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Geez, we're in like now we're in Lester Bang's almost famous territory.

76
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yes, we are. Is rock dead?

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Well, we're lucky that if dad is supposed to be interested that almost everything we're talking about is from the 80s and 90s.

78
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah, that's a good point.

79
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Are there any recent, I'm looking at the list, what are the more recent?

80
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I mean, there's ones that are still around. A lot of them are still around.

81
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah, yeah.

82
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You can go see, but are any of these new? I would say no.

83
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I would say 1994, my man.

84
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay, yes. All right. That might be as far as we go, right?

85
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That might be as recent. I want to, I was, you know, going through a lot of these, watching clips, a lot of these, and I want to give some attention to the animatronic nature.

86
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah.

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And possibly some weight to like, how good are these animatronics?

88
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And, you know, I don't know that that'll be the deciding factor.

89
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It could be a tiebreaker, but I also think a big one is I don't have a problem with click clack sounds.

90
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I love click clack sounds, but if that overpowers the music, I think you're going to lose points.

91
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Interesting.

92
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And there's one competitor that I was a little disappointed to see.

93
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I think we're, I think I wonder if we're thinking the same one. Yeah, totally. Yeah. Yeah. A little too loud on that.

94
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Sometimes it adds to the charm, but you can't, but it's got to be about the music. It can't override the music.

95
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It has to be about the music.

96
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And I feel like I may be judging, this is related to the animatronic idea, but I think musicianship, which is obviously contrived and done by the animatronic make, but like how realistic are we?

97
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:33,000
In our performance, because I think if the song is great, if it's the greatest song and animatronic ever sung, but it's not being done realistically.

98
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Again, I think it's hard. I think like as in animation, you know, accurate piano guitar playing, which you really admire the movies that are on in my house all the time because the kids like soul and cocoa, which have fantastic, very realistic guitar playing and piano playing.

99
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I think we'll get very close to that with some of these absolutely soul level. Yeah. Yeah. Very complex piano playing, but that's sort of, I'm going to be, I'm going to be watching the hands for sure.

100
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:17,000
My eyes have been on the hands the whole time. I think the hands. Another thing, and in some of these, I think it was a disadvantage if it was original music versus cover songs.

101
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I think so. But then other times I was like, I'm okay with this because maybe the other competitor was just weaker overall. So I don't mind the stronger competitor just playing, you know, a top 40 hit an old, an old tape, a kind of scratchy tape in a lot of cases.

102
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Right. Okay. So we'll forgive a tape.

103
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Anything else? I mean, we could just, we could certainly dive in because some of my concern is that the very first one is almost could be a full episode.

104
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yes. I think you're right.

105
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's a one seed versus a one seed.

106
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

107
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Which people have tried to explain to me, try to explain to us before I think like, I don't, it's usually like a one seed versus 16th. Like it's, and I'm like, I don't know. I don't know how the draft works.

108
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Why are you holding us to this standard of knowing about sports things? We made a little bra. We know enough to know that there's a bracket. We went that far. We deserve applause for that.

109
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
People are talking about snake drafts and I just like the eyes glaze over.

110
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We will do no effort. Okay. As far as learning how an actual sweet 16 March Madness 16.

111
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Sweet 16.

112
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Do they call it a sweet 16?

113
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Whatever the hell it's called.

114
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah.

115
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Good. I don't know. It doesn't sound right to me.

116
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't know. As I said, it didn't sound right either. So we will not learn.

117
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We did do a lot of effort of like pairings that made sense.

118
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yes, we did that, but we don't know how this works and we will not know how this works. It will only get worse as the years drag on.

119
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah. Well, I think you're right about sweet 16.

120
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yeah, okay. There you go.

121
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yeah, it just felt silly to hear. But yeah, you're right.

122
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
No, that in our minds how March Madness works is the teams are paired by their thematic similarity.

123
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah, right.

124
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's why you put them against each other.

125
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The mascot of the team that's similar to another team's mascot is paired against each other. That's how it works.

126
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
We should do it. I don't care about how they did through the year. I don't pay attention to that.

127
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Have we never have we also not learned that we should probably just skip to the elite eight for the sake of time?

128
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
No, we have not learned that. Absolutely not.

129
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
How many would get cut out of the picture?

130
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:42,000
No, but we have an interesting qualifier this year too. The first half, we split it in two halves.

131
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yes, although I think now it's not so cleanly that we kind of tried to go that it's banned on one side and solo.

132
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But some other ones rearranged and snuck in there.

133
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
There's kind of a wild card.

134
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes. Yeah. But roughly it is that way.

135
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So the first two matchups are going to be pure rock. This is rock and roll through.

136
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
These are hardcore rock bands. And the big one to dive into and discuss is here we go.

137
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Munch's Make Believe Band versus the Rockafire Explosion.

138
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Munch's Make Believe Band from Chuck E. Cheese. Rockafire Explosion from Showbiz Pizza Place.

139
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:35,000
These competitors were thrust together, combined together in a freakish fly-like merging event called concept unification.

140
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The world chose Munch's Make Believe Band. Corporate Synergy chose Munch's Make Believe Band, but that's not a choice that we have to make.

141
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So Munch's Make Believe Band, to clarify, you know some of this if you're listening to the show, but that's the band that Chuck E. Cheese is in.

142
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And Rockafire Explosion is all these characters who we don't see so much anymore, except maybe in these, you know, when they put out a music video singing to a more current song or what have you.

143
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Owned by Aaron Fector who got cut out of in this whole merger situation.

144
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah, yeah, they'll pop up here and there, but yes, the winner as far as visibility is obviously Chuck. Chuck E. Cheese and Munch and everyone.

145
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Though they're disappearing.

146
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
There are not that many.

147
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yeah, classic robots, we've talked about this before on the show, are disappearing.

148
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
There's not a lot of full munches out there.

149
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No more full munches or very few full munches.

150
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I think it's spread, like most often you check. Just down in Carson, the band wasn't in there and that was unfortunate to see.

151
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But they're around and they're obviously they're in our hearts and that makes us have to cut out, I'd say, the era where it's screams and puppets.

152
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That all does it. We have to judge the animatronic body of work.

153
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Right.

154
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Because unlike a lot of legacy brands, Chuck E. Cheese has adapted to like the band camp SoundCloud era of music with original internet programming.

155
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And we like, we've said it before on the show, we like that stuff. A lot of it.

156
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah.

157
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Are you allowed to, there's some crossover.

158
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I've certainly seen animatronics moving around to songs that we love, like another Chuck E. Day.

159
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah, that's true.

160
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The Snoop Dogg-esque song that they do.

161
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But that's sort of an after, it's like, well, they're around so we can program them to do this.

162
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But I certainly associate that song more with the puppet era.

163
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Well, we can't, look, we can't completely take it out of our minds.

164
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Mm-hmm.

165
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I did try to focus on more of the classic era of the band, of Chuck E. Cheese, when I was looking through things and trying to make a determination.

166
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I also want to say, in case you're thinking, oh, these three fuckers are biased, we have said on the show before, we like Chuck E. Cheese.

167
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
We have more affection for it because that's what our childhood band was.

168
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So I wanted to put that out there, that we have said that before in case you want to, you're going to clip a piece of audio and you're going to try to hold it against this if we pretend,

169
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
we're not pretending. We have said that before.

170
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So I did an extra amount of effort to make sure I was absorbing the actual impact of the Rock Fire explosion.

171
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That's good. Very good of you.

172
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yeah, because I think my memories, my association with Munch's Make Believe band is happy childhood memories.

173
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
My association primarily with the Rock Fire explosion is a documentary that is upsetting in multiple ways.

174
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Many different flavors of like, oh, no, I guess.

175
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah, we can't hold some of the people against them.

176
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's their own creators against this is about the music, even though some of the characters are voiced by the creator, Aaron Fector, who strikes us as a little odd.

177
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
But we have to take that. Let's try to view this as a band, as characters.

178
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Let me let me say the lineup here. Yes, thank you.

179
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
As we were looking at musically in Munch's Make Believe band, we got Munch on piano.

180
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Right. Purple Monster, Pasquale P. Pieplate, the Italian chef on drums.

181
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Jasper Jowls on guitar. He Jowls. Thank you.

182
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And Chuck E. Cheese and Helen Henney splitting vocal duty.

183
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Right over on the other side, Rock of Fire. You've got Billy Bob Broccoli on bass.

184
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Fats Geronimo on keyboards is the gorilla.

185
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Beach Bear on guitar. Duke LaRue on drums is Duke a bear or a dog?

186
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I guess he's a dog. He's like a space dog. Yeah. Yeah.

187
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Got a space dog on drums and then various singer. A lot of singers in the mix.

188
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's kind of a sly in the family stone. It's Mitzi Mozzarella is the cheerleader.

189
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Mouse Looney Bird's in there. There's a sun and a moon. Various other characters.

190
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Spider, I believe. Oh yeah. Spider lowers down sometimes.

191
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Yeah. What's the spider's name again? I'm not sure I know the name of the spider.

192
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Sorry. We'll do a we'll fully dive in later.

193
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And I don't want that to our lack of awareness to rub against the Rock of Fire Explosion.

194
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Right. You know, I would say it was a pleasure to see this band a little more and get to know this band.

195
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Antioch. Antioch? Yeah. And of course, Antioch the Spider.

196
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Antioch the Spider. From the Rock of Fire Explosion.

197
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So let me say having listed that lineup, I'm impressed that we got a bass player.

198
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yeah. Really fleshes out the sound. And I think Billy Bob brings a lot to the table.

199
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
He's very jolly and lovable. Yeah. Fleshes out the sound.

200
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah. And the band is more yeah has more instrumentation going on, I think.

201
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I will say also like, you know, look is a big part of bands, you know. Yeah.

202
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Image or whatever. Like Aerosmith didn't just get popular by completely just being one of the best rock bands of all time.

203
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
They also have cool image. They have the scarves and everything.

204
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And I will say that I like sort of the vibe coming from the Rock of Fire Explosion as a band.

205
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I feel even though they each member has separate identities, they do form an interesting stage picture.

206
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Like Kiss. They've all got their different themes. Yes, exactly.

207
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But yeah, they're all they all feel of a piece together.

208
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Which I guess we were not talking about Chuck yet, but I do think maybe even more so than Chuck E. Cheese.

209
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Chuck E. Cheese feels like kind of disparate characters all on stage together.

210
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
A little bit separate, not feeling like as much of a unit as I'd like that to feel.

211
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Sure, I could see that. Yeah, I mean, like I dig I dig some of these vibes a lot.

212
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I a big fan of Duke LaRue. I regret not having looked into Duke LaRue further before.

213
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
He's cool. I also want to bring up it's a part of image.

214
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
This spins out from image is the instruments.

215
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That's not the music you're hearing, but it is a big part of the sound.

216
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And iconic instruments are definitely part of the picture of great rock stars.

217
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And I think the instruments are cool. I like Fats Geronimo's keyboard, which kind of became Munches.

218
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I feel like they pretty much stripped that.

219
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And because I'm looking at Munches too. I like his piano, but aren't they the same?

220
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So you got to give maybe Fats credit for bringing that piece of gear.

221
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And I also think a Beach Bear's silver guitar is very cool. I think he's got a great axe.

222
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I think yeah, I think that the instruments look cooler in the Rock of Fire for sure.

223
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
As opposed to like, I don't really vibe with Jasper's folksy acoustic.

224
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I forget if it's an acoustic or an electric. I don't have the instruments memorized.

225
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
But I think he's limited in his guitar genre a little bit with the country leanings.

226
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yeah, I mean Billy Bob in Rock of Fire has like kind of an old school country like Square.

227
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't even know what you would call that. Kind of a very country bear as guitar.

228
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
There's a lot of those kind of instruments. A lot of homemade instruments I'd say throughout the competition.

229
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So yeah, the instruments are cooler looking in Rock of Fire.

230
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
The show itself, like is it Rolf DeWolf who has the puppet on stage?

231
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Oh, I didn't even track those guys. Yeah, there's a puppet too. A lot of characters.

232
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Rolf DeWolf too is yeah, he has like a bow tie, but he also has like a puppet character as well on stage that sings.

233
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Which is an extra element to everything as well. So like they're putting on a show.

234
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
They have so much going on, which I appreciate. I mean, it's very maybe E Street band in a lot of ways as well.

235
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Not that there's a puppet, but like everyone feels like they have the right.

236
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
There's no little Stephen has to have a puppet on stage that he uses or anything.

237
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Are there any puppets in Rock? Has there been any big band with puppets?

238
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yeah, I don't think that's a good question.

239
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I mean, I think the puppet, he had a full puppet version of his concert going on on the side of the stage for one tour.

240
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That's fun. But I don't know if there's a regular puppet member of the band.

241
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Somebody tell me if I'm missing one. Inevitably there's puppet music videos.

242
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Oh, sure. Genesis and there's more.

243
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So yeah, I mean, the pick, like I get why vibe wise and look wise.

244
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Some people say this is the superior band to Chuck E. Cheese.

245
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I do get it. Yeah, because the vibes are stronger now that I'm an adult.

246
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
If I take away my nostalgia for Chuck E. Cheese, I try to take it completely away.

247
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I do go, oh, I'm a little more attracted to this. Sure. Right.

248
00:21:49,000 --> 00:22:00,000
But in terms of staying power, well, saying power, of course, and I will say this as far as look wise and interest wise, I munch himself is so great.

249
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yes. Yeah. A little bit of Muppet flavor.

250
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yeah. And I want to hug him.

251
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And Chuck E. often wears a tuxedo to show respect to the stage.

252
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Of course. And you love that. You never see it.

253
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Which you never see anymore.

254
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah. I mean, like Green Day wears a tux when they're in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

255
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Like when I think when they were playing with Ringo at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame a couple years ago, Billy Joe was wearing a tux to show respect.

256
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So that's good. They were doing that. They were backing Ringo up on boys, which is really fun performance if you haven't seen it.

257
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
The famous Green Day tuxes.

258
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The Green Day tuxes. So yeah. Also somebody on Twitter pointed out a Billy Joe Armstrong starring movie that I have to watch soon.

259
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And I can't remember what it's called.

260
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Oh, I think I've heard of this. Yeah. I may have seen this trailer. Yeah. Yeah.

261
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I didn't. It's like a couple years old already at this point. So yeah, there's that.

262
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:57,000
But I guess my point about Munch is just like Munch is the thing holding Chucky on as far as interesting stage picture, I think, for me.

263
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Because like you go you see Munch, you go, oh shit. I love that guy. That guy. That's my guy right there.

264
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Stronger front man potentially. I like that they put his name in the band. It's a fun discovery that it's not. What's the band? Is it Chucky Cheese?

265
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Right. The Chucky Cheese Rock Brigade or something? No, no, no. It's Munch's Make Believe Band.

266
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Munch's Make Believe Band. With the fakeness acknowledged in the Munch's Make Believe Band. Yes, right.

267
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
That ties into our spirit here. It gives them license to do a lot more too. It lets them break free of genre.

268
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Is there a chance that we're over correcting by siding with Rockafire, pre-anticipating this possible bias?

269
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I have only begun to start my thoughts on all of this. So no, I would say no.

270
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I mean you have to give Chucky credit too for different phases, I guess, in the way that the Beatles had different eras.

271
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:02,000
They've evolved. They've evolved. Yes, that's true. Rockafire is, though, Beatles only have ten years and it's all killer for the most part.

272
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And Rockafire also has a short window. Well, that's what I was trying to figure out. Who is the Beatles and who is the Stones in this case?

273
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And it's Rockafire is probably the easier one to paint as the Beatles.

274
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I think that they're clearly the Beatles. Not only that's correct and around for less time, but clearly a big influence on music to come in that they stole their skin was removed but their skeletons remained.

275
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Maybe there's a metaphor for how the Beatles have impacted. It's like so many bands took their skeletons.

276
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:49,000
But not only that, I was looking into what was the music that they played. Rockafire Explosion did giant Beatles sets and not just the early stuff, maybe not even the early stuff.

277
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Full show of white album songs, which are a lot of my favorite. I think I'm a white album guy, so I was delighted to see that.

278
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Twelve minutes of complex music, right? Risky music and then entire end of Abbey Road is a show that you could see the Rockafire Explosion do.

279
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Wow. Yeah, yeah. I mean, that's something.

280
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yeah, I was. It's a little confusing to exactly because a lot of people have now had taken them after the fact and had them do these big like mega mixes.

281
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I was getting a little confused. I went back to the start. Yes. With the music too, because I found also they did a Beatles medley.

282
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So I was thinking, OK, where what's like the definitive Rockafire? That's what I was looking for.

283
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
The definitive Rockafire, because I really don't know it. And I found a couple things.

284
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I found your first Rockafire Explosion album. Oh, it's got a great picture of them on the front. The vibe of it looks really great.

285
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:53,000
They did release a record. Yes. Yeah. And I believe it's this. And I was scrolling through it and I was like, man.

286
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And as I usually do when I find something like this, whether it's a McGruff album or whether it's something else, I go, is this going to be my new favorite album?

287
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I'm like fingers crossed, hoping that this is something I'm going to punish everyone I know with for the next 20 years.

288
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:15,000
That's what I'm hoping for. And I am sad to report it is not. Oh, no, it's no McGruff.

289
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
No McGruff. All right. All right. It's fine. It's covers. You know, they do.

290
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Like they're doing Beatles. It's like a little like.

291
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Yeah, it sounds OK. It sounds like a great one to pick for a children's performance show.

292
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But the whole album is kind of like this. And you're like, it just sounds like I don't know.

293
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It didn't. It was like studio musicians covering stuff. I was like, oh, man. Sure. That's a bummer.

294
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yeah, yeah. That could have really tipped it. The one. OK, I will say the one thing I found.

295
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
This is this is a welcome. I don't know if you guys heard this. Welcome to show up is pizza, which I believe is the song they would play.

296
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
OK, this isn't an interesting piece of music, I will say.

297
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:12,000
This is the closest thing I could find. And I found some other original songs which are unclear if they were written by Aaron Fecter in the last five years.

298
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Possibly because he does have a YouTube channel and they'll they'll program with new stuff.

299
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And maybe I missed like a seminal album. But this, I think, is the closest thing I found to something that was kind of interesting.

300
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:37,000
OK. Ladies and gentlemen, the world's most advanced entertainment has now joined forces with the world's finest pizza.

301
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:53,000
That's true.

302
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Crazy intro. Yeah.

303
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Interesting was the right clarifier. It's an offbeat jam. And I know I don't.

304
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Hey, I like it. Yeah, I think it's kind of cool. Yeah, yeah.

305
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And I was hoping that first album was going to be more of stuff like that.

306
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
But it did not. It did not live up to that minute and a half thing there.

307
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Well, a lot of what I found was was covers and I can't say enough how impressed I was that they're doing the more the more daring Beatles music.

308
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Sure. Yeah. But then, you know, they do pop hits, too.

309
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
But this is what I said about watching hands and the listeners can't do this.

310
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:44,000
But you guys here can. When you look just what I think Beach Bear is is the core of it for me.

311
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Just just watch him jam this solo to Van Halen's jump.

312
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:06,000
No, you know, for a limited animatronic, the first flopping around.

313
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah, it's I. OK, I did also note this when I was watching a couple of you go into that and Fats is jamming the beat.

314
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,000
He's lost in a trance. He I was impressed by this jump performance kind of went to the floppy hand route.

315
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And it seems to work to the advantage because it ends up looking more natural than like the Jasper has just got three big fingers.

316
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Yeah. You're not seeing a lot of contact there.

317
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I noted Beach Bear looks good when he's soloing.

318
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I also noticed Beach Bear. We got a means back.

319
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yeah, I think it's good musician body language. He's doing the thing.

320
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Yeah, he kind of like stalls. So like Eddie Van Halen would hit a note and he would kind of stall.

321
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And then he would use it. I think it's called a hammer on where he kind of like punches the string very fast with his little one of his fingers.

322
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And it really like mimics a kind of what that would look like when a guitar player is doing it.

323
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And yeah, as you're saying, he leans back with that motion where he's really feeling the solo he's playing technique and it's technique and it is very good.

324
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And it is better than anything, I think, in the munches make believe band as far as performance.

325
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Let me say this to the drummer, Duke LaRue, something I've I don't think I've ever watched a lot of amateur music.

326
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I've seen a lot of animatronic bands in the last week.

327
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I don't think I ever saw any animatronic musician make contact with the drums and mainly the symbol.

328
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
That's what you notice. That's that's the rarest. I don't even expect it.

329
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
That's so not where my bar is. Yeah, but I saw Duke hitting that symbol.

330
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And guys, I don't want to drag this out any further. I'm locking in Rock of Fire Explosion as my choice.

331
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Interesting. Why drag it out? Why drag it out?

332
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And I'm not saying that they're better characters.

333
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I think I, you know, I think I find the Chuck E. Cheese world more pleasant.

334
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
But talking music, there was there was no argument for me here.

335
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Hmm. You know, I think I'll lock mine into and I think maybe I'm leaning more towards intangibles, but I might have to go with munches make believe band.

336
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Oh, boy. OK. Oh, it puts it on Mike.

337
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It's a tricky one because I really I try to go into these not forming an opinion before so we could talk them through.

338
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So as we're talking through the one thing I would say is that for me, I was looking as you kind of could tell, like I was looking for a piece of music to move me more than what I mentioned on the last Chuck E.

339
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Cheese episode, the song Together We Got It that that weighed in my decision.

340
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Of course, it's a very good song. It's an excellent song.

341
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
We got it. And yeah, I remember. I mean, look, listen to that.

342
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It's obviously a different genre than a lot of the showbiz piece of stuff.

343
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I'll fast forward it a little bit strong song.

344
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
That's the intro there.

345
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Together we got it.

346
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And that's why Squalley singing.

347
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So it's tough because like aesthetic wise, yes, the band is the the the all other sorts.

348
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Rock of Fire Explosion is superior, but the music of Chuck E. Cheese and Munch and Helen, you know, it's like I have to go with Munch's Make Believe Band.

349
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I was looking desperately. I was wanting to say, yeah, the fire and maybe somebody maybe somebody will shame me and say, you know what?

350
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Here's the album you missed and I'll feel like a fool.

351
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:59,000
And I've ruined this whole final four years ago in the creepy Orlando warehouse.

352
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It is truly essential. Mike, I think, you know, Rock Fire Explosion might be more the Velvet Underground kind of choice, but I don't think that'll be the last one of those today.

353
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I think though, you know, I think Rock of Fire is more like like and this is gonna I'm going to people gonna be mad at me like the doors or something where it's like the image is so weird.

354
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
The image is so bad that the vibe is so cool.

355
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I don't hate. Yeah, I'm offended now. I'm offended.

356
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I don't know. I'm just saying I think that the doors are very popular because of the like people think Jim Morris is cool.

357
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
They're not exactly they're not the same. They're not the same vibe as something of the time.

358
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I'm saying, yeah, there's an essence to the doors that people want to track.

359
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And some of the songs are OK with the door. I don't hate that they weren't passed along generationally very well.

360
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I wouldn't say at least at least not to us. I don't know.

361
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But I think Jim Morrison and Billy Bob go hand in hand.

362
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Clearly, I just think the vibes are doing so much heavy lifting with Rock of Fire.

363
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And I said I have to go with Munch. I just have to go with my gut.

364
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I'm not I'm not mad at that at all. I just I think I wanted to represent some strong musician.

365
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I don't regret my vote, but I don't regret the way things have gone.

366
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Really quick before we move on, can I say the story about when I looked up what was going on with the the white album medley?

367
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
There's a part in the show where Billy Bob, I think.

368
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
What is it? This might be about Rocky Raccoon.

369
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Maybe he's introducing Rocky Raccoon and he says, but, you know, folks, it doesn't pay to be going and seeking revenge on somebody.

370
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I mean, even if they do something real bad like steal, steal your girlfriend or something, you know, because if she was any good, she wouldn't have left you anyway.

371
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
So forget her. That's a that's a big tear that the Billy Bob the bear goes on.

372
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And then it turns out that what was happening there was that Aaron Fector, the create the guy who does the robots, his girlfriend, who was the show programmer, left him for Rick Bailey, the voice of Beach Bear.

373
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And his revenge was, let me put this little screed into Billy Bob's mouth and then she has to program it because she still works there.

374
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,000
So with that shady story in my I don't mind departing the Rock of Fire explosion.

375
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Yeah. Yeah. What a weird idea.

376
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I'll get my revenge through. Well, go listen to our Chuck E. Cheese episode.

377
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Yeah, weirdness. Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.

378
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Yeah. All right. Well, last mention of the animatronics talking about their relationships today.

379
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
No, no, no, no. Oh, sure.

380
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Oh, right. Right. Oh, I know what you mean.

381
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
OK, OK. But for now, we move on to a category that I'm pretty excited about.

382
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I was happy with your territory.

383
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I'd say so. I feel pretty good about this.

384
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And maybe the weight's really on me to figure it out because this is not just a rock face off.

385
00:35:49,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's a Beach Boys face off in which the Peach Boys from the Epcot retired show Food Rocks go up against another Chuck E.

386
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Cheese group, a Chuck E.

387
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Cheese side room group called the Beach Bowser's.

388
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Those, of course, were a bunch of dogs who sang Beach Boys songs.

389
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
They are redressed Beatles. They were at some point the Beagles.

390
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And then maybe in Kokomo mania of 1988 that swept the nation, which is the happy place that Mike Love has lived in ever since the one week where they went number one.

391
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I might be wrong about that.

392
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
It was no more than three weeks, but you still see the Beach Boys today in twenty twenty two.

393
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
If you go to see them, he's like and then we went number one.

394
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Like that was so that was longer ago now than their original hits were when it went Kokomo came out.

395
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Anyways, Beach Boys versus Beach Boys.

396
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
This is exciting. I really love that we landed on this.

397
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I love that this exists. I love that there were is that's one of those faint memories that until you start diving in on the Internet, I'm like,

398
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I feel like I walked into a room and there were a bunch of animals playing Beach Boys songs.

399
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And indeed there there was such a thing was the Beach Bowser's.

400
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Now Food Rocks. I'm sure most people have a more affection for Kitchen Cabaret.

401
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I think it was a more expensive show.

402
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I think there was more care put in the design of it.

403
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Food Rocks, I think cheaper show to make a little more current.

404
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I think a sponsor. I don't like Kitchen Cabaret.

405
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
You know. OK.

406
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Now I have more memories of Food Rocks and I liked like I kind of knew a couple of the songs.

407
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So I like the parodies.

408
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Yeah, yeah. It did reach out to us a little more.

409
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Kids of the early 90s by having music as late as 1966.

410
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:51,000
No, that's not true. There was Peter Gabriel and the end well and Tone Lowe generally a rapper reaches out to us.

411
00:37:51,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Yeah. But so here you have this maybe an unfair stacking in terms of what they played because the Peach Boys was just one song.

412
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It was good nutrition. Yeah. A parody of Good Vibrations as opposed to the Beach Bowser's set,

413
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
which I think there were a number of songs that they did.

414
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I found 10 on one show tape. I think at one point it was just playing along to the tape.

415
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
But then at some point they did custom covers of Beach Boys songs,

416
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
which were mostly not amended except for adding barks sometimes a little bit.

417
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Uh huh. So but you do cover more Beach Boys territory in the Beach Bowser's set.

418
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I don't know if that does anything. Yeah.

419
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Yeah. I mean, I'm going to make a big sweeping generalization.

420
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I think both these bands are cute. Yeah. In different ways.

421
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:52,000
The dogs are all very cute. And then the different fruit based. They're all fruits, right?

422
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Oh, yes. Yeah. Well, to say their lineup, it's the there's a there are little bodies with big fruit heads and it's a peach and an apple playing little guitars or ukuleles.

423
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
There's a pear on the tambourine and then an orange on piano. Pretty cute.

424
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Yeah. And then the other ones, the Beach Bowser's, I don't think are particularly clarified.

425
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:21,000
There's one of them says their name at the beginning is Woody Bowser. It's actually a good clip. I'll try to post it.

426
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Hey, it's Woody Bowser. He starts the show by saying, Hey, Cowabunga, it's Woody Bowser. We're about to go catch a wave on a beach.

427
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
And I don't know what voice that. Yeah. I was going to say, is he parroting all Beach Boys?

428
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I read as time went on, they got more generic surfer do it than direct one to one. Yeah. Yeah.

429
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I don't know. I don't feel like the Beach Boys would say Cowabunga. Yeah, that's extremely.

430
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:56,000
No, that's like meshing up 90s stuff with the stuff. I think in terms of parody, the Peach Boys kind of cleaner.

431
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Beach Boys to Beach Boys, you know, good nutrition instead of good vibrations.

432
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Yes. But the Beach Bowser's, I guess, putting on more of a show, you know?

433
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Well, they are. They waggle around a lot. They're heavy on the waggling. Yeah.

434
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:18,000
But what I mean, in general, would you say you have, I don't want to use the word respect, but I will because I can't think of a better word.

435
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Do you have more respect for the parody artist or for the cover band? You know what I'm saying?

436
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Like in general, do you have a feeling about that? Because cover bands, I think generally you kind of, you know, that's funny or that you might have a good time running into one of those in Vegas or in another place.

437
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:43,000
But parody, you know, it can be really funny. Obviously, parody bands can be good. So I'm trying to think initially like.

438
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Well, obviously we're laughing at good nutrition. We are. We are.

439
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Every time we're loving it. The funniest shit I've ever heard.

440
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I thought I did think it was funny as a kid. I did not follow it. Did I follow good nutrition? No, absolutely not.

441
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You had a. That was the era of like your ketchup's blue now. Your ketchup's great. Pretty cool.

442
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
You had a 50 pack of American cheese that you brought with you in the park.

443
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Yeah. Thanks to my good friends at Kraft. Yeah. Yeah.

444
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
That's also the sponsors of the land where it's like, you know, fruits and vegetables that.

445
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Yeah, sure. Kind of. What is the food court cell? Oh, meat cooked over an open fire. Of course. Healthy.

446
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Yeah. 50 cheese challenge. Cheese slice challenge.

447
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Hmm. Hmm. I don't actually don't think I went into this with a leaning.

448
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I guess I, you know, I prefer as with like White Album and Abbey Road, I like the more experimental stuff.

449
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I don't think any of these bands play my favorite Beach Boys music, which is the sweet spot of late 60s, early 70s.

450
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
But I couldn't ask them to. They're not going to play anything off of Holland. I could know.

451
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I expect that. But I guess maybe I like the good nutrition nods to the psychedelic, the experimental era that really.

452
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
That's a piece from from Smile that's in a theme park.

453
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:13,000
There is a big popular hit song, but from, you know, a piece of experimental pop art.

454
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:20,000
So really pretty subversive of Disney to do this. Right. Hmm. 30 years later. Yeah. Oh, boy.

455
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It's a real. I can't believe this is even allowed. They wanted to do. God only knows what I do without fruit.

456
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
But they're like, I can't say God can't say God. Yeah. Controversial. Not anymore. Not anymore.

457
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Only at that that Christmas thing we do. Yeah.

458
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:43,000
That nativity thing. That very weird Christmas Eve candlelight ceremony we do like 60 times a season.

459
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Yeah. Yeah. And we're like, I feel like some of these some of the edgier celebrities will come in.

460
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I feel like what's his name? Jim Caviezel. I feel like it's maybe. Oh, man. Am I making that up?

461
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Maybe I'm making up that Jim Caviezel has ever been part of it. I think Caviezel has done it before.

462
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Whether he knows he had done it before is up for debate. Yeah.

463
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
This year they've got the guy from Yellowstone who would not get vaccinated.

464
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
They keep him away from the rest of the gas. Gotta find out who this is.

465
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Cool actors are waiting. Cool actors. Yeah. I don't know. What are you guys leaning on?

466
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I think I am leaning to one. Huh? Huh? And I'll think I'll just declare. Yeah.

467
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I am going to go with the Peach Boys. OK. And I love the Beach Bowser's.

468
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I think they're cool and they're cute. But I think part of this is going to be, you know,

469
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,000
not every one of these bands or these artists have a full discography that's available or that's even been heard by humans.

470
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I have to give a little bit of credit to what the piece that we've heard suggests about a larger catalog.

471
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
What it would suggest about other works. So I would say the Peach Boys. Good nutrition is interesting.

472
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I feel like I think they're more interesting and fascinating than artists because of what they're doing with the music.

473
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,000
And I like the Beach Boys. But we still, it's got to say we have the Beach Boys still out there rocking to this day.

474
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Playing pretty much the same set that the Beach Bowser's do. Possibly worse than the Beach Bowser's.

475
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,000
You might be better off seeing the Beach Bowser's in whatever state they're in in the year 2022.

476
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I mean, one of these groups needs to have a Stamos stand in a weirdly much younger robot really sweaty,

477
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:32,000
really showing you that he plays the drums, not just playing them, but like putting those drumsticks way up.

478
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Do you see everyone? I'm playing drums right now. Look at me. I am playing. Yes.

479
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
So I have to give it to the Peach Boys just for that alone.

480
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Okay. Jason, thoughts?

481
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Yeah. I mean, I think that was a lot of my arguments too.

482
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You know, I think the Peach Boys a little more unique in their sculpt.

483
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Pretty short and sweet. Kind of got in and out.

484
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:07,000
The Beach Bowser's. I mean, I love dogs. I love giant animatronic dogs. Certainly.

485
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:16,000
But yeah, I mean, it is like we said in the previous round session, guys playing the Beach Boys or in one case,

486
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I feel like I saw a clip where I'm like, did they just rip? Are they just playing an album? Are they playing the album cut?

487
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Are they allowed? No, yeah, sometimes. Yeah, yeah. Sometimes it's just copyright skirting.

488
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
You know you're getting originality with the Peach Boys, even though it's just the one song.

489
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Yeah. So I think I'm going in with the Peach Boys as well.

490
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I'm comfortable with a full sweep of the Peach Boys. And I like that.

491
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
You know, I think you got to give it up for the Disney craftsmanship too,

492
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
because we're going to see a lot of Chuck E. Cheese in here ultimately.

493
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And so I like that Disney is represented. But I was going to say early on,

494
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I think one thing that's exciting about this tournament is that as opposed to the first,

495
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:06,000
not really applicable with the fake theme parks, but the first one, Fake Rocks was Disney with Cars Land.

496
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Fake Smell was Universal with ET. Right. I think this is a good chance to, for maybe an outside entity to take it.

497
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Oh yeah, maybe. So we'll see. The next round will be Chuck E. Cheese versus Disney.

498
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:26,000
So that's exciting. But for now we move on. Well, let me say this before we get into this round.

499
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And I don't, I'm sorry to drag this out a little bit, but I think this is the juncture where I have to inform you guys that we made a big mistake.

500
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,000
We have our list locked it. We figured out our list, but I realized a crucial error that we made.

501
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:52,000
And that is that in the remaining rounds, we did not find a place for the Knott's Timber Mountain Log Ride band that only plays at Halloween,

502
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,000
a band called the Calico Coffin Creepers. Well, look, sometimes big teams don't make it into the sweet 16.

503
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Sure. But I wanted to bring this up. To me, I think this belongs in the 16 big time.

504
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I think there's, I think here's what I'm saying. Look at the list. And I know we try to reveal these as we go,

505
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:20,000
but I think in this case could be an interesting call. If you see a weak spot in there and you think that the Calico Coffin Creepers belong,

506
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:29,000
as I do, and you guys outvote me like on all the other ones, but I think if one of you thinks that they should go in along with me,

507
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I think that they need to go in. I believe they should go in. Yeah, I believe they go in. I see two weak spots,

508
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:44,000
one of which I think is in this due to a technicality. Uh huh. Uh huh. The other is in this very next round. Yeah.

509
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Are we think, well, do you see a weak spot, Mike? Yeah, I think so. Can you point it to me?

510
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Well, do we all just declare, because this is a discussion in and of itself. Are we seeing the same weak spot?

511
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Let's just say the weak spot. What do we think? Uh, one, two, three, Rocky and Bullwinkle. Oh, not you, Mike. Oh, I was going to say,

512
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:18,000
no, I'll save it. I don't want to. Oh boy. Okay. So you would say put them in this very round that we're about to do. I think put them in this very round.

513
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Interesting. Yeah, I think Jason, I think I agree with Jason. I'm not so far off. I would. Yeah, yeah. No, not so far off. I'm comfortable with that.

514
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:36,000
That's an easy. I think Jason's right. I really thought we were looking at the same way. I'm now you're going to have to, Mike, declare what where you were going to put them later.

515
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Okay, well, I'll declare later. So we're saying officially that in a further dis of kitchen cabaret that the kitchen crack pots are out. I think they're going to get smoked by the competitor in this round.

516
00:48:51,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I think so. To begin with. Yeah, so we're not setting up the Calico coffin creepers for success. No, not necessarily. No, I think it's just a matter of like what 14 seed is going in here. Yeah, yeah, sure.

517
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:17,000
But I like this a lot. I like the Calico coffin creepers much more. So much I have to say the full name every time. I like this a lot more than this kitchen cabaret thing.

518
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:29,000
They you know, they're a bunch of jars who play other jars. There's no way it was going to go any further than that. So the interesting thing about the kitchen crack pots is that the mayonnaise jar, the drummer is kind of the front and center.

519
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:41,000
It's kind of the front man. And how often do you see that sort of in the way that munch is like this is munches ban the keyboard is bad. Yeah, yeah. So that mayonnaise jar is a real Phil Collins.

520
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Jan Winner has not put a mayonnaise jar in his rock and roll hall of fame yet.

521
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
There's a lot of musicians in there who are the musical equivalent of mayonnaise jars. That's fair.

522
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:07,000
So that brings us to yeah, the Calico coffin creepers versus who wants to. The five bear rugs. The five bear rugs are back. We are back in a little taste of country bear jamber week.

523
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:15,000
So and the way we're representing and it's you know, we could have had a solo act from the Jamboree, but we've gone with the big band.

524
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Kind of the heart and soul of the show. Kind of the base of the show.

525
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Right. The base of the show. But yeah, I will also say, yeah, we didn't go with the solo acts. So keep that in mind.

526
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Because some of the big stuff you think of Big L, you know, Trixie, you know, we're not including them really. This is the backing band for the show.

527
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:45,000
The house band kind of. The house band for the show. Yeah. So it's not the full country bear show when you're thinking about this. That's what I just want to put out there.

528
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Yeah, yeah. And we also didn't end up with Gomer, who I have a big admiration for. I think is a really strong laying it down.

529
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Right. So take away. Yeah, we're going to take away Gomer, take away Trixie, take away Swing and Teddy Barra.

530
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Mm hmm. Okay. Yes. And think of just those bear rugs. Zeke and Zeb and Ted and Fred and there's bear named Tennessee.

531
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Tennessee. Yeah. And instrument wise, we've got Zeke on banjo, Zeb on fiddle, Ted on jug, Fred on mouth harp and Tennessee on a bass with one string.

532
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Elsewhere. And let me just show you guys a photo. You know, why don't we get a little taste of the Calico Goffin Creepers as well? Yes.

533
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:35,000
You know, they got to escape the ride when they couldn't operate the ride in 2020. They did like a taste of Halloween festivals.

534
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:43,000
So they were the band was outside of the ride and you could actually sit and watch them for a while and discover that only two of them moved in any way.

535
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
But here's here's some of them.

536
00:51:50,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Cool drum. They got a cool like kind of like scribbled on. Oh, yeah. There's a gray. There's a gray alien within with overalls on.

537
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:14,000
There's a wide shot. There's a wolf man on banjo who sways slightly aliens in on a barrel. There is a Sasquatch.

538
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Yeah, Bigfoot doing nothing. Just kind of being there. He's kind of like that guy that danced on stage at the muddy muddy Boston.

539
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Yeah, I was going to say he's all about vibes. Yeah. Yeah. You got a very Nosferatu like vampire on the washboard and then a drummer who's a spider man.

540
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Not not spider man, but he is he's a spider man. So that's the Calico Goffin Creepers. Again, only two of them move.

541
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:50,000
So you got to I guess withhold some points there. That's that's too bad. But I'll also you know, you don't expect a lot from from knots and from a knots seasonal overlay.

542
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
You know, they don't have a ton of money for that. Right. Impressed two of them move. Yeah, I know that is impressive.

543
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:04,000
And I will say, you know, we've talked about this before the Halloween overlay of this Timber Mountain log ride as you're kind of barreling down because that thing moves fast.

544
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:12,000
That ride moves pretty fast for a log ride that's in water as you're barreling down the end of that thing. You zoom by this band. Yeah.

545
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And they make such an impact on you as you're going. Like if you're like us and like this type of thing, because I think we noted all we're like, what was that band back there?

546
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Who were those guys? Like we made a whole show of it. The song they're playing at the end of there is a very upbeat kind of country little thing that's going on.

547
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:38,000
And I think I asked I've asked multiple people at knots like, do you have a soundtrack CD for the music of some of this? And they're like, no, we don't have any of that.

548
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:45,000
We don't have I think it's made by the knots band and former Disneyland band. Correct. Billy Hill and the Hillbillies.

549
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Well, it's like theme park native music crazy Kirk. Now, okay. Yeah.

550
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah. Is that how recent the band is? Because they were fired not what five years ago from Disney or something like that.

551
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Something like, well, because they used to play back where in the the barn area or the animal petting zoo area, there was a stage back there.

552
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:11,000
And that's now Galaxy's Edge is right on top of that. Right. Yes. I think this is correct because I don't think they've been running this thing for, you know, they only opened up that one.

553
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Right. Right. You know, in 2015 or so. So recent now that's this gets a recent group of animatronics in there.

554
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,000
And, you know, I like the diversity. I like that there's an alien. The alien is the funniest thing.

555
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:39,000
And I like that they don't all fit together. They aren't all part of one horror genre or type of movie or something. Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

556
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:46,000
And it's I'm sure that's where the bear says trick or treat, which he's not in the band. So we can't unfortunately add that to it.

557
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,000
That would tip it over all the way. That might tip it over all the way because now you're adding a bear to it.

558
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:59,000
But it's hard to take it away because it's such a big part of that one moment on the ride. Yeah. Yeah. He's a he's a fan at least. Yeah. He's part of the culture.

559
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:09,000
And it's you know what? It's using like kind of a common theme park trope of like like a haunted house with just a bunch of crazy stuff in it.

560
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:23,000
And it's like, well, this is a disparate collection of characters and guys. And we've made them be an upbeat, like jaunty country bit. Like it's fun. Yeah. Yeah. Music is fun. Yeah. It's really fun.

561
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:33,000
That said, they're up against the five bear. Right now, the five bear rugs, one of the big I mean, the couple big moments they have is the start of the country bears.

562
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Just a regular show is the big bands, the big band. What is it? Bear Serenade, which is fun. They do at the end. They play like everybody plays.

563
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Everyone plays. They've also got a vibes guy. They've got the little the little bear with the little teddy bear that looks like he doesn't want to be there. He's upset.

564
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Well, he's a nervous little good boy. He's just like us. Right. So he's our entrance into the chamber.

565
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
If we were a little on stage with a bunch of bears playing instruments, we would be ecstatic.

566
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Finally our dream. Yeah. So it's tough. Obviously, I'm a huge country bear fan. But those bears without the other bears.

567
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I think it hurts it. I think it hurts a lot. They're great players. All of them are great players. Do we mess this up? Should we pick a solo act?

568
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:33,000
We probably made a lot of mistakes here today as far as what we should have done. Well, we have to start. Look, we are works in progress. Yeah. We own our mistakes.

569
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,000
We are just as the Lord made us. You know, we're always saying that. That's a regular catchphrase. That's right.

570
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:50,000
When we do our post mortems of the episodes and we all admit everything that we did wrong every time we put our hands over each other's shoulders and say, it's OK. You're perfect. You're messy. But that's perfect. Yeah.

571
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:58,000
There's a lot of love in the post mortems. I wish you could. We should record. But we're too. I don't feel vulnerable enough to show the audience.

572
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I'm not. No, we learned it from our mentor, Andre Gregory. You know, it's one of the exercises he did in the forest. You know, Jason's right. He's our mentor.

573
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:23,000
So I'm really struggling with this because I'm trying to make sure like when I zip past this band during Halloween, I get so excited and I'm not hyping this up for no reason.

574
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:32,000
But I do get legit excited to see this band every time. Yeah, we do. Isn't you? We almost zipped right by him and putting him in there. How did we not? I don't know.

575
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:48,000
So it's hard for me here and I'm trying to search my feelings to make sure I'm not trying to just do this for shock value, but I kind of feel like I want to give it to the Calico Coven Critters.

576
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:58,000
And it's not against the bear. I'm not. I love the bears. Look, the bears got a lot of shine in December. We gave them a whole week. Right. But I'm trying not to do.

577
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I'm not trying to not to do it just to be interesting. I'm just saying that if it comes down to those those specific bears from the show and these characters, I do.

578
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:20,000
If they're two rock concerts, those five bears and these Calico Coven creepers, whatever the hell they're called, which one do you kind of just on image alone?

579
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Because I think musically they're similar musically. I think they both have similar skills. I think they have plays similar genres, jaunty country music.

580
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:36,000
They're well paired. This worked out very well. It really did. It did. Yeah. And this could be our first upset, you know.

581
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:42,000
So Scott, what do you think? I don't want to be the decider here.

582
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I I do want to be the decider and I'm deciding Calico Coven. Yeah.

583
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:58,000
You see this picture, though? Yeah, you'll get it. I do. Look, it's making me so happy.

584
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:05,000
And you know what? I love that they don't have to be like expensive animatronics. This is like a haunted house level.

585
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Yeah, maybe I am letting personal bias leak in. I can admit this. Maybe I got a little tired of the country bears.

586
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I think I'm ready to I think they did get their moment on this show. Yeah. And the Calico Coven creepers haven't.

587
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I truly I think that if you're yeah, I was trying to take away. I'm not trying to be shocking here.

588
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I'm not trying to be some shot comic by doing this. I'm saying that if you're taking them out, I think they both are comparable player.

589
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I think they are good players, both good bands. Well, it's like St. Peter's in the actual NCAA tournament this year.

590
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Smaller school made it to one. Their first of the underdogs knocked out. Yeah.

591
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:51,000
The underdogs knocked out as they got further along. But people were shocked at how far they went. Yeah.

592
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
You're right. This is an emotional story. I'm really happy about this.

593
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And they have a Spider-Man. This picture is making me so happy.

594
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I. All right. Wow. Calico. This now this we do understand the seeds thing.

595
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Exciting. That's like a one or a two or a three. I think. No guarantee they go all the way.

596
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:17,000
They're still a lot. Not. I'm rooting for them. I mean, strong gay. They're already in the history books.

597
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Jason, do you want to do the honor on the next one? This is maybe my most anticipated matchup.

598
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Rocky and Bullwinkle of, you know, Rocky and Bullwinkle versus the four little shavers.

599
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Yeah, these are this is maybe the matchup where they're like around the least.

600
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:48,000
There's multiples of all of them. But Rocky and Bullwinkle are from Bullwinkle's restaurant,

601
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
which is something we really need to hit. Right. Topic wise.

602
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,000
But these were around and maybe still are a tiny bit. I don't know if the animatronics are.

603
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,000
But this was like, you know, they were at it was a Chuck E. Cheese like brand.

604
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,000
And they're I think usually like pitch and put kind of player, any golf kind of places.

605
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,000
And then four little shavers were a Chuck E. Cheese side act. Yes.

606
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I think there were only three of them ever in the country. I could be wrong.

607
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Well, they were at a place called the Ice Cream Emporium, which was an ice cream spinoff to Chuck E. Cheese of Chuck E. Cheese.

608
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:34,000
And their names, of course, I say this every time. Nolan, Oh Nolan, Curly and Mick Nolan named after Nolan.

609
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Bushnell. Yeah. Founder of Atari and Time Theater.

610
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:46,000
And there are restored. There's a full restored four little shavers at the Volo Auto Museum in Illinois.

611
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Yes. Are there multiple on this list of things you can see at the Volo Auto Museum?

612
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I think maybe there's another one. So yeah, I'd be there too.

613
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:01,000
But definitely this. I think there are only three, four little shavers ever installed.

614
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
And if we have to say that's a barbershop quartet, barbershop quartet, barbershop quartet.

615
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
One of them's in a barber chair. The rest are dressed like old timey barbers.

616
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:16,000
It was one of a shaver piece. I think so. Like a blade.

617
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:24,000
There was a guy who I did an improv class with, an older gentleman, an old man in an improv class.

618
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:33,000
And he was a barber and he was taking improv classes because he wanted to do a show where he would cut someone's hair on stage with his barber friends and sing songs.

619
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:39,000
And someone said, hey, man, have you ever done anything on stage? And he said no. And I said, OK, well, I'll do an improv class.

620
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:47,000
And he said, it's a great idea. Everyone loves it. I don't know if he ever did it. He was a very old fellow.

621
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Bizarre way in. Huh. Huh. So little shavers ask. Shavers.

622
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:01,000
So, yeah, we're getting a little deeper. This is, by the way, this entire area I was saying is like Americana or country.

623
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
When the kitchen crackpots were in it, you know, that's there's a lot of country with country bears.

624
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:10,000
But then kitchen crackpots were like, I don't know, 40s bullshit. I'm glad they're out.

625
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:18,000
But but this is kind of Rocky and Bullwinkle are sort of more in the country bluegrass zone.

626
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I think I think you got a you got a banjo in there. The Bullwinkle plays and you got Rocky on kind of a carved up base.

627
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:34,000
What is he? Maybe I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. I wrote it down. Sure. Again, I'd say a fiddle.

628
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I'd say a fiddle. Yeah, that's a go to use of animatronic based instruments.

629
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
There's a lot of fiddles around. Sure. So this would be a show.

630
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:53,000
And they were musically the core of it. But then up above them were the like on the arch on the proscenium arch.

631
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:58,000
There were carved Boris and Natasha who were in like a little totem pole situation.

632
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
They would interject in a Statler and Waldorf kind of way.

633
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
And then the side stages were Dudley Do-Right and underdog.

634
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And I'm unclear on if they sang or were just kind of part of the or told jokes or whatever it is.

635
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Like Chuck E. Cheese stuff and like pizza time theater, like all like surprisingly like archive well archived.

636
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Like there are full shows and every version of it that you can find.

637
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:28,000
But like a lot of this stuff like Bullwinkles, like it's tough to figure out exactly what is what.

638
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Yeah, there's some video. Yeah, I'm just saying it's not like you can find everything that had ever happened at one of these places.

639
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
And certainly harder to find like set lists and stage. There are no set lists.

640
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I mean, yeah, everyone took them. Everyone took them at the end of the show.

641
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
It hopped up on stage. Setlist FM does not have it.

642
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Mike, do you have that Four Little Shavers clip I sent you?

643
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Jason sent me one clip. I sent you one.

644
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
This is the only clip I really followed because I got so excited.

645
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Well, that's I should also say there was a moment where I was like, well, you know, kind of everybody in this is a musician and they don't technically play instruments.

646
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
So should they not be? And I sensed like I asked a wrong.

647
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I asked a bad question by bringing that up. I just wanted to.

648
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I had a lot. I had a lot about Four Little Shavers.

649
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Yeah, this is a place of love. You're smiling a wide smile.

650
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I'm always excited when they come up on the show.

651
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
But Barbara, Jason's rock and roll is barbershop quartet.

652
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,000
That's what he thinks when he thinks of rock. So I'll play a clip here of them.

653
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:36,000
But not to do my heart is feeling the way I'm feeling is simply great.

654
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:45,000
It has been on ready for love. I can jump over the moon above.

655
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
It has a feeling.

656
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Yeah, this is somehow I knew that like this was going to be big for you when I came across the song title Fit as a Fiddle.

657
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Like we got a Jason classic on our hands.

658
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Fit as a Fiddle from 1932 written by Arthur Fried, music by Al Hoffman and Al Goodhart.

659
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I learned this song at a very young age because Gene Kelly, Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor sing this song in a flashback scene in singing in the ring.

660
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
They're showing that they like did stage music.

661
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:22,000
And that's why it would be easy for him, a silent film performer, to transition to talkies.

662
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
God, there's a just just both for the god damn shavers.

663
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
So I was very excited.

664
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Say you're the shavers in my fucking wheelhouse all day long.

665
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
They also sing a song called Toot Toot Tootsie.

666
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Well, yeah, so did Old Yellow Eyes.

667
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I believe Brent Spiner also does Old Toot Toot Toot Toot Toot Goodbye, I think.

668
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:48,000
It really makes me that we were watching the Oscars over here the other night and we're still recovering.

669
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
We're trying to move on.

670
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
But it just struck me.

671
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I was like in pair.

672
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I'd looked up fit as a fiddle earlier in the day.

673
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
And then and then Jane, your girlfriend, was here and that she she was especially excited.

674
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
The most excited she was in the Oscars was when Megan the Stallion showed up.

675
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:10,000
And I was like, what how does this work where Megan the Stallion big in the household and fit as a fiddle big in the household?

676
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I like a song from the 30s and Jane's like current like very, very popular.

677
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Yeah, it's a charismatic modern performer.

678
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Darling, this Megan the Stallion song is all right.

679
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
But if you heard Toot Toot Toot Toot See Goodbye, why let me do a few bars for you, my dear.

680
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I should try some.

681
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Megan should sing a song or two about butterscotch.

682
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I did. I was like looking up the four little shavers when I was over at Jane's and I yelled from the other room like, honey, they knew fit as a fiddle.

683
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Oh, Tootsy.

684
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And then I just look what I found.

685
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I just like started singing the core and she's just like, OK, yeah.

686
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Yeah. Where did you get that straw hat?

687
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Materialized it.

688
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Why does the dog have arm garters on all of a sudden?

689
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
You should bring them back.

690
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
That's a signature look.

691
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I should.

692
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
You're going to sing the old one soon.

693
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
So maybe that's in the content and contention.

694
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
But the other thing about rock and roll, I loved Rocking Bullwinkle as a kid, too.

695
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:26,000
But these animatronics, these are probably the most guilty of the click clack overwhelming the music.

696
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Yeah. Yeah. That's why I said maybe bump on.

697
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I think this seems like a good brand and I think we should talk.

698
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
We should do an episode about it.

699
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,000
But maybe they're struggling because the videos aren't very good and are close to the click clack.

700
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
But like we don't have to drag all these out.

701
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I'm going for a little shave.

702
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Yes, I'll say this, though.

703
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I found some of the coolest sounding music in one of these clips real quick.

704
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Not that.

705
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
This is Bullwinkle. Yeah.

706
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Yeah. Rocky and Bullwinkle playing this.

707
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
This is sweet.

708
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Yeah.

709
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
So I was going to be a little more torn.

710
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I hadn't decided, but you guys have destroyed poor Rocking Bullwinkle.

711
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Yeah.

712
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Do you give them a vote?

713
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I'll vote for Rocky Bullwinkle.

714
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
OK, OK. Sure, sure, sure.

715
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Did you? Was that a full sweep of Calico Coffin Creeper?

716
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Or are you sticking by Fibera?

717
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Just for the people keeping the stats.

718
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
No, I'll go with Calico.

719
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Wow, wow. That is a full sweep. OK, OK.

720
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
But otherwise.

721
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:28,000
But in this case, the Calico Coffin Creepers who go on to face the four little shavers from Pizza Time Theater.

722
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Now we go solo for a little while and another bit.

723
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Boy, we got to. Oh, my God.

724
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
This is an endless episode.

725
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
OK, let's just.

726
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:44,000
This is what inspired this episode, by the way, is that there was an episode where I think we talked about what if there was a dueling piano bar between these competitors?

727
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:50,000
And that is Sunny Eclipse from Tomorrowland from Cosmic Rays in the Magic Kingdom in Disney World.

728
01:09:50,000 --> 01:10:03,000
The Lounge Singing Alien versus Mack Tonight, the McDonald's spokesmoon, who, if you don't know, was or still is at a couple McDonald's restaurants.

729
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
McDonald's restaurants playing piano.

730
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:11,000
There were and are animatronic Mac tonight's that you could see in McDonald's that have really stepped up their game.

731
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Right. Yes. And these are very similar.

732
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
These are. So this is some of the most similar performers, I think, on this list.

733
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Yeah. Yeah.

734
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
I would say. Yeah.

735
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Both like piano based, although in Sunny's case, it is the Astro organ.

736
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Yes. But it's the same.

737
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
It's a similar vibe.

738
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
It's a similar kind of bluesy vibe.

739
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
We got a lounge.

740
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,000
That's really the next one is to we're in the lounge territory.

741
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I guess an easy kind of funny that there's so many animatronics in that zone because like this is a far gone.

742
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,000
You know, when you go out to a bar and that part's gone, we don't do that as much anymore.

743
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
But like and then there's like a lounge.

744
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Yeah.

745
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I think I like playing to take in requests.

746
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
And this is not the most common thing in the world now.

747
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
But when they were making these robots.

748
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Yeah. And the Dresden's famous duo, one of them passed away recently.

749
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Oh, yeah. Marty. Right. Marty.

750
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
And Elaine. Yeah.

751
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,000
So like there was some of the last classic lounge singers around.

752
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
So, yeah, this is a this is another bygone era situation.

753
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Barbershop.

754
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Well, how to begin?

755
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I think I think I didn't know what really the Mac tonight show consisted of.

756
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I saw an animatronic Mac tonight.

757
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:42,000
It was one of the big reasons for me to go to something called the world's largest McDonald's, which is in the Orlando area, which is still a crazy spectacle.

758
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:50,000
But it's not like the seven hundred aesthetics at once that it was in 2010 when I went.

759
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
And unfortunately, he was not working.

760
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,000
It was like a reason to do the trip and inspired a Disney World trip and then got there and it was not working.

761
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
So points against it right away.

762
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
But you can still see it there.

763
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:13,000
And then there's there's I think this is gone, but there's a place called the solid gold McDonald's in Wisconsin, Greenville, Wisconsin, I believe, which is weird.

764
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:20,000
And maybe God, I don't know the full where the Mac tonight animatronics were, but those are two that I I know about.

765
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
And I was like, what is the show exactly?

766
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:28,000
And I was a little disappointed to find it's a lot of singing over prerecords.

767
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
It is like I must say Chuck Berry's in there.

768
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I mean, I found one with Born to be Wild.

769
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
That's not right.

770
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
This is not a correct choice for a piano.

771
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
There's not a piano in that song.

772
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Yeah.

773
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
So disappointing a little from the get go.

774
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Yeah, I you know, I found in some of the solo rounds and in with Rock and Bullwinkle, too.

775
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I was I was docking some points because I'm like, is this your main gig, man?

776
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Like this isn't Mack tonight's main gig.

777
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
You know, it's little movies, pitch man.

778
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Like that's the ads are the yes.

779
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:16,000
The the the 80s McDonald's ads and just his existence on merchandise and as a crazy reference to bring up and weird.

780
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Yeah.

781
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Retrofuture of I mean, I love Mac tonight.

782
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
But is this really the way that he shines?

783
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Sunny Eclipse exclusive engagement, a cosmic race.

784
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Also the last time I was there a few months ago, frozen, frozen and rigor mortis on the stage.

785
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
No, no, no.

786
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
So not working similar to your Mac tonight experience.

787
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I believe is up and working more recently.

788
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
OK, good, good.

789
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:46,000
But yeah, original songs, you know, he's there's original songs in the commercials.

790
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
But do we even count that because it's not in the robot show?

791
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Yeah, he does perform Mac the knife, which was his main thing.

792
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:02,000
But I don't think with the customized lyrics about head for golden lights dinner at McDonald's.

793
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:10,000
So I and I could be wrong, but if that original song was not in the show, then there's not a lot I can I can say in the favor of this.

794
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Yeah. Let me say this, though, that this wasn't at all locations, but I found one video.

795
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Of course, Sunny Eclipse has invisible backup singers who are the space angels.

796
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
And I thought, well, that's big points that there are backup singers.

797
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:31,000
But in one case, Mack tonight did have backup singers and those are the rockin chickens.

798
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Oh, yeah. Right. Right.

799
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
They all poke out of windows of like a little fake.

800
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:40,000
That's good. And they all do shout together, which has the call in response to it.

801
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Yeah, that's good.

802
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Yeah, I like the rockin chickens.

803
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Look, look wise and vibe wise.

804
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
I'll say this Mac tonight.

805
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
He will haunt my dreams for the rest of my life.

806
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:55,000
There is something so striking about him, maybe more so than anyone else on this list.

807
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:01,000
That I will never forget this in the same way that like I'm haunted by Joe Camel.

808
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Mm hmm. It's a similar era.

809
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
It's a similar type of spokes character.

810
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
They're both cool.

811
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
They're both cool guys.

812
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
You want to be like both of them.

813
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Yeah. Both big smokers, I think for sure.

814
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
He should do a joke.

815
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Oh, yeah, you're right.

816
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
We probably should.

817
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,000
I'm the paywall with the generals warning.

818
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Yeah, we will not. Yeah, we got to do Joe Camel.

819
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
He was ever an animatronic anywhere for any reason.

820
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
And when you take like a tour of the Marlboro factory.

821
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Yeah, maybe he actually does smoke.

822
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
No, camel. Oh, yeah.

823
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Yeah. Jesus. That was just at the time.

824
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I lost my mind.

825
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Promotions are like a cool mascot and then the Marlboro man.

826
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Yeah, you could get points.

827
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Yeah.

828
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Camel cigarettes. Yeah, we'll do.

829
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
We'll do a camel cigarettes episode.

830
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
We'll do some cigarettes episodes.

831
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Coming soon.

832
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:09,000
But I will give Matt tonight points for that because that is just such a striking image of a character in a way like top my top 20 most striking characters in my brain.

833
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:14,000
It's such a thing from our childhood specific because I think he happened in like 87, 88.

834
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Yeah. And it did just like, yeah, really tear through the fabric.

835
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Right. My world and life.

836
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Right. That age.

837
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Like I will never forget this face.

838
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Yeah. So so he does. He does. Does deserve points for that.

839
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Yeah. But I think, you know, our our love of Sunny Eclipse is pretty clear.

840
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Whole episode about him with Jenny Nicholson on the second gate.

841
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
It's a really fun show.

842
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
And if you go to Disney World, you have that's a thing you have to like.

843
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Oh, here's an obscure corner you can take people to.

844
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
And he looks great, too. He looks cool.

845
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,000
His set, the restaurant doesn't look cool that he's in, but he is little area looks cool.

846
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Yeah. It's just a good concept art you can find online.

847
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
He looks cool.

848
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
And the songs are much better.

849
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Yeah.

850
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Original songs.

851
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
I looked it up again. Loves the center of the universe.

852
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Moving song.

853
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:12,000
All right. Well, I think, unfortunately, but I look I still like the idea of pairing them up.

854
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
In some way. Yeah. Yeah.

855
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Could happen.

856
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Well, Mac needs more love now for a lot of the Szechuan sauce is coming back yet again.

857
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Everything retro happened like there probably is the right way to bring back.

858
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Yes. Right. That would be exciting.

859
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:31,000
They need to reclaim some like darker parts of the Internet tried to claim him.

860
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
This is 10 years ago. Eight, 10 years ago or so.

861
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:41,000
I think it's already been done with. Yeah, we don't like you can't bring them up now without people saying, well, do you know that it's the right way?

862
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Well, no, no, it's not. I didn't even remember.

863
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Tonight is ours. Damn it. Yeah, I didn't even remember it.

864
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I think the the Scott I say I sent you a Mac tonight.

865
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Beach towel. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's incredible.

866
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Yeah, I love that. I think lots of people are already starting to reclaim them.

867
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
So I think it's time for McDonald's.

868
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,000
They've been pretty lackluster in their honestly.

869
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:07,000
They're they're trying to roll out like their version of Beyond Burger Impossible Burger soon.

870
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Seems like the perfect time for Mac tonight to come back.

871
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Why is that? Yeah, I was going to say, what's the what's the.

872
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Because they well, they haven't had a big new food item in a while.

873
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,000
They're they're getting hampered down by the rising cost of meat like everywhere is.

874
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,000
And I think we could all use the morale boost of seeing our friend Mac again.

875
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
You know, and also like, let's let's scare.

876
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Let's scare Scott. I don't mean to, you know, put your child on the spot.

877
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Like, let's get them. Let's get them some impressions in their minds as they develop object.

878
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Yeah, yeah, I would like them to be as scarred by Mac tonight.

879
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Why not? It happened to me. It should have been.

880
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:52,000
That's right. It's the right time for Beyond Meat at McDonald's.

881
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Well, Sunny Eclipse advances. No disrespect, Mac.

882
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:01,000
But I think you're right. Well, do you give him further respect for his real job as a TV pitchman?

883
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Yeah. And we move on in the lounge area.

884
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Feel free, Jason, to take this next.

885
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Well, I'm concerned. Maybe I don't have the right names, but this is Sally.

886
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Sally, the singing animatronic loun singer from Sally Dark Rides.

887
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:23,000
The namesake of Sally Dark Rides. Yes. Versus Dolly Dimples.

888
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Dolly Dimples, who's a Chuck E. Cheese side character as well.

889
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Sally, we came across in our episode about Sally Dark Rides.

890
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
That was a second gate, right? Yes.

891
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Which I recommend. We found some very bizarre off the beaten path rides.

892
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:46,000
They make some of the strangest animatronics outside of Disney and Universal, although sometimes for Universal.

893
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Including, and that was your find, I think, Mike, was this weird video advertising that you could in your...

894
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
It seems like especially hotel bars is what they're aiming for.

895
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Yeah, I have it. I have it. Oh, yes, please. Yeah, yeah.

896
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Nights, have you ever felt as all night?

897
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:17,000
She's talented, good looking, and an entertainer par excellence. Meet Sally, our piano playing lady.

898
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Sally's realistic good looks love her voice.

899
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
They keep mentioning how attractive the robot is in this ad.

900
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
It's a really strange video. It's not the last time.

901
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:33,000
This is 1984, so it's not all that surprising to see a robot singing and playing the piano.

902
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Anyway, some other guy goes, oh, and she's attractive too at the end of this.

903
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
That was a selling point for the robot.

904
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
She's always sober, doesn't take breaks, and even comes with a warranty.

905
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Yeah, she's the perfect employee.

906
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Which is also funny because that's how we think of women in America. They've got to be attractive.

907
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,000
And then the other thing is this is the contempt these people have for employees.

908
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Well, they're always drunk and they always want a break from their work.

909
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Musicians, what illicit substances they get going in their automobiles.

910
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:20,000
So yeah, Sally, imagine a mannequin from a department store playing the piano.

911
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Yes.

912
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
It's exactly like this.

913
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,000
And later on, DJ, there was a second iteration of her.

914
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Eventually, we can't count that.

915
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Yeah, this round.

916
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Dolly Dimples, the Chuck E. Cheese show specifically, kept coming across as specifically for adults.

917
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:43,000
And for a number of reasons, one, she would kind of flirt with the people close to the stage.

918
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,000
She also has some references to her many husbands.

919
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
That was the other relationship I was alluding to.

920
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:55,000
She's like, one of whom, like the shavers, his name is Nolan.

921
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
They nodded to Nolan, who's Chuck E. Cheese's daddy.

922
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Not Christopher Nolan.

923
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
No, no, no.

924
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Nolan Bushnell.

925
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Christopher Nolan was not married to Dolly Dimples.

926
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
And not Jonathan Nolan.

927
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
And not the third Nolan.

928
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
And not the third Nolan.

929
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
And no one talk about the third one.

930
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
The talk of the third Nolan.

931
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Nolan Ryan.

932
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Nolan Ryan, a baseball player.

933
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Yeah.

934
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Yeah, so Dolly Dimples looks like a hippopotamus in a wig.

935
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Big clown wig.

936
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Big clown wig, as Jamie Loftus said, this divorcee hippopotamus on our Chuck E. Cheese episode.

937
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Yes, it's very, she looks very funny.

938
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
I really like the look she's got going here.

939
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Yeah.

940
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I'll say that.

941
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Yes, yeah.

942
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:41,000
And yeah, her show's a little, let's say a little bodier.

943
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
A little bodier, yeah.

944
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:47,000
With these references and with the, because, which, I was looking for proof of what that means, the bodiness.

945
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,000
And I think it's mainly that she says that people are getting her hot and bothered.

946
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Yeah.

947
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Which I guess is X-rated within Theme Park world.

948
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Children's entertainment world.

949
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Right, and this is one of those where this is all documented on YouTube.

950
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
You can find the whole show.

951
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
She does like, she does some older songs, I feel like,

952
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
other than Sally.

953
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Sally is doing like the hits of the 60s or 70s.

954
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:18,000
She does, Sally was doing an old fashioned love song by Three Dog Nights, of course written by Paul Williams.

955
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
That's new compared to some of the songs Dolly Dimples does.

956
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
She does Summertime.

957
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
She does Frankie and John.

958
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
George Gershwin, yeah.

959
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Could see goodbye.

960
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Yeah, well, how many of the acts on this list?

961
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,000
She does Hello Dolly from Hello Dolly.

962
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
That's cute.

963
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Yeah.

964
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Watch that man right out of my hair.

965
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Yeah.

966
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,000
The vibe, this is just, I don't have it, actually, this, I just want to give everybody a vibe.

967
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Little Chicago there.

968
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
I assume the Blues Brothers.

969
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
You should have done that at our Chicago show.

970
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
You should have started the show singing Chicago, Chicago.

971
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
There's always another Chicago show.

972
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Next Chicago show, we're coming out as the Blues Brothers, let's be honest.

973
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
We could never be the Blues Brothers.

974
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
We're just a bunch of comedians.

975
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
We couldn't be authentic blues musicians.

976
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
You're right.

977
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Like the Blues Brothers.

978
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
You gotta be the professional dancer to do.

979
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,000
We're going to have to work hard to get ready for that.

980
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Who would be of all three of the, I consider now the Blues Brothers, the three good men,

981
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Ackroyd and Belushi, Jim Belushi.

982
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Which one would each of us be?

983
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Well, I don't look, I don't, why aren't you counting your Ackroyd because you're tall?

984
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I can swing it, but Jason's the kid.

985
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Oh yeah, the kid.

986
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

987
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
This is the kid in Blues Brothers.

988
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
12 year old.

989
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Okay, we got it down.

990
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:03,000
So yeah, Dolly Dimples, more personality from what I understand than Sally.

991
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Sally plays through, I think she has a little banter, but there's not a lot of documentation online about it.

992
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:13,000
But it feels like Dolly Dimples is programmed for you to sit down.

993
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:19,000
It's so strange, we talked about this before, like there used to be multiple rooms in these Chuck E. Cheese places.

994
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
And you just go in a separate room with Dolly Dimples.

995
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Like you could be in there alone with her.

996
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Yeah.

997
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
And like just enjoy your pizza and drinks.

998
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:34,000
This is how I think, you know, the Chuck E. Cheese stuff maybe shines because it's more aggressively documented, as you've said, Mike.

999
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Even to this level of detail, that apparently the first time there was ever a Dolly Dimples room that they made up a, because of the hot and bothered and all that, they took us, they put up a sign.

1000
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
They made up a sign that says, especially for mom and dad.

1001
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
They didn't want to say only for mom and dad, but especially.

1002
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
And then ultimately they decided to not install the sign.

1003
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,000
And I'm reading this like, how am I reading this?

1004
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:02,000
This is the inner workings of, I wouldn't be reading like an oral history about Leslie's pool supplies.

1005
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Yeah, yeah.

1006
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,000
How is this level of detail made it to me and therefore you, the audience.

1007
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
But now it has.

1008
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:15,000
So it's, you know, do we have to dock Dolly points for being so NC-17?

1009
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
You know, I don't, I don't think so.

1010
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I think they're, mom and dad need a show too while they're drinking like a giant pour of white's infandel out of those red plastic cups that repeats a play's hat back in the day.

1011
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Look, there's, I've seen like a couple of times now there's, oh, you know what?

1012
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:39,000
The Rainforest Cafe in Woodfield Mall was replaced by a Peppa Pig's Playland kind of a thing.

1013
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
And I've seen this before.

1014
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I think there are multiple Peppa Pig.

1015
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
I don't know how, I don't know what there's animatronic situation.

1016
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
I haven't looked into it.

1017
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:53,000
But if like you brought your kid to Peppa Pig and there was like a Dolly Dimples room, so a parents could, they could own wine.

1018
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
They could have a drink and they could hear one of their favorite songs to to to see goodbye.

1019
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
I think that'd be great.

1020
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,000
And get out of the eyesight of their child.

1021
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Yeah, right.

1022
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
A great thing to do in a place like that.

1023
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Exactly.

1024
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Who would have thought like in the era when like even motels, the signs would say like color TV, bar, lounge, nightly entertainment,

1025
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:21,000
like who would have thought Dolly Dimples would be one of the last regular lounge singers outside of like Las Vegas?

1026
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
So there's Dolly's around.

1027
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I think I can't.

1028
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I don't know if in Volo this museum, but there's for sure Dolly's around.

1029
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
People have kept them up.

1030
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
There's a guy who has one in his living room.

1031
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Oh, wow.

1032
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Like a restored one that he programs and post videos.

1033
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
I don't want to get lucky guy.

1034
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Yeah, I live with Dolly.

1035
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
I don't want to get sympathy here, but let me say this.

1036
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:50,000
I saw Sally for sale and this is on Worth Point, which has come up a bunch for this kind of nonsense.

1037
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
It's being sold on Worth Point.

1038
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Sally has been playing piano for many years at Wax World of the Stars in Wisconsin Dells.

1039
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Oh, yeah.

1040
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,000
That museum is now closed and Sally is looking for a new home.

1041
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Not only can she play piano, she sings as well, lips move in song sing, can't blah, blah, blah.

1042
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
But she is tired.

1043
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
She has a few missing fingers and is in need of some refurbishing.

1044
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
But that's all right.

1045
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
This is what this copy says.

1046
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
It is all right.

1047
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
It is all right.

1048
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Sally works hard.

1049
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
She doesn't get breaks.

1050
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
She doesn't get a drink.

1051
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,000
So Sally's in rough shape.

1052
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
She can maybe use this.

1053
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,000
But I think we're all failing.

1054
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Yeah, I got to go with Dolly.

1055
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
We got to Dolly Dimples.

1056
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
All right.

1057
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Sorry, Sally.

1058
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Wishing you the best.

1059
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I hope you got a great new owner.

1060
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
It fixed you up right.

1061
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,000
But Dolly Dimples moves on to take on Sony Eclipse.

1062
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I'm not sure the order.

1063
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
I think I know the order I want to go here.

1064
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
I think I know the right way to close it out.

1065
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Let's jump back to bands.

1066
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
And here we have.

1067
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
So we're in Disney territory now.

1068
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
This is kind of some chaos, some miscellany.

1069
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
We'll see how they fare against each other.

1070
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
All right.

1071
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:05,000
We have here the Muppet Penguin Orchestra from Muppet

1072
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Vision 3D versus the Seven Dwarves.

1073
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Why the Seven Dwarves?

1074
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Because the Seven Dwarves are a band.

1075
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
You know the ride.

1076
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Think about the ride.

1077
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Think about Enchanted Wish and even the Mind Train ride.

1078
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
The same scene.

1079
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Yes.

1080
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Yeah.

1081
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,000
They are celebrating with Snow White in a happy moment.

1082
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
And we'll ride with some otherwise scary stuff.

1083
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
The Seven Dwarves are a band.

1084
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
They.

1085
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
The Seven Dwarves rock.

1086
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Yeah.

1087
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Yes.

1088
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
I don't know if they call it they're doing rock music.

1089
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
It's kind of like Swiss Alps stuff.

1090
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
It's the they're playing the silly song, Scott.

1091
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Is that the name of it?

1092
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Yeah.

1093
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:49,000
And in this in the movie, of course, there's longer.

1094
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
And then they all like sing a little verse.

1095
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Not all of them.

1096
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
A couple of them.

1097
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Happy sings a verse.

1098
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
You know what I'm saying.

1099
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
I know it's so much more from the ride.

1100
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
I forget that there's lyrics.

1101
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Yeah, there's lyrics in there, but we don't they don't sing it in the ride.

1102
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
So it shouldn't count.

1103
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
So yeah.

1104
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
But a lot of them.

1105
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
All right.

1106
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Look, you got a fiddle in there.

1107
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
You got a big bass.

1108
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
You got an accordion.

1109
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:15,000
And you got if we're talking cool gear like I think the only thing getting close maybe

1110
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:22,000
to the munch slash fats piano setup is this ornate wooden piano or organ, whatever you

1111
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
want to call it, where the pipes, I guess it's an organ because of the pipes, because

1112
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:31,000
it's a bunch of carved animals that all make the noises from little holes.

1113
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
This is maybe the best instrument in the whole tournament.

1114
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Could be.

1115
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
This is the coolest looking instrument.

1116
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
You got to give them points for that.

1117
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Yeah.

1118
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,000
And then they're all like grumpy is playing the accordion.

1119
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Is that grumpy?

1120
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
I believe it looks like grumpy to me.

1121
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Wow.

1122
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
And then Doc is on a mandolin.

1123
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:54,000
And then I think that's happy in the blue on the bass.

1124
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Sleepy maybe playing fiddle.

1125
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Yeah.

1126
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Sleepy even the fiddle.

1127
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:02,000
And then Sneezy and Dopey are just stacked on top of each other.

1128
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Yeah.

1129
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Now they didn't go the full because I watched the clip from the movie.

1130
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Dopey in the movie is playing percussion.

1131
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Dopey is awesome.

1132
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Really?

1133
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
He's so good.

1134
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
And he's doing tricks.

1135
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Remember he like shoots his like the drumstick like flies through his clothes.

1136
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Now we can't count it.

1137
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:27,000
I'm just saying that he has this ability to play and they did not show him drumming in here because I think he could have taken out any other drummer maybe in this competition too.

1138
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:33,000
I think these dwarves are low key like just fucking killer session musician kind of players.

1139
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
What a crazy thing.

1140
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:40,000
They go work in a mine all day and how do they unwind by just going to town?

1141
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Yeah.

1142
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
They're really good musicians.

1143
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:55,000
It's like I would love to see like the I don't know it's not sad but like if say this was a Chuck E Cheese like people would have these dwarf shows in their garages and stuff and they would have like reprogrammed to play like a Lumineers song or something.

1144
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
You know?

1145
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Hey ho music or Mumford and Son.

1146
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Sure.

1147
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
The best music.

1148
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
My favorite music.

1149
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
The best.

1150
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Yeah.

1151
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I was going to suggest getting rid of this other act to replace with the Calico Critters.

1152
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Oh.

1153
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Oh.

1154
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
So we're not feeling good about Muppets we're going to go.

1155
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
I had the wrong act down.

1156
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Oh really?

1157
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
What would you think?

1158
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
I thought it was the almost by the skin of their teeth jamming jesters.

1159
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Oh I see.

1160
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,000
I think we would have blown away both of these bands.

1161
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Well it's still up for the jamming jesters also came up in the Sally Dark Rides second gate.

1162
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Right.

1163
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
They would have won?

1164
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
I think they would have won this round easily.

1165
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Oh really?

1166
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Do you want to pull them in?

1167
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
I like last minute replacement.

1168
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
This is the thing of your childhood Mike.

1169
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Do you want to put the gesture back?

1170
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,000
You want to replace jesters with the Muppets Penguin Orchestra?

1171
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
No I'm saying the other.

1172
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Wait who do you think is in?

1173
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,000
I would have replaced the Muppet Penguin Orchestra with the Calico Creepers earlier.

1174
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Oh I see.

1175
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
I see.

1176
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:58,000
So in our official way of saying this Muppets but we're saying but now and you they're the

1177
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
link weak link to you.

1178
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
So that means their chances are not very good.

1179
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Right.

1180
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Sorry Muppet fans.

1181
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,000
But do we want to put in this thing from your childhood?

1182
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
I would replace the Muppet Orchestra with jamming jesters.

1183
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Sure.

1184
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
All right.

1185
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Muppets you're out.

1186
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Jamming jesters are in.

1187
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
A regional thing from Enchanted Forest in Lombard Illinois.

1188
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Correct?

1189
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Yeah.

1190
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
All right.

1191
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Jamming jesters.

1192
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
People get through their phone by the way.

1193
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:27,000
A thousand people in our audience through their phone when I said a Muppet thing is

1194
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,000
out.

1195
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,000
I don't think neither of these were my the dwarves or the Muppet.

1196
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Like neither of these were my favorites.

1197
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I was a I freaking loved the seven dwarves.

1198
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
I was obsessed as a kid.

1199
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
I was obsessed with the seven dwarves.

1200
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,000
I had I've told the story before.

1201
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
I was sick and I was like my dad was like can I get you something when I go to the store

1202
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,000
and I go I want seven dwarves toys and he goes and he goes oh okay and then he like

1203
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,000
left on my mom goes they don't make seven dwarves toys.

1204
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
What are you going to buy do you agree to that?

1205
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:59,000
And he went and he found you know Walgreens or something like a pack of seven little ninja

1206
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:03,000
characters and whatever and he brought it back and he goes hey these are the ninja dwarves.

1207
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Good enough.

1208
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Did you buy it?

1209
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Yeah I bought it.

1210
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Yeah.

1211
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Wow.

1212
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
And then they buy the time my sister was was three or something.

1213
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:14,000
They did have pretty high quality dwarves things but I was obsessed.

1214
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
They had the poster on my wall.

1215
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,000
When I finally opened my eyes on the well no the original didn't have this fun scene I

1216
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,000
don't even think in Disney World but look I like them finest characters as animatronic

1217
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
musicians.

1218
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
I don't think that scene is a lie.

1219
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
It's fine.

1220
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
I don't think I love it.

1221
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I just like it too.

1222
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Yeah I like it too.

1223
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Two days ago I love going in that room when they're playing that little.

1224
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Yeah I'm clapping along.

1225
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,000
I'm pretty happy Snow White's having a good time.

1226
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:41,000
I think in the context of the ride but in the context of this this bracket I was like

1227
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
I don't know.

1228
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
I like the silly song.

1229
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:49,000
I like bringing with this genre like yodely music into this rock competition.

1230
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
I like acknowledging them as musicians.

1231
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
What is rock and roll?

1232
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
What is it?

1233
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
It's the essence.

1234
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
It's the vibe in that room.

1235
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Can you imagine you go on that ride and you go it would be awesome to hang out in this

1236
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,000
room with these dwarves with the seven dwarves and Snow White.

1237
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
This would be a fun little party we're having.

1238
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,000
But the jamming gestures I mean they do rock around the clock.

1239
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
They do let's go to the hop.

1240
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
They do magic to do from Pippin.

1241
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
They do a lot of Pippin.

1242
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
They do a lot of songs from Pippin.

1243
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Can we explain this from the ground up if you don't have the second gate and you should.

1244
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Go check out the Sally one especially because that's a lot of where this is coming from.

1245
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
But this is something that was from Mike's childhood.

1246
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:27,000
You didn't realize that this Anatronics company was behind it and it is it's medieval themed.

1247
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
There's a dragon in the band.

1248
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:35,000
There's another there's a very Sally like and like a mannequin looking woman like a

1249
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
princess or something.

1250
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
I don't know what she is.

1251
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Anything else you want to say being as a little home.

1252
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:45,000
There's a little dragon called Cute and they do some some OK comedy.

1253
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Isn't there a bigger dragon that kind of rolls out directly onto the carpet.

1254
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Yeah.

1255
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
A little cute dragon that's up on a table or something.

1256
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Yes.

1257
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:58,000
And it's like I love I do love this show.

1258
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
And it was from.

1259
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Yeah.

1260
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Should we say I don't know.

1261
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
It's from Enchanted Castle.

1262
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Did we say that Enchanted Castle.

1263
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
You did say that.

1264
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
OK.

1265
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
In Lombard Illinois.

1266
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
It's still there.

1267
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
It still exists.

1268
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Although somebody I recently said they think the show is done.

1269
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
I think they don't run it anymore.

1270
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
So it's possible it's finally over.

1271
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:20,000
But it's a great like you don't see you see some of the same like kind of hillbilly type

1272
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,000
shows with these robots but you don't see a lot of medieval.

1273
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
I appreciate that vibe.

1274
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I think it's fun.

1275
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:31,000
There's a lot of mouth robot noise clacking noise on these which we pointed out on the

1276
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,000
episode like a trumpeter.

1277
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Is he also a dragon.

1278
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
There's like a kind of a donkey looking guy.

1279
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
They've ref.

1280
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
They've changed.

1281
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,000
They we've discovered they changed it around a little bit over the years.

1282
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
And yeah they do like.

1283
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:51,000
At some point it was Merlin Merlin's magical music makers and then became the jamming

1284
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
gestures.

1285
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Right.

1286
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
And they do.

1287
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
They also do old time rock and roll sometimes.

1288
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Yeah.

1289
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:03,000
I will say I did find a YouTube comment on one of the videos where someone just wrote

1290
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
in all caps Chuck E.

1291
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Cheese's in Darien Illinois is better than this.

1292
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,000
And I was like oh I guess fair.

1293
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
I mean that's kind of fair.

1294
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
I bet it is.

1295
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
But you know it's about the music.

1296
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
And you've been there in person.

1297
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,000
This has become like a Mike Passion.

1298
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:25,000
So I don't want to put it all on you but you know you can speak to this the most maybe.

1299
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Yeah it's tough because like I mean I like that we put the jamming gestures in here but

1300
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:38,000
these are two things that the dwarves song and being in the room and this is again I

1301
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:43,000
try to take out you know nostalgia or my extreme love and I try to just judge it on the rock.

1302
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:47,000
I try to judge it on the vibes and I don't know.

1303
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:53,000
I think that that seven dwarves band and the song they're playing the vibe is too good

1304
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
to ignore.

1305
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
The vibe is too fun to ignore.

1306
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,000
And I look I can't completely take myself out of it because I wanted to be friends with

1307
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:03,000
these seven guys and Snow White Snow White not so much seven guys.

1308
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Yes I wanted to be buddies with them.

1309
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:11,000
I thought this seemed like they were like the original like aspirational hang you know

1310
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,000
like this is very odd but OK.

1311
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
I'm not worse.

1312
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Before the frat pack before your other guy.

1313
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Yeah not my other guys but I as a child and this is not I'm not exaggerating for the air

1314
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
here.

1315
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
This is true.

1316
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I was I was a huge seven dwarves kid and I wanted to be there Snow White.

1317
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
You wanted them.

1318
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Yeah I was like a lady out of here.

1319
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,000
What about Mike Michael and the seven dwarves.

1320
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
No Mike.

1321
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Snow Mike is what I said.

1322
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,000
And these robots still look good.

1323
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
The song is still fun.

1324
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Fan art by the way.

1325
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Sure.

1326
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:53,000
You and his shirt with sleeves kind of like the Disney bound version of those are with

1327
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
your current your actual style.

1328
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
These sleeves are on trend right now.

1329
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:02,000
So you know it's like you get a hold of the end of the ride would be like the prince is

1330
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:06,000
coming over and I'm like no no no get away and I'm like motioning for dopey to come over

1331
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
to like get kids.

1332
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:13,000
To love kiss dopey bring me a hard Mountain Dew Bob last.

1333
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Let's party fellas.

1334
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
I got to go seven dwarves.

1335
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Yeah I'm happy Jim and gestures are in there but I think seven dwarves is the best maybe

1336
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
the best Disney music scene.

1337
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Think about it.

1338
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Oh yeah.

1339
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Most music all portrayed in one place and it's fun.

1340
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Yeah I like seven dwarves.

1341
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
I think they're in.

1342
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
That's all right.

1343
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,000
You play the guys the gang the whole gang got in.

1344
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Yeah yeah I think they made a valiant effort.

1345
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,000
The Muppets dist geez.

1346
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
People are upset.

1347
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
So I like them too but.

1348
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:54,000
It's a full orchestra I like that but yeah it brings us to the final round and this the

1349
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,000
matchup you've been waiting for ghost versus alien.

1350
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:04,000
This is where we finally settle the hash between the ghost or the alien.

1351
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:13,000
The hash between the ghost organist in the haunted mansion and the ET playing the marimba

1352
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,000
the big big glowy plants rocks there.

1353
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
They're there.

1354
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
They light up and he's playing them with you know.

1355
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Yeah.

1356
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,000
ET playing big glowy things with percussion sticks from the ET adventure.

1357
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Look up and don't blink or you will miss him.

1358
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Yes.

1359
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Yeah it's hard.

1360
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:35,000
It's possible even to find a good picture of him but he's burned into my brain.

1361
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Once I was thinking about musicians and rides.

1362
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Well this is look you don't.

1363
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:45,000
How do you know that you're in an interplanetary celebration unless there's a little alien

1364
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
going bling bling bling bling bling bling.

1365
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
This is Ewok stuff.

1366
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
This is great.

1367
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Yeah.

1368
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
It makes me so happy.

1369
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
It's I don't know why he's so I didn't even remember.

1370
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I so did not realize he was way up in the back.

1371
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Right.

1372
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
He's he's he's in the front of my heart.

1373
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Well because another one is kind of playing a plant like harp thing.

1374
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Right.

1375
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Yeah.

1376
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Like a lot of the planet is like a musical instrument you know.

1377
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
It can all be.

1378
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
It's a very musical planet.

1379
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Like the green planet is cool.

1380
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
I think we can all agree.

1381
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Lots of cool environments on the green planet.

1382
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
It's such an under the sea thing.

1383
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
It's such a vibe of under the sea.

1384
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
But what does ET open?

1385
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Is it like what does it.

1386
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Pretty close.

1387
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Yeah.

1388
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
I think it's like the ride 90.

1389
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Ninety one.

1390
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Yes.

1391
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
So were they 90 probably in Florida.

1392
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Yeah.

1393
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Florida.

1394
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
So the influence by under the sea.

1395
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Maybe.

1396
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
It's such an under the sea.

1397
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Should we have put an under the sea character in this.

1398
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I don't think so because I think this is the vibe.

1399
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Well maybe Mr.

1400
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Limp it just for hanging out.

1401
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Oh sure.

1402
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
All right.

1403
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000
I guess he doesn't really play anything.

1404
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,000
So but then you got some history.

1405
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,000
You got I didn't realize this is the we're talking about Victor Geist.

1406
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I just covered him in the last episode.

1407
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
This is what we just made it past.

1408
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Victor Geist I believe in the ballroom.

1409
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Right.

1410
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Right.

1411
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:10,000
And he's playing a big crazy huge organ from 20,000 leagues and there's spirits coming out of the pipes.

1412
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
It's an impressive piece.

1413
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Yeah.

1414
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Somebody pointed out that we didn't recognize or didn't say that it's a play on Poltergeist.

1415
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Yeah.

1416
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:24,000
I still I understand if the if the we were saying it was like a normal name and we missed that Geist is ghost.

1417
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Yeah.

1418
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
That I get.

1419
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Sure.

1420
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
But anybody who's saying no it's a joke.

1421
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,000
It's a play on Poltergeist.

1422
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
No it's not.

1423
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
You mean Victor Geist.

1424
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Poltergeist.

1425
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:37,000
That's not it would have to be closer to I might have complained about this already.

1426
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Oh maybe.

1427
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Possibly sounds familiar.

1428
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
I'll keep complaining about it.

1429
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:46,000
And maybe it's maybe it taints Victor Geist for me.

1430
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
I didn't like that whole conversation.

1431
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Yeah.

1432
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Look I like I still like Victor Geist despite this controversy that's swirling around him.

1433
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
But the ET plays the cute.

1434
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
He's cute.

1435
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Yeah.

1436
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Look you know if you got thoughts Jason but I know what I'm no I mean he's kind of a big centerpiece of that ballroom scene.

1437
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Yeah.

1438
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
You got to go on the cuteness.

1439
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Yeah.

1440
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Oh there's no way.

1441
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Now he's not an ET.

1442
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:17,000
He's a brodo is so I just want to remember.

1443
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
OK.

1444
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Brodo is OG.

1445
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Brodo is OG.

1446
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Is a brodo is OG playing something we don't know.

1447
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Blung blung blung.

1448
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Blung.

1449
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Wow.

1450
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
OK.

1451
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
So we've the elite eight.

1452
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
The elite eight we've made it through here.

1453
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:38,000
I'll go in the opposite order of what we'll wrap back around to.

1454
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:43,000
So we will have Calico coffin creepers from Knott's Berry Farm versus four little shavers from Chuck E. Cheese.

1455
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Sony Eclipse versus Dolly Dimples.

1456
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Disney versus Chuck E. Cheese.

1457
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Yeah.

1458
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Yeah.

1459
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Seven dwarves versus the ET playing the marimbas.

1460
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Yes.

1461
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Wow.

1462
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:01,000
But that loops us back around to the first one we have to cover which is in round two Munch's Make Believe Band from Chuck E. Cheese's versus the Peach Boys.

1463
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Oh yeah.

1464
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Yeah.

1465
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,000
This seems like a blowout.

1466
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Yeah I think so.

1467
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Yeah.

1468
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,000
This is an easy one.

1469
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Yeah.

1470
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Sorry Peach Boys.

1471
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
I'm glad they made it but yeah.

1472
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Hey look we can't.

1473
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Mr. Munch.

1474
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Yep.

1475
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Yep.

1476
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:18,000
I'll make it a different color so I know what one in the next.

1477
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Okay.

1478
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
This is interesting then.

1479
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Calico coffin creepers versus four little shavers.

1480
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Oh Jason.

1481
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,000
One of my favorites versus a new favorite.

1482
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Yeah.

1483
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
That kind of got in at the last minute.

1484
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
We have to like the fun of the new.

1485
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
We have to like let that sit for a second.

1486
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
You don't want to get emotional and you don't want to get excited about a new thing.

1487
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
And their merits.

1488
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Look there's more movement certainly in the four little shavers.

1489
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
They are flapping all around.

1490
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Yeah.

1491
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,000
I go back though to my original argument which is that.

1492
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
I mean look acapella music.

1493
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
That's music.

1494
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
They're musicians.

1495
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Yeah.

1496
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
But we were kind of going.

1497
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
There's a lot of instruments here.

1498
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,000
If we're studying musicians but that's not going to be points in the favor of Calico

1499
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,000
coffin creepers.

1500
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
These are not the best animatronics we're going to find in the thing.

1501
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,000
No.

1502
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
It's more about a vibe.

1503
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Which yeah.

1504
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Is that like aesthetically here.

1505
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Aesthetically like Jason you would say obviously aesthetically your ultimate band all wears

1506
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:29,000
expenders and little dickies and that's like your ultimate just very uncomfortable.

1507
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Yeah.

1508
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Tunish amount of clothes piled on top of each other.

1509
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Right.

1510
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Yes.

1511
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Right.

1512
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,000
So it's just.

1513
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Yeah.

1514
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
So when you when you go to Calico the Calico.

1515
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:45,000
The Calico guy it's just the music isn't any newer.

1516
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:48,000
This is old time country music you know.

1517
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:52,000
They're probably not so dissimilar in the eras.

1518
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,000
No.

1519
01:45:53,000 --> 01:46:00,000
But if we're talking about rock closer to the origins of rock.

1520
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Hey I think you know I tried to I tried to late add Mr.

1521
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Lincoln as a spoken word category on this cat and this tournament and say does he rock

1522
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
does the spoken word of a great moment for Mr.

1523
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Lincoln rock.

1524
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,000
So my cat I want to.

1525
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Spoken word Grammys he could have won.

1526
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Yeah.

1527
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
I wanted to expand what it means to rock.

1528
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:23,000
So Jason look if you get passion if you feel passion from it if it gets your you know blood

1529
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:27,000
pumping I'm talking about the little shavers then it is rock you know.

1530
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:32,000
These little furry barbershop singers get your blood flowing.

1531
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:37,000
I mean I certainly don't want my blood pumping when I'm getting a straight razor shave.

1532
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
I would like it to be very still.

1533
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
That's fair.

1534
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Yeah.

1535
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,000
I'm just saying.

1536
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Fluidy.

1537
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
They're also in an ice cream place too.

1538
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:48,000
So that that's points in your point.

1539
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Yeah.

1540
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,000
The others are at a coot nanny though.

1541
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
I know that's all that's really fun.

1542
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Halloween hoot nanny and I like that they're seasonal and regional.

1543
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:02,000
I think those are just can be points against but I think they're they're points for in

1544
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,000
this regard.

1545
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,000
I like the Knott's Berry Farm would make it this far.

1546
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Makes it more special.

1547
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:13,000
I mean at the Volo Auto Museum they're kind of in a recreation of like of a pizza type

1548
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,000
experience which is not their original context.

1549
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:22,000
So you know very few people got to see them in their original context of like an animatronic

1550
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,000
ice cream parlor.

1551
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Right.

1552
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:28,000
So but the Calico Coffin Creepers are in their original context.

1553
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:32,000
You know you know what we somebody we haven't brought into this yet is something I'd like

1554
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,000
to quickly like and I see that it is available on T-Public.

1555
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Like which bands merch would you rather wear?

1556
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:45,000
And obviously we don't see they don't have like big you know big gift shops or big online

1557
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:51,000
stores but I think I'm going to be wearing a Calico Coffin Creepers shirt over a four

1558
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
little shaver shirt and that's me.

1559
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,000
That's my preference.

1560
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Yeah.

1561
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:00,000
You don't want like a shirt that's like that that Adventureland kind of games games games

1562
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
ride ride ride shirts but it just says hello hello hello.

1563
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,000
That's a fun shirt.

1564
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Maybe now that you're OK.

1565
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Well that's true.

1566
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,000
I was going to picturing like one of those things where it's like a t-shirt but it has

1567
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:14,000
the look of their like their barbershop outfits on it.

1568
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,000
OK.

1569
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:21,000
I want a logo of the logo that's on their drum which is like yeah yeah badly.

1570
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Yes.

1571
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Like the way you know when you write a poster for yourself if you aren't good at that kind

1572
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:30,000
of thing and you start to run out of room and the letters get spread and you know you

1573
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,000
get smaller and smaller that's their their drum drumhead.

1574
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Yeah.

1575
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Does not look good but it's the choice.

1576
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,000
The Calico.

1577
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Yeah.

1578
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Yeah.

1579
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
If you look at their drumhead.

1580
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
I mean that's very far away.

1581
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
A little DIY a little like it's good.

1582
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Yeah.

1583
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,000
They're like not the corporate band.

1584
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,000
You know what I'm saying.

1585
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Also that's a strike in there.

1586
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Like that's good.

1587
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Not a strike against them.

1588
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Yeah.

1589
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Not like big barbershop.

1590
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Yeah.

1591
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,000
That's a corporate.

1592
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,000
That's a big thing.

1593
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Shills.

1594
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Yeah.

1595
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
For big shampoo.

1596
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Yeah.

1597
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
I got to go with my Calico coffin creepers here.

1598
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Yeah.

1599
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,000
You said it.

1600
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,000
You hit you got me with corporate.

1601
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,000
How do you argue against that.

1602
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,000
These are the underground guy.

1603
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
These are these guys are still keeping it real.

1604
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,000
This matchup I think even I have to go with Calico.

1605
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Oh really.

1606
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Wow.

1607
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
The Calico coffin creepers.

1608
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,000
I'm not.

1609
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:23,000
I recognize that a barbershop ice cream animatronics pretty narrow taste pretty narrow specific

1610
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,000
taste.

1611
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Sure.

1612
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Sure.

1613
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:32,000
So but if we're talking about the the spirit of the tournament I think they're going to

1614
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
have to take the L here even if it was close in my book.

1615
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Wow.

1616
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Wow.

1617
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Calico.

1618
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Wow.

1619
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Wow.

1620
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Defeat four little shavers.

1621
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Anyone who's saying wow to that out loud is in a really weird rabbit hole.

1622
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Yeah.

1623
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Thanks for being here.

1624
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Thank you.

1625
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
The let's move to lounge.

1626
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Who's the king of lounge.

1627
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Is it.

1628
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Is it a big alien or is it a piano playing hippo.

1629
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Sunny versus Dolly.

1630
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Sunny versus Dolly.

1631
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:06,000
They both have like they both have a very impressive body of work.

1632
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:12,000
I'll say they both have a good substantial amount of material you can find online.

1633
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Dolly did a long.

1634
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:19,000
I'll say this Dolly did a longer kind of show a little a little looser which you can appreciate

1635
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
sometimes especially when it's in a live environment.

1636
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,000
She seemed like she wanted to have more interaction with the customers.

1637
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Sunny is sort of you know doing a little crowd work but he has a pretty tight show that he

1638
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
does and he does the same one every time.

1639
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:37,000
So I'm just trying to think of now the venues they're playing and obviously you know the

1640
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:41,000
the Dolly Dimples room was a little looser a little more fun than cosmic rays.

1641
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Cosmic rays is a little more they still wanted you in and out.

1642
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Can't drink there.

1643
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Well look we're going to get into trouble arguing the quality of this restaurant to Jason

1644
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
who has come to its defense many times.

1645
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Fine dining options.

1646
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,000
No toppings bar.

1647
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Free toppings don't you understand.

1648
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Toppings bar.

1649
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Not a bar but a topping.

1650
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Toppings bar at Cosmic Rays right now.

1651
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Really?

1652
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:10,000
I think the last time I was there folks please let us know when the toppings bars return.

1653
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Let Jason know.

1654
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
You can leave us out of the ad on that.

1655
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Tag all accounts.

1656
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Mr. Morrow please do a video on the toppings bar at Cosmic Rays returns.

1657
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Do 30 minutes on it and go through all the different like how the pieces of lettuce are.

1658
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Mike Mr. Morrow recently did a video where he was fishing off a dock at Port Orleans.

1659
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Oh I missed this.

1660
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Riverside and I'm shocked.

1661
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:40,000
I knew about the fishing excursions where you go out on a boat but I didn't know you could just fish off a dock at Wilder's Lodge.

1662
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Wow.

1663
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:47,000
And Port Orleans Riverside or else I would have definitely dragged at least you to do that with me.

1664
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Do we have to get fishing is all I give you everything.

1665
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Six bucks for a half an hour.

1666
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Six or seven bucks.

1667
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,000
You keep the fish.

1668
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,000
No they're catch and release.

1669
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,000
But the fish die anyway.

1670
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,000
I'm catching release.

1671
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
I don't think I don't know that they do.

1672
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
I think they just get a little annoyed.

1673
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
You've got to cook through their mouth.

1674
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Yeah.

1675
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,000
I don't know.

1676
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,000
I think they die anyway.

1677
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:12,000
I'd actually honestly prefer we just eat them because then at least if they're going to die we're using them.

1678
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,000
You reap your reward.

1679
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Yeah I don't want to do that.

1680
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,000
I'm just saying that would be my perfect.

1681
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:21,000
You think they want a bunch of guests cooking up bone in swamp fish in the common area girls.

1682
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,000
In your hotel room.

1683
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Walt said that on his deathbed.

1684
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
That's what he wanted.

1685
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
That's why he did the Florida Project.

1686
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Bunch of swamp fish.

1687
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Florida Project.

1688
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000
So that's on my list next time I get down to Orlando.

1689
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Let me.

1690
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Three words.

1691
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Well five words.

1692
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
You, Norc City.

1693
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Planet Zork.

1694
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Planet Zork.

1695
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,000
I forgot.

1696
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
I forgot Planet Zork.

1697
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,000
If you don't recall and if you haven't heard our second gate.

1698
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
We're referencing a lot of second gate stuff here.

1699
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:59,000
So any clips the land singing robot piano Astro Oregon player comes from an opposite New York City called you Norc City.

1700
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Which is not fully opposite because city is the same.

1701
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Yeah.

1702
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:07,000
A topsy turvy town where the subways are up and the streets are down.

1703
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:14,000
I mean is there anything is there writing that polished in the Dolly Dimple set.

1704
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,000
No she just kind of makes a pass at your husband.

1705
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
You know that's really.

1706
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
She needs another one.

1707
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Yeah.

1708
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,000
She's like a benevolent you know.

1709
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Sonny we don't know about his life.

1710
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:31,000
That's when entertainment was you know that's for the we don't need to know everything about a person.

1711
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:34,000
I don't need to know which space angel he's dating.

1712
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,000
That's true.

1713
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
None of my business.

1714
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:40,000
I want to say Dolly but I'm going to not say Dolly.

1715
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Yeah I think I'm going to give it to Sonny anyway.

1716
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Very close.

1717
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1718
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,000
I mean he's you know we love him.

1719
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,000
We've discussed him at length.

1720
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Everybody goes there and I'm always thankful when people send pictures of themselves with Sonny.

1721
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Yeah.

1722
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
I'm always happy to.

1723
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:01,000
That's that's like putting your own's you know everybody goes and does Splash Mountain but not everybody takes the time.

1724
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Yes right.

1725
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
This show that I can't believe is still there.

1726
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,000
I'm so happy it's still there.

1727
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Yeah thank goodness.

1728
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,000
So this isn't it.

1729
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,000
This is very interesting.

1730
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:14,000
The seven dwarfs versus the ET playing the versus number one.

1731
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Broto.

1732
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Broto.

1733
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
What's the full name?

1734
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Broto is OG.

1735
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Playing Green Planet Light Up.

1736
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Green Planet Glow Plants.

1737
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Green Planet Glow Plants.

1738
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:31,000
If you're talking about a vibe and a bunch of folks you want to hang out with.

1739
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Well but it's not all of them.

1740
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
It's just one ET.

1741
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,000
One Broto is OG.

1742
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Yeah but look at the setting you're in.

1743
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Like a dirty a dirty old cabin that probably stank.

1744
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
That cabin does not look dirty.

1745
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,000
That cabin.

1746
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Well no she cleans it.

1747
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Snow White cleaned that shit.

1748
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,000
But all those dudes that many dudes in a house is gonna stink.

1749
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Now fair enough they were messy.

1750
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:56,000
They were they had fallen under old school gender roles and they made Snow White clean this place up.

1751
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,000
But if she's there that place was spotless.

1752
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
That's true and those animals are helping.

1753
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
The animals were fantastic.

1754
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Yeah they do a great job.

1755
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,000
So when you drive in in Disneyland that is not a dirty cabin.

1756
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Don't ever say that.

1757
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:15,000
And unfortunately I can't when I think dirty between these two I think the ET ride more.

1758
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
But that's part of the charm of it.

1759
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:20,000
That planet was almost toast okay.

1760
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
That they were able to recover that quickly.

1761
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,000
It's fresh.

1762
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,000
It's freshly saved.

1763
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
That is true.

1764
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Yeah.

1765
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,000
ET's healing touch.

1766
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

1767
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,000
It was almost ash.

1768
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Yeah.

1769
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Just a mere 45 seconds ago.

1770
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Here's what I'll say about that setting and I guess we really this is about rock.

1771
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
This is not about setting necessarily.

1772
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,000
But it's where they choose to perform.

1773
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,000
The planet feels gooey to me.

1774
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
It feels like there would be like a film on everything.

1775
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Like if you touched it you'd be like your hands would be messy with a substance.

1776
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:50,000
I don't even know an outer world substance.

1777
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Do we actually want to visit the Green Planet?

1778
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
I want to visit the Green Planet.

1779
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,000
I mean I do.

1780
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,000
I do but.

1781
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:01,000
I mean if you go to the Hollywood Bowl or you go to Red Rocks you have to deal with the elements.

1782
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
You know.

1783
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:07,000
That is in play versus if you go to the Dolby Theater or something indoors.

1784
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Would you rather go to Red Rocks or to the Green Planet?

1785
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Or would you rather see your favorite band?

1786
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,000
I think I'd rather go to the Green Planet.

1787
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:20,000
You'd rather see your favorite band the New Pornographers on the Green Planet.

1788
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,000
I guess it would.

1789
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
I think that's more pop.

1790
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:28,000
I think the Green Planet is more.

1791
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,000
What was the phrase?

1792
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Power poppy.

1793
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Well aesthetically color wise yes it does feel a little more.

1794
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Yeah a lot of their album covers are often very colorful.

1795
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Right.

1796
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Look I don't want to be anywhere near the Dolby Theater.

1797
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
That's a place of danger and violence.

1798
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Well yeah.

1799
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,000
I would say Red Rocks.

1800
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Red Rocks is like yeah in the mountains.

1801
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
It seems.

1802
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,000
What are we arguing?

1803
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:56,000
I lost track of Red Rocks is Green Planet.

1804
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:01,000
But no we're talking about the elements and like the vibe of both these places.

1805
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Jason is trying to stall out so to prove that the Seven Dwarves locate.

1806
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000
He doesn't like that.

1807
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Jason is anti-Seven Dwarves ever since they beat the Jammin' Justers.

1808
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:14,000
And I kind of feel he's trying to divert here from the actual arguments to confuse me.

1809
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,000
I know you guys told me on how fun Marimba ET was.

1810
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,000
I was getting shocking points for how fast you go by that thing.

1811
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
I haven't decided by the way.

1812
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,000
I'm just saying.

1813
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Okay.

1814
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
I'm just saying you said dirty.

1815
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,000
You said their living quarters were dirty and I disagreed.

1816
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Have you decided Jason?

1817
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
I think I've made my decision.

1818
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Okay.

1819
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Are you locking in?

1820
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,000
I will lock in the Marimba playing Broto as OG.

1821
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Yeah.

1822
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Yeah.

1823
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Yeah I love him.

1824
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Yeah he's in.

1825
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,000
All right.

1826
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Yeah.

1827
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Sorry Mike.

1828
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,000
What were you?

1829
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,000
I was going to go with the Dwarves.

1830
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:50,000
That's okay.

1831
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Understood.

1832
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,000
That's what this is all about.

1833
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Yes.

1834
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:57,000
They're still great characters and we respect your desire to be their friends.

1835
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Yes.

1836
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Thank you.

1837
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:02,000
So that brings us to the final four.

1838
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,000
The final four.

1839
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:11,000
We've made it to the final four which is Sunny Eclipse who will take on the Broto as OG playing

1840
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,000
the glow plants.

1841
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:20,000
But first Munchers Make Believe Band versus the Calico Croffin Creepers.

1842
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
I can't believe it got to that point.

1843
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,000
This is the ultimate one seed versus 16 seed.

1844
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
This one is tough here.

1845
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Yeah.

1846
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:32,000
It's really now how far do we want to take this new or how far do we want to take this

1847
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Rudy like.

1848
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Yeah Rudy Band.

1849
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:39,000
It's a Rudy like band.

1850
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,000
The movie Rudy.

1851
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,000
If Rudy was five monsters.

1852
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,000
It's not the band Rooney.

1853
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,000
It's the movie.

1854
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
They're nothing like Rooney.

1855
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:48,000
They're not like Rooney.

1856
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,000
It's like Rudy.

1857
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:56,000
But will this outcome be more like later in life Rudy like the tragic stuff.

1858
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,000
I don't know.

1859
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:00,000
I don't really remember the specifics but it's just like oh no.

1860
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

1861
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:06,000
After the big game or whatever like it's just like oh it wasn't.

1862
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
The real life person you're talking about.

1863
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Yeah.

1864
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Rudy not Rooney.

1865
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
What happened to Rooney?

1866
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Oh I thought you were.

1867
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,000
OK.

1868
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,000
We keep talking about.

1869
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
I don't know what happened to Rooney.

1870
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I haven't heard from Rooney in a while.

1871
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Where's Rooney been?

1872
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
I know where Andy Rooney is.

1873
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:25,000
I don't mind the dry heat of hell.

1874
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:32,000
All right.

1875
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Munch versus Calico.

1876
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Oh boy.

1877
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,000
I'm losing my mind here.

1878
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Yeah.

1879
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:43,000
It's look it's hard because we've lived with Munch so long and Calico is so new but truly

1880
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:49,000
like the feeling I get from it is somebody some band who I've been with for a long time.

1881
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Like I get a vibe of like oh these these people have been in my life for a long time.

1882
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Instantly classic.

1883
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Instantly classic.

1884
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Instantly.

1885
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:01,000
It's not it doesn't feel it's retro but it's not a novelty retro.

1886
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
That's what I feel about it as well.

1887
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:08,000
I like this sentiment but let me say this the what do we know about the Calico Koffman

1888
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Creepers music?

1889
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:13,000
It's like ding ding ding ding ding ding what do we know about the other competitor.

1890
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,000
We've got it together we've got it.

1891
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Sure.

1892
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,000
We've got it.

1893
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
I mean that's now that's echoing.

1894
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Look I didn't vote for them in the first round but it's you know it's it's hard to not respect

1895
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,000
the work.

1896
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Yeah.

1897
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
This substance is going to outweigh.

1898
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Well this is the problem Chuck E Cheese just has so much material.

1899
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Yes.

1900
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:43,000
That is available that we've poured over and it's hard to completely just give it to Calico

1901
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:49,000
based on speculation and I understand they beat the Country Bears speculation what their

1902
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:50,000
other work would be like.

1903
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:55,000
I mean Country Bears obviously are fantastic and that band is fantastic.

1904
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
But you know the kind of music that they play.

1905
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:00,000
The Country Bears music we don't hear we can guess what it's like.

1906
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:08,000
What does an alien on a tissue box guitar play with a Nosferatu and a washboard.

1907
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Yeah.

1908
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Who knows.

1909
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Yeah.

1910
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,000
They're like they're the craft work they're outsider.

1911
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Right.

1912
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:20,000
But yeah I think sadly much has to win.

1913
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
We still you get a monster either way.

1914
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
And I get a monster either way.

1915
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
A purple monster.

1916
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
All right.

1917
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,000
All right.

1918
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,000
I guess the corporations win this time.

1919
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Munch goes ahead.

1920
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Munch goes to the final round.

1921
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Wow.

1922
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Which leaves us with Sunny Eclipse versus the ET Blank.

1923
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
The Verona is actually a big.

1924
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Yeah I don't think it's a tough one.

1925
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
I like for ET.

1926
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
It is tough.

1927
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Huh.

1928
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Two wonderful aliens.

1929
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Yeah two wonderful aliens.

1930
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Two wonderful aliens.

1931
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:56,000
And I didn't vote for ET in the last round and it's tricky because some of these yeah

1932
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:03,000
they don't have the discography that the others do and it's hard because he has no discography.

1933
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Yeah that's true.

1934
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:07,000
We have eight original songs versus bing bing dong.

1935
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Let me let me bring this up.

1936
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Let me bring this up.

1937
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Does something have to be a pop song structure to rock.

1938
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Does it have to be a three four five minute pop song lounge song whatever.

1939
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:22,000
No because Marky Moon the television saw Marky Moon is 10 minutes long.

1940
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Well Marky Moon is a different story.

1941
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,000
That's pretty rockin.

1942
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:28,000
It is a rockin song but I'm saying even structureless.

1943
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:36,000
I'm saying even you know I don't think that on Broto Asoji they have three minute pop songs or even 10 minute pops and recordings.

1944
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Maybe they don't have musical recordings.

1945
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Music is just a full on expression of yourself as an artist.

1946
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,000
OK.

1947
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:48,000
So there is an even what I'm saying is that this is handicapped by this.

1948
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:52,000
The lack of rock and roll on the green planet.

1949
02:02:52,000 --> 02:03:05,000
So we have to take all of that idea out of our head here and just judge this little E.T. based on what he's doing and how we feel he's expressing himself because it's not a fair playing field here.

1950
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Do you know what I'm saying.

1951
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:11,000
There's no even chance that he would have like oh you know this is a session musician.

1952
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
He's been on 10 different.

1953
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:19,000
The Astro Oregon is a piece that he had to buy or build or have commissioned.

1954
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
But that's an expensive piece.

1955
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
That's of like that you know that's true.

1956
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:28,000
A touring musician could afford this E.T. this little Broto Asoji is just playing what's around.

1957
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Yeah he's playing the plants.

1958
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Right.

1959
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,000
He lives with.

1960
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Right.

1961
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:41,000
And Sunny Eclipse like Sunny Eclipse is obviously from a place that is very similar to our world because he is playing three minute song.

1962
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
He is playing three ish minute songs.

1963
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
They have chorus verse what have you.

1964
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:50,000
But the E.T. is just letting the music flow out of him.

1965
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:58,000
It's it's the most pure maybe music musician in this whole field.

1966
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Wow.

1967
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
That's what I would say about him.

1968
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,000
I haven't decided yet.

1969
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
I'm just saying that we can't.

1970
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
That's so so emotional.

1971
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,000
It makes me want to vote.

1972
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Yes kind of beautiful.

1973
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Thank you.

1974
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:25,000
I'm just trying to I'm trying to give him credit because he's he's he's he's not on the same just a little a little guy on a planet who doesn't even know what he has to offer like kind of like a like a boy lifting up a broom with the special power.

1975
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:29,000
He doesn't even know the full weight of he's like a little broom boy.

1976
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
He's like a little broom boy.

1977
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
I completely agree.

1978
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:49,000
So when you're making your decision now I want you to think about that and think about that yes on eclipse is the shinier object in this and we recognize more of what he's doing because it's so close to our world.

1979
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:59,000
But really examine in your heart what this little E.T. is he's hitting the glowing things.

1980
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:06,000
We think about how much he rocks in the context of his world of its world.

1981
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:19,000
I can't tell if now we all just say sunny clips after that emotion or if everyone has to make here's let's let's all write it down so we don't get influenced by each other.

1982
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Let's all choose what we're going to choose.

1983
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:29,000
And I'm going to write it down on my thing here and we'll show each other and then we'll do it.

1984
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:32,000
We have to don't want to say it out loud for the audio.

1985
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:39,000
I guess we will say it out loud but now this will be proof that we actually we're not lying or trying to like go against the others.

1986
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,000
You know what I mean.

1987
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
I just want this to be fully fully fair.

1988
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,000
OK.

1989
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,000
OK.

1990
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:45,000
OK.

1991
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:48,000
So what we'll do is five four three two one and then we'll all say it.

1992
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
I don't know why I said five and not three.

1993
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
It's build up the suspense.

1994
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,000
OK.

1995
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:54,000
All right.

1996
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Five five four three two one.

1997
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,000
You saw it.

1998
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Did we get swayed.

1999
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Wait what did you say.

2000
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:04,000
I said you're sunny.

2001
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,000
All right.

2002
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,000
And I'm fine with that.

2003
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:07,000
I think that's right.

2004
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:10,000
But yours you did influence that was so beautiful.

2005
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Thank you.

2006
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
And I was just I've been pulling for him the whole time.

2007
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,000
The other way.

2008
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Yeah.

2009
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,000
I said I hadn't decided.

2010
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,000
I said I was just trying to think about it.

2011
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,000
You got me.

2012
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:24,000
I think this is this this musician alone doesn't even know where to put the gifts that he has.

2013
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,000
Yeah.

2014
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:28,000
But maybe but maybe that was sunny once.

2015
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Maybe maybe sunny was on a similar plan.

2016
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
We don't know how he grew up.

2017
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Yeah.

2018
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:40,000
He might have had a really hard boiled life possible and he rose up to become a slightly paid attention to animatronic.

2019
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Yes.

2020
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Who is going to get screwed by cosmic ray like cosmic ray is going to shaft.

2021
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Oh you're right.

2022
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,000
You're right.

2023
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,000
He has the trouble.

2024
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,000
The tips in the door.

2025
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Well this is what I might have guessed.

2026
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
We were where I might have guessed that we'd land.

2027
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:04,000
And I like where we land for the final two the the the the top of the top which is Munch's Make Believe band versus sunny eclipse.

2028
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
I mean that's if you had to put money on it.

2029
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:10,000
I guess I thought five bear rugs would make it further and not lose immediately.

2030
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Yeah.

2031
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
But oh god here.

2032
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Well I don't know.

2033
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Do you know.

2034
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,000
I don't know either.

2035
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
I think I know.

2036
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Wow.

2037
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Do you have another speech in you Michael to sway us.

2038
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:25,000
I think I do one speech per episode.

2039
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Oh OK.

2040
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,000
So you're tapped out.

2041
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
I don't know if I have a speech in me.

2042
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Yeah I don't know.

2043
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:34,000
It's band versus solo versus solo which you can't with some supporting.

2044
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:37,000
It's all acts that I've voted against.

2045
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Yeah.

2046
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:42,000
And yet I'm but I still like that I have no I take no offense to either of these.

2047
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
I think these are these are some fine artists.

2048
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Chuck E. Cheese the underdog in this case a big company but compared to the Walt Disney company the underdog.

2049
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Uh huh.

2050
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Well and look there these this band is getting removed everywhere.

2051
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
There's only one sunny.

2052
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Yeah.

2053
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:07,000
And they thankfully there are so many more things the Disney has to deal with that they probably are just forgetting to get rid of.

2054
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Yeah.

2055
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Sunny eclipse as opposed to the active extermination of munches make believe band.

2056
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:17,000
This is a corporate priorities to get rid of them.

2057
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
But that's so more of an underdog.

2058
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,000
Absolutely.

2059
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Yes.

2060
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
No I'm saying I think it's I think it's terrible what's happened to them.

2061
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,000
I think it's a real shame.

2062
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,000
I agree.

2063
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
I will say they're taking the munches.

2064
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Their body of work both of the bodies of work.

2065
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:33,000
I mean sunny eclipse is it is all killer no filler.

2066
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:36,000
No I'm not talking about the name of that sum forty one album.

2067
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:41,000
I mean that is the phrase to say like the songs are all solid and good.

2068
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:45,000
They're of a piece and there's not really a clunker in there.

2069
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:46,000
There's ones we like better than others.

2070
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Chuck E. Cheese has a sprawling.

2071
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:52,000
I guess it's kind of Beatles rolling Beatles has like 10 years of great stuff.

2072
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Rolling Stones has like 10 15 years of great stuff.

2073
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
But then you get the later stuff and it's like.

2074
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:02,000
According to music critics their best stuff has been in the last five years.

2075
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Is that true.

2076
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Well it's just always like if you're an old if you're an old music critic you're like Stones better than ever.

2077
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Well as they do they're boring like noodly album.

2078
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Yeah.

2079
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Yeah.

2080
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Bang.

2081
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
They've never been better than bigger bang.

2082
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,000
That is who said that.

2083
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
No one's critics do.

2084
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
I don't like it.

2085
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
But what does the on winner say about.

2086
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Who do you think is publishing these ancient music.

2087
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Yeah that's true.

2088
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:36,000
But yeah you would say it's sometimes it's sometimes it's interesting like the Quentin Tarantino idea to make just like 10 good movies or whatever.

2089
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Like is that better.

2090
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Would we rather have artists do 50 things and half of them are good or would you rather have the artists do you know a couple of things and they're perfect or they're amazing.

2091
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Like that's I think a question.

2092
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:53,000
That's what I'm struggling with right now is I think I know but that's what I'm thinking about.

2093
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Well you want a majority of that body of work to be about pizza and soda.

2094
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
That's certainly what you want either way.

2095
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Yes.

2096
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Or the presence of a toppings bar.

2097
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Yes.

2098
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,000
You want it.

2099
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:06,000
They do both of these acts do sing about the food a little bit.

2100
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Yeah.

2101
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
There's there are topping bars and play both here.

2102
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
That's kind of tragic.

2103
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:15,000
No toppings bar right now but Sonny does he talk about the toppings bar.

2104
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Maybe not.

2105
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,000
I don't think he talks about the toppings bar.

2106
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:20,000
I don't think Chuck is like hey what's happens by.

2107
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Cosmic rays.

2108
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:25,000
I like that there's a full universe fleshed out there unseen.

2109
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:28,000
There's the space angels there's the cosmic ray.

2110
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:29,000
We know his boss.

2111
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
We know his support system.

2112
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Yeah.

2113
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Support system.

2114
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:38,000
I really like that he's related to the customs agent from Star Tours in Japan.

2115
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Yes.

2116
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Officer Zizek.

2117
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:43,000
That it ties together a global mythology.

2118
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:47,000
But there's so much universe.

2119
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Chuck E. Cheese.

2120
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Of course.

2121
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,000
You didn't.

2122
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
You used to be able to travel a lot.

2123
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
You know ease of seeing them.

2124
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
I mean you got the special.

2125
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,000
It goes both ways.

2126
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:58,000
It's special.

2127
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
You can only see Sonny Klitz in one place.

2128
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:05,000
But back in the day used to probably only go a mile or two.

2129
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:08,000
You know to your local Chuck E. Cheese establishment.

2130
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Yeah.

2131
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Right.

2132
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,000
It's a special thing.

2133
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Is like that's again.

2134
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,000
There's yeah.

2135
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Do you can you consider it being special.

2136
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Is that better.

2137
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:16,000
It's also inconvenient.

2138
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Well it is inconvenient.

2139
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:18,000
That's true.

2140
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Is you know Sonny refers to his we think that maybe cosmic rays and treating him the best.

2141
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:28,000
The business owner in this case is Chuck E. He's in the band.

2142
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Right.

2143
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:35,000
I've watched bar rescues where the bar owner goes up and performs and John does not like

2144
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:36,000
that.

2145
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,000
It's a special thing.

2146
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
What's the underground wonder bar.

2147
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,000
I don't know.

2148
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:44,000
That's the Chicago one with the owner and her son running it.

2149
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:49,000
And she does like new agey like just unlistening a bold new age kind of stuff.

2150
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:50,000
So it's terrible.

2151
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:55,000
And they they moved from somewhere to they had to get out of their old space and they

2152
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:58,000
moved to somewhere where the rent is like five to ten times more.

2153
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,000
It was a bad decision.

2154
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Every part of it was a bad decision.

2155
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:04,000
And then they moved to a place where they had to get out of their old space.

2156
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:09,000
He's looking at things all the time and talking about looks and everything that he's

2157
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,000
looking for.

2158
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:15,000
And he drew Mas someday and he's like you know, this brings me back to theawful.

2159
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:16,000
The wife kind of sounds upset.

2160
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,800
Getting the audience to like buy put put people in especially the chezcha stuff in

2161
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:22,000
Europe with all the Tim Hiddens shit suck shit.

2162
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,000
So that's why we spent a few hours doing that.

2163
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Neither of these I guess they're wondered how these were handled by him.

2164
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
It's a sad story especially when we get letters coming out.

2165
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:32,900
And the owner of the band was a guy with private files who's found them and Target

2166
02:12:32,900 --> 02:12:33,900
his nasal ness and whininess.

2167
02:12:33,900 --> 02:12:35,900
He's kind of a Donald Fagan.

2168
02:12:35,900 --> 02:12:36,900
That's true.

2169
02:12:36,900 --> 02:12:37,900
Yeah, that's true.

2170
02:12:37,900 --> 02:12:41,900
Chuck E. Cheese is Donald Fagan and I'm not going to argue against a Donald Fagan

2171
02:12:41,900 --> 02:12:42,900
type.

2172
02:12:42,900 --> 02:12:43,900
Yeah.

2173
02:12:43,900 --> 02:12:45,900
And look the band we haven't even we haven't you know, we've talked about him before but

2174
02:12:45,900 --> 02:12:47,900
Helen Helen is a great singer too.

2175
02:12:47,900 --> 02:12:53,900
Helen Henny and she's you know, she's been slighted a lot in the various Chuck E. Cheese

2176
02:12:53,900 --> 02:12:54,900
media.

2177
02:12:54,900 --> 02:12:55,900
Yeah.

2178
02:12:55,900 --> 02:12:59,900
What does she say in that movie?

2179
02:12:59,900 --> 02:13:00,900
Yeah, I can't remember.

2180
02:13:00,900 --> 02:13:01,900
But she's one of the guys.

2181
02:13:01,900 --> 02:13:04,900
Oh yeah, she's just one of the guys.

2182
02:13:04,900 --> 02:13:05,900
Yeah.

2183
02:13:05,900 --> 02:13:08,900
And it's unfair to her but she's got a great voice.

2184
02:13:08,900 --> 02:13:09,900
She's got a great presence.

2185
02:13:09,900 --> 02:13:10,900
She's only gotten better.

2186
02:13:10,900 --> 02:13:12,900
I think the newer Helens are superior.

2187
02:13:12,900 --> 02:13:13,900
I agree.

2188
02:13:13,900 --> 02:13:16,900
She's been fleshed out.

2189
02:13:16,900 --> 02:13:20,900
So it's tricky because there's it's a sunny is that sunny is it's tough here because he's

2190
02:13:20,900 --> 02:13:26,900
just one alien and there's so many good performers.

2191
02:13:26,900 --> 02:13:28,900
Is it does it maybe by going Chuck?

2192
02:13:28,900 --> 02:13:36,900
Does it nod to Chuck E. Cheese's ancestors as we all like, you know, we need our ancestors

2193
02:13:36,900 --> 02:13:39,900
for us to be here today and we have to honor them.

2194
02:13:39,900 --> 02:13:40,900
Right.

2195
02:13:40,900 --> 02:13:47,900
Isn't when they literally are made of the metal bones of other competitors in this competition.

2196
02:13:47,900 --> 02:13:52,900
Do you honor the whole and Chuck E. Cheese who produced so many great artists that we've

2197
02:13:52,900 --> 02:13:56,900
discussed over the course of the last seven hours or whatever it's been.

2198
02:13:56,900 --> 02:14:01,900
Do we honor all of their work by choosing Munch's Make Believe Band?

2199
02:14:01,900 --> 02:14:03,900
It's an interesting point.

2200
02:14:03,900 --> 02:14:07,900
Yes, it's the history of rock and roll is honored.

2201
02:14:07,900 --> 02:14:13,900
The history of fake rock and roll is honored when you choose Munch's Make Believe Band.

2202
02:14:13,900 --> 02:14:14,900
Oh, and you know what?

2203
02:14:14,900 --> 02:14:21,900
And it's and look, sunny is firmly lounge and whereas Munch's Make Believe Band rocks.

2204
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:23,900
There's no argument against that.

2205
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:24,900
There is no argument against that's true.

2206
02:14:24,900 --> 02:14:28,900
I mean, we all remember there obviously like walking on the sun in the 90s lounge.

2207
02:14:28,900 --> 02:14:30,900
There was a lounge period.

2208
02:14:30,900 --> 02:14:31,900
The song Tangerine Speedo.

2209
02:14:31,900 --> 02:14:33,900
We all remember from the late 90s.

2210
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:34,900
Very loungy.

2211
02:14:34,900 --> 02:14:40,900
Yeah, there was a short little lounge like when the British rock band like the Kinks

2212
02:14:40,900 --> 02:14:43,900
and stuff would do that like music hall that.

2213
02:14:43,900 --> 02:14:44,900
Yeah, sure.

2214
02:14:44,900 --> 02:14:45,900
Yeah.

2215
02:14:45,900 --> 02:14:50,900
But Munch's Make Believe Band rocks.

2216
02:14:50,900 --> 02:14:53,900
And is this not the fake rock music?

2217
02:14:53,900 --> 02:14:54,900
Final Four.

2218
02:14:54,900 --> 02:14:55,900
Yeah.

2219
02:14:55,900 --> 02:14:56,900
Maybe we've landed there.

2220
02:14:56,900 --> 02:14:57,900
Yeah.

2221
02:14:57,900 --> 02:14:58,900
You want to say it?

2222
02:14:58,900 --> 02:14:59,900
I think Munch's Make Believe Band.

2223
02:14:59,900 --> 02:15:00,900
Munch's Make Believe Band.

2224
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:02,900
Munch's Make Believe Band and you.

2225
02:15:02,900 --> 02:15:03,900
You've got it.

2226
02:15:03,900 --> 02:15:04,900
Yay.

2227
02:15:04,900 --> 02:15:05,900
You got it.

2228
02:15:05,900 --> 02:15:06,900
We got it.

2229
02:15:06,900 --> 02:15:09,900
We won the award or whatever this is.

2230
02:15:09,900 --> 02:15:10,900
The competition.

2231
02:15:10,900 --> 02:15:14,900
If there's a free meal, I'll be there.

2232
02:15:14,900 --> 02:15:18,900
Make sure to clean my head out with Windex.

2233
02:15:18,900 --> 02:15:21,900
Spray some Lysol in my empty head.

2234
02:15:21,900 --> 02:15:24,900
Don't just do it once a year.

2235
02:15:24,900 --> 02:15:25,900
Once a fiscal year.

2236
02:15:25,900 --> 02:15:27,900
Do it once a month, please.

2237
02:15:27,900 --> 02:15:30,900
You knew we'd beat that ugly alien mug.

2238
02:15:30,900 --> 02:15:31,900
Yeah.

2239
02:15:31,900 --> 02:15:33,900
We stomped him like a bug.

2240
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:37,900
We'll take care of him or any other competitors.

2241
02:15:37,900 --> 02:15:40,900
Yeah, we're on delivery apps as two restaurants.

2242
02:15:40,900 --> 02:15:41,900
What of it?

2243
02:15:41,900 --> 02:15:42,900
Yeah, that's not the end.

2244
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:43,900
We'll make it.

2245
02:15:43,900 --> 02:15:44,900
We'll make it.

2246
02:15:44,900 --> 02:15:45,900
We're doing it forever.

2247
02:15:45,900 --> 02:15:47,900
It's part of the business model now.

2248
02:15:47,900 --> 02:15:50,900
Oh, what have we done?

2249
02:15:50,900 --> 02:15:51,900
We've awarded this to it.

2250
02:15:51,900 --> 02:15:54,900
That's what I was going to say is, look, I think Sonny is a good guy.

2251
02:15:54,900 --> 02:15:55,900
Yeah.

2252
02:15:55,900 --> 02:15:57,900
I think maybe is Chuck a little toxic?

2253
02:15:57,900 --> 02:16:03,900
Well, our favorite Chuck E. Cheese is the original one or the ones he was still kind

2254
02:16:03,900 --> 02:16:04,900
of like that.

2255
02:16:04,900 --> 02:16:05,900
He was really surly.

2256
02:16:05,900 --> 02:16:07,900
He was really shady.

2257
02:16:07,900 --> 02:16:09,900
He was less shady when we were kids.

2258
02:16:09,900 --> 02:16:14,900
The original version was really shady, which I do think is the best version.

2259
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:19,900
But yeah, now he's like kind of happy go lucky.

2260
02:16:19,900 --> 02:16:21,900
And they've gotten rid of that.

2261
02:16:21,900 --> 02:16:22,900
He's now a mouse.

2262
02:16:22,900 --> 02:16:23,900
He's not a rat.

2263
02:16:23,900 --> 02:16:24,900
Yeah, yeah.

2264
02:16:24,900 --> 02:16:25,900
He's shaken off the rat qualities.

2265
02:16:25,900 --> 02:16:28,900
So I guess you have to take all of the Chucks in.

2266
02:16:28,900 --> 02:16:31,900
And, you know, like, look, Chuck is just an unfortunate look.

2267
02:16:31,900 --> 02:16:36,900
There's as with, you know, Mike Love is a kind of toxic presence in a band that I love,

2268
02:16:36,900 --> 02:16:38,900
but I still find a lot to enjoy about Mike Love.

2269
02:16:38,900 --> 02:16:40,900
And I think Chuck is the Mike Love.

2270
02:16:40,900 --> 02:16:42,900
He's the guy who doesn't play an instrument.

2271
02:16:42,900 --> 02:16:48,900
He doesn't add to the musical blend in the way that favors hats.

2272
02:16:48,900 --> 02:16:52,900
Yes, he's a big hat guy, probably balding underneath.

2273
02:16:52,900 --> 02:16:53,900
Yeah, for sure.

2274
02:16:53,900 --> 02:16:57,900
But it's really I think this is let's let's just Chuck's there.

2275
02:16:57,900 --> 02:17:02,900
And that's but we know that like Mike Love, if he was here in person, he'd make a really

2276
02:17:02,900 --> 02:17:03,900
bizarre speech.

2277
02:17:03,900 --> 02:17:04,900
Oh, yeah.

2278
02:17:04,900 --> 02:17:09,900
He would he would be so mean to and Sonny Eclipse has always been too chicken shit to

2279
02:17:09,900 --> 02:17:12,900
get on stage with Munch's Make Believe Band.

2280
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:18,900
I challenge the fucking I challenge the four little shavers.

2281
02:17:18,900 --> 02:17:19,900
Get up here.

2282
02:17:19,900 --> 02:17:21,900
Any I'll whoop their ass.

2283
02:17:21,900 --> 02:17:22,900
Yeah.

2284
02:17:22,900 --> 02:17:23,900
Sorry.

2285
02:17:23,900 --> 02:17:24,900
I've been on a pizza fast.

2286
02:17:24,900 --> 02:17:26,900
I guess I'm a little nuts right now.

2287
02:17:26,900 --> 02:17:29,900
Sonny plays to warm crowds in Orlando every day.

2288
02:17:29,900 --> 02:17:33,900
Come to the mean streets of Wilmington, Delaware and try that shit.

2289
02:17:33,900 --> 02:17:35,900
David Crosby tweets.

2290
02:17:35,900 --> 02:17:36,900
I hate Chuck E.

2291
02:17:36,900 --> 02:17:37,900
Cheese.

2292
02:17:39,900 --> 02:17:41,900
But it's not like it's a shared victory.

2293
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:43,900
This is about Munch's Make Believe Band.

2294
02:17:43,900 --> 02:17:44,900
We love Munch.

2295
02:17:44,900 --> 02:17:45,900
Yeah, we do.

2296
02:17:45,900 --> 02:17:46,900
Really is.

2297
02:17:46,900 --> 02:17:48,900
I played Helen Henney.

2298
02:17:48,900 --> 02:17:49,900
Yes.

2299
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:50,900
Yeah.

2300
02:17:50,900 --> 02:17:51,900
Yeah.

2301
02:17:51,900 --> 02:17:53,900
And we've talked at length about them, but we will talk about at length more.

2302
02:17:53,900 --> 02:17:55,900
I'm sure maybe soon.

2303
02:17:55,900 --> 02:17:56,900
I don't know.

2304
02:17:56,900 --> 02:17:58,900
But yeah, it's it's too much.

2305
02:17:58,900 --> 02:18:01,900
There's too much good stuff going on.

2306
02:18:01,900 --> 02:18:02,900
That's right.

2307
02:18:02,900 --> 02:18:03,900
Yeah.

2308
02:18:03,900 --> 02:18:10,900
And if Muppet ripoff monster and an Italian chef and a dog and a bird and a toxic rat

2309
02:18:10,900 --> 02:18:17,900
can come together to create decades of great music, which is mostly being eliminated from Chuck E.

2310
02:18:17,900 --> 02:18:21,900
Cheese locations, then isn't there hope for all of us?

2311
02:18:21,900 --> 02:18:22,900
I think so.

2312
02:18:22,900 --> 02:18:23,900
That was beautiful.

2313
02:18:23,900 --> 02:18:25,900
I think I think that's where it's where it needed to land.

2314
02:18:25,900 --> 02:18:26,900
I'm happy with it, though.

2315
02:18:26,900 --> 02:18:28,900
I voted against them.

2316
02:18:28,900 --> 02:18:31,900
Congratulations Munch's Make Believe Band.

2322
02:18:53,900 --> 02:18:54,900
Yes.

2323
02:18:54,900 --> 02:18:57,900
We will be back with more bullshit.

2324
02:18:57,900 --> 02:18:58,900
We'll be back.

2325
02:18:58,900 --> 02:18:59,900
We'll win.

2326
02:18:59,900 --> 02:19:01,900
Think of a new contest we can win.

2327
02:19:01,900 --> 02:19:02,900
Yeah.
