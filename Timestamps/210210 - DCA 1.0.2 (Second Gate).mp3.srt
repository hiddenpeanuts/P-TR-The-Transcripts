1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,500
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate,

3
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,520
where it's time for us to sacrament go

4
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,760
back to California Adventure.

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,800
We've got some more Dwar takes,

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,080
and we still have to talk about the big bear.

7
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,460
I'm Jason Sheridan joined as always by Scott Gardner.

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,720
Hang on.

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,300
Didn't we talk about the big bear already?

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,040
Yeah, we talked about the bear.

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,760
I'm here, and what happened to our names?

12
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,440
What happened to our California names?

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,480
Stop there.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,600
What happened to those California based names for us?

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,920
You know, I wore out all my puns,

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,040
and I warned you they were not good, and here we are.

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,520
Okay, well, it's the second gate.

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,040
I hope people won't be upset

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,960
that the puns were not flying as fast.

20
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,160
We'll try to make up for it as the episode goes on.

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,360
Yeah, you know, I do actually,

22
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,880
I have a pun based challenge to present later in the episode.

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,440
So we can look forward to some puns there,

24
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,840
and we'll have to think on our feet for that one.

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,720
Okay, I'll get ready.

26
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,400
You know what I think is nice,

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,560
we could say at the top is that by here,

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,160
so this is a two parter as you probably know.

29
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,000
We bit off more than we could chew in DCA 1.0,

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,120
so we had to do DCA 1.0.2 here on the second gate,

31
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,800
and we'll cover everything that we didn't talk about

32
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,800
about the original California adventure kooky vibes.

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,120
But it's nice that we can do it here on the second gate

34
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,080
because it can follow the music, the second gate theme,

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,600
which is very early DCA inspired.

36
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,800
I guess it's kind of like California screaming

37
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
more than anything.

38
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,880
Yes, it was inspired by California screaming,

39
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,800
I'm trying to think, and walking around

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,440
and walking around the Grand Californian.

41
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,120
That was my inspiration.

42
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,720
The actual music body itself is very like,

43
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,480
you're hearing the guitar,

44
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,640
I guess it's called Flamenco guitar,

45
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,680
but like around, I don't know,

46
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,280
walking around near the hotel,

47
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,120
and then you have the countdown.

48
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,560
Like resorty smooth jazz kind of,

49
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,160
which I may be forgetting that especially

50
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,640
in that Napa area, it was all kind of like,

51
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,560
yeah, like lame acoustic jazz for a long time.

52
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,400
Maybe still is, I don't remember what they play now.

53
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,960
It still is in places is my memory of it,

54
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,880
which has been so long since I've roamed that area.

55
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,920
It feels like forever ago that I would go into

56
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,920
just like whitewater snacks, get a large drink,

57
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,760
and open a laptop over by the,

58
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,120
like the shady area of the pool.

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,400
It's not by the pool, but it's like tucked away

60
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,280
by whitewater snacks.

61
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,200
You know what I'm talking about.

62
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,800
You're fondly recalling when you would go work there.

63
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,160
That's what you're flushing to for it nostalgically.

64
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,520
Yes, and I would rack up fast passes for a few hours,

65
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,440
and then go on a bunch of stuff and leave.

66
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,560
The greatest thing you can do in your 30s.

67
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,360
Well, that's one thing that California Adventure

68
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,200
succeeded in is setting up great places to work

69
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,640
and do commerce.

70
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,600
Not for, I mean, the hotel is another,

71
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,680
obviously the hotel is not in this.

72
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,360
There's a lot of probably sectioning off

73
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,600
that we have to do.

74
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,480
Well, this is, I mean, look,

75
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,280
the California Adventure episodes are really a lot like,

76
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,400
you know, your Mandalorian Disney Plus show

77
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,720
in the sense that that's really just

78
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,720
a starting off point for 10 other series slash episodes.

79
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,360
It's not just Mandalorian.

80
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,800
You're gonna get the Bad Batch.

81
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,680
You're gonna get Ahsoka, and for this,

82
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,680
you're gonna get episodes about steps in time eventually.

83
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,880
Yeah.

84
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,960
The California Hyperion show that is kind of a nightmare.

85
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,520
Yeah, we did not miss.

86
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,360
Soap opera bistro, et cetera.

87
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,440
Yeah, we did not miss Soap Opera Bistro.

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,360
We're not fools.

89
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,600
We know about soap opera bistro.

90
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,280
We talked about it with Matt Corley, right?

91
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,680
Yeah, we could have.

92
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,000
But it's probably its own thing, I think.

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,560
Yeah, it'll be its own thing.

94
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,040
What'll happen at the end of this episode

95
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,160
is that there's a big, there's like a figure

96
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,920
and you can't quite see their face and who is it?

97
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,480
That must imply some adventures for the 1.0.3,

98
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,400
and then they take off their hood and it's Caliphia.

99
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,120
It's Queen Caliphia, star of golden dreams,

100
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,960
which is also, which is what we were gonna do.

101
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,840
We bumped it because of this overflow that we had.

102
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,880
So Caliphia's day will come someday in the future.

103
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,720
So the door opens and it's Queen Caliphia, spoiler alert.

104
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,360
That's what happens at the end of this.

105
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,200
Sorry, but just don't tweet about it.

106
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,360
Let people go in surprised.

107
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,880
Even though we're saying it in the middle of the episode.

108
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,720
So I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.

109
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,560
Yes, yeah.

110
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,400
I apologize.

111
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,640
The tweeting would be the problem.

112
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,040
And like Queen Caliphia is standing in the corner

113
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,800
of the room like the end of Blair Witch.

114
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,400
And you're like, oh shit, is she okay?

115
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,120
And she's not.

116
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,640
She's not.

117
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,800
She's not okay, but she will have her own spin-off as well.

118
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,840
I think on Disney Plus, I think.

119
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,800
Yeah. I assume by the end of this.

120
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,200
We're so proud to be streaming.

121
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Finally bringing Park's favorite Queen Caliphia

122
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,200
to the Disney Plus screen, the mid-size to the mid-size screen.

123
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,360
Yes, and I can- Just need one.

124
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,400
Yeah, go ahead, Jason.

125
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,520
Oh, I was gonna say, I can only assume the villain

126
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,320
of her show will be like the main character

127
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,400
from There Will Be Blood or like any number of oil barons

128
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,400
or water baron freaks that really ran California

129
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,360
into the ground.

130
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,480
Yeah, that's true.

131
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,800
Yeah.

132
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,720
Yeah, just a series of those who don't represent

133
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,520
or who don't like respect the gift that she gave us.

134
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,000
The great, the California-shaped mass,

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,880
as we established in the last one,

136
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,960
California Adventure was really glorified,

137
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,280
just the shape of California,

138
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,640
which came to Caliphia in a dream

139
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,160
or she went into a trance and then like woke up

140
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,560
in a pool of her own blood and that was the shape

141
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,920
and she knew that had to be the shape of California.

142
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,800
Robert Wolfgang, oh, I'm home, thank God.

143
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,480
You were there and you were there.

144
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,320
Wait, are you, Robert and Wolfgang being the restaurateurs?

145
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,280
Yeah, being the restaurateurs who got the F out of there

146
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,560
really fast.

147
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,760
It took me a sec, Robert, yeah, it was a Robert Mondavi thing

148
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,680
and a Wolfgang Puck thing and they didn't stick around.

149
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,280
It was a tough first year.

150
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,520
A lot of bad stuff happened, general bad tourism.

151
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,200
You know, this, as we've said, this was,

152
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,240
the park opened in 2001 and it didn't meet

153
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,240
the attendance that it was supposed to,

154
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,120
fell short for the first six months.

155
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,880
It was like always bad, but then in September,

156
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,440
I feel like it took another big turn

157
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,400
and Jason, is there like anything you wanna put this

158
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,840
in the context of, like something that might've been

159
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,880
happening around that time?

160
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,000
Now, I did look into this

161
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,360
because it didn't come up last episode

162
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,840
of the tourism downturn after the September 11th attacks

163
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,080
because I was trying to do the math of like,

164
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,680
there were about a little over one million off

165
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,840
for Disneyland estimated attendance

166
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,640
and two million off for California Adventure.

167
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,920
I was like, well, wait, if the tourism downturn happened,

168
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,720
you know, October, November, December,

169
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,000
second half of September,

170
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,360
would that make up for their estimates?

171
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,120
But I was reading, Mouse Planet was doing a retrospective

172
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,680
of DCA and their number had it right before

173
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,480
the September 11th attacks, DCA's daily numbers,

174
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,600
attendance numbers were at like 4,500 people a day.

175
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,840
4,500?

176
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,840
4,500 and they were estimating much more than that.

177
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,120
They were estimating close to 20,000 a day.

178
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,160
Wow.

179
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,840
So you were saying you cannot blame 9-11 necessarily

180
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,320
on the failure of California Adventure,

181
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,040
which I guess I would agree with it as-

182
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,240
Well, certainly the tourism downturn didn't help,

183
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,200
but it was already on like a crashing rocket ship,

184
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,640
way down even before that.

185
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,080
And yeah, with the restaurateurs getting out of there

186
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,600
and they're like desperately,

187
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,680
they got the who wants to be a millionaire attraction

188
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,560
in there and then they moved the

189
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,600
Main Street Electrical Parade over.

190
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,040
So like they started patching it in like 2002,

191
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,440
but like Bugs Land eventually comes along.

192
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,200
Well, don't forget the first patch.

193
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,320
You did have the patch of the Rock in the Bay

194
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,320
concert series, which we touched on a little bit.

195
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,480
I think in the first summer they got that going,

196
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,280
which wait, now I gotta find the Yesterland for that.

197
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,360
This is one of the, you know, it's like the pool

198
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,320
of performers who came and did concerts

199
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,720
in that first summer.

200
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,520
It's not unlike the people who play at Epcot,

201
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,200
like that are always in the Epcot circuit.

202
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,480
Right.

203
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,480
But just seeing it all condensed into one list of bands,

204
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,680
you just, you never have more like asterisks

205
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,680
and featureings and withs and the review featuring with,

206
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,080
like there's so many qualifications to,

207
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,240
like if you look at the list here,

208
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,560
the Beach Boys featuring Mike Love and Bruce Johnston,

209
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,240
The Temptations review featuring Dennis Edwards,

210
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,000
David Clayton Thomas with Blood, Sweat and Tears,

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,320
Herman's new, Herman starring Peter Noon, Starship,

212
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,840
featuring Mickey Thomas, The Turtles featuring Flo and Eddie,

213
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,040
The Monkey starring Davy Jones and Mickey Dolan.

214
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,280
It's like, it's a really complicated rubric to figure.

215
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,520
So who's there?

216
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,400
Like who's available is what this feels like.

217
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,280
Oh, who's available?

218
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,680
Who isn't mad at somebody?

219
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,320
Who wasn't sued out of a band?

220
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,840
Who wasn't, yeah, who's not in rehab?

221
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,600
There's a lot of different things.

222
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,480
Who was paid off to just get their share of money

223
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,520
and doesn't have to tour

224
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,600
because the others can't stand them.

225
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,680
Like it could be any number of things that happen

226
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,280
when you're dealing with bands here

227
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,400
that have been around for what, 40 plus years at that point.

228
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,480
Some shyster just come along

229
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,120
and collect a bunch of doo-wop band names.

230
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,000
I know that's a thing that happened at some point.

231
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,640
Some guys like, I'm just gonna buy five of these

232
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,920
and nobody will ever know.

233
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,160
And if I get sued, all right, it's not the Temptations.

234
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,560
It's the original Temptations review, done deal.

235
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,760
Can't stop me from that.

236
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,880
Those are words in the English language.

237
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,880
Yes, real Ghostbusters, original Ghostbusters

238
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,280
sort of conflict.

239
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,680
Right, right.

240
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,240
The most confusing ones.

241
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,640
Anyway, this is what they considered

242
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,040
summer's hottest sounds.

243
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,720
Was a lot of- Summer's hottest sounds in 2002 or 2001.

244
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,000
Herman's Hermits.

245
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,320
Starring Peter Noon.

246
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,200
Starring Peter Noon.

247
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,920
Look, I've seen Herman's Hermits.

248
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,160
I've seen Peter Noon at September Fest

249
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
in Schaumburgill and all that.

250
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,280
So I know all the songs.

251
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,720
I'm just saying, I think it's-

252
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,240
September Fest. I wonder if it's the hottest sound.

253
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,720
Oh yeah. Who needs a Summer Fest

254
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,160
when you got September Fest?

255
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,960
Yeah, the September Fest, you know,

256
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,680
they would bring in the hottest acts like Peter Noon.

257
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,160
I guess- Maybe Davy Jones one year.

258
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,200
I guess this is the- Solo Davy Jones.

259
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,080
Our parents to spend, like our parents age

260
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,560
to get there and spend money,

261
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,040
but it does feel like a misfire,

262
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,600
much like the Soap Opera Bistro

263
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,840
and much of the Hard Rock Park's initial offerings of like,

264
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,160
do you know what teenagers like?

265
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,520
Like you couldn't get a couple of ska bands

266
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,080
from Orange County.

267
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,000
Yeah, I don't know a lot of-

268
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,640
I'm trying to look at the list here of like,

269
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,200
who is the most expensive band to get on this list?

270
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,080
Is it Mike Love and the Beach Boys?

271
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,480
Oddly, I think they could be,

272
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,640
except that they're also such a state fair, like,

273
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,520
like shouldn't the Bangles be more expensive

274
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,320
because they've had hits more recently?

275
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
You think?

276
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,960
But I don't know.

277
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,440
Yeah, it's- Some of the names are promoted just to like,

278
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,240
they're like, why pull out Peter Noon's name?

279
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,440
That's just to like, that's like extra like SEO.

280
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,080
It's like maybe, all right,

281
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,400
do you kind of remember what Herman's Hermits was?

282
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,800
Maybe you saw this name at one point in time, 40 years ago.

283
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,000
Does that help jog your memory?

284
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,800
Yeah, that might be what that's about.

285
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,200
Like going, what's that? Oh, Peter.

286
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,400
Yeah, yeah. Like you get an extra 2% of people interested

287
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,040
because they recognize Peter's name and not the band's name.

288
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,240
Now, Mickey Thomas is because he's the only guy from

289
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,160
Jefferson Airplane in the band, yes?

290
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,160
Not Airplane, he's post Airplane.

291
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,880
He's pure Jefferson Starship.

292
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,640
Yeah, because he's like a yeah, he's a later day.

293
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,320
He's when they got sort of like 80s rock shlocky.

294
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,240
But they do, so but they do Jefferson Airplane songs

295
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,720
in the Starship sets.

296
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,400
They do, yeah, but that's still, you know, they did that

297
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,760
when he came on in 1980.

298
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,880
No, he had nothing to do with with any of that.

299
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,840
No, but that's like-

300
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,080
Well, I'm confused.

301
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

302
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,320
No, it's you have to like draw a lot of arrows and connections

303
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,800
all over all over this band list to really understand it.

304
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,880
Because yeah, OK, anyway, sorry to bore everybody with that.

305
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,320
Yeah, well, it's as a oh, who's bored?

306
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,440
Saying classic rock name,

307
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,560
saying the name is classic rock bands is thrilling.

308
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,360
I was about to explain, I go, well, Jefferson Airplane

309
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,960
became Jefferson Starship, which became Starship.

310
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,280
I was explaining that to the audience,

311
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,640
but I really thought he was involved in the first incarnation of the band

312
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,520
because they still play the Jefferson Airplane hits.

313
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,120
Yeah, no, he's the later guy because he sang the song Fooled Around

314
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,360
and Fell in Love like he was in the Elvin Bishop band.

315
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,360
I think when Jefferson Airplane was still in their early days,

316
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,360
I'm falling asleep in my own sentence.

317
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,600
I took a dive around Elvin Bishop.

318
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,440
And besides, why are we getting hung up on these bands

319
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,680
when there's another band to get hung up on?

320
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,080
That's right, everybody.

321
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,320
There's more Jim Belushi and the Sacred Hearts information to go through.

322
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,200
Just what you're doing.

323
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,920
We're going to get some gripes about too much Jim Belushi talk.

324
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,080
I'm sure of that at this point.

325
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,920
But so just skip ahead.

326
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,280
I'll say 45 minutes.

327
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,880
That'll be my rough guess if you don't want to hear this.

328
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,040
Look, we got a lot of unpleasant Caesar salads to talk about.

329
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,120
We got to hit.

330
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,520
We got the phrase Broadway dipping sauces will be used very soon.

331
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,760
So if that's what you're if you're in it for unpleasant food, skip ahead.

332
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,680
If you want to hear about unpleasant music, stay with us here.

333
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,680
So, Mike, you were saying that you were upset that you couldn't find

334
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,640
any photographs of any of the concerts by Jim Belushi and the Sacred Hearts

335
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,400
at video video video.

336
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,000
OK, I saw a photo or two.

337
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,280
OK, OK, because there are photos.

338
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,840
Thanks to getty images.

339
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,000
Just let me flip through these.

340
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,720
Here he's kind of like shaking his tush at a back.

341
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,920
I have not seen that. I have not seen that picture.

342
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,360
Now you have. And it's beautiful.

343
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,760
A couple of the sign is behind him.

344
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,720
Here he is with some sweat on his shirt.

345
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,440
And here he is with much sweat on his shirt.

346
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,400
The the other Jim Belushi things.

347
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,680
OK, so Jason, you were correct

348
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,600
that he is an investor in the House of Blues.

349
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,000
He's not like one of the primaries, I don't think, but he's in the mix.

350
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,640
I wanted to correct that one from the last episode.

351
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,200
He and Aerosmith were among some of the early.

352
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,480
Wow. All.

353
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

354
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,360
So some of the boy to be a fly on those walls, huh?

355
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,680
Walls.

356
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,880
He think they ever see any walls.

357
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,360
And Jim on the harmonica.

358
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,560
Oh, boy, I hope I hope and I hope it went for I hope single solos went for

359
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,680
it. I hope one of them did half an hour and then traded it

360
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,160
to the other who did 45 minutes.

361
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,840
Man, if we're in the if I'm in the pit at the Aerosmith,

362
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,280
this is our wild Las Vegas residency and they bring Jim up on stage.

363
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,800
Oh, my God, it meltdown and Belushi is coming out.

364
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,720
Um, yeah, well, something to give you hope, an image to get you through this.

365
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,760
Yes, I'm imagining it now.

366
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,880
But the other thing that's a correction on my end, I think we have to say that

367
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,800
we discovered perhaps the Jason story about the DVDs and according to Jim

368
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,920
and them all being given bad, the crew gifts, we're no longer sure that this is

369
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,680
a story about Jim Belushi.

370
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,400
We may have disgraced his his name

371
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,160
in a needless way.

372
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,920
I clarify that it could have been any number of unpleasant sitcom stars.

373
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,360
I think there are also other other unpleasant stories flying around

374
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,360
about him at the time, you know.

375
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,920
So, oh, certainly, we're we're saying, yeah, we don't know that that story

376
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,640
happened for sure.

377
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,280
Yes, someone reached out and said that they think that the story of a bad

378
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,240
crew gift that is just then put into it through a door

379
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,800
to be disposed of by the person who gave it, that we think that this may have

380
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,960
involved Cougar Town and it may have been a soundtrack.

381
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,640
It may have been CD copies of the soundtrack of Cougar Town.

382
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,040
I also think there's a chance that this story has made the rounds

383
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,960
about every single sitcom.

384
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,120
Maybe. Oh, yes.

385
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,880
I think it's a game of telephone.

386
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,280
Yeah. Hollywood telephone.

387
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,760
Yeah. So it's like, yeah, it it happened to.

388
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,440
Hmm.

389
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,920
Louis Anderson on the Louis Anderson sitcom.

390
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,920
Dabney Coleman.

391
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,280
Yeah, Dabney Coleman.

392
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,320
It happened at the Leo and Max, the Judd

393
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,480
Hirsch Bob Newhart sitcom in the late 90s.

394
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,800
Everyone was mad at Judd Hirsch.

395
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,440
So they put record albums through the window of his car.

396
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,560
Yeah, it happened to I think it all initially was from the sitcom

397
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,480
Hazel from the 60s.

398
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,600
Shirley Booth, the actress who played Hazel, gave out a lot of vinyl records

399
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,400
of they were just the Hazel theme over and over.

400
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,040
And right. Everybody filled her

401
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,160
Model T with it.

402
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,120
She was still driving a Model T. Yeah.

403
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
She liked retro stuff.

404
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,440
Uh, yeah. So.

405
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,640
So that's the that's my Jim Belushi

406
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,000
corrections segment.

407
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,040
I just don't want Jason.

408
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,800
I want you to end up at the at the other end of a,

409
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,040
you know, a voting machine, a dominion,

410
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,440
Lou Dobbs kind of affair.

411
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,360
And you're getting sued by Jim Belushi for.

412
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,120
I said, allegedly, and also I'm kind of breaking even because I was right

413
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,960
about the House of Blues thing.

414
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,800
Yeah. Oh, no, no, no. Yes, I know.

415
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,480
I know we're we're landing in the center.

416
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,640
So he'll give you money for saying, wait, now you're Jason's hand.

417
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,360
And OK, I think me and Jim settle things with a little smoke out, maybe.

418
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,440
A little you and me.

419
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,280
Portland, Oregon. No, me and Jim.

420
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,880
He said he. Yeah, I see.

421
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,200
OK, OK. No, no, no.

422
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,960
We're all ending up up there.

423
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,960
And I just did it again in further Jim Belushi content.

424
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,280
I thought you guys should hear a little bit of a some copy that I found

425
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:18,200
about Jim Belushi and the Sacred Hearts band that is from CalEntertainment.com,

426
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,720
which is their their booking website.

427
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,600
If you want to book them for a corporate event or for a theme park performance,

428
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,480
it's a big ol it's it's a long, long bit of prose about Jim Belushi.

429
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,920
And here's the beginning.

430
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,240
The first thing you need to know about Jim Belushi is that he's a performer,

431
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,120
not an actor, not a comedian, not a singer, but a performer.

432
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,920
The second thing you need to know, and this is in some ways

433
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,440
more important than the first thing, is that he has absolutely no shame.

434
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,520
None. Zip zero.

435
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,440
What? He allowed this copy to be,

436
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,480
you know, the cool thing about people where they have no shame.

437
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,560
That's what it's not fear that you don't want people to have.

438
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,720
It's shame. No one should have shame.

439
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,800
He's not like Tom Green, like he's not Tom Green in the 90s.

440
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,360
What are they? He's never done anything.

441
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,920
Like that. I would think no shame as a selling point

442
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,200
means somebody who would do like wild, outrageous things.

443
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,240
Eric Andre has no shame because he's a wild comedian

444
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,680
who does crazy stuff for your amusement.

445
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,880
That would be the selling point of no shame. Not like no shame.

446
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,640
He's willing to put his name on any piece of shit.

447
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,000
Like that's the no shame I think of

448
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,520
with Jim Belushi, maybe

449
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,680
he's willing to do anything for money.

450
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,760
He has no shame.

451
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,800
Uh, yeah, I don't think that's one to aspire to be.

452
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,080
I was even thinking like, I have had people like that's not like,

453
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,280
wasn't there a comedian who had a special called Shameless?

454
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,760
Who is the comedian who did shame?

455
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,920
And then I remembered, oh, Louis C.K.

456
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,360
That was Louis C.K. who did Shameless.

457
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,760
So the cool quality of being shameless.

458
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,280
Only the best are his. Yeah.

459
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,240
I mean, you know, you want your shame,

460
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,240
you want shame to just fall in a nice, comfortable area.

461
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,640
Some people have too much of it.

462
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,600
Some people have a little too little of it.

463
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,120
And then some people like Belushi have none.

464
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,280
I guess consider ourselves the opposite of Belushi, of course.

465
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,800
We're all loaded with as much shame as

466
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,280
pushed into our bodies.

467
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,840
All like, yeah, Mickey Backpack's full of shame.

468
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
We carry around.

469
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,640
Yes. And then there's one thing at the

470
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,760
end, which is the sacred hearts they've played for Al Gore,

471
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,480
Governor Gray Davis and many other politicos.

472
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,720
President Clinton is a really big fan.

473
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,880
And since one of these days, he's going to be out of a day job.

474
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,680
He'll probably want to sit in with the sacred hearts.

475
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:01,160
So I have just this is copy from that stretch is clearly from 1999.

476
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,520
Yeah, they're they're they're like selling point is from a Clinton era

477
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,600
blurb that was written.

478
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,280
The 22 year old is surged today.

479
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,000
He's drank his surge so he can go all day long.

480
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,880
What was Belushi doing in the 90s?

481
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,800
Was he like shitting on stage?

482
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,040
What are they?

483
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,000
What are they trying to advertise here?

484
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,760
Yes, he was.

485
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,760
He was at the show where Gigi Allen collapsed.

486
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,000
He's going to do like they're they're advertising a guy

487
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,400
who's going to come and do a bad cover of Crossroads on the harmonica.

488
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,600
What are they?

489
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,400
What are they?

490
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,680
Maybe also take a dump and stick his balls in it.

491
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,520
Yeah, shameless.

492
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,240
He opened his gargoyle.

493
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,320
Jim Belushi.

494
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,800
Jim Belushi is the modern day Gigi Allen.

495
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,080
Yeah, he would.

496
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,120
What?

497
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,240
He would literally he would.

498
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,440
It's not just the sacred hearts.

499
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,200
He would like open himself up from the center and rip his chest open

500
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,480
and show you his literal heart beating in his chest.

501
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,160
Wow.

502
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,680
Splatter blood at you.

503
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,520
These are really intense concerts.

504
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,040
He was crazy.

505
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,760
Yeah.

506
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,920
Cannibal Corpse opening for Jim Belushi.

507
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,960
Hardcore band.

508
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,120
You know, so many needles in his body by the end of it.

509
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,520
And one more little thing at the end of this word on the street is

510
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,080
if it's going to be a tough audience, get Jim Belushi and the Sacred Hearts.

511
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,960
A butt hasn't been born that can stay in a chair through their first set.

512
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,240
Come on, man.

513
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,800
Geez, Louise.

514
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,760
I remember the day that my my son's butt was born.

515
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,000
What an emotional, you know, just to look at that, but no, I made that

516
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,240
when a butt is born.

517
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,680
The Stork.

518
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,720
The angels dance.

519
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,800
The Stork brought a new butt to the house.

520
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,680
So let's just say there's a little bundle of butt on the way.

521
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,960
They're saying that if you have like a crowd that might not want to pay attention

522
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,560
or might be like unruly, that Jim Belushi and the Sacred Hearts

523
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,480
will tame them.

524
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,480
Because if you're yeah, they enter the first set.

525
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,360
So like what you do, you get a Jim Belushi sandwich going,

526
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,000
a Sacred Heart sandwich.

527
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,760
And if you're doing like a corporate retreat for Hewlett Packard

528
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,960
and the vice president has to talk for a while and you're worried

529
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,760
that people are going to fail, then you make sure Jim Belushi is before

530
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,280
and after and then everyone will stay put and hear his thoughts about

531
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,120
what we're going to do to surge into the 21st century.

532
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,440
Hi. Can you email them and say, like, I have a group of 15 year olds

533
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,560
and they're having a birthday party and they are quite the handful.

534
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,160
Will Jim Belushi and the Sacred Hearts be able to tame them

535
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,480
and make them quiet down with his version of sweet home Chicago?

536
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,000
Could Jim Belushi come and talk about Robert Johnson

537
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,880
and how not enough people know about Robert Johnson for 45 minutes?

538
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,520
I'm not sure that's my question.

539
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,120
Though the blue is going to say name a blues artist.

540
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,880
My brother, John.

541
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,320
End of list.

542
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,040
Danny and John and Eric Clapton.

543
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,960
That's it.

544
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,200
List over this new kid, John Maker.

545
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,080
Forget his name. Anyway, he's a pretty, pretty boy.

546
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,360
The also just the the the butt

547
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,440
that can stay in a chair through their first like that.

548
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,600
In that sentence, that implies that maybe people leave.

549
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,840
Like if you know, but stays in the chair through the entire first set.

550
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,560
Right. That's because you get up and leave.

551
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,760
That's a butt getting up.

552
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,200
I mean, they really should have said if they're talking about everyone's butt

553
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,160
and the second gate, so we can keep saying, but over and over again,

554
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,720
because we're being bloody.

555
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,240
We get fine on the main feed.

556
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,840
That's why I say.

557
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,960
Yeah. But if you're talking about everyone's butt, you would say like,

558
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,280
oh, a butt hasn't been born that wouldn't shake to the rhythms

559
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,520
of the sacred hearts.

560
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,600
You would say you would make sure to let people know.

561
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,800
Yes, that the butts are staying in the vicinity.

562
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,520
They're just enjoying the music so much that they're vibrating or whatever.

563
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,920
Yeah, that was what you would try to convey.

564
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,720
That is what because what you're saying is like the butts go right up

565
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,840
out the door and sit in their car seat.

566
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,760
Sit in a different seat, the seat of their automobile

567
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,240
where they think about their regrets about going out tonight.

568
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,640
Mm hmm. Not a there's not a ball hasn't been born

569
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,440
that hasn't vibrated to the loud stomping bass of the sacred arts band.

570
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,720
Now I'm going to look up what the fucking set lists are.

571
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,640
All right. So what's half of the what's

572
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,400
you want to do? Golden stay first or paradise?

573
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,600
Here, what's everyone's vote?

574
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,240
Don't we? I think we got to decide without me while I'm looking for this.

575
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,320
Yeah, I was on a set list site earlier.

576
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,960
You know, they play Mockingbird.

577
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,720
I know that. So all kinds of great.

578
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,920
They kicked off this.

579
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,960
They kicked off this show with Sweet Home Chicago

580
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:24,520
and did it in the middle and close to several times in between.

581
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,520
All right. And you're right.

582
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,000
We're not in Chicago or in California.

583
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,720
Send your gripes. Sorry.

584
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,400
I got a gripe too much Jim Belushi, but we're moving on now.

585
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,800
Yeah. Well, we were in the fog of

586
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,040
Bountiful Valley Farm, of course.

587
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,880
Yes. Talking about seeds.

588
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,560
So you really well, you got your choice where to go from from there, I suppose.

589
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,920
I guess you're the you're maybe you're the nearest to

590
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,320
Golden State.

591
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,480
Oh, well, actually, I correct myself.

592
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,240
Bountiful Valley Farm is one of six areas of the district

593
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,880
to Golden State, which, of course, again, are Bountiful Valley Farm,

594
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,760
Golden Vine Winery, Pacific Worth, the Bay Area, Grizzly Peak Recreation Area

595
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,160
and Condor Flats.

596
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,000
So I guess let's keep heading around the horn.

597
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,560
And what does that mean?

598
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,480
Where do you go around the horn?

599
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,880
Does keep going around the loop, the odd shape.

600
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,320
California Adventure.

601
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,280
I know all the Disney parks, if you look at them from above, kind of

602
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,160
have interesting shapes.

603
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,040
But I feel like California Adventure, especially on that opening day,

604
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,400
map is very uneven feeling.

605
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,280
There's big holes. It is like big patches.

606
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,760
Really shouldn't something be there?

607
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,840
And then eventually things were there.

608
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,640
It was parking lots a lot.

609
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,160
That's one thing I remember about Paradise Pier.

610
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,160
There's still just kind of a wall on the side as you walk

611
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,520
through the main entrance and over to the Incredicoaster.

612
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,040
But there used to be a wall because if you went over the...

613
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,640
Like now it's blocking Cars Land.

614
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,400
Before it was just a wall because it was just a parking lot.

615
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,320
I was like, I don't know, let's just put up some woods

616
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,280
and nobody thinks about how there's nothing over there.

617
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,280
It is crazy that it's still to this day.

618
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,080
It's so clearly like, you know, Anaheim's right there,

619
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,920
whereas Disneyland, you really they do a very good job.

620
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,920
You never really feel like you're anywhere close to civilization anywhere.

621
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,520
But especially in the old California Adventure was like,

622
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,800
you're like, I know what's across.

623
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,920
I know what's on the other side of that wall.

624
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,480
Like I've been in there and I'm curious if any listeners have ever experienced this.

625
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,360
I've been to California Adventure with people.

626
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,240
They aren't even like total never been there before rubes.

627
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,920
I've had people say like, now what's that attraction over there?

628
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,120
And they point to a big building that's sort of spacey looking and kind of

629
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,240
not unlike Space Mountain.

630
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,160
And I say that is not in the park.

631
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,360
That is the Anaheim Convention Center.

632
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,520
That is not a thing that you can go do.

633
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,640
And I would not blame people for asking that question.

634
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,480
I don't think that's that crazy because it kind of looks like, you know, that's

635
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,400
is that the future of California section?

636
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,160
No, that's not the good across the street.

637
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,160
That's a good part of this.

638
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,880
That's like the cool thing.

639
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,680
Yeah, yeah, no, it's it's very visible. Sorry.

640
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,480
I went to WonderCon a couple of years ago and it

641
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,520
it was busy enough that they were you had to park at the Angel Stadium.

642
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,840
They had buses shuttling people over and they dropped you off

643
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,360
backstage at California Adventure.

644
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:36,840
And then you went you exited and then came out to a crosswalk

645
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,880
that put you in the middle of the convention center.

646
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,680
But that was very surreal being dropped off like behind Radiator Springs.

647
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,840
Yeah, it is interesting because like with Disneyland,

648
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,400
when they were doing Star Wars construction and they had ripped down

649
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,120
all those trees back in the back of the park and that you could see the

650
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,680
Mickey and Friends parking structure from there, I went, that's there?

651
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,400
Yes. Like, I truly I didn't have any idea that that's where

652
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,960
that that's where the parking structure was.

653
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,080
And I was like, man, they really disorient you in here

654
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,120
versus like California Adventure is like, I know exactly how to get to

655
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,760
Captain Kidd's from any point in the park.

656
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,840
If I could just if there were exits everywhere,

657
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,520
I could easily get to any of the harbor businesses.

658
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,200
Well, that's just what you're you're dreaming of doing.

659
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,200
So you just you have an oddly Captain Kidd centric mind.

660
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,960
Oh, yeah. A lot of the things I do and think about are all in the context

661
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,200
of getting back to Captain Kidd's.

662
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,000
We will. Are you are you worried about where they're going?

663
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,400
I mean, we haven't really looked into a ton of like the financials for Captain Kidd's.

664
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,440
I don't know if it's part of another corporation or another business,

665
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,760
like a restaurant business like group or anything.

666
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,400
So I am a little worried just because I don't have much knowledge of the stability.

667
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,920
So it's a buffet. That's a tough thing.

668
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,080
Oh, yeah. A buffet that's supported by the traffic from a theme park.

669
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,440
That's tough. Could this be the end of this?

670
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,480
Be Captain Kidd's final voyage?

671
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,960
Mm hmm. Possibly could.

672
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,400
I I we will look into it.

673
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,480
And I don't know if they're doing takeout.

674
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,040
Really, I should drive down there and get some takeout

675
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,520
from kids doing a it's a buffet.

676
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:22,520
So you just like fill out a checklist or just tell them item by item

677
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,560
and kind of the amount like probably maybe two scoops of jello or

678
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,000
but like not that much, like two small scoops of jello.

679
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,200
That's like part of a half hour list of what you want.

680
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,560
And then you pay them thirty four ninety nine

681
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,800
curbside cap and gets it all.

682
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,920
If it's an all you can eat, would it be possible as long as it's the same day

683
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,440
for me to come back in my car and get another round of food?

684
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,400
Yeah, I think so, because you could just do circles

685
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,200
around the Disneyland area, just keep going around the park over and over.

686
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,080
You mean that's I mean, that would be some theatrics.

687
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,880
I don't know. I'm just saying maybe in the whole like

688
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,120
because you could stay in a buffet for hours and eat.

689
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,640
Mm hmm. So I'm just saying, as long as it's the same day,

690
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,960
I think Captain Kidd should keep bringing free curb, like more curbside food to me.

691
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,600
I'm going to look into this.

692
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,040
So you might go you might go down there, come back up, eat,

693
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,280
go back for go back down. Yeah.

694
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,680
This is more electrifying than Belushi.

695
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,960
Well, what's well, then you what do you want to talk about, Jason?

696
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,800
Why? The market?

697
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,160
That was a well, now you look now you look silly because you love that shit.

698
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,760
What wine country?

699
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,120
Rine country market.

700
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,680
Wait, I don't know what you said.

701
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,720
Oh, I said wine country market.

702
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,880
OK, I don't know what that shit referred to.

703
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,400
Yeah, the he was saying you would as a place you wanted to be at.

704
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,920
And you were talking about a buffet.

705
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,920
You look foolish.

706
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,080
Now into the vine, you know. Oh, sure.

707
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,240
You're stomping grounds. Yeah. Yeah.

708
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,640
Well, look, I do like it there.

709
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,040
I have no information about it because I that's another thing.

710
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,880
I wonder if the winery is its own situation.

711
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,440
I don't know.

712
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,880
You know, feel free, though.

713
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,480
What do you got about the winery?

714
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,600
Well, I you know, some of it's still standing.

715
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,600
The interesting thing I found out about the wine country

716
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,520
market is that it was, you know, a market where you could go

717
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,440
and buy like cheeses and bottles of wine.

718
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,040
You could enjoy the food.

719
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,440
There was also sandwiches and salads pre-made somewhere else

720
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,600
and at theme park prices.

721
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,520
But if you bought a bottle of wine, they boxed it up

722
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,400
and gave you a coat check ticket, essentially,

723
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,280
and you could pick it up on your way out.

724
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,800
You could not drink the bottle there.

725
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,400
Hmm. Oh, you weren't allowed to drink the bottle.

726
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,440
You were not allowed to like crack it open and drink it

727
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,440
on the massive patio that was outside of it.

728
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,760
Really? Yeah, there was wine.

729
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,040
There was the walk up line bars on both sides of it.

730
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,120
Now that that's down to just one.

731
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:08,280
But this was like a venture with Disney and Robert Mondavi.

732
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,920
It did not last long.

733
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,160
And yes, your land put the estimate of his losses

734
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:20,320
at between 12 and 13 million for his relationship with California Adventure.

735
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,560
Just because it just wasn't the demand wasn't there.

736
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,880
The guests were not there.

737
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,480
So Disney took this over pretty quickly

738
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,160
and it became what it pretty much still is today.

739
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,760
The wine, like the upstairs wine patio, wine country, Tritoria.

740
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,920
Very little of that has changed from Disney taking it over.

741
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,320
That's where it becomes the greatest area in the park,

742
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,360
the best area and the best park in the world.

743
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,720
Yeah, Fresco Tasting Terrace.

744
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,760
Yeah. Yep.

745
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,960
But that's now Pass Holder.

746
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,040
Oh, what's going to happen with that?

747
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,480
Because that's Pass Holder exclusive.

748
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,760
It was became Pass Holder exclusive for a little while.

749
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,040
Then it got so popular.

750
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,440
Well, there's no such thing as pass holders now.

751
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,520
So you got to give it back to the people.

752
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,920
We're legacy pass holders.

753
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,400
Yeah, that's interesting.

754
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,240
I guess the reason they were probably I'm thinking now,

755
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,000
if like you couldn't crack open a bottle of wine

756
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,200
is because they wanted to control people's alcohol intake.

757
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,480
And if you could just buy a bottle of wine and crack it open and walk around,

758
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,200
that might be dangerous in a Disney park.

759
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,320
Yeah. Also, like active glass you're carrying,

760
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,440
the amount of glass you have on your person.

761
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,360
They also like to keep down.

762
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,080
That's true, too.

763
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,880
But I feel like some people would go in in the morning at 9 a.m.

764
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,680
buy a bottle, just drink it, finish it at noon, finish it by noon, walking around.

765
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,560
Probably be a bad idea.

766
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,760
Might be a little rowdy.

767
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:43,720
If this some people is a subtweet, then, yes, some people might do that.

768
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,280
And some people might have the best day of their lives.

769
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,720
Would you? Is that something you thought about?

770
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,680
Like, I wish I could just crack a bottle of wine and we could just sip from it.

771
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,720
I mean, it does.

772
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:59,480
Hmm. I mean, I, you know, I've I don't think like walking around, though,

773
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,200
because then you have to like keep rearrange.

774
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,920
Do you just have like a glass that is if I could have disposable glass?

775
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,120
I don't know. Now I'll I'll sit.

776
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,280
I'll do them one at a time. All right. All right.

777
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,960
I'll get a bottle's worth plastic bottle with a twist top.

778
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,000
You can put in a backpack.

779
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,320
Sure. Yeah.

780
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,480
Might be getting hot, though, as you go.

781
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,560
Robert Mondavi, Robert Mondavi should have thought of that,

782
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,960
and he should have made a plastic bottle with a twist top.

783
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,120
It's like a carrying bag.

784
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,200
Then he wouldn't have lost all that money.

785
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,720
Yeah, he didn't bring the innovation, the California spirit of innovation.

786
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,560
Yeah. To innovate better ways to drink.

787
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,560
So they lost his like celebrity endorsement.

788
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,000
Then they basically just it's now just a Disney.

789
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,040
Nobody else like filled that role except for Disney.

790
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,960
And then there are like random, you know, the Lasseter wines and such

791
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,720
that filled the menu after that.

792
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,280
Or were those wines always available?

793
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,520
It seemed to be mostly Robert Mondavi.

794
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,000
Branded wines to start.

795
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,520
Which is, by the way, garbage, right?

796
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,840
Isn't like from my recollection.

797
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,360
I don't know. Makes the crap.

798
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,840
Correct me if I'm wrong, but like I think by opening it up,

799
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,200
now there's like now they can offer a ton of stuff and not just like

800
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,280
his one brand of kind of middle and garbage.

801
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,600
I mean, I think that's true.

802
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,920
I mean, I don't it's certainly ubiquitous.

803
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,440
Like, you know, Robert Mondavi, Cupcake, Barefoot.

804
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,280
Like I don't I can't speak to the quality of any of those,

805
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,600
but I know you can buy them at 7-Eleven.

806
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,120
Which probably tells you something, I think.

807
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,880
So this was good.

808
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,400
This was a good early change is getting Mondavi out of there,

809
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,520
getting that that cheapskate Mondavi out of there with his crap wine.

810
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,640
Good. Take a lot of his money on the way out.

811
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,640
Yeah. So that's good.

812
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,560
I think I'll teach you to monopolize the wine situation in a theme park.

813
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:08,120
Yeah. And it seems like they were, you know, the same sort of issue

814
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,280
popping up just a few steps away at the start of Paradise Pier with

815
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,640
what is it called? It's it was originally called Avalon Cove.

816
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,960
Yes. The home of the beloved Cove bar.

817
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,160
But when it opened, the restaurant was was a Wolfgang Puck restaurant.

818
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,960
Right. Yes. And, you know, Wolfgang Puck, it's like he's got

819
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,800
I feel like he has so many different brands as far as his quality is concerned.

820
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,320
Sometimes you get something, you know, it's pretty good.

821
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,560
And then I'm like, I have never eaten one of his high end restaurants or anything,

822
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,240
which I'm sure are fine.

823
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,800
But I've eaten at an airport with with Wolfgang Puck

824
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,200
branded meal and it's nothing special.

825
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,880
I an airport meal isn't kidding me.

826
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,920
Yeah, believe it or not.

827
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,240
I've been to Spago a couple of times, like when my family's come to.

828
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,400
Oh, yes, I remember.

829
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,480
I've met him. I've met. He was going around.

830
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,520
He shook everyone's hand in the restaurant.

831
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,040
And like, I don't know, it's a nice enough place that it's like

832
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,400
if you were sitting at the bar and your table is ready,

833
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,720
they put your drink on a little, you know, slab of granite

834
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,040
and walk it over to your table with you.

835
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,080
Which is like how the moon like how the moon.

836
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,320
Yeah, well, that only the finance.

837
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,280
Yeah, it's only the balance.

838
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,600
But yes, you're correct.

839
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,400
He has like consumer brands you can buy at the grocery store and at the airport.

840
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,200
And but, you know, people weren't really like buying.

841
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:43,240
People didn't really want to buy the menu was just like seafood and steaks.

842
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,880
And, you know, the thing that I kept coming across from people being like,

843
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,680
you know, Epcot was successful

844
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,960
because it opened with all these restaurants and there wasn't a lot of high end

845
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,680
restaurants necessarily around that area of central Florida compared to

846
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,000
southern California, which is filled with some of the best restaurants in the country.

847
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,080
Yeah, sure.

848
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,400
I also think it's I correct me if I'm wrong, but like I think that the appetite

849
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:17,400
of the consumer has only like grown for high end dining experiences inside a theme park.

850
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,560
I mean, they've had Blue Bayou forever, but I feel like in the last 10 years now,

851
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,720
especially Carthay is such a good restaurant and all these other places.

852
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,120
It's like, I think people more even expect to have like a number of different

853
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,560
good places to eat in theme parks.

854
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,640
Whereas that might have been a little bit limited before.

855
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,160
I could be totally wrong about that, but.

856
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,080
I think that's true.

857
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:39,800
Yeah.

858
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,680
I think there was a little bit of variety at the start of California Adventure.

859
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,240
I don't know that there was a lot of quality, but you look at the like high,

860
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,680
quote unquote high end and it is just like New York strip steak, Caesar salad,

861
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,120
New England clam chow.

862
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,160
It's just like, yeah, you can get this.

863
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,800
You can walk from here and gets this better.

864
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,760
You can get this better in downtown Disney.

865
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,160
Yeah, or Captain Kids Buffet or Captain Kids Buffet.

866
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:03,720
You could get it.

867
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:09,120
Well, and you could get it all on one platter for 11.99 for adults and 8.99 for kids.

868
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,360
So Wolfgang Wolfgang ran away.

869
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,600
Yeah, he didn't like it.

870
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,080
Do we know how much money he lost?

871
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,520
I don't know.

872
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,040
I didn't see it.

873
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,800
I think he got out earlier, so he might not have.

874
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,960
He may have broken even.

875
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,160
Yeah, he might not have been.

876
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,320
And then they switched it over to the other one.

877
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,480
And then they switched it over to a lot of character dining.

878
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,720
And, you know, the bar is still there.

879
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,720
The cove bar is still going.

880
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,600
Well, it was Ariel.

881
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,000
There was Ariel's grotto and Ariel's grotto downstairs.

882
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,360
Yeah.

883
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,920
For now, it's I always call it the wrong name.

884
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,880
I think somebody had a gripe.

885
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,320
I think it's it's the lamp light lounge.

886
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,720
Well, I've done the same thing.

887
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,920
I thought that was about me.

888
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,360
Maybe it was about you, but I think I've called it the wrong name too,

889
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,200
because lamp lighter is, uh, uh, what's his name's character.

890
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,200
Not Burt.

891
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,600
It's, uh, it's, uh,

892
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,320
Oh, Burt is a chimney sweep.

893
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,120
Lin-Manuel is.

894
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,880
Burt is a chimney sweep.

895
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,960
Lin-Manuel's character I can't think of the name of is a lamp lighter.

896
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:16,480
So I think it's lamp light lounge, but I think I call it the lamp lighter

897
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,960
lounge because I'm thinking of Lin's Mary Poppins Returns character.

898
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,480
Well, everyone's always thinking of him all the time.

899
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:23,920
Yes.

900
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,760
Well, yeah, like much like Captain Kids, I can't shake this from my brain.

901
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,720
I think of that restaurant and I think of Lin in that movie.

902
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,720
Would you say Captain Kid and Lin in that movie and Jim Belushi are your guys?

903
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,520
I would say that.

904
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,080
Yes, I would.

905
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:38,920
Yeah.

906
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,520
Uh, lamp light is similar.

907
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,800
That's similar to the, I, we, I don't think we mentioned this in the first

908
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,160
part of this Disney's apostrophe S California adventure later changed to

909
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,280
just Disney California adventure, which I don't think I have spent any

910
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,160
brain power processing until this past week.

911
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,120
I saw that too.

912
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,400
And I was, I was like, Oh yeah.

913
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,560
And then I was like, do you have an opinion on that?

914
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:10,240
And I don't know that I do, but Disney California adventure versus

915
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,080
Disney's California adventure.

916
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,000
Like what is no sense to say out loud.

917
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,160
Which one doesn't make sense.

918
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,840
Disney California adventure, like the grammatically, I think it's bizarre.

919
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,240
Yeah.

920
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,920
Disney, Disney California adventure.

921
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,160
Yeah.

922
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,000
Why wouldn't it be Disney's they own it?

923
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,760
It's part of their, yeah.

924
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,160
Disney.

925
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,080
Oh, is it Disney, Disney Hollywood studios or Disney's Hollywood studios?

926
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,320
Now it's Disney Hollywood studios.

927
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:39,880
I think, right.

928
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,400
Well, it was Disney MGM studios because it was a joint venture.

929
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,520
Right.

930
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:46,840
Right.

931
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,640
So, uh, no, wait a minute.

932
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,480
The electrifying stuff we had to get to was a posture.

933
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,000
Yeah.

934
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:53,440
Yeah.

935
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,280
That's right, baby.

936
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:54,720
You needed to do it.

937
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,320
That's right.

938
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,160
It's Disney's it's, it says it on here, Disney's Hollywood studios.

939
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,600
So I'm not sure what the thinking was there for getting rid of that.

940
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,040
Their rules of grammar are insane.

941
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:10,720
Enchanted wish, colon, magic nights, like all this bullshit they just make.

942
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,480
Oh, sure.

943
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,640
So yeah, I'm not sure.

944
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,920
I'm not sure why they did that.

945
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,920
Um, but someone let us know.

946
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,600
Cause maybe they explained it.

947
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,360
Um, are we at the pier?

948
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,480
Is that the way we're going?

949
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,600
Is that the route we're taking?

950
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,400
I suppose so.

951
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,520
Yeah.

952
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,400
What is, what else is in cold golden state that is worth addressing?

953
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:36,960
Well, Condor flats was the, uh, you know, the not to California's aviation

954
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,600
history, and that was where Soren was the original head of the park and

955
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,080
remains to this day, although it's now grizzly peak airfield, they've tied it.

956
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,040
Tied it back together.

957
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:54,680
The, the national parks, um, theme as it is now at the time, the grizzly peak

958
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,520
recreation area was all about extreme sports.

959
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,200
Yes.

960
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,520
Cause they had the X, they hosted the X games.

961
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,480
Is that right?

962
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,680
Well, they had like X little X games kind of setups demonstrations.

963
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,120
Um, well, there was a whole, I mean, there was a whole X games tie in for a

964
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:21,800
little, but while the X games experience, uh, during which there was a attraction

965
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,680
kind of in that little San Francisco area.

966
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,560
And that is called the Xcade.

967
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:31,440
Um, and here's a picture of the X, the Xcade it has, you know, a motorcycle

968
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,240
game and a skating game.

969
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,120
Look at the sign of Xcade.

970
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:42,720
Is this the most six flags E thing that has ever been in a Disney park?

971
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:44,640
Yes.

972
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,680
Uh, well, yeah.

973
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,200
I mean, I was thinking as I was watching old paradise pier, I go, this is pretty

974
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:54,880
six flags E and this is even 10 times the six flags and this of just old paradise

975
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,200
pier.

976
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:55,560
Yeah.

977
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:00,880
I mean, just the, just the extreme, just the word itself without even the bad

978
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,160
graphic design is such a six flags thing.

979
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,120
That's so funny.

980
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:05,920
It looks horrible.

981
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,440
I couldn't, they make it look a little better.

982
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:08,640
Yeah.

983
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,600
The building, the building looks nice.

984
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,760
That's the, yeah, the building looks fine.

985
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,600
Well, the building isn't, I mean, that was there before.

986
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:22,960
I feel like the X, the Xcade sign itself, um, is, I just want a classier

987
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:28,280
Xcade sign, you know, this is like a, like spec art for an energy drink that

988
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,520
didn't get off the ground.

989
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:30,680
Right.

990
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:31,960
They didn't get the fun.

991
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:32,240
Yeah.

992
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:32,720
Yeah.

993
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,040
The Xcade man.

994
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,880
And it was like, the Xcade is one of those games.

995
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,160
That's really in the basement of Disney attractions.

996
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,040
I feel the most obscure.

997
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,000
The worst looking, uh, who's nostalgic for the Xcade.

998
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,640
Maybe somebody.

999
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,680
It's funny you say that because that the interior does look like a partially

1000
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,360
finished basement and one of my friend's house is growing up.

1001
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,000
Not every, well, the, there's a big, just a big Yamaha sign that's crooked

1002
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,760
and covering half the window.

1003
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,160
Yeah.

1004
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:04,520
Yeah.

1005
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,720
His uncle, his uncle used to run an arcade that went belly up.

1006
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:14,800
So he's got like a semi working NBA jam cabinet and, um, uh, Yamaha banner.

1007
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,320
Cool.

1008
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,920
You gotta come over and see that banner.

1009
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,400
Got to see the banner, man.

1010
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,320
That is funny.

1011
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:25,200
Cause the bait, the quote unquote Bay area part of golden state is mostly

1012
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,440
like a couple of nice looking buildings that house a bathroom.

1013
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,760
And I, that is now a shop field Xcade.

1014
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:41,040
And then the giant, um, golden dreams building that became the, uh, uh,

1015
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,760
little mermaid attraction.

1016
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,160
Mm hmm.

1017
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:54,120
Um, we're thrilled talking about clearly was, was the taste pilot grill opening

1018
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,560
day.

1019
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,240
Yes.

1020
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,240
Yeah.

1021
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,520
Um, and that was replaced.

1022
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:03,320
Like I will say that, like, I do think that the, the update they did to the

1023
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:08,560
area, the condor flats area is better, but I, it's not bad.

1024
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,680
This area is not bad early on.

1025
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,200
I think this hangs okay together as far, I mean, grizzly, the grizzly area, the

1026
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:21,080
most I think, and then maybe second in line, the area around Soren with all of

1027
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:24,360
this theming, it's at least themed somewhat and you could sort of see it,

1028
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,800
you know, piecing together into a better park.

1029
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,040
Like it's okay.

1030
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,640
It was okay.

1031
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,400
Is my memory.

1032
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,080
A nice atmosphere.

1033
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,040
The trees have just gotten bigger and bigger.

1034
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,760
Like that's helped the area.

1035
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:36,640
Yeah.

1036
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,400
And it wasn't like when they were like, we're going to re-theme taste pilot's

1037
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:44,040
grill, I was like, finally this abomination of a quick service restaurant

1038
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:44,680
is going away.

1039
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,160
Like I was like, oh, okay, cool.

1040
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:46,840
And I like it.

1041
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,600
It looks better now, I think, but it wasn't like, it wasn't complete garbage.

1042
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,800
Like some of this other stuff.

1043
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,320
I mean, I think it's the same type of garbage quick service food, but that's,

1044
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,920
that's beside the point we're talking about the theming here.

1045
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,120
We lost our puns though.

1046
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,200
We lost our G-Force gourmet burgers.

1047
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:11,120
Like the wild blue, like spelled like the cheese, wild blue yonder burger, the

1048
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:16,600
flight stuff, which of course is X1 rocket ribs and the hot wing squadron.

1049
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,200
I like that.

1050
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,120
I enjoyed saying that.

1051
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,400
Hot wing squadron is good.

1052
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,240
I watched a show called hot wing squadron.

1053
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:32,600
The side stuff, fly by, fly by fries, which are not, they just don't even tell

1054
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:37,720
you the difference between fly by fries and full throttle fly fries.

1055
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,320
It's impossible to say.

1056
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:44,600
One's more expensive than the others that assumes loaded, but I don't know how.

1057
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,240
They don't list toppings, toppings, which then also have puns.

1058
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,000
I would assume inside maybe on a menu you would be able to get it, but yeah,

1059
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,920
just looking at this exterior menu, they really, they're keeping you guessing.

1060
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,920
Oh, they have a toppings bar.

1061
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,200
This is a toppings bar establishment, or at least it was for many years.

1062
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,000
So that's why it's still on this topics.

1063
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,040
Smokejumper is still at a toppings bar.

1064
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:07,240
Yeah.

1065
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,560
Well, right now I don't know that they're going wild with the public

1066
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,880
touch this toppings bar set up.

1067
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,040
Is Smokejumper is open right now?

1068
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,760
Wasn't it open for a little while?

1069
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:24,400
I think it is as one of the, one is one of the restaurants closest to the entrance.

1070
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:24,720
Yes.

1071
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,920
I believe that you can go to Smokejumper's.

1072
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:33,160
If you want to go to all the way to Disneyland and just go get a theme

1073
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:39,520
park burger and fries for $20, you can do that and pay $10 for parking.

1074
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,480
But the question is, can you just pick up with some tongs, a loose piece of

1075
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,080
lettuce from the bar, from the toppings bar?

1076
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,480
That's the question we have now.

1077
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:49,880
Okay.

1078
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,080
It's open, but toppings bar is a question mark.

1079
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:53,680
Got it.

1080
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:58,240
Bring your own tongs and you might have some trouble at security with that.

1081
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:58,640
Mm-hmm.

1082
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,600
If you, if they think that your tongs can be used as a weapon, if they're

1083
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,240
small tongs, maybe not, if they're big tongs, you could sort of like,

1084
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,480
uh, clang somebody's head in.

1085
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,280
Jason, what's your tong situation at home?

1086
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,240
Uh, you know, I would probably go for a smaller tong.

1087
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,840
Uh, if I was bringing it in, probably go for plastic.

1088
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,640
So they weren't concerned about the metal.

1089
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,720
So maybe don't even notice it.

1090
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,680
Um, I don't know.

1091
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,760
I think I have a regular pair of like Oxo, you know, locking tongs that you

1092
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,000
lock so they fit in the drawer.

1093
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,400
Standard issue.

1094
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:33,600
Standard issue.

1095
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,160
Standard issue tongs.

1096
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:35,680
All right.

1097
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,080
Sure.

1098
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:42,320
Um, so yeah, this, this area in general, I think fine was fine.

1099
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,080
It was fine.

1100
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,320
And people are, and people are fond of that original Soarin.

1101
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,440
And that's the only thing, the fact that they do bring it back and that they

1102
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,640
stick, like that they've played into the nostalgia there.

1103
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,360
Soarin, uh, saved the park.

1104
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,440
It's really all on the back of Soarin, I feel.

1105
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:58,840
Yeah.

1106
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,120
Yeah.

1107
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,280
That is pretty crazy.

1108
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:04,520
Um, that, that, that, that was doing all the heavy lifting when you think about it.

1109
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:08,560
I mean, other than like, yeah, like the, um, um, Paradise pier, the coaster,

1110
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,760
which I can, I'm not, I want to call it the Incredicoaster and I forgot.

1111
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,040
California screaming.

1112
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,520
Of course.

1113
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:14,960
Yeah.

1114
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,640
But yeah, yeah.

1115
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,520
Which is a great ride.

1116
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:20,320
But as far as anything where you would go, like to people go, Oh my, I've never

1117
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,720
been on anything like this before.

1118
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:22,800
Like that was it.

1119
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,160
Yeah.

1120
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,680
It was the one technological jump up, I would say.

1121
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:32,520
Um, yeah, which I think any new park needs one of those in the Spider-Man kind

1122
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,520
of way, you need something where you're like, how did they do that?

1123
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,560
I've never seen that before.

1124
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,160
Right.

1125
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:41,440
Um, so they got one and a good smell, a good orange smell.

1126
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,040
Great orange smell.

1127
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:47,680
Um, and then Grizzly Peak, Grizzly Peak has changed the least.

1128
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,320
From, yeah.

1129
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:49,560
Yeah.

1130
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,880
And it's maybe the most like immersive, like you're, you're lost in there.

1131
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,880
You're not looking out at Captain Kidd's there.

1132
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,320
Yes.

1133
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:00,680
And they, it blends into the hotel nicely, which you always hear, like, that's

1134
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,720
what Eisner got fixated on was making the hotel nice.

1135
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:09,400
So it may have benefited from that and from like, okay, we're putting a water ride

1136
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,640
here, water rides are always popular.

1137
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,160
You know?

1138
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:17,720
And there's little, and the nice thing about Grizzly, the Grizzly Peak, and I'm

1139
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,760
sure I've said it before, is there's little secret places still to this day.

1140
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,400
You can walk around that you might not have even noticed.

1141
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,720
Like, like at night, there's like those little trails where you can kind of walk

1142
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:32,920
around by the water and kind of see, see the, uh, like mist and stuff from the ride.

1143
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,160
And,

1144
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:33,960
Oh, sure.

1145
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,240
And people aren't there probably.

1146
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,760
And people are, yeah, it's never very crowded whenever we walk over there.

1147
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,640
Um, and whether it's actually that challenge trail or just on the other side

1148
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:48,480
there, it's like, yeah, you don't, you don't know where Harbor is, which is nice.

1149
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,320
So yeah, that it's interesting.

1150
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,800
What do you think, like when they were building it, they were like, this is the

1151
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,480
only place that's going to survive.

1152
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:59,800
Like, this is the only thing that's going to stay because it's actually immersive.

1153
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,840
Well, I'm wondering how much the design, like the imagineers, like, saw Camp

1154
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:10,400
Snoopy at knots because it, the first time I went to not since all camp Snoopy, I

1155
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,200
was like, Oh, it seems like someone came here and then drew up the grizzly peak

1156
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:19,840
area because it is got a very similar vibe, you know?

1157
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:20,960
Yeah.

1158
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,840
Like yellow stone type, like, yeah, you're an action wooded.

1159
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:26,640
Yes.

1160
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,920
And they're like, well, we can do a better camp Snoopy.

1161
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,160
We're going to suck at camp Snoopy at knots.

1162
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,560
Like we're going to really do it up.

1163
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:38,560
Uh, the bear there, of course, like the other big bear.

1164
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:39,880
Yes.

1165
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,840
I really, we have this, except we did talk about this bear.

1166
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,120
We did all episode about it.

1167
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:44,560
Yeah.

1168
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:44,720
Yeah.

1169
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,280
We talked about, we're just kind of hitting the, hitting the points.

1170
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:47,920
Sure.

1171
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:48,120
Yeah.

1172
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,160
Change its vest.

1173
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,000
The, the bear's vest changed.

1174
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:51,880
That's what's happened.

1175
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:52,360
Yeah.

1176
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,280
The vest, he gets a sweater at Christmas time now.

1177
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:56,320
It's great.

1178
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,640
Um, yeah.

1179
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:01,040
All the bears, I, there's a, the smaller bear that gets a sweater.

1180
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:04,400
I think I said this probably on the episode and it's, there's an Instagram

1181
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,560
post where I accidentally, I was so excited to take a picture of the bear

1182
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:11,120
with a sweater that I made a family move inadvertently.

1183
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,400
Like I would think I was alone and I think I was like quickly like went up with

1184
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,680
my phone and there was a family right there and they like saw me and they like

1185
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,520
scurried away and I was like, well, that's, that's not what should be happening.

1186
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,440
I should not be sending a family running away from my iPhone.

1187
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,200
This man's disturbed.

1188
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,760
So give him space.

1189
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,000
That being said, I took the photo and never apologized.

1190
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,120
Yes.

1191
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,040
I am shameless.

1192
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,760
An hour later, you walked into Captain Kids and who were the first people you

1193
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,960
see that scared family.

1194
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:47,080
And I said, good, I'm glad I made you do that.

1195
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,760
I have no shame.

1196
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:49,920
I don't care.

1197
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,000
I'll do anything in this park.

1198
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:56,200
And then their butts were no, weren't in those seats for much longer.

1199
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:56,920
They got up.

1200
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:57,640
That's right.

1201
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,840
They got up and ran away.

1202
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,320
That's right.

1203
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:05,320
Um, so yeah, Grizzly go, go back and listen to our Mary Holland, uh, Grizzly

1204
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:09,240
Roads, the river rapids episode to get our in depth takes about the bears and

1205
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,120
the fake rocks.

1206
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,080
Yeah.

1207
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,000
Um, let's, let's talk some, let's talk some sign trash.

1208
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,280
Let's go over to, I don't know if it's the pier or to, uh, I don't know

1209
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,560
which way we want to go.

1210
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:23,200
Do you, do you end at burger invasion?

1211
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:23,800
I think you do.

1212
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,160
Maybe you end at burger invasion.

1213
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:30,560
Cause I think the most, I'm going to call it the most egregious thing is over in

1214
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:31,680
this neck of the woods.

1215
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:32,920
So maybe let's start.

1216
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:37,320
We already hit Avalon Cove cause it tied into restaurant tours, getting

1217
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,360
shafted by low attendance numbers.

1218
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:46,280
So, uh, well, okay, we got the way we talked about the strips and the dips.

1219
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,280
Um, what have we missed over here?

1220
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,440
I, I've got a strips and dips thing.

1221
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:55,080
Uh, the strips and dips came with your choice of what we're called

1222
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,000
Broadway dipping sauces.

1223
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,240
Broadway.

1224
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,840
I don't even know why.

1225
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,680
I don't quite understand that.

1226
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:05,880
California.

1227
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,160
Why are we dealing with Broadway?

1228
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:08,400
Yeah.

1229
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:08,800
Yeah.

1230
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:13,800
There's, uh, so then you, we don't know the flavors of the Broadway dipping sauces.

1231
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,120
Uh, I can pull them up real quick.

1232
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,000
I accidentally closed the window.

1233
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:21,400
Um, but I did have a Broadway in California.

1234
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,400
Somewhere.

1235
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,040
Yeah.

1236
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:27,120
It's not quite the same prestige as the Broadway in New York.

1237
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,320
I would assume.

1238
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:34,880
Um, they should have taken, I'm sure they were thinking that hard about which

1239
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:40,920
Broadway, um, do you think the majority of our Broadway, the majority of the

1240
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,160
Imagineers would hear us and be like, dude, you guys are paying way too much

1241
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,640
attention to this garbage, man.

1242
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,440
What are you even, what are you doing?

1243
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,640
Why would you devote this much time to that?

1244
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,440
We just fired off these shitty puns.

1245
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,320
Who cares?

1246
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,560
We were trying to read it.

1247
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:57,880
Original characters like boardwalk Betsy's world famous.

1248
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,440
Oh man.

1249
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,000
I love boardwalk Betsy.

1250
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:01,760
I will say that.

1251
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:03,880
I'm a big fan.

1252
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:04,440
Yeah.

1253
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,520
Oh, I'm sorry.

1254
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,720
It was boardwalk dipping sauces.

1255
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,080
That makes so much more sense.

1256
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:09,800
Jason.

1257
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:10,400
I was like,

1258
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,200
That was a hype.

1259
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,120
You hyped it up.

1260
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,920
I was all day sitting here going like, why would they call it Broadway dipping

1261
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,400
sauces?

1262
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:24,360
I mean, it's still worth talking about Malibu ranch, Midway honey

1263
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:28,720
mustard, Santa barbecue, and totally teriyaki.

1264
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,640
You've like must up your hair now because you're so like upset with the

1265
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,200
different, like you, you look like like Doc Brown or something.

1266
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,680
Your hair is like crazy.

1267
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,280
Cause like you just, you're so frazzled from getting the name of the

1268
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,520
dipping sauce is wrong.

1269
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,400
Broadway dipping sauce is more electrifying than Jim Belushi.

1270
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,400
And let's talk about the next thing.

1271
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,240
Hey.

1272
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,560
I'm not letting it go.

1273
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:51,920
That's a, that's a counterpoint.

1274
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,520
You were wrong.

1275
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,840
You tossed off there, bud.

1276
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,160
Yeah, that's fine.

1277
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:55,880
That's fine.

1278
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,360
You know, I wanted to have some fun.

1279
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,360
I wanted, and this is karma.

1280
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,080
You know, this is what karma is.

1281
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:03,880
I did a little.

1282
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,240
Bring up those sauces.

1283
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:05,640
Go back.

1284
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,240
I want to talk about the sauces more.

1285
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,360
About Belushi and, uh, captain kids.

1286
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,200
And now it came back to bite me in the ass.

1287
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:12,800
Hold on.

1288
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:13,920
You know, sauce.

1289
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,080
What based manner?

1290
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,160
Oh my gosh.

1291
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,080
And sauce too.

1292
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,120
That's the most humiliating.

1293
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,080
Sauce boardwalk dipping sauce.

1294
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:20,520
All right.

1295
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,160
So what are the boardwalk dipping sauces?

1296
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:24,240
Oh, here we go.

1297
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,120
Malibu ranch.

1298
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,520
Of course.

1299
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,320
Midway honey mustard.

1300
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:29,960
Oh, well, all right.

1301
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:35,800
There it is a midway Santa barbecue or totally teriyaki.

1302
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:36,240
All right.

1303
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,960
So there's two California references in the boardwalk sauce.

1304
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:44,280
It's one of the, this is very like par for the, uh, theme menu

1305
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:48,560
course where some of it is themed and then some of it, they give up and just

1306
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,320
name it something fun sounding.

1307
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:51,560
Yeah.

1308
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,520
Uh, yes.

1309
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,640
And then again, imagine whoever names.

1310
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,120
Is there a minute?

1311
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,240
Wait a second.

1312
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,560
What Jason, Jason, we have your reprieve.

1313
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:04,080
Look above this on the sunset specials.

1314
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:08,040
Look under the sunset chicken and the hot and spicy chicken strips and the

1315
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,160
seaside zucchini strips.

1316
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:15,520
It says served with one of our Broadway dipping sauces.

1317
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,760
It is there.

1318
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,680
And it's in zucchini strips too.

1319
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,400
Zucchini sets.

1320
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:24,480
They all say, Oh my God, how do you above on this menu?

1321
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,200
It says Broadway dipping sauces.

1322
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,760
And then right below it, it says choose your boardwalk dipping sauce.

1323
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:30,880
Wow.

1324
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:36,760
This has been an emotional roller coaster for a thing that is choice of one board.

1325
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:37,120
Oh yeah.

1326
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,240
Boardwalk is up in the jumbo fries.

1327
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,280
Boardwalk is God damn.

1328
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,840
This must be, this might be the most satisfying bear trap I've ever

1329
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,040
stepped in on this show.

1330
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,840
Your hairstyle looks different every time the zoom cuts to you.

1331
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,960
It's so floppy right now.

1332
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:55,360
I can just do anything with there's so much of it right now.

1333
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,600
I'm just saying like, you're like messing your hair up because of the

1334
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,040
stress that this is causing you.

1335
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,120
I wrote it down.

1336
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:04,600
I read it and I wrote it down and I'm like, go under, go to the next menu here

1337
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:07,560
and let's see if there's actually any sort of difference in the sauces.

1338
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,280
Is there a fix?

1339
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,080
Wait, wait, wait.

1340
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:10,960
Oh, wait a minute.

1341
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,360
That was just a full on mistake that they made.

1342
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,120
The makers of them.

1343
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:14,920
Wow.

1344
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:21,000
2001, 2003, they messed up the typo and they added more combos.

1345
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:21,880
Oh, they added more.

1346
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,800
There's more boardwalk dipping sauces now.

1347
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:24,560
Okay.

1348
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,960
Which sauces are they?

1349
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:31,560
Muscle beach, marinara or hoopla hot sauce.

1350
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:35,880
Once again, keeping with the theme of that one is a California pun

1351
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,200
and the other is nothing.

1352
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:38,480
Wow.

1353
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:39,680
Wow.

1354
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,720
And then you'd wait, there's a third.

1355
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,160
We have a third here too.

1356
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:43,880
Yeah.

1357
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,200
What's on the bottom here, Jason?

1358
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,480
This is at 2006.

1359
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,880
This is how it tapped out.

1360
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,640
When the before, because this was right where this was replaced by midway

1361
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:00,400
media, one of the, this might be one of the best plus ups, although I have to

1362
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,000
say if I'm going to eat, if I'm going to eat deep fried stuff at a theme park,

1363
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:08,800
chicken strips and mozzarella sticks would be high on my list, but I don't

1364
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,440
think anyone was like, oh, this is the good stuff.

1365
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,840
This is the good ones, you know?

1366
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,360
Huh?

1367
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:19,160
So you're saying it's better to have an interactive high traffic ride than an

1368
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,520
error laden fried food establishment.

1369
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,160
Yeah, I think that's what he's saying.

1370
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,120
I don't want to think words.

1371
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,640
Jason, do you need a break now?

1372
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,120
This has been such a rollercoaster of emotions for you.

1373
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,680
Man, that's wild.

1374
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:40,320
It was, it was buried that you were correct.

1375
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:46,560
You were like, it was it like, like the, for the second one was mocking you and

1376
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:50,520
that there was no Broadway, but then deep, there was like a little nugget buried in

1377
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:50,960
there.

1378
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:56,880
Um, this is what happens when you don't have a regular sleep schedule for like a

1379
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,160
year where you're like either up till 3am or you're asleep by 10pm.

1380
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:08,840
That's you end up confusing the met the 2001 strips, chips and dips menu with the

1381
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,840
2003 chips, strips and dips.

1382
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:12,480
Correct.

1383
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,000
When they corrected themselves.

1384
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,200
God, what a misprint.

1385
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,080
How did you?

1386
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,680
Well, it's fighting them in the ass now.

1387
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,040
Now it's all on the record.

1388
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:24,360
Now people will go see their shoddy work on yesterland.

1389
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:28,640
Can you imagine if somebody is, somebody explaining to this Patreon that they,

1390
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:33,120
they give money to and they say, well, you know, there was a really funny part in

1391
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:37,600
the last episode where there was a, about an hour and five minutes in after they

1392
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:42,480
had been done 20 minute talking about Jim Belushi, there was a, a dipping sauce

1393
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,880
mistake that was really, really, uh, it was like, I was on the edge of my seat

1394
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,560
trying to figure out what was happening.

1395
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,320
And then I was like, really?

1396
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,480
Like as many twists and turns as like a great episode of prestige television,

1397
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,200
then the other person would just like, uh, you know, never talk to them again.

1398
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:05,000
The other person would, uh, take out their phone, uh, like take that person's

1399
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:10,080
phone from them, ask for the code, enter it, uh, go, uh, uh, go into their

1400
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,320
Patreon account and unsubscribe from it.

1401
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:13,440
Right.

1402
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:14,960
Right.

1403
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,880
We got to get you out of this thing.

1404
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,120
We got to deprogram you.

1405
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,280
This is a, yeah, this is a cult.

1406
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,120
I can tell this is a cult.

1407
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:28,520
No, but you would say now good boys and seats and you're talking different.

1408
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,280
Your terminology has changed.

1409
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:35,320
This is like, it's because it's like, I just watched tenant this week and it's

1410
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,920
because you're catching the bullet.

1411
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,840
You're not firing the bullet folks.

1412
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:39,480
Check it out.

1413
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:40,960
Tenant pretty good.

1414
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,280
Had a good time.

1415
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,520
Oh, all right.

1416
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,720
Well, I haven't seen it yet.

1417
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,520
Um, what was the character's name at this, at this establishment

1418
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,560
again that I liked?

1419
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,000
Boardwalk Betsy.

1420
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,160
Boardwalk Betsy.

1421
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,040
I like her.

1422
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:56,800
I'd like her to come back in some capacity much more than any other

1423
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,800
generic, uh, characters that were around.

1424
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,040
Why do you like her?

1425
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:05,200
Uh, I, she suggests a personality to me.

1426
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:11,280
You know, she seems like she's got like, brassy feels like she would give you

1427
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:15,320
the business if you came into her restaurant, not in like a, not in a

1428
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:19,040
dick slash resort way, maybe, but like a folksy or friendlier way.

1429
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,360
I don't know what's not to like about this woman winking at us.

1430
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,880
Is she winking or is her eye permanently like that?

1431
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:33,040
Was there, did she get splashed by, did he get splashed by the oil from a strip

1432
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,240
or a chip or a dip?

1433
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:39,480
It's possible like a pirate or an evil sailor splashed oil in her eye.

1434
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,440
Also, what could have happened in her seed travels?

1435
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,000
She is in a, in a boat hat.

1436
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:46,640
Yeah.

1437
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:49,600
But they like, they came into the restaurant and they like grabbed the

1438
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,760
fry basket and threw it at her.

1439
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,520
But then like she beat the shit out of them.

1440
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,560
Cause she's also tough.

1441
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,280
I'm imagining a whole life for this woman is what I'm saying.

1442
01:07:59,440 --> 01:07:59,960
Yeah.

1443
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:04,200
Um, she, so she killed a couple people, Boardwalk Betsy killed a couple

1444
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,760
people, but they had it coming.

1445
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:06,800
Oh yeah.

1446
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,880
Anything that, any person that Boardwalk Betsy's killed, they had it coming.

1447
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,800
It was well-deserved and God would, God would not judge her.

1448
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,840
He'd be like, yup, they deserved it.

1449
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,440
That's what he would say when she got to heaven, right?

1450
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,760
Right this way, Betsy.

1451
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,840
And your eye is healed.

1452
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:23,480
He'd also say that.

1453
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:27,080
Some here, I guess Betsy, wait, there's a quote from Betsy.

1454
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,560
The, the cluck stops here.

1455
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:33,880
See, that's, I mean, she seems to have the same like comedic voice of the whole

1456
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:34,440
park.

1457
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,360
Uh, I will say that.

1458
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:40,120
That's another thing God would have said when letting her into heaven is the

1459
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,240
clock stops here in heaven.

1460
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:42,800
You live here.

1461
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:43,120
Yeah.

1462
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:43,760
Yeah.

1463
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,240
Right.

1464
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:48,440
God has a sense of humor, like the, all the signs at California adventure.

1465
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:49,960
That's the thing.

1466
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:50,880
I w I don't know that.

1467
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,040
I just know that because of Scott telling about it, because of all his

1468
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:54,800
religious training.

1469
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,680
I don't trust any of these signs now.

1470
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,040
They gaslighting me.

1471
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,400
Jason is really worried now.

1472
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:06,400
He's really worried that he's going to get something wrong when it comes to a

1473
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:06,960
sign.

1474
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,640
Uh, I think it's all right.

1475
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:09,320
It's okay.

1476
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:13,040
I don't, I want you to be comfortable as we go here.

1477
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,880
Are you going, are you afraid like you're going to get the man hat in beach

1478
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,400
sign wrong for some reason?

1479
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:24,200
I truly, I did not remember any of these, you know, I don't remember man and beach.

1480
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:24,520
Sure.

1481
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,080
I walked by all of this.

1482
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:26,320
Yeah.

1483
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,680
I never the store.

1484
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:36,560
It's a hat store called man hat in beach, man hat and beach, like man hat and

1485
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,920
beach, which is a part of California that you might not know.

1486
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:40,560
Cause you don't live here.

1487
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,360
Cause who cares?

1488
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,560
Why would you go to a beach?

1489
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,680
Why would you care about that?

1490
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:44,880
Why is this?

1491
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,520
I remember dino jack, sunglass shack.

1492
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,160
Cause in a pinch I did buy a pair of sunglasses there once.

1493
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:52,800
And I like the dinosaur.

1494
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:53,040
I do.

1495
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,640
We have an argument about the dinosaur on the show before I kind of like that

1496
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:00,400
dinosaur more of a girdy man myself.

1497
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,920
That's exactly what I was going to say.

1498
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:08,640
This is like the way that I like the city facade effect in, in, uh, Disney

1499
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,400
studios, but I don't like it in Hollywood.

1500
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,200
I think it's similar.

1501
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:16,080
I like girthy the dinosaur who sells you ice cream in Disney's Hollywood

1502
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:21,120
studios, but I don't really care for dinosaur jack and his sunglass shack.

1503
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:27,280
Why is one big dinosaur, uh, less silly, more believable than the other?

1504
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:27,840
I don't know.

1505
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,040
I can't tell the difference, but dinosaur jack seems cheaper to me.

1506
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,920
That is our Jack definitely is cheaper.

1507
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:40,160
And I think the original dinosaur jack paint job does look really odd.

1508
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,320
It looks like dinosaur jack is sick or something.

1509
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:48,560
He was bright pink originally, but bright pink dinosaur.

1510
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:54,560
Maybe it's that old, I was going to say it's like the castle cake maybe coming back.

1511
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,640
Maybe I don't like my, my big gaudy pinks.

1512
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,200
Well, I'm it's a bad pink.

1513
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:02,240
I think I don't even, it looks faded in all the pictures I've seen.

1514
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,040
And maybe that's just the photography, but it also, he just has like yellow

1515
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,640
rashes all over him.

1516
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,360
It doesn't look like fun spots on an animal.

1517
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,480
It looks, it looks, yeah, it looks like he's ill.

1518
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,720
But when he's green, when he's later on in green, I think he looks cool.

1519
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,200
It's not as good as Gertie though.

1520
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,200
I will, I will say Gertie is better.

1521
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,160
You think cool.

1522
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,200
You think he looks cool.

1523
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:24,960
Looks kind of cool.

1524
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,320
He's got that kind of like a Bruce Willis shaved head.

1525
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,040
He's got sunglasses on.

1526
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:39,200
Usually we're arguing cute, but now we're arguing is dinosaur jack from the sunglass shack cool.

1527
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,280
I guess he is in sunglasses.

1528
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:41,920
I'll give you that.

1529
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:42,720
Yeah.

1530
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:46,720
I mean, like this, this is a cool, cool that, I mean, how many people

1531
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:47,840
wear sunglasses aren't cool.

1532
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,920
First of all, Jim Belushi does.

1533
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:50,880
Oh, that's true.

1534
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:51,120
Yeah.

1535
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:51,760
You got me there.

1536
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,520
I think, yeah, I think he looks, there's this picture here.

1537
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,520
I'll, I'll, I'll share it.

1538
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,240
And I think you'll see what I'm saying that this character looks cool.

1539
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:01,520
I think you'll know.

1540
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:04,960
See, like right here, like.

1541
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:10,880
Like why does that angle show me that he's cool more than another one would?

1542
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,200
He's looking down the nose.

1543
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:13,680
He's looking.

1544
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,360
He's doing that kind of like, he's checking out what's going on.

1545
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,840
And maybe he's just checking out what's going across the pier.

1546
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,280
And he's got a vibe in this picture.

1547
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:26,960
Sometimes if you see a farther away picture of him, you can kind of see his like not as cool body.

1548
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,920
I will say his head is much cooler than his body.

1549
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,840
His body looks less cool.

1550
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,720
His body looks kind of more like toyish childish.

1551
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:37,520
But I do think his head looks pretty cool.

1552
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,240
I think he looks cool just from the neck up.

1553
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,800
And Gertie looks realistic.

1554
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,800
Gertie is more of a realistic dinosaur.

1555
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:45,920
Yeah.

1556
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:52,640
Gertie's more, you know, just steadfast, like a good trustworthy friend, but is Gertie cool?

1557
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:53,120
I don't know.

1558
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:54,320
Dinosaur.

1559
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:58,720
What do you think is the, if this dinosaur Jack sticking his sunglasses down,

1560
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,440
if he had something to say to you that was cool.

1561
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:03,280
Well, if he.

1562
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,160
What might that be?

1563
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:05,760
Well, if it's a.

1564
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:06,800
Smoke cigarettes, kids.

1565
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,160
Anybody got a smoke?

1566
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:13,360
Well, what would he say if it was 2001 California adventure?

1567
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,640
He would make a pun, I guess.

1568
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,680
But it would be like a cooler end pun.

1569
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:19,520
Yeah, he would.

1570
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,920
I'm peering over at the pier, he would say.

1571
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:27,920
That's what he would do.

1572
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:28,880
And you'd go, oh, cool.

1573
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,320
That's cool.

1574
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:31,200
That's cool.

1575
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:31,840
That is cool.

1576
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:33,200
That's very cool.

1577
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:33,760
What he said.

1578
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:34,960
Yeah.

1579
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,320
That's what he would say.

1580
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,560
So I like.

1581
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:39,440
Future so bright.

1582
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:43,120
I got to wear a pair of the things you can buy in my body.

1583
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:47,040
Because you buy the sunglasses in the middle of his gut.

1584
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,040
Can you bring that picture back up?

1585
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:57,920
I noticed that dinosaur Jack or dino Jack, as it says on this pin,

1586
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:03,360
if you look closely, there is a pin of a Disney pin trading pin.

1587
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,520
Specifically from the piece of Disney history line

1588
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:12,800
that features a small container of a piece of him that you could buy.

1589
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:13,300
Whoa.

1590
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:14,160
What?

1591
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:15,040
Yes.

1592
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:18,560
This was a line of pins or at least one line of pins.

1593
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,760
Maybe they've done more where like closed things.

1594
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,560
They have sold pieces of it inside a tiny little.

1595
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,520
Really?

1596
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,480
I didn't realize they did this because this is like baseball cards.

1597
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,840
High end baseball cards often will have like,

1598
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,320
and the best cards will have pieces of Jersey,

1599
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:38,160
pieces of an actual baseball on like inside the card.

1600
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,000
And this is the same kind of idea.

1601
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,600
These must be worth a fortune.

1602
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:50,160
That piece of dinosaur Jack, an inch, a less than inch wide piece of dinosaur Jack.

1603
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:56,000
I will say it's kind of fucked up because he's a character and it's not a Jersey.

1604
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:57,280
Yeah.

1605
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:00,000
They cut, they cut him into little pieces.

1606
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,040
They dismembered him.

1607
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:05,120
And now you can buy a tiny piece of the dinosaur.

1608
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,080
But I didn't know they did those.

1609
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:12,000
Boardwalk Betsy tore him up by with her bare hands.

1610
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:15,200
Yeah.

1611
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:18,320
Just raw strength and grit and determination.

1612
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:26,720
And she took tiny pieces of a dinosaur and glued it to a pin to sell for a good markup.

1613
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,960
Man, I got to find out how much these are because they're

1614
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:29,460
$30.

1615
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:29,960
$30.

1616
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:32,660
Here's $30 on eBay.

1617
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:33,780
Yeah.

1618
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:37,060
They should have done that to Botanicus at least so we could have had a piece of him and

1619
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:37,940
not let him decay.

1620
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:43,380
You know, I have a little, just a little, a little piece of his shoulder.

1621
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:46,500
I have a little, yeah, it's like right in the middle of his chest.

1622
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:49,060
This is, I have Botanicus's skin.

1623
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:54,740
I have Botanicus's toenail, his little toenail.

1624
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:58,820
I have this in a pin and I wear it now because I'm a creep.

1625
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:06,820
If I get all the pieces of Botanicus's skin, I can sew it all back together and then be inside it.

1626
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:11,380
And then I'm, I'm wearing a Botanicus skin suit and I'm Botanicus.

1627
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:11,880
Yeah.

1628
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:13,080
Yeah.

1629
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,380
Man, well this is, then that's possible with Dino Jack.

1630
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:19,300
Yeah. If you could piece enough pins together.

1631
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:22,980
I could recreate the coolest character in theme park history.

1632
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,420
Wow. We got to, we got to track this down.

1633
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:31,380
We got to track all the Dino Jack pieces down so I can recreate them inside this apartment.

1634
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:37,860
Do you consider the orange stinger orange a character or is it a setting?

1635
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:44,260
Do I consider New York a character in movies?

1636
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:45,300
That's the question here.

1637
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,900
And I would say sometimes depending on the film.

1638
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:54,740
So I guess depending on the context, I could consider that orange a character.

1639
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:55,240
Yes.

1640
01:16:56,420 --> 01:17:00,180
Are there pieces, are there pieces I can buy of the orange?

1641
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:01,140
Is that where you're headed with this?

1642
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,860
Uh, I don't know. I got to look this up.

1643
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:05,620
I want to know what other.

1644
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:10,020
Yeah. I want to know what other things they took down that we can buy

1645
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:13,780
like microscopic pieces of in a pin.

1646
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:17,460
Just buy whatever you can and turn it into one big Frankenstein.

1647
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:23,140
That's like lots of, that's made up of a thousand different obscure theme park characters.

1648
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:28,180
I could fix the problem with Dino Jack is that he didn't have a cool body somehow.

1649
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:33,060
I could make a cool body for him to put that cool, put the cool head on.

1650
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:37,380
Dino Jack, I'm going to make you the cool body you never had.

1651
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:42,020
Really the plus up I would just say is just put a big leather jacket on him.

1652
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:45,060
That's all I would be interested in, but we'll see.

1653
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:46,980
Yeah. We'll see. Depending on the pieces I can get.

1654
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:52,660
Huh. I never bought any sunglasses from Dino Jack though, and that's a regret.

1655
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:56,340
No. Yeah. You're going to have a hard time

1656
01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:59,140
ending your life with that on your plate.

1657
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:04,020
Oh yeah. Yeah. That's something you can never get that back.

1658
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:06,180
You can never buy sunglasses from a dinosaur.

1659
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:11,700
That's why you should really, we should all buy things from everywhere that there is

1660
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:16,500
in theme parks so that we never in case that they, in case they go away.

1661
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:20,020
Yeah. Well, you got to be, yeah, you got to be, you cover your bases.

1662
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:22,500
I mean, some of this stuff is still standing.

1663
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:26,100
Cornedale Castle still stands. Golden Zephyr still stands.

1664
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:30,580
I believe Chomping Jellyfish was still standing last time it was there.

1665
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:32,260
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's still there.

1666
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:35,780
It's a nice little sleeper and that's in Disney Sea as well.

1667
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:42,100
That's in the little aerial zone. That's the only common thread between the greatest park

1668
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:46,660
in the world and what was maybe at the time, one of the worst Disney parks in the world

1669
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:51,620
in the same year. They did have the same ride, which it's funny.

1670
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:56,820
Like yeah, jumping jellyfish is like probably one of the top 10 rides in California Adventure

1671
01:18:56,820 --> 01:19:03,540
at this point and it's the worst ride and it's just like, oh, and we also have this in Disney Sea.

1672
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:08,500
Yeah. I have not, I've been on the jellyfish.

1673
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:12,500
I have not been in the, I have not been on Golden Zephyr.

1674
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:17,220
I realize it. I have once, it's closed due to wind a lot.

1675
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:19,940
Yeah. If it's windy out.

1676
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:21,700
Makes me worried. Yeah.

1677
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:25,620
What's wrong with it? All it takes is a little wind.

1678
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:30,980
Yeah. I mean, cause those things are so much like carnival rides and I love like,

1679
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:34,900
I don't even know what you would call the generic version of Silly Symphony Swings or the orange,

1680
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:38,820
whatever the orange thing was. I love that as a kid, but as I get older, I'm like,

1681
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:43,860
this feels much more precarious than other rides. It's just like, there's a chain. There's two chains.

1682
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:48,740
I'm being held up by, I could go flying into the water or into the food court.

1683
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:54,500
Like there's something that makes me a little more anxious now doing those, but I will do them.

1684
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:59,620
I'm not as, it's, I'm trying to think if I'm more freaked out by Mulholland Madness,

1685
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:04,180
Goofy Skyschool or I don't know. It's about, it might be about equal, honestly.

1686
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:05,860
Yeah. But it is fun.

1687
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:11,940
The Silly Symphony Swings are fun. I just am like constantly looking up on those.

1688
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:15,140
Sure. Do you want to talk about the orange?

1689
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:23,060
Yeah. I liked the orange. I don't know. I kind of liked it. I think it was, I think they,

1690
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:28,100
in this area of the park, they were leaning heavily on that style of architecture in California,

1691
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:34,340
where like Tale of the Pup or Idol Hour Bar, which is a bar shaped like a barrel,

1692
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:43,300
like a building shaped like an item or shaped like a thing. And yes, it's just less endearing.

1693
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:48,580
It's fun when you encounter that in the middle of a city. It's a little less fun when you're in

1694
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:53,460
a theme park and everything kind of looks like that already, you know?

1695
01:20:54,900 --> 01:21:00,740
Yeah. I'll say like, I like this orange more than I like the sun at the, like the icon of the

1696
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:07,060
original park. I think it is more fun to look at. It's clearly a little like, I don't know,

1697
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:12,660
gaudy, cheapish, but it's fun to look at. I enjoy looking at it.

1698
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:16,660
Like it looks good with neon at night, actually. Yeah.

1699
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:21,780
Maybe I like the orange. Maybe I, here I thought we were going to, you know,

1700
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:26,340
tear this orange apart, but I, you know, of all the things, because we've talked about

1701
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:31,620
some truly hideous things in this two parter and I don't know, the orange is kind of neat.

1702
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:40,740
It was big. The size, I think the size benefits the neon benefits. And yeah, I mean, it had a

1703
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:45,300
little more theming, a little more thought to it than Malibuumer, which was just nothing.

1704
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,700
Yeah, there's nothing to Malibuumer. Yeah.

1705
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:55,860
Yeah. What I remember about the orange is that I will say this, that like you'd see pictures of

1706
01:21:55,860 --> 01:22:02,740
this park getting built. Because people, if you were staying at the, what's now the Paradise

1707
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:07,620
Pier Hotel, if you had a room in there, you could, you know, very easily look over the fence and see

1708
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:12,180
the stuff that was going in. And all this carnival stuff went in first. The coaster went in first.

1709
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:16,500
And the orange might've been like the first thing up. I think it was pretty easy to build.

1710
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:22,020
So that was sitting there for a while. And I just remember the general feeling. I felt this and

1711
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:26,340
message boards I was going to were like, all right, we got the new park coming. Oh, we got

1712
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:34,420
our first thing up. It's a big orange. Uh oh. Like this does not bode well. And I admit that

1713
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:39,300
that was the feeling at the time. Just like, ah, geez, I don't know. Is it all going to be like

1714
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:47,380
this orange? Is that a sign of what's to come? But you know, now that some of that anger has died down

1715
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:53,140
and now we, and they made the park better. I feel like now if you had to bring, I don't know,

1716
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:56,180
maybe the orange is more interesting than the silly Symphony swings.

1717
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:58,820
Yeah. I like it.

1718
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:04,980
I mean, it's, it's, um, after, since we, I think maybe even if we had done this first,

1719
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:09,940
we might've been harder on it as opposed to going through Hollywood land first. Because like,

1720
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:13,700
when you compare this to stuff in Hollywood land, you go, well, this is fun. I mean, it's,

1721
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:21,620
it's not like classy maybe, but it's fun. Like it doesn't look as much like crap as some of the

1722
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:28,580
other stuff. And I don't know. I, I would say if there's a one piece of the pier, I would be

1723
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:33,940
close to nostalgic for other than the dinosaurs. It would be this. Um, cause when I see, I see the

1724
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:41,940
rest of the pier, you go, ah, I don't miss any of this. Um, but this is, this is fun in hindsight.

1725
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:45,540
And I never was like, if you went with me at California adventure 10 years ago, I was not

1726
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:52,340
like this or like, I, I, I was not upset about the orange or anything, but if I may, I'm analyzing,

1727
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:55,700
you know, as a theme park, uh, analyzer.

1728
01:23:55,700 --> 01:24:00,660
Well, I was going to ask this question. Does, if you had to, uh, snap your fingers,

1729
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:06,820
reverse the Thanos and bring something back, if one thing could come back from DCA 1.0,

1730
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:11,380
um, I was going to ask that question. My answer was going to be the orange. Is it,

1731
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:18,260
is that the answer for all of us? It could be ride or it could be a writer. It could be one

1732
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:26,020
like sign, anything you want, but only one. That is a very good question. Oh my gosh. I'm on the

1733
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:34,580
spot here. Um, let me think only one. I mean, I, can it be an ironic pick? Does it have to be sincere?

1734
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:40,180
I think, I think you define that it's just, what would you like to see there again?

1735
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:47,860
I would like superstar limo to be in the park. Oh yeah. Yeah. Sure. Sure. It would be great to go

1736
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:53,940
on it. Yeah. Like a couple times a year. I probably this again, I w I keep apologizing to monsters

1737
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:58,260
in cried, no offense monsters in cry, which are very good, but I think I would go on superstar

1738
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:04,020
limo more. I would go on it every time I went to the park. I think so. Yeah. I would have to say it.

1739
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:08,340
Yeah. Um, I think, yeah. So that would be my number one pick, but if we're talking like

1740
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:15,300
aesthetic choices, uh, yeah, I think, or I could see orange being the one, bring the orange back

1741
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:18,980
in some capacity. You could even class it up. You know, what you could do is you could class it up

1742
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:24,100
a little bit with a different type of paint job. The paint, the orange in here is very like, I don't

1743
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:28,580
know how, what you would call it. It's not like there's no like gradient. There's no shading

1744
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:33,940
necessarily on it. But I think if you maybe just painted it a little bit more to fit in with the

1745
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:37,780
aesthetic of the pier that the Pixar pier now, I think you could make it work.

1746
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:46,340
More mature orange. A more mature classy orange. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Um, well, what would we not

1747
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:52,820
bring back of what's left? Oh, I've got the most egregious thing, uh, that we haven't talked about

1748
01:25:52,820 --> 01:26:02,420
yet. The SS rust worthy. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I, I, I, I don't know how I just blocked this out. I think

1749
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:06,740
I just associate it with like, oh, there's kids play area over here. It was a little ship

1750
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:13,300
jumping jellyfish. Okay. And just went along my way in college. Um, I have to say, I did not know

1751
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:24,100
until I started researching this episode about the horrifying faceless firemen, the nightmare

1752
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:31,140
creature that in theory, a child stands behind and they have fun water fights with this hose.

1753
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:38,340
Uh, in reality, it just looks like a ghost, uh, it's constantly standing there.

1754
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:45,940
Oh yeah. It is, it is a very scary without an actual human head in there. Um, yeah, I don't,

1755
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:50,980
I did not know anything about the ghost. Are they, oh, wait, Jason, are you smarter scare them or the

1756
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:56,020
doll face spectrum? Oh, well, it's gotta be doll face spectrum, man. Cause that's just imprinted

1757
01:26:56,020 --> 01:27:01,780
on me at like a primal, you know, young, young ages, my brain was still developing, but, um,

1758
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:08,100
yeah, I really did not like the firemen. Uh, when I stumbled upon it, I get the need for a kids play

1759
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:13,700
area, but when it's just like, uh, it makes me ship the olive at islands of adventure, it looked

1760
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:19,700
like a masterwork of aesthetics of pleasing aesthetics. Yeah. Well, they were, they, um,

1761
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:24,900
they were metal. They were flat too. That picture you're showing had looked like it had some

1762
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:31,220
dimension. So they were like, oddly like detailed, like it really, I think would look okay in a photo

1763
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:38,020
op with your kid behind it. It wouldn't just look like a flat. Um, but I, I did not remember this.

1764
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:43,300
I realize, I don't know, I forget where it is, but there was supposed to be a muscle beach play area

1765
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:47,780
that was originally conceived for Disney California adventure. It was going to be

1766
01:27:47,780 --> 01:27:54,900
themed after muscle beach in Venice. That's very, that's odd. That's so odd. Like this,

1767
01:27:54,900 --> 01:28:00,260
Oh, paradise pier might be the oddest part. Did everyone come across the name of the games at the

1768
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:07,540
boardwalk? Uh, I have them somewhere. Oh yeah. Well, you got, yeah. Hey, you got rebounding beach.

1769
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:14,100
Of course I know. Reboundo beach. Uh, they gave up seemingly immediately with angels in the outfield.

1770
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:25,060
Uh, just a movie they had a boardwalk board cow wenga pass. That's okay. That's very specific.

1771
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:33,620
That's very local to like the Disney studios area. Dolphin Derby, new hall, fishery, San Joaquin

1772
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:41,060
volley, rebounding beach and shore shot. Reboundo beach is the best. I think of all of those,

1773
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:46,580
but it's not that great. You got, yeah, you got, okay. So you got rebounding beach. You got

1774
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:52,980
Malibu Ritos. Uh, I mean, there's, there's puns of places in California, Sam, Andreas shakes.

1775
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:57,460
There's all this stuff. We were doing some of these at the beginning of the episodes. Why I

1776
01:28:57,460 --> 01:29:04,100
thought something we could try to do together. Um, okay. So I have a list of California's most

1777
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:10,340
populated cities. Uh, in a minute I'm going to ask one of you for a number and we'll look at what

1778
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:16,580
that city is and we will try to think of something and it could be a ride. It could be a, uh, a

1779
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:22,660
carnival game. It could be just an item at a restaurant. Um, I don't know what's, what's left

1780
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:29,380
if it lends itself to like a bathroom amenity. Um, but I, this, this seems like just let's,

1781
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:37,940
let's try to think like 2001, um, imagine your namers. Um, so let's see, um, uh, well, I don't

1782
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:42,340
know. One of you, one of you just call it a number. Let's keep it in more known city. So like, so one

1783
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:52,740
to a hundred, uh, eight, eight. Um, eight is Oakland. Okay. Um, okay. Which is the, so that's,

1784
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:56,420
that's, that's a pretty big one and nothing was, I don't think was named after Oakland.

1785
01:29:57,300 --> 01:30:04,420
Okay. It's a bicycle shop called Spokeland. Pretty good. Pretty good. I was going to say a,

1786
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:10,180
it could be a kid's water area, uh, like the rest worthy, uh, called Sokeland.

1787
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:16,020
Or it's like, uh, it's like an egg slut type restaurant called Yokeland.

1788
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:21,460
That's pretty good. Yokeland they should have done. Absolutely. Yeah. Yokeland's pretty good.

1789
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:27,140
That's a breakfast spot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Geez. Wow. Wow. If this isn't another hire,

1790
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:31,700
if this isn't another resume here, or this isn't another proof of concept that we're

1791
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:39,140
sketching out. Boy, I've got one, but it's worse. I've got one. Uh, but instead of grizzly peak,

1792
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:46,020
do you do a redwood area called Oaksland? Sure. That's what you call the wooded area.

1793
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:53,700
Instead of naming it after a real place with, with Oaks. Yes. You do Oaksland.

1794
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:59,540
Pretty good. I don't know. I like it. Do you want to do one further down the list of a hundred?

1795
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:09,700
Yeah. Can I get, um, 21 21 lucky 21. This is a little close. Oxnard. Um, okay. Well, Soxnard.

1796
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:21,860
Yeah. Soxnard there. Uh, uh, yeah. I mean, now that they own Fox, you could do Foxnard and it's all

1797
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:26,100
the Fox property. Yeah. It's all your friends. It's all your Fox friends. There's Pixar appear

1798
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:32,260
and there's Foxnard. Foxnard is like it's in the Fox area in California venture. So theme is still

1799
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:38,260
to California. That's good. So it's alien and all that stuff. Where you get your Kevin McAllister

1800
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:44,900
merchandise. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, that's pretty good. Um, but here we, let's, let's do

1801
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:53,620
one more. Let's uh, get anyone closer to the bottom. 98. 98. Um, uh, Newport beach. We already

1802
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:58,740
got some beaches. We got a reboundo beach in Manhattan beach, but Newport is not represented.

1803
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:11,940
It's a stew restaurant. It's two port beach. Well, you got my vote. It's all stew. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1804
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:18,580
Cause here's your first dollar. Oh, I have it for Cal Universal. Group port beach.

1805
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:22,980
Oh, that's good. Grooves beach from a Despicable Me.

1806
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:31,620
Pretty good. Get it. Go the other side and do Newport beach. Also, that's good. Yeah.

1807
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:40,740
Well, it's got to be more, but that was not, um, terrible effort. I don't think none of those were

1808
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:47,860
at a Newport reach. I didn't think maybe that one was, but yeah, all of these could have been in the

1809
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:55,300
park. I don't think anything was too absurd for the, for the quality for the line they had there.

1810
01:32:57,060 --> 01:33:02,260
Could I just say real quick? I like the SS Rustworthy. I kind of think it's cool. Yeah. Yeah.

1811
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:06,980
I think it's cool. If we fully explain it's like that, it's like it's, it's shifts that it's

1812
01:33:06,980 --> 01:33:11,380
presented by McDonald's as a part of the McDonald's presence in the park. And the reason it's called

1813
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:16,820
the trust it's called the Rustworthy is it's kind of like missing a T that fell off of the sign.

1814
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:23,220
So it's supposed to be SS trustworthy, which it does say in some setting, but maybe it's not so

1815
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:28,420
trustworthy because the T fell off. So now it's the SS Rustworthy. I think the ship looks like

1816
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:36,580
more well-themed than a lot of the stuff in DCA 1.0. Well, look at that. That sort of like,

1817
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:42,180
like water stain at the, but you know, you know, like we're complaining that everything looks too

1818
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:48,660
clean, but look at it at the rust, right? On the, on the stern. I will use the word stern

1819
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:55,700
because the captions there. Yeah. Like that actually is more subtle and well done. I think

1820
01:33:55,700 --> 01:34:03,540
than, than a lot of it. That's more Disney Seas Alley. A McDonald's boat. Sign me up just for the

1821
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:09,620
concept alone. And then I see it and I go, Oh, pretty good. Obviously I could use a Grimace or

1822
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:15,300
two. I could use Grimace. I could use a Fry Guy on here. I could use Birdie, but that's the only

1823
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:18,500
plus of I would have for it. I think other than that, like if you were a kid and you're like,

1824
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:22,820
I would like to go on the McDonald's ship. Wait, were those surfboards that you could kind of

1825
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:28,420
teeter on? That's a cool playground mechanism. Yeah. It looks dangerous, but yeah, it does look

1826
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:33,860
very dangerous. Oh yeah. That looks not very high, but yeah, those kids are going to eat shit. I mean,

1827
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:38,980
they're going to fall, but it was fun before they fell. Yeah. I like this. I think this looks like

1828
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:46,980
this would be fine. This would, this looks like Toontown level. Yeah. You know what? Wow. Well,

1829
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:53,860
here, like there's some surprises in there. This isn't all, uh, snarking and dunking. We like the

1830
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:59,940
orange. We like the Rustworthy. There used to be a back entrance right over here too. If you're

1831
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:05,620
staying at Paradise Pier, you could get in. It very much reminded me of like back in the early

1832
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:10,420
2000s. If you stayed at the Hard Rock at Universal Orlando, you could just go through like an employee

1833
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:16,180
parking lot and an access path and be right at the front gates of, uh, the original universal park.

1834
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:20,740
And they would tell you about it at the front desk, but there weren't really signs saying to use it.

1835
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:26,100
So that's gone. That's closed. That's gone because you got to hit metal detectors. Now they direct

1836
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:31,300
you like, Oh, take the path around the hotel and then hit the metal detector. But yeah, you can just

1837
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:39,140
kind of wander over back in the day. And, um, here's, here's my question now. We're getting,

1838
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:42,180
we're already talking about Rustworthy. We're really close to burger invasion. I feel like you

1839
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:46,500
got to end with burger invasion. What do we want to finish? Uh, what do we want to fit in before

1840
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:53,140
burger invasion? Oh, um, uh, just maybe the aesthetic of California screaming, like I never

1841
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:58,500
had a problem with the Mickey symbol, but in like now looking at just Mickey on the fun wheel,

1842
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:04,660
taking Mickey off of the roller coaster, it's clear how much better that is. Like,

1843
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:10,900
it's, it's so, it makes such a difference just having paradise pier written on the coaster and

1844
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:18,340
Mickey on the Ferris wheel. Like too many, too many big shapes in this place. Yeah. I don't hate the

1845
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:24,740
old Mickey on the, on the roller coaster, but yeah, I, it's just, it's funny that I, I wouldn't have

1846
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:29,460
been able to identify these problems. I mean, I would have known that that weird sun scares me on

1847
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:33,780
the, on the Ferris wheel, but other than that, it's interesting. I go, man, that does look so much

1848
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:39,780
better. Yeah. Um, after the fact. Um, so yeah, I don't know. I don't have any, a ton more thoughts.

1849
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:47,620
I don't have much to say about, uh, pizza. Um, Mao Mao. However, I here's this, this something clicked

1850
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:55,140
for me when I was watching a, um, a video about, called the wacky weirdness that was Disney's

1851
01:36:55,140 --> 01:37:01,220
California adventure. And that's by a YouTuber named magically Emily. Um, and what she, something

1852
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:07,780
she said, I think really, uh, you really see it in pizza, um, Mao Mao, but you see it all over the

1853
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:12,660
place. Pizza, um, Mao Mao is kind of like Tiki themed and it's like a cool surf shack where they

1854
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:19,780
make pizza and everything's looks annoying. And that's too many fonts fighting. Um, but this, uh,

1855
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:26,900
what, what she said in the video is that a lot of California adventure, um, feels like Blizzard

1856
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:32,900
beach, you know, like it's stuff that you would, things that you would forgive because it's just a

1857
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:38,020
water park and it's kind of this kooky thing. And you're, so your level of theming expectation

1858
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:45,860
is a little lower. You're fine with some kind of eye rolly pun stuff. Um, but yeah, or, you know,

1859
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:51,540
it's essentially a tin shack, but they kind of put some funny and there's an implied character

1860
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:56,980
of who runs it, but you kind of expect something higher with a full theme park. Doesn't that feel

1861
01:37:56,980 --> 01:38:02,100
right though? It is a lot of this is very Blizzard beachy and you're, it's fine there, but I don't

1862
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:09,540
know about it here. Yeah, it's, it is, I mean, you, depending on what your expectations are for

1863
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:15,220
something matters a ton. I don't know in anything, movies, TV, theme parks, like you're going into a

1864
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:21,780
water park, you expect it to be fine. You don't expect there hasn't been yet a water park on a

1865
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:28,340
theming level of what the Disney sea or the best Disney park. So you're never going to fully expect

1866
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:33,220
you'll always be blown away. I like volcano Bay. The volcano is amazing. It's incredible. Then the

1867
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:38,660
rides and slides are fun, but still they didn't go all out on theming for those things. So we have yet

1868
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:43,540
to get to a place where you like, you expect everything to be a certain way in a water park.

1869
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:49,140
And it's like, yeah, this, this feels like that aesthetic. It is obviously like connected. We've

1870
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:54,980
talked about the ninetiesness of Disney world, which we like in some ways, but you can definitely

1871
01:38:54,980 --> 01:39:02,580
feel like it's time to end the nineties in the, with the aesthetic of 2001 California adventure.

1872
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:08,420
The nineties must end the Jedi must end the nineties must end and 2001 California adventure

1873
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:12,020
is where like you really can feel it. So yeah, I totally agree with what she's saying.

1874
01:39:12,020 --> 01:39:17,380
Well, I think Paradise Pier, they also like split the difference because like the first,

1875
01:39:17,380 --> 01:39:24,180
like half of it they're going for like early 20th century seaside amusement town,

1876
01:39:24,180 --> 01:39:31,220
like the billboards are old timey kind of, even though it's for Coke and copper tone or whatever.

1877
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:37,860
When you, you come around that part of the pier and California screaming, old timey Calliope music,

1878
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:43,220
and it's made to look like an old wooden coaster. And then you run like faced first into like

1879
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:52,420
late 20th century kitsch. And it, it, it doesn't, it doesn't quite marry well. And that is kind of

1880
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:57,940
what like some seaside resort towns are like, they preserve some of it. And then some of it

1881
01:39:57,940 --> 01:40:04,660
changes as people like stop caring about frozen yogurt and they want, you know, rolled ice cream,

1882
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:12,020
like whatever the trend of the moment is the, the Fortnite shirts give way to, I don't know,

1883
01:40:13,060 --> 01:40:17,060
minion shirts or reverse that angry birds. I don't know what's in what timeline,

1884
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:24,020
yeah, angry birds, but it, that kind of changes. But like these parks don't quite change that way.

1885
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:30,020
Like these parks aren't updated as much. They kind of stay put for a little while. So I think the,

1886
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:37,460
the pizza, um, while, while the design inside, it does look like, you know, you go to long beach or

1887
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:42,260
Newport beach in California and there was like, Hey, this is a burger and beer place. We've been

1888
01:40:42,260 --> 01:40:47,700
on diners, drive-ins and dives. Uh, we've been, my grandfather started this 50 years ago. He was a

1889
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:54,980
surfer and we've kept it going, et cetera, et cetera. But it's like, we'll just drive to that

1890
01:40:54,980 --> 01:41:02,020
place. Don't eat this terrible pizza. Just go to that place. Like it's not, it doesn't transport

1891
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:09,540
you to somewhere that you couldn't get to, um, in California. Yeah. It's just, it also, it just also

1892
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:14,740
feels like it's of, of the moment, which you can, I don't think there's a good example of something

1893
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:19,460
that lasted in theme parks that are, that's so of the moment. Like it has to be more.

1894
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:24,420
We're in the way that we're like, this thing's great. It's so eighties and, but also that's

1895
01:41:24,420 --> 01:41:28,260
what you love or even like the haunted mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean are kind of indelibly

1896
01:41:28,260 --> 01:41:33,940
sixties. They're timeless, but they're sixties and things are, Epcot's timeless, but it's eighties.

1897
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:37,140
Is anything timeless, but it's 2001?

1898
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:44,100
Well, that's a good question. I, all that stuff comes in waves. I even remember when I felt like

1899
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:47,860
people were like, it turned completely on the eighties and the eighties aesthetic and even

1900
01:41:47,860 --> 01:41:52,500
eighties music. I feel like I remember that in like even college when it was like that stuff's

1901
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:57,780
date, like it felt dated. So I don't know if we're even there yet. I guess is where I'm going with

1902
01:41:57,780 --> 01:42:03,620
20 years though. That should be, it is 20 years. There's certainly things that are like

1903
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:08,100
probably like, you know, pulled out and remember and fondly recalled from then, but

1904
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:13,140
maybe not a lot in theme park world. Yeah. I don't know. That's a good question.

1905
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:19,700
I have a maybe related question. I was just saying I'm waiting. I in, in indie rock and roll,

1906
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:23,940
I think there's a big resurgence in sort of an early nineties sound. None of these bands are

1907
01:42:23,940 --> 01:42:28,100
that popular. I don't think, but even, but some are, some are moderately popular and I'm like,

1908
01:42:28,180 --> 01:42:35,460
is there going to be a resurgence of my beloved teen years of like the third eye blind matchbox

1909
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:40,740
20, the bare naked ladies sound, will that come, will that be coming back in the next five to 10

1910
01:42:40,740 --> 01:42:45,540
years? It's I think it's possible. Will I be the one to do it? Maybe that's also possible.

1911
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:50,900
You're going to start, you now are going to start a matchbox 20

1912
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:54,980
tribute band. That's going to be cool. Not a tribute, but it'll be like, oh, you know,

1913
01:42:54,980 --> 01:43:00,420
this is the similar, man, this sounds just as good as more than you think you are.

1914
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:05,620
The matchbox 20 album or, you know, it's possible. I'm just saying it's possible. I'm not saying I'm

1915
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:13,220
doing it. Sure. Sure. Well, but with it's new radicals mania out there again, post an operation,

1916
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:19,460
obviously. So well, there's, there's fun accounts like catalog. I mean, there's accounts on the Y2K

1917
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:25,380
aesthetic Institute on Twitter. And there's a lot of accounts around that cataloging some of the

1918
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:31,940
early 2000s design stuff. And some of it is very fun. And you're starting to see like designers

1919
01:43:31,940 --> 01:43:39,700
and fashion, like call it back. But it's possible. What I'm saying is I don't think we appreciate a

1920
01:43:39,700 --> 01:43:44,180
lot of this stuff right now, but who knows in five years, maybe we will look like fools for goofing

1921
01:43:44,180 --> 01:43:49,540
on all this in a couple of years because maybe it's not in fashion. It's like not our choice,

1922
01:43:49,540 --> 01:43:54,580
like what we pull from then. Cause we went through it and we were like, we took things for granted.

1923
01:43:54,580 --> 01:43:58,180
We don't have an outsider perspective. We're just like, I remember then everything kind of looked

1924
01:43:58,180 --> 01:44:03,220
like shit. Maybe that's how people feel about the eighties. Like maybe you have to like be more

1925
01:44:03,220 --> 01:44:08,820
removed from it to say, wait, no, no, no, this was cool. And this was cool. Right. Yeah. That's true.

1926
01:44:09,460 --> 01:44:16,420
To us on a similar note, I wanted to ask this question. The vibe of California adventure in

1927
01:44:16,420 --> 01:44:20,820
general, that's what a lot of this has been about. And I'm thinking about that opening special,

1928
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:25,860
especially to like the way that it's, you know, like the way that Barry Bustwick and Richard

1929
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:31,540
Kind are dressed and the way Drew Carey's dressed in the ride. I feel like, you know, it's bright

1930
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:37,060
yellow, like big bowling shirts and then like, yeah, annoying fonts like pizza, um, it's like,

1931
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:43,220
and it's all tilted and, uh, colors that don't really, man, it's, it's kooky. It's supposed to

1932
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:48,260
be that way. I was just trying to think like, are there, is there anything else in pop culture,

1933
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:55,620
I'm talking outside of theme parks that you would say is the vibe of California adventure 1.0?

1934
01:44:56,260 --> 01:45:02,020
And I have a little list of what I thought of, but if you want to, if you want to add anything to the

1935
01:45:02,020 --> 01:45:07,540
list, because I don't, there's no name for this aesthetic. Maybe, maybe DCIS is the,

1936
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:15,140
the term for the aesthetic. I mean, that can drive it. Um, but does anything strike you as like,

1937
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:19,140
oh yeah, that is also like early DCI.

1938
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:26,020
Huh. Anything and anything like a place or that. That's what I'm thinking. I'm just thinking other

1939
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:31,940
pop culture. I'll list a couple things and just see if anything else occurs, occurs to you. Um,

1940
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:40,660
I think, um, Smash Mouth in general. Yes. Yes. Some retro there. I think retro is a nice part of it.

1941
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:48,500
I think the movie from Justin to Kelly is kind of like California, early California adventure.

1942
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:57,860
Master of disguise, you might say. Um, it's kind of like, that's almost like a Mr. Six movie. That's

1943
01:45:57,860 --> 01:46:04,100
like if there was a Mr. Six full feature film, it would be master of disguise. Um, I think that,

1944
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:11,380
I think the Drew Carey show in general, but specifically Mimi, I think the character Mimi,

1945
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:17,540
early California adventure is like walking around Mimi. If you could be, if you could be,

1946
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:22,420
if there was, if you could be Mimi, like being John Malkovich, it's, it's, you'd be here. Um,

1947
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:26,100
and even though it came later, the John Lovitz comedy club,

1948
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:31,300
you could have absolutely planted the John Lovitz comedy club in the middle of California adventure.

1949
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:39,380
And I think John, John Lasseter's shirts. Um, well, that's no question. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1950
01:46:40,340 --> 01:46:46,420
Though I'm sure he has a shirt for every era of theme parks. I had assumed. Yeah, absolutely.

1951
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:52,020
Ease of, ease of 2001, Nostalgia. Yeah. Yeah. Those are, that's a good list. I,

1952
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:55,540
I don't know that I can improve on that at all right now, but I, I see what you're saying.

1953
01:46:56,180 --> 01:47:00,980
I, I, the first thing that I thought of, which is not right, it was gone in 60 seconds,

1954
01:47:00,980 --> 01:47:08,500
but that's not right. No, maybe I, I'm trying to remember that poster. I remember it. I remember

1955
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:14,660
it more than some relatives faces, I think. That's a couple of years prior, I think, right? To, uh,

1956
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:19,780
California Metro opening. Can I? No, 2000, it's 2000. I have a couple. That's a little too cool.

1957
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:24,740
Go ahead, Jason. I, I'd like some, some feedback on it. Um, by the way, to answer your earlier

1958
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:28,740
question, the thing I wish that was still there was the ice cream place, ketchup flavor, because

1959
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:34,820
they did a lot of fun stuff with flavor swirls. Okay. So my contribution to your current question,

1960
01:47:34,820 --> 01:47:44,260
um, the J Moore sitcom action. Sure. Yeah. It's even hard to say why, but I know what you mean.

1961
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:50,500
I mean, it's the poster, but also it's kind of, I think Mcgee, that's it. Mcgee, all the Mcgee

1962
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:57,220
videos and Charlie's angel. Definitely Charlie's angels. Okay. Here's another one. The David

1963
01:47:57,220 --> 01:48:05,300
Duchovny, Sean Williams Scott movie evolution. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Um, I'm going to toss

1964
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:11,700
out a dark horse. Yeah. Well, big fat liar. Big liar was what I was about to say. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1965
01:48:12,340 --> 01:48:20,180
Agreed. Um, and I, I do, I do like this movie. It definitely got too much and it definitely got out

1966
01:48:20,180 --> 01:48:26,260
of hand as time went on. But when I saw it, we all had a nice time. Shrek. Yeah. Shrek, Shrek is on

1967
01:48:26,260 --> 01:48:31,460
my list. Yeah. Yeah. Completely. And all the culture surrounding Shrek, general Shrek ism,

1968
01:48:31,460 --> 01:48:38,020
I think ties into Smash Mouth. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, it's probably too mean spirited,

1969
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:42,180
but I think you could make an argument for father of the pride. It's a little later.

1970
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:51,140
Yeah. Yeah. I, um, I don't, I think there's a level of like just all these things just kind

1971
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:56,420
of go for it. They all, they do all take big aesthetic swings. So they, the right swing,

1972
01:48:56,420 --> 01:49:03,700
I don't know. They all, uh, none of them care if their CGI is up to snuff or not. Like we're doing

1973
01:49:03,700 --> 01:49:11,620
it anyway. Yeah. Shit. Bold. Early. I mean, is it like 2000 core? Is that the term?

1974
01:49:11,620 --> 01:49:18,580
2000 core, which I like in like magazine ads or like, like plastic blobby watches, but like

1975
01:49:19,460 --> 01:49:27,220
maybe less so on the, uh, oh my God, I had one. I had one so clear. Oh, I got it. Osmosis Jones.

1976
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:29,940
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.

1977
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:37,700
I know a movie with a stacked cast that I went to see and like very slowly throughout it. I was

1978
01:49:37,700 --> 01:49:44,820
like, Oh no, this isn't very good. Oh no. What about bringing down the house? The, um, is that

1979
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:53,380
the, uh, the queen Latifah Steve Martin movie? Yeah. Yeah. I find them both very endearing. So

1980
01:49:53,380 --> 01:50:01,060
I think it's, I, I probably do not agree though, that here as I share my screen, that this

1981
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:08,820
image of Steve Martin in a bright blue Jersey and bling kicking his leg, his sneaker,

1982
01:50:08,820 --> 01:50:14,340
put up and wearing a knit cap. Doesn't this kind of feel like California adventure to you somehow?

1983
01:50:14,340 --> 01:50:17,860
Well, they had to do this scene very quickly because they had to get that wardrobe back to

1984
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:21,780
Bulworth. Uh, maybe for it.

1985
01:50:21,780 --> 01:50:28,660
Bored. That's pretty good. I think anything that's loud and proud and, and 2000 Z that's,

1986
01:50:28,660 --> 01:50:31,780
that's maybe what I'm saying. Austin powers two and three.

1987
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:42,340
Yeah, but I saw two first, so I, I think I have more affection for two. I saw bad. I know, but I,

1988
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:48,820
I'm thinking, but I think two is a lot trashier movies though than the original, I think. And

1989
01:50:48,820 --> 01:50:54,660
especially the third big time gold member. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Completely. If you know,

1990
01:50:54,660 --> 01:50:58,820
if we have any idea what we're talking about listener, maybe we'll prompt this on Twitter,

1991
01:50:58,820 --> 01:51:05,780
but just like what let's like try to create the aesthetic family tree of DCA 1.0. Cause there's

1992
01:51:05,780 --> 01:51:11,220
got to be, I was like, there has to be this in the wild more. Uh, and I think it, I think it was,

1993
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:16,580
this is a fair amount of examples. Yeah. Zoomers, if you're listening, I'm always hearing young

1994
01:51:16,580 --> 01:51:24,340
people talk about vibes. We're talking vibes. We're talking 2000, 2001 vibes. And I think we

1995
01:51:24,340 --> 01:51:32,660
can have a lot of fun with this. So please, yeah. Keep it, keep it going. Um, let's, uh, I think

1996
01:51:32,660 --> 01:51:37,940
with all that, we, as we said, we know where we have to close the, the dearly departed,

1997
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:44,500
the most egregious thing I think in this entire original park is half a McDonald's menu

1998
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:56,580
or a quarter of the limited McDonald's menu served under a huge sloppy burger that is also

1999
01:51:57,140 --> 01:52:06,340
a spaceship. I guess we're talking about burger invasion hosted by McDonald's. Um,

2000
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:12,260
and yeah, I mean here now, like I'll just share the screens. We're all, I mean, we're probably

2001
01:52:12,260 --> 01:52:18,580
all looking at it to some extent, but like, this is definitely 2000 core. Like this, this font for

2002
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:27,700
sure would have been, uh, up on a poster of a bad movie of the time. And just like, oh my God,

2003
01:52:27,700 --> 01:52:33,220
that this like, look at this pathway leading up to it that you've got like, you know, a nice little

2004
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:40,020
theme park garden on either side of you and your reward at the end is a big, like a long burger.

2005
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:47,060
Isn't this, this looks like a sub of a burger. Yeah, I don't know. I don't, to me it's like a burger

2006
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:52,100
actually would make more, like would actually lend itself to being a UFO much easier than the way

2007
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:59,060
they did it. I don't know why it looks like that. It looks odd. It looks like squished, right? Like

2008
01:53:00,020 --> 01:53:06,340
it should be like bigger or less, a bit less, a bit like less long. Yeah. Like what you're saying.

2009
01:53:06,340 --> 01:53:15,060
It's like weird portholes in the meat and then a bunch of screws and gears on the bottom

2010
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:22,420
bun, but not on the top. You could have also made it like just silver. Like it resembles a hamburger,

2011
01:53:22,420 --> 01:53:26,820
but it's obviously a spaceship, you know, like you could have, like that would have been much less

2012
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:32,900
gross because this looks kind of gross. It looks like it's really, yeah, it looks like fake. I mean,

2013
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:39,700
it's obviously fake, but it looks, it just looks like, I don't know, like in the display of a

2014
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:44,580
restaurant, sometimes they have like a fake burger to make you want to eat the real one. And sometimes

2015
01:53:44,580 --> 01:53:49,780
those are really gross. In Japan, they have that a lot where they have like the plates out in the

2016
01:53:49,780 --> 01:53:54,580
window and sometimes they look fine. And then sometimes they look like artificial or they've

2017
01:53:54,580 --> 01:53:59,460
been treated so they don't spoil. So something's not rotting in the window, but this looks like,

2018
01:53:59,460 --> 01:54:06,980
yeah, like this looks like some play food, like a giant piece of play food that's been squished.

2019
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:11,140
It's weird. I don't know why you, this would not make anyone hungry.

2020
01:54:11,780 --> 01:54:16,820
And presumably they still had some of the blueprints for the sci-fi dining,

2021
01:54:16,820 --> 01:54:24,420
like just some of that. Like what went so wrong between Disney MGM studios and this?

2022
01:54:24,580 --> 01:54:27,460
They had so many similar ideas and did them so bad.

2023
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:34,900
Yeah, I don't know. It's like, yeah, McDonald's, it was like, did McDonald's insist we must have

2024
01:54:34,900 --> 01:54:40,020
a representation of a Big Mac that well, that's the only reason people would come over here.

2025
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:41,940
I mean, the five is less agree. But that's not a Big Mac.

2026
01:54:42,580 --> 01:54:47,300
I know, but it's got sesame seeds. It's got sesame seeds on it. That's why I'm assuming

2027
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:51,860
they think it's a Big Mac. It's the thing this article pointed out. This is a kind of burger

2028
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:56,580
that then you could not get when you got to the counter at Burger Invasion.

2029
01:54:58,340 --> 01:55:01,140
Yeah. What is the menu? The menu is down lower, right?

2030
01:55:01,140 --> 01:55:08,180
Yeah. It's like a rest stop McDonald's. I mean, it is exciting. I mean, it would be cool to like

2031
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:14,100
get a Big Mac or a McFlurry in the middle of the theme park. Like sometimes you just want a Big

2032
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:17,780
Mac or sometimes it's a, well, it's hard to beat, you know?

2033
01:55:18,260 --> 01:55:23,940
I would say I and a lot of other people have a lot more affection for the fry card in, over in

2034
01:55:24,580 --> 01:55:32,100
Frontierland where they would sell the McDonald's fries there than this. But yes, to your point,

2035
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:37,140
I mean, sometimes when it comes down to like what kind of garbage hamburger are you going to eat?

2036
01:55:37,140 --> 01:55:41,380
Is it going to be from the Tomorrowland fasts quick service or would it be McDonald's? I'd

2037
01:55:41,380 --> 01:55:44,100
probably pick McDonald's. Yes.

2038
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:48,020
Like if it's going to be a cheap fast cheap-ish fast meal.

2039
01:55:48,580 --> 01:55:51,380
You know what you're getting? It's a vetted cheap burger.

2040
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:56,340
I don't think like, yeah, like the Tomorrowland, which I haven't had a ton, but like the

2041
01:55:56,340 --> 01:55:59,780
Tomorrowland cheeseburger over at, what is it? Tomorrowland Terrace? Is that what that restaurant

2042
01:55:59,780 --> 01:56:05,780
is called? Yeah. Like that's never good. I've never had that and gone, wow, pretty good.

2043
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:08,420
No, that's always a disappointment.

2044
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:15,620
Certainly not. I also just look at the texture everywhere. Like, yeah, it's like real like,

2045
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:19,460
it looks like worms or something. The burger.

2046
01:56:19,460 --> 01:56:20,820
Yes. Worms.

2047
01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:28,660
Looks like a ton of worms all jammed together with metal pieces sticking out. The weird like wrinkly

2048
01:56:29,780 --> 01:56:37,060
lettuce, like it looks like wrinkled felt, like floppy cheese. I don't, I'm trying to think of

2049
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:42,180
where else I've seen iterations of giant hamburgers, but I think they bother me in general.

2050
01:56:42,180 --> 01:56:48,260
And I don't think in that way where I'm bothered by big things. I think they just like discussed

2051
01:56:48,260 --> 01:56:53,140
me aesthetically in the, in the film Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band with the

2052
01:56:53,140 --> 01:56:59,460
Bee Gees and Peter Frampton, there's a giant hamburger covering a gazebo. That's one of the

2053
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:04,980
main like aesthetic swings of that movie. It's like awful. The big burger. Gah.

2054
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:06,580
Yeah.

2055
01:57:06,580 --> 01:57:09,620
Am I wrong? Are there good examples of big burgers?

2056
01:57:10,420 --> 01:57:19,300
Not that, not since it's smaller, but the Playplace officer Big Mac jail thing. That's a big

2057
01:57:19,300 --> 01:57:24,020
burger that you can climb in. We've talked about this recently. I think that's a good version of

2058
01:57:24,020 --> 01:57:30,900
it. Yeah. But he's like only part food. He's part food, part character and part place making.

2059
01:57:32,020 --> 01:57:33,300
Yes. Part prison.

2060
01:57:34,100 --> 01:57:38,020
Part prison. Yes. The foodness is offset.

2061
01:57:38,740 --> 01:57:42,420
Yeah. So that, yeah, it's not completely the same thing. I'm trying to think. Yeah. But I,

2062
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:47,860
look, fake food in general. I mean, my sister had the whole like fake kitchen, like Fisher Price

2063
01:57:47,860 --> 01:57:53,940
kitchen with all the fake food that we would play with. And I always remember like being a

2064
01:57:53,940 --> 01:58:00,900
little grossed out at the fake food. It was always a little gross. We, we, I would probably use it to

2065
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:06,260
like, the Ninja Turtles would hit each other with it. But I would still like, when I would look at

2066
01:58:06,260 --> 01:58:11,140
like the fake slice of cheese, I'd be like, oh, something weird about fake food. This is like

2067
01:58:11,140 --> 01:58:15,860
sandwich cheese. Like, like there wouldn't be holes in the cheese. Yeah. That's Swiss cheese

2068
01:58:15,860 --> 01:58:21,780
right there. Also the onions are still a little green. Yeah. They're really thick. They would

2069
01:58:21,780 --> 01:58:28,820
really dominate. Big squishy ketchup. There's a parade that we looked at that had like a giant

2070
01:58:28,820 --> 01:58:34,500
sandwich and it had that kind of cheese. And I didn't like that either. I, this is just a bad

2071
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:42,260
area, I guess. And then like this font, doesn't this font belong in Marvel superhero island?

2072
01:58:43,380 --> 01:58:49,140
Yeah. It's similar to that. Yeah. I mean, I think it's similar to like Buzz Lightyear's spin,

2073
01:58:50,260 --> 01:58:55,060
whatever. I don't like it aesthetically. I like the ride, but I think that, I think all the signage

2074
01:58:55,060 --> 01:58:59,940
for all of them is pretty uniformly gross. Yeah. I don't know. I don't, I don't hate the,

2075
01:58:59,940 --> 01:59:04,820
for this font so much. It's just, it's sticking out of a really unappetizing hamburger spaceship.

2076
01:59:05,700 --> 01:59:10,500
And the colors in the font are not represent the, the many colors in the font are not really

2077
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:15,220
represented in the burger and are not represented in the McDonald's logo, which has like a space

2078
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:20,980
halo over it. I think if you make this thing all like steel, like paint it like a steel gray

2079
01:59:21,940 --> 01:59:26,580
and with like little highlights and like, like little lights on it, but it looks like a hamburger.

2080
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:31,620
I think it looks not perfect, but it looks much better and more aesthetically pleasing.

2081
01:59:32,660 --> 01:59:36,260
That's like, you don't want people, yeah, you don't want people to like look at and go,

2082
01:59:37,060 --> 01:59:39,700
you want people to go, oh, look at that as a spaceship, but oh, it looks kind of like a

2083
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:45,540
hamburger. That's cute. Let me go eat McDonald's. Well, there's also some weird perspective going

2084
01:59:45,540 --> 01:59:53,540
on because the picture appears to like the thruster, the, the, the, the thruster is pushing it

2085
01:59:54,500 --> 01:59:59,700
sideways as opposed to at you. Like if it was coming at you, it might be a little more dynamic,

2086
02:00:00,660 --> 02:00:06,100
but it's like you're watching it pass. Yeah. Yeah.

2087
02:00:07,540 --> 02:00:15,140
Trip to the left. It doesn't help when you look at it from behind. And this was not their intent

2088
02:00:15,140 --> 02:00:20,180
looking at Cars Land from behind. Doesn't look so good. However, again, this is what I was saying

2089
02:00:20,180 --> 02:00:23,380
when you're looking at construction photos, like what does this new park going to look like? And

2090
02:00:23,380 --> 02:00:29,300
then you see this, you see this pink dinosaur, you see a big orange and you see the back of a

2091
02:00:29,300 --> 02:00:36,900
hamburger. Things just did not feel promising from the outset for this area. No, no, it looks, yes,

2092
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:42,660
it looks like, um, like a movie, like you could just push the flat down and the burger will come

2093
02:00:42,660 --> 02:00:46,260
down, which maybe you could have at the time. I don't know. Well, that's not what would be fine

2094
02:00:46,260 --> 02:00:52,580
with this on a billboard. If this was like a, if this, if some new burger based movie was being

2095
02:00:52,580 --> 02:00:57,220
advertised, I guess I like the burger. There's kind of 3d burgers. I don't think they've done

2096
02:00:57,220 --> 02:01:03,140
this in a long time, but in and out billboards used to have sort of 3d of five burgers and

2097
02:01:03,140 --> 02:01:08,020
those were fine. They looked like the in and out burgers, not like generic, but partially

2098
02:01:08,020 --> 02:01:12,980
sandwich burgers, partially hot dog shapes. What did this thing doesn't know what it is?

2099
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:22,100
Yeah, it's yeah, it doesn't. And I would not bring this back even for irony. No, at the expense. Yeah.

2100
02:01:22,100 --> 02:01:26,580
I mean, even if I could get McDonald's, I still wouldn't. There's a McDonald's across the street.

2101
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:32,740
There's a McDonald's on Harbor. Yeah. Yeah. You can get whatever you want there. You're dead to me,

2102
02:01:32,740 --> 02:01:43,700
big burger. Yeah. I'm I'm exhausted. I'll say that. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I feel like there

2103
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:48,900
was a one. Oh, oh my God. We haven't talked about the this is the final little thing. The

2104
02:01:50,100 --> 02:01:55,140
send us out as well. Oh, okay. So wonderful. Okay. Okay. You not only got burger invasion

2105
02:01:56,100 --> 02:02:02,020
and by the way, the whole thing, the calling it burger invasion presented by McDonald's and

2106
02:02:02,020 --> 02:02:06,740
the fry wagon wasn't called McDonald's like Disney wanted to have the McDonald's sponsorship,

2107
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:11,540
but they were resistant to just putting a McDonald's in as opposed to Six Flags,

2108
02:02:11,540 --> 02:02:15,940
which that guy took over and said Johnny Rockets is going in and they said, yes, sir.

2109
02:02:15,940 --> 02:02:21,700
Universal kind of the same deal. Disney to their credit wanted their money, but they didn't want

2110
02:02:21,700 --> 02:02:26,180
to just say McDonald's. So they're like, we got to do something else. We got to call it something.

2111
02:02:26,180 --> 02:02:31,220
So that's why it's burger invasion. And you know, they made it a fun thing. It's Kooky,

2112
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:37,780
California culture. And they tied it in with the billboard over in Paradise Spear. There's an ad

2113
02:02:37,780 --> 02:02:47,140
for burger invasion with the slogan. It's a meteor shower and meteor is crossed out and it says

2114
02:02:47,140 --> 02:03:00,340
meteor with the McDonald's M. It's a meteor shower. Yeah. This, I will say this billboard is 10 times

2115
02:03:00,340 --> 02:03:07,620
better than the facade. It's much more dynamic. I agree. 100%. There's a lot of burgers. They're

2116
02:03:07,620 --> 02:03:13,940
all coming. There's fries coming at you too. It's a lot. It's many, all of it. Flesh is out the world

2117
02:03:13,940 --> 02:03:19,780
of the burger ship. There's lots of burger ships, seemingly traveling at light speed down to earth

2118
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:25,860
and some fries as well, which are not ships. They're just big boxes of fries. Yeah. This is

2119
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:31,060
way better. If this was just literally the sign, I wouldn't have as much of a problem with it. I

2120
02:03:31,060 --> 02:03:36,500
don't think I'd be like, well, it's kind of cheap looking, but it's kind of, it's okay. I don't hate

2121
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:45,220
it. Are you though bothered by the idea of a meat shower? That's a question for Jason.

2122
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:52,340
Well, I don't know. You know, in Vegas, you can see Lady Gaga's a meat dress at the house of Gaga.

2123
02:03:52,420 --> 02:03:58,020
Hey, did you know that was preserved in Burbank at a taxidermy place? They preserved it so it

2124
02:03:58,020 --> 02:04:04,740
could be put on display. Jason, meat shower, have you ever taken a meat shower in your life?

2125
02:04:04,740 --> 02:04:10,420
I've taken a meat shower. I think we were together. I've been to the places where they come

2126
02:04:10,420 --> 02:04:15,220
around with the meat on the swords and cut it off. That's hardly a shower.

2127
02:04:16,180 --> 02:04:22,260
But it kind of falls from above, like in the loosest sense, maybe a meat drizzle. That is

2128
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:29,860
technically. I know. I know we're talking about the shower head has to be raining ground beef.

2129
02:04:29,860 --> 02:04:36,580
That's what a meteor shower is. Okay. So you're talking like a gummo kind of nightmare. Yeah. No,

2130
02:04:36,580 --> 02:04:43,940
I don't think I am into that. Yeah, I don't know. I can't really defend this. I will say it is

2131
02:04:43,940 --> 02:04:52,420
certainly more dynamic, but again, breaks the old timey beach down for the like in your face kitsch.

2132
02:04:53,700 --> 02:05:00,980
It's unclear if these burgers and fries are ships though, because this, the actual facade of the

2133
02:05:00,980 --> 02:05:06,340
restaurant would suggest that they're ships of some kind and perhaps there are aliens inside.

2134
02:05:06,340 --> 02:05:12,900
So it's a meteor shower, but I don't know. I don't know if these are actually like sentient life

2135
02:05:12,900 --> 02:05:18,180
forms. I don't actually know what this billboard is implying because these are not regular

2136
02:05:18,180 --> 02:05:23,300
hamburgers with regular meat. You know what I'm saying? Like it's not just, they have propulsion

2137
02:05:23,300 --> 02:05:28,740
systems. They have some sort of, yeah, gears. Like there's something going on here. So yeah,

2138
02:05:28,740 --> 02:05:34,580
not just saying that lots of burgers are coming to earth. It's like the very specific notion that

2139
02:05:34,580 --> 02:05:40,820
burger shaped ships are on their way to earth, like, like 10 of them. And is that a problem?

2140
02:05:41,540 --> 02:05:45,380
It might be very possible. It's this very Independence day scenario where they're,

2141
02:05:45,380 --> 02:05:51,620
they're going to just try to kill us all. So if it's straight meat shower, no, thank you.

2142
02:05:52,180 --> 02:05:58,500
But if it's like sort of McDonald's fun aliens coming to give us hamburgers from their ship and

2143
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:02,740
they have like hamburger making machines in the ship, then I'm interested.

2144
02:06:04,180 --> 02:06:05,300
Welcome to earth burger.

2145
02:06:06,260 --> 02:06:06,500
Yeah.

2146
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:13,860
But they pulled out, but they pulled it out before we could actually have all these questions

2147
02:06:13,860 --> 02:06:19,700
answered. So they did. Yeah. It's just left for us to pontificate again, as you said, Mike, far

2148
02:06:19,700 --> 02:06:25,620
beyond what the Imagineers who put this in, far beyond the degree to which they thought about it.

2149
02:06:25,620 --> 02:06:30,660
We've wasted a lot of time. We've wasted two episodes, this one longer than the first. What

2150
02:06:30,660 --> 02:06:35,460
were we thinking that we could do this in one, especially because like, well, I guess what we

2151
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:43,140
didn't account for was between the two 40 minutes of Jim Belushi content. See when you, by the time

2152
02:06:43,140 --> 02:06:48,260
you've accounted for all that, you know, look, it, it, it went and went, but.

2153
02:06:50,100 --> 02:06:54,420
But look, that's the, that's what you're listening here for is Belushi content,

2154
02:06:55,300 --> 02:07:02,500
seat content, all the side stuff that really, all the, all the garnishes from the salad bar,

2155
02:07:02,500 --> 02:07:09,940
from the topping that is pop podcast, the ride, we can pull anything, lettuce, tomato,

2156
02:07:09,940 --> 02:07:14,740
rel you could put relish on the. Relish mushrooms, onions. Yeah. Yeah.

2157
02:07:15,860 --> 02:07:21,220
You could put on boardwalk dips or Broadway Broadway dips. Yeah. Either one.

2158
02:07:21,540 --> 02:07:27,220
So fucking pissed at imagine you've never been more. No, no, no. Don't you see that

2159
02:07:27,220 --> 02:07:33,300
there became a hero story for you? You were right. Yeah. Yeah. It's like they were designed.

2160
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:37,380
They set a trap for you. And I think that's unfair. I think they, they're the ones who should be

2161
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:42,980
punished. I had to leave my like the goddamn here's journey. I had to leave my comfort zone

2162
02:07:42,980 --> 02:07:50,820
and struggle. It sucked. So that's. Well, you'll be stronger because of it.

2163
02:07:51,460 --> 02:07:58,020
Yeah, that's true. And then I'll return back to rest. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So we've made it. We've

2164
02:07:58,020 --> 02:08:08,420
made it through a two act, a pretty epic heroes journey for everybody that you survived DCA 1.0

2165
02:08:08,420 --> 02:08:17,220
and DCA 1.0.2. Keep it tuned here to patreon.com slash podcast, the ride for, you know, more stuff

2166
02:08:17,220 --> 02:08:24,180
that's like this, if that's still what you want. Now, Mike, you said you had a way to take us out.

2167
02:08:24,180 --> 02:08:28,660
Oh yeah. Well, I wasn't even aware that there was sort of a pre world of color show called

2168
02:08:28,660 --> 02:08:35,860
Luminaria. Yeah. And we'll get to a full episode on it, but I was looking at a clip of it and maybe I

2169
02:08:35,860 --> 02:08:40,900
I'll think this is funnier than you guys will. There's a clip of it and it's clearly low rent

2170
02:08:41,860 --> 02:08:45,860
world of color. There's still cool stuff in it, but I'm pretty sure I found a clip where like

2171
02:08:46,580 --> 02:08:49,780
one of the explosives malfunctions and I just want to play it for you.

2172
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:54,260
And you tell me, maybe I'm wrong. It might just be where the person was sitting,

2173
02:08:54,820 --> 02:08:59,620
but it's like here, I'm just going to play it and it might not even read for the listener. You

2174
02:08:59,620 --> 02:09:04,660
cannot even hear it, but I just wanted to play this and get reaction. So here we go. I'm going

2175
02:09:04,660 --> 02:09:10,340
to share the screen now, share the computer screen. You can tell me if you think this was on purpose

2176
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:12,500
or not, because it seems like something blows up.

2177
02:09:30,260 --> 02:09:38,100
What? Well, now black smoke is not something you usually want to see from a fireworks display.

2178
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:42,580
Am I wrong? It's not like a music swells or anything. All of a sudden, just like a fucking

2179
02:09:43,380 --> 02:09:49,540
bomb goes off. I think so. I don't know. We'll have to explore it on the luminari episode,

2180
02:09:49,540 --> 02:09:55,780
but I don't know, made me laugh. It's kind of California adventure distilled. It was initially

2181
02:09:55,780 --> 02:10:04,740
like a bomb going off, but hey, it all worked out, you know, and they planted the seeds,

2182
02:10:04,740 --> 02:10:10,980
the seeds from last episode of what became a really amazing park. I feel like maybe they had

2183
02:10:10,980 --> 02:10:16,260
to do that. They had to just like stick a stupid thing in the ground so that a better park could

2184
02:10:16,260 --> 02:10:22,660
grow. So it goes to you. Yeah, it had to go through a hero's journey. Your park. That's right.

2185
02:10:22,660 --> 02:10:28,340
Journey. And they had to correct the Broadway and boardwalk a little errors all through the

2186
02:10:28,340 --> 02:10:32,340
part. That was, that's like, there were a ton of those on a big scale and they fixed it.

2187
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:40,580
And it's great today. Happy 20 years. Happy 20 years. We really like California Adventure now.

2188
02:10:40,580 --> 02:10:45,780
We really, really do. I think I like it more even having like reflected on where it came from. It's

2189
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:52,260
awkward adolescence. And yeah, it might be the second or third best Disney park in the country.

2190
02:10:53,140 --> 02:11:02,260
That's my feeling. Definitely my feeling. All right. I guess everybody go and enjoy your

2191
02:11:02,260 --> 02:11:08,980
Malibu Rideau and catch a good night. Catch a flave. And catch, don't forget to catch a flave.

2192
02:11:09,540 --> 02:11:12,020
Catch a flave. Bye. Bye.
