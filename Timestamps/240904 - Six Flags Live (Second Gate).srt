1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,880
Yo welcome to podcast the ride.

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,000
We say it with a little extra ass because I want to take a ride on dat ass.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,440
You know how we do baby.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,120
This is SCO double tizzy.

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,120
You know I'm getting busy.

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,720
We got Mikey C in the place to be.

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,000
Yo, yo, yo, sorry just adjusting the ones and twos.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,080
Oh yeah, you know that's the cool way.

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,480
That's how we're calling it this summer.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,480
It's ones and twos.

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,680
We don't even know the name of the equipment we're using.

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,640
Jay Schizzle, he's all up in that pizzle.

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,440
Yo, it's Jason J-A-S-O-N like when the fellas say it, love when the ladies yell it.

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,320
That's something you would say on any episode.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,640
Just splice that, put it into a regular intro and see how confused people get.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:14,200
Yeah, hey, it's podcast the ride the second gate here and this is one where I would say

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,720
you don't have to watch what we're talking about for this to make sense, but you might

19
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,920
want to do like a little just dip your toe in.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,800
Yeah, get that toe a little wet, get a little wet in there, get all wet up in it and just

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,560
to get a sense of the vibe.

22
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,800
You don't need to watch this full half hour, but I think the vibe is important before we

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,080
start explaining some things about this.

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,080
If you watch the first two or three minutes, you'll get it, but if you watch the full 29

25
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,440
minutes, it will feel like two hours of your life have passed.

26
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,760
It is definitely a different time zone, this special.

27
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,600
This I think is maybe one of the strangest things we've, I showed it to Jane and she,

28
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,440
I think her response was, why are you punishing me?

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,440
What did I do?

30
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,000
Why are we watching this?

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,560
Well that's the kind of thing, yeah, I'm prepared to make those kinds of statements.

32
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,880
I think this is one of the most repellent things that we've ever watched.

33
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,000
You called it cursed the first time I said it.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,840
It's pretty cursed and I, well here, just to say the whole history, so we're talking

35
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,560
about something called Six Flags Live and I'm excited about this because it feels kind

36
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,560
of in the spirit of weird, failed, non-theme park or roller coaster endeavors of the Six

37
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,440
Flags organization.

38
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:41,880
I'm still very delighted by Six Flags roller coaster cuts that they tried to do at Children's

39
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,320
Hair Salon and I'm like, you know, it's the kind of thing you can't force a sequel to.

40
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,920
You got to just bump into it.

41
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:55,400
So my delight when a little while ago, a Twitter account called Lost Media Busters,

42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,480
which has some good stuff in general, it's worth following in general, but they posted

43
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:07,100
a lost half-hour teen-oriented pilot made by Six Flags in 2001.

44
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,120
This was posted to a YouTube channel called Retro Six Flags.

45
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,120
Also has some very interesting stuff on their channel.

46
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,620
Yeah, I did a little dive after and I don't remember any of it, but it was, I was so excited

47
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:24,900
that there was that because there's a lot of that for Disney and some for Universal,

48
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,060
you know, yeah, Retro, the old, because we do so, God knows this podcast is born out

49
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,980
of like, oh, the way it used to be.

50
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,860
Remember old Disney MGM studios?

51
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,780
And you see almost none of this with Six Flags and I think that the audience for it is pretty

52
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:43,820
limited because all of the view counts on this channel are all like sub 300.

53
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:51,300
But it's like area music or voice tracks, like it's stuff we like, but it is really

54
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:57,940
so much of Disney and even Universal is preserved, but it's really lost media when you start

55
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,660
trying to find Six Flags.

56
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,660
It's really where yet.

57
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,220
I just don't think it's not an area that because, you know, the vibe of Six Flags, especially

58
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,020
around this time, and that's what this episode is all about, is a little bit in your face.

59
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,000
It's a little bit of its time.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,520
So having like the thoughtful nostalgia for the magic of Six Flags just seems so rare

61
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,520
to me.

62
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,520
Yeah.

63
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,760
This is my impression was that they were going to play this in the lines for rides.

64
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,760
Is that right?

65
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,760
Maybe?

66
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,760
Hard to say.

67
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
Yeah.

68
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,580
Some of the literature indicates that basically.

69
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,680
So this goes up on Twitter a little while ago.

70
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,960
A couple of listeners brought it to our attention.

71
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,560
Josh D regular history buff, Ben Stans.

72
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,560
And so I was like poker.

73
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,880
It was on my like to do list.

74
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,800
I think I was busy that way that day.

75
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,000
And Jason, you flagged it.

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And then not I didn't like buckle down and watch it until our friend Kevin Tully alerted

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,360
us to just send us the link without saying anything.

78
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,720
And I said, Oh yeah, I've been meaning to get to this.

79
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,460
And then his next texts really sparked my attention.

80
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,940
This is, I believe, like the video from the ring.

81
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,940
I watched it all.

82
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,940
And now I have this unshakable feeling I'm going to die within seven days.

83
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,880
I think I had only watched the first few minutes when I sent when I sent it to you guys.

84
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,060
And then when I sat down and watched all of it, I was a little like, this is unbelievable.

85
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,060
Yeah.

86
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,060
Yeah.

87
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,780
It's a it's a hell of a it's a hell of a tone to lock into for a while.

88
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,900
And I completely agree with Kevin's sentiments.

89
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,740
He did not pass away, but I, this is over seven days ago.

90
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,740
Yeah.

91
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,740
Yeah.

92
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,740
Yes.

93
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,340
I do worry about sending listeners to watch the given how like real the PTR curse has

94
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:53,500
been over the course of the whole year seems to have affected Aerosmith, the band in general.

95
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,340
We brought Aerosmith down.

96
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,860
They're no longer able to perform live because of Stephen's voice in case you didn't hear

97
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,860
the news.

98
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,740
Well, because of us is what happens.

99
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,740
Because of us.

100
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,700
Because you believed too much, because you believed in their music and you believe in

101
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,620
him, the man and all of his deeds too much.

102
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,780
Yeah, I believe in all of his deeds.

103
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,780
And I always say that.

104
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,780
You've always said that.

105
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,060
People are saying it, but I'm saying it the most.

106
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,020
Check out Stephen Tyler's deeds.

107
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,300
He did perform Mama Kin with the Black Crows like two months ago.

108
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,300
So I've got false hope that he was fine.

109
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,380
You know, two months ago he seemed like he was singing on stage, but I bet he can't just

110
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,420
sing a full concert anymore.

111
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:34,660
Mama Kin, that's a heck of a blues, blues jammy jam.

112
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,020
You go rock, you go fast there, but you don't have to belt it out necessarily like you do

113
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,940
Dream On.

114
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,900
So it's not the vocal strain necessarily.

115
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,220
But yeah, we took him down, sadly.

116
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:52,060
So listeners beware, I guess, if you want to get into this, but given what we've said

117
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,060
about it thus far.

118
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,460
But this is available on YouTube and on retro Six Flags.

119
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,180
It's a half hour.

120
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,700
And just to get into the vibe of it.

121
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,900
So it's called Six Flags Live.

122
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,460
And if it wasn't clear enough from it being called that, and then you get into it and

123
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:17,820
there's like young hosts with microphones and the microphones say S.F.L. in kind of

124
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:24,140
like a thin, slithery font, sometimes lowercase, a lascivious font.

125
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,700
I do find it to be a lascivious, yeah, yeah.

126
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:32,540
A lot of this is lascivious, or what's the term, misogynistic.

127
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,140
That's certainly the case, yes.

128
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,260
But from that S.F.L. shortening, you're like, OK, well, this is certainly Six Flags Attempt

129
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:48,300
at a TRL, at a Total Request Live, which was a ubiquitous linchpin of pop culture in our

130
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,420
era when we were growing up.

131
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:56,060
So they had this idea, OK, what if we took Total Request Live, which has provided this

132
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,620
vibrant hub to MTV's operation and lifted all these record sales.

133
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,460
And now it's like part of the Times Square attraction.

134
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,440
What if we did that in Six Flags Parks?

135
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:14,700
What if it was a TRL in places where roller coasters are passing by every 10 seconds,

136
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,180
so everyone has to shout over them?

137
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:24,140
And what if we put live in the title, but it seemingly has no way to actually be live?

138
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:29,900
And what if, on top of that, a lot of the function of it is sports scores?

139
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,260
My complaint about sports scores, too, of the minute, let me digest them.

140
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,180
Give them to me weeks later.

141
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,020
Don't bug me with this up to the minute scores.

142
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,220
Sports scores and lists from magazines.

143
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,220
Yes.

144
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:52,140
There's so much about like, oh, Rolling Stone said this or L Magazine said this.

145
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,460
Contour Magazine is talking about the 10 sexiest belly buttons of the summer.

146
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,580
What do you think?

147
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,060
There are some confusing belly button shirts.

148
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,300
There's confusing belly button shirts.

149
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,860
The jeans look weird.

150
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,180
That spiky pixie cut.

151
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:14,580
The one woman has like a shirt that looks like curtains to showcase her belly button.

152
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,140
I haven't seen one of those in like 20 years.

153
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,940
That's an old school thing, I guess.

154
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,380
Nobody ever brought that back?

155
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,700
Belly button like tassels to hide your little belly button.

156
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,820
Well, they don't do a very good job.

157
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,940
There's tantalization of the tassels.

158
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,940
Sometimes you see it and sometimes you don't.

159
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,620
Also, there's monologue jokes, essentially, hidden in the...

160
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,620
Yeah.

161
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,660
There's just segments where people are doing monologue jokes for like a late night talk show.

162
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:47,580
There's a good amount of monologue jokes and some of them are one take because they stutter

163
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,580
or words are rearranged.

164
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,420
Like 100% of this was one take.

165
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,420
Can I...

166
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,540
Really, in the special, there is this segment and this is like a hard monologue joke.

167
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:06,100
It is a terrible joke, but the setting of it is really something.

168
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,820
If I could just play this real quick.

169
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,820
Yeah, yeah, please.

170
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,820
Can you believe it?

171
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,940
The Backstreet Boys are finally back on track as far as their tour goes, now that AJ has

172
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,940
graduated from alcohol abuse treatment.

173
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,940
We'll see how long that lasts.

174
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,700
That is a joke about like, we'll see if that rehab takes.

175
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,060
I think you're being incredibly kind by calling it a joke.

176
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,060
I...

177
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,060
It is...

178
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,060
Just a mean statement.

179
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:37,700
It is very mean, but it is delivered in a lazy river.

180
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:44,020
I'm like, well, delivering monologue jokes in a lazy river, that's not a job I ever considered,

181
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,820
but I think I would like it.

182
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,700
Not this quality of joke.

183
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,500
Not this quality of joke where it's just, like you said, a mean statement.

184
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,100
You had to film that ad in the pool and it like damn near killed you.

185
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,860
If you had to do that all day every day, it wasn't a lazy river though.

186
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,860
It wasn't a lazy river.

187
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,860
Well, but I didn't...

188
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,860
It wasn't a lazy river.

189
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,860
I didn't have a big floaty, you know?

190
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,860
Okay, okay.

191
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:08,380
The later spot where I am in a big floaty was very comfortable.

192
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,380
Okay, okay.

193
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,220
Can we try to make a pilot sort of on the down low at one of these water parks with

194
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,540
Jason in a lazy river where he does monologue jokes?

195
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,260
I'll just shoot it on the iPhone.

196
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,260
Yeah.

197
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,260
Okay.

198
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,260
Which...

199
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,260
What's the one at Knott's?

200
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,980
I'm like at Soak City.

201
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,980
Soak City, okay.

202
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,380
Well, is there a lazy river at Soak City?

203
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,380
Let's look into it.

204
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,300
Soak City becomes Talk City.

205
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,300
Yeah.

206
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,980
Donald Trump's added to get...

207
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,980
Jason...

208
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,780
Oh, is that you drowning?

209
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,700
Well, I fell out of the tube.

210
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,700
Oh, okay.

211
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,700
That's you, not the camera.

212
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,700
I was struggling.

213
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,700
They dropped the camera.

214
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,700
Yeah.

215
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,700
You're just floating in an inner tube asking women as they walk by.

216
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,700
You got any tattoos?

217
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,700
Hey, you!

218
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,700
No!

219
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,700
You got any tattoos?

220
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,700
No, I don't want to bother anyone.

221
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,700
Oh, okay.

222
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,700
So it's just jokes.

223
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,700
Well, it's a different format than Six Flags Live.

224
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,700
Okay, okay.

225
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,700
There's a lot less costing.

226
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,700
Yeah, I didn't say anything about...

227
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,820
I meant actually crafted jokes.

228
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,100
Well, we want to get some views on this though, so we got to see some tattoos.

229
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,820
That's my point of view on it, but okay, well, we'll talk off air.

230
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,100
Do you have Amazing Grace?

231
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,660
The musical notes, but I'm going to call it lyrics for some reason.

232
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,380
That was the history of it, is that Mike kept pushing the show into this sexy place when

233
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,020
Jason just wanted it to be about the joke craft.

234
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:19,300
Anyway, Jason drowned after that, and they did bring him back with enough CPR, but it

235
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:24,580
was the type of CPR that had to go for so long it broke his ribs, so he's healing from

236
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,580
that.

237
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,180
Well, I know the rumor coming out about this show is that it's so funny that people are

238
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,940
busting ribs, but it wasn't the comedy that did it.

239
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,140
I did not get a rib removed for a Marilyn Manson kind of thing.

240
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,340
I would really like that rumor.

241
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,900
There's a rumor going around that Jason got his rib removed.

242
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,260
Let's snuff that out.

243
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,260
One single rib.

244
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,780
I know that Jason's the sex positive, the comfortable one of a bunch, but he's not comfortable

245
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,780
enough for that surgery.

246
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,780
No.

247
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,780
No.

248
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,780
Not yet, at least.

249
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,580
Plus, he doesn't need a rib removed to get down to that, baby.

250
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:03,340
This guy's flexing, y'all.

251
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,380
I'm surprised they didn't talk about that in the ... Yo, there's a rumor going around

252
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:15,940
about my boy Marilyn M. This special ... There's not a lot of information about where it came

253
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,220
from or indeed the use of it.

254
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,660
Was this going to be an online thing or were they going to show it in the line?

255
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,620
It did seem like that was indicated.

256
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,700
Here's what we know from the YouTube description.

257
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,640
It was produced by a company called Ackerman McQueen.

258
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,120
Hold onto that name for later.

259
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,800
For now, all you need to know is that Ackerman McQueen produced all of Six Flags advertising

260
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,040
content around this time.

261
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,080
It's the same entity that is making the commercials.

262
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,640
When I heard that, I'm like, okay, this makes a ton of sense because the ickiness of the

263
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:55,320
vibe definitely crosses over to the kinds of ads that I saw in the late 90s that scared

264
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,400
me away from Magic Mountain to this day.

265
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,400
The modus operandi, I think, was to ... It's not sweet little magical Disney ads.

266
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:13,800
It's full of screaming and terror and push yourself to the limit.

267
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,440
I was trying to watch a few ads to find ones with the vibe.

268
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
Oh, yeah, there we go.

269
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,960
It's a lot of the same shit they do.

270
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:25,280
Things will be heavily tinted blue or brown and sometimes making the park look post-op

271
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
apocalyptic.

272
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,600
That's what they're going for.

273
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,360
Can you survive the wasteland?

274
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,400
Then they'll cut to a guy getting blasted in the face by a hairdryer that's a foot off

275
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:42,400
camera so it looks like the ride is blasting his cheeks back.

276
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:48,800
I feel like maybe this company and this style of ad is what pioneered the use of my favorite

277
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:58,720
scream in sound effect media, the Howie scream, the Ru-wah, which that's not the Wilhelm,

278
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,560
but the one with the second level of guttural.

279
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,880
Anyway, I think that was ... Six Facts stuff at that time, just very over-tinted, over-edited,

280
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,840
gross fonts, edgy, could try to scare you, but then in watching a bunch last night, I

281
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:21,320
was reminded that no matter how do you dare, brave the pits of hell, then it still had

282
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,640
to end with $5 off with a Coke can from your local rounds.

283
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,640
The markets were never cool with getting too scary with these things.

284
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,640
Just a point of clarification, there is no Mr. Six in this special.

285
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,360
That comes later, I believe.

286
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,760
It does come later.

287
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:48,280
It's fair to say, actually, that this ad company, Ackerman McQueen, the Six Flags relationship

288
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,040
was severed in 2003.

289
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:59,480
In 2004, they get a new ad company, and that is the dawn of Mr. Six.

290
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,440
Mr. Six was a company coming in hot, we're not going to be doing this edgy Six Flags

291
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Live stuff.

292
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,880
We are going to create an icon that will last generations.

293
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:17,720
Ackerman McQueen had to shift all their efforts to making the movie Domino, if you remember

294
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,720
that.

295
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,280
Who was in Domino?

296
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,280
Domino, is that Keira Knightley?

297
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,280
It's the bounty hunter movie.

298
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,960
I think it is Tony Scott, but it's really over-edited.

299
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,200
It very much has this aesthetic.

300
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,800
2005, yeah, Keira Knightley, Tony Scott.

301
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:41,440
Donor is the name, WB Donor is the name of the company that took over, that created

302
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,000
Mr. Six.

303
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,920
Prior to that, back in the 50s, they came up with Takes a Lickin' and Keeps on Tickin'.

304
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,840
Then in 97, they created Zoom Zoom.

305
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,320
Remember Zoom Zoom?

306
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,320
Oh, Zoom Zoom Zoom.

307
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
What is that?

308
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
Zoom Zoom, there was a Mazda.

309
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,640
There was somebody whispering, Zoom Zoom.

310
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,040
I don't remember that.

311
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,160
I feel like that was on TV a lot.

312
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,160
It probably was.

313
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,960
Yeah, so anyway, that's the Donor history.

314
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,280
I will get to history about the other shortly.

315
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,960
I was going to say, this is also just this era.

316
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,120
People will post Game Boy print ads sometimes from the late 90s, early 2000s, and they're

317
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,960
very sexual.

318
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:25,440
It was just like, this was what was going on in advertising at this time, for whatever

319
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,440
reason.

320
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,480
Yeah, it was just a weird.

321
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
Unaggressive.

322
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,400
I tend to blame all of the late 90s aggression on the singular event of Woodstock 99, but

323
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:42,160
it was, I feel like that was part of a stew, an aggressive, poisonous stew of 50 things.

324
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,600
And Six Flags Live, certainly a part of it, though you can't put any blame on Six Flags

325
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,960
Live because it wasn't released to encourage bad acts from people.

326
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,440
It wasn't releaseable also.

327
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,440
No, no.

328
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,440
I wouldn't say so.

329
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:02,680
In fact, I apologize for the degree of sound quality of the, you might hear some really

330
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,520
blown out mics and some pretty unlistenable music.

331
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,800
I'm sorry, let me show you this Game Boy ad.

332
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,840
The new Game Boy Pocket, seriously distracting.

333
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:16,520
And there's a woman tied to a bed frame, and it's like, I'm not going to, I guess, have

334
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,520
sex with this.

335
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,080
I mean, she could be consenting to this situation, but she's waiting for you to.

336
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,080
She may have put herself in that position, but yeah.

337
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,080
I mean, it's unclear though.

338
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,080
I'll say that.

339
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,640
She has the love of like, oh, are we doing this?

340
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,640
Like, where are you?

341
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,360
But this is for a Game Boy.

342
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
Yeah.

343
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,080
This is primarily for children.

344
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,600
Possibly being played by 11 year olds.

345
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,120
I mean, obviously the audience was aging up a little bit at that point, but this is only

346
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,040
what, 10 years after the Game Boy came out?

347
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:45,720
But I like the idea of kind of a like sweaty, pimply 11 year old being in that room and

348
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,280
going not now.

349
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,760
Kirby is back in dreamland.

350
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,360
I have to help him.

351
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,680
Kirby.

352
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,680
God.

353
00:18:53,680 --> 00:19:00,080
Let me, that's insane, although I'm less offended by this actual imagery and more offended by

354
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
the font.

355
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,080
Oh yeah.

356
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
Well, that font is lascivious.

357
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,080
It's a nightmare font.

358
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,080
I don't know.

359
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,400
That's less lascivious and more like it's trying to act like it's shaking around, like

360
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,120
it's in motion despite being in print.

361
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,120
Seriously distracting.

362
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,400
It's a kind of font I feel like you'd also see in a like, join the Navy ad from this

363
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,400
time.

364
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,840
Well, those Navy ads were probably sexual too.

365
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,840
The Navy's extreme.

366
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,560
I had a Game Boy pocket.

367
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,920
It was just slightly better looking than Game Boy and it wasn't a massive fit.

368
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:34,320
It was just like, it could fit in your pocket, but it was a big, big, big, big, big pockets

369
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,320
at that time.

370
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,320
So that was the style.

371
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,320
Oh, that was true.

372
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
Yeah.

373
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,680
Did you guys ever have any Junko jeans?

374
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,680
No, no, but I did have big, big shorts.

375
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,440
Kevin Smith style shorts.

376
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
Yeah, that seems right.

377
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,920
Yeah, that was all I knew to do, just wear giant clothes.

378
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,560
I think that's what people want.

379
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,600
Will girls like this know for many years?

380
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,720
Huge clothes that don't fit me now.

381
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
Huge clothes.

382
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,400
And I am bigger than I was then.

383
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,400
Air walk, you know, got to get my air walks or my vans, you know.

384
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
Sure.

385
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,520
Let me play this little, just to give a flavor of it.

386
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,640
Aesthetically, what you're seeing here, everything's shaking around, everything's shaking around.

387
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,040
It's all lowercase, which is edgy.

388
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,600
Capitalization is for newspapers.

389
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,760
Those are boring snooze.

390
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,000
But then you'll get a little vibe of one of the, one of the hosts, one of the first hosts

391
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,760
who appears, who I believe is.

392
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,480
Are there 20 or are there a dozen?

393
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
I lost count.

394
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

395
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,480
There are far too many.

396
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,480
Yeah, yeah.

397
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,040
But I think, I think Corey, we see here.

398
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
What's up, girl?

399
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
How you doing?

400
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
I know you want to jam.

401
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Put the pig down.

402
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Let's go.

403
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
Let's start jamming.

404
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,040
Sorry.

405
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,040
Also.

406
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
Okay.

407
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
That's a stuffed pig.

408
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Okay.

409
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
Yeah, yeah.

410
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,680
Uh, this, this is the kickoff of the show.

411
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:54,440
There's been like an intro with just a lot of like, it's just said like music, right?

412
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,440
And then, uh, in some brief appearances for pop stars to assure you celebrities won't

413
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
be in this.

414
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,560
But then it just, once you get into the meat of the show, it's just a guy named Corey with

415
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,920
spiky hair, just like hopping up to a woman.

416
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,080
Like it's not full on a costing, but sorta.

417
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,080
Yeah, a little bit.

418
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,080
He's like, he's a waving fist.

419
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,200
This could be dangerous if you're not paying attention.

420
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,400
Does Corey have like the Derrick Wibley Sum 41 hair?

421
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,640
Cause that's who I associate, plenty of people have that hair.

422
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,200
That's the guy I associate most with that hairstyle.

423
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
I hadn't thought about it.

424
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,060
Yeah, that is, it's very Sum 41.

425
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:34,320
It's like a, some of the vibes of these guys, of the 20 hosts of the show, some of them

426
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,080
are very new metal, but then there are two, like some of the new metal can be a little

427
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,080
scary.

428
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,600
They're more, these guys all seem like soft.

429
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Yes.

430
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,440
So I, which is why I calibrate their vibe at crazy town.

431
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,640
I think they're very, you're my butterfly sugar, baby.

432
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:59,040
Cause that band was kind of between metal and boy band and, and like the, because it's

433
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:04,000
bright colors and nobody's ever, no one on earth was ever scared of crazy town.

434
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,840
No, new metal at least has some aesthetic.

435
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,200
I feel like crazy town.

436
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,760
I feel like crazy town had an aesthetic, but it's a little more grown in a lab.

437
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,760
Crazy town.

438
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,760
You're saying they're not authentic.

439
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,720
I don't know what even they would be authentic too.

440
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,720
They're original.

441
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,720
They're continued.

442
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
Yeah.

443
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
I mean, that's where, yeah.

444
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,280
They are kind of their own genre, which is so rare to find.

445
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:33,840
Do you have any more of Corey, you, this was the clip that went around like Twitter and

446
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,680
Instagram.

447
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,680
Okay.

448
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
Okay.

449
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
Yeah.

450
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,120
But this is, he means his dance.

451
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,120
He's like hopping around.

452
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,120
Yeah.

453
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
That's what he's talking about.

454
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
No, we saw him at the backpack.

455
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,120
Oh, he is.

456
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,120
Oh, okay.

457
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,120
It comes up.

458
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,120
So you can see the assets.

459
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,120
Let's see the assets.

460
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,120
Look at the assets of the G bag.

461
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,120
That's what I'm talking about.

462
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
Do you like the G bag?

463
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,120
It's German, huh?

464
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,120
Yep.

465
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,120
This has got crazy stuff.

466
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,120
Look at that.

467
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
What?

468
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,120
How much is it?

469
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,120
$200.

470
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,120
That's all.

471
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
One day paper route.

472
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
One day's paper route.

473
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
You can pick this up.

474
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
One day's paper route.

475
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
One day's paper route.

476
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:17,120
So it's all about a backpack with speakers.

477
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,680
But then I don't think anyone's turned around to show it until that point.

478
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
So it's just confusing.

479
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,800
And then when he says assets, and then the shot just is of her ass.

480
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:34,480
I don't know that it's about assets, or I think that's what he's referring to.

481
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:41,000
It's a $200 backpack with a CD player and speakers, the Osiris G bag.

482
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,040
He keeps saying one day paper route.

483
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,640
One day's paper route.

484
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,720
Now Jason, you did not have a paper route, even though it feels right that you did.

485
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,120
He would have done a paper route to all the residents of a lazy river.

486
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,120
Oh, wow.

487
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:01,000
If you give him a plastic box to keep the newspapers dry, he'll throw them every which

488
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,760
way as long as it's all people along a lazy river.

489
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,840
A paper route in movies, I feel like it's like a tunnel of love.

490
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,000
It exists in movies and television.

491
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,960
The actual paper route, I just remember someone's sedan driving along, and then just winging

492
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:23,480
newspapers out of an open window, because it was fucking freezing most of the year.

493
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,520
Much of the year.

494
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,800
You're saying the paper boy video game doesn't exist.

495
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,800
No, no.

496
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
Riding a bike.

497
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
Anymore.

498
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,560
Throwing tied up newspapers waving at your neighbors.

499
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,040
No, I never encountered that.

500
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,800
Yeah, because I remember a car just pulling up and coming out the window.

501
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,800
Yeah.

502
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Yeah.

503
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,800
When I was a kid.

504
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,800
Paper whips.

505
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
But it does feel like, yeah, you would.

506
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,720
Maybe if you went into one of these either beach town or Lake Michigan style things, there's

507
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,760
a bunch of houses on the lake, and you could just float around the big lake and whip the

508
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
paper in the backyard.

509
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,040
I mean, a lazy river is my preferred method of transit.

510
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,040
Yeah.

511
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,040
Sure.

512
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,480
Your tip for future, if you're trying to invite Jason to a birthday party or something, you

513
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,920
might get the follow up question, is it along a lazy river?

514
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,920
Along a lazy river.

515
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,880
If it's on my way, I'll try to float down, but.

516
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,760
Is $200 a day what you would get for delivering papers?

517
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,760
I don't think so.

518
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,760
It seems high for the early 2000s.

519
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,400
That seems like it would be the total revenue, not the profit.

520
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,200
Is he talking about the net or the gross?

521
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,200
We don't know, Cory.

522
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
Come on.

523
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
Be more clear.

524
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,280
That would usually, the paper person would come around on Saturday or Sunday and like,

525
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,720
oh, hey, yo, over the next few months.

526
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
You know?

527
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Yeah.

528
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,040
So it's a confusing segment for many reasons.

529
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Yeah.

530
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,680
You're getting, a lot is being thrown at you, vibes wise.

531
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,160
Cory himself is just a lot, frankly.

532
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,160
There's a lot to handle.

533
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:54,200
I would say that all of the men in it, all of these spiky haired frosted tip guys, okay,

534
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
here's the thing.

535
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,040
I don't know these people and I can't slander these people and I can't speak to anything

536
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,000
that they have done in their lives and I'm not going to do that.

537
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,960
I'm just going to say that the vibe is rapist-ish.

538
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Yeah.

539
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
I won't call them rapists.

540
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,400
I will call them rapish.

541
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Okay.

542
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,400
It is.

543
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
That's not saying anything.

544
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,680
Cory, if you're listening, I'm just, I don't know.

545
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,680
It's a vibe.

546
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,440
The whole special is very corny, but there's no sexuality.

547
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
If that makes sense.

548
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,360
No, there's no, there's never any point of connection.

549
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,440
There's never any point where one person with lust in their eyes encounters someone else

550
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,440
with lust in their eyes.

551
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,080
It is either, it is annoyance all the way to hatred.

552
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:42,180
There's never electricity between two people, even though everybody's shouting about sex

553
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,080
and butts for the whole special.

554
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,840
Even shouting about it in most cases when in groups of people, they seem like they've

555
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,040
agreed to be on a camera.

556
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,520
They do not seem comfortable.

557
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,280
They do not seem prepped.

558
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,840
They seem confused.

559
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:01,880
There is one moment where I feel like a woman is asking questions and people are just walking

560
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,400
by and they're like, what?

561
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,200
Yeah, things are just being shouted.

562
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,240
So wait, and if we haven't explained this, it's all just like handheld footage in the

563
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,600
general grounds of Six Flags Parks.

564
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,560
It's a lot of Magic Mountain, but you also go to over Texas and maybe some other ones

565
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,560
or in the water parks.

566
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:25,120
Yeah, Marine World, which was not a Six Flags, Marine World, I believe, was a park.

567
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,120
Then Six Flags acquired it and eventually maybe they left or they ran into the ground.

568
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,520
It's got a confusing history.

569
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,880
It's a history they don't get into.

570
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,880
They don't seem to care.

571
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,880
You know what?

572
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,080
We make a show all about rides and park ownerships and if that's what you thought you'd get

573
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,760
out of Six Flags Live, frankly, you don't get any of that.

574
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:51,640
It seems to be all about either the latest trends or trying to put the moves on a member

575
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,640
of the opposite sex.

576
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,560
If we were doing the show, we would be asking about the history of the Sid and Marty Croft

577
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:03,000
Dirty Puppet Show that they did at Six Flags many, many decades ago, but there's no mention

578
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
of it.

579
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
What is that?

580
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
What kind of coaster is that?

581
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Is that a Vekoma?

582
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,960
Cory didn't even know if it was a Vekoma.

583
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,480
Cory also, just in terms of vibe, he's also kind of like a living ... You know in office

584
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,440
space the like, oh, oh.

585
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:24,240
If that wasn't like a comedy character, if that was just a man who existed as opposed

586
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,200
to a part being played by somebody.

587
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,080
That's the vibe, but they aren't satisfied with Cory because there's just more.

588
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,800
There's a hundred Corys in this special.

589
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,040
There's so many Corys.

590
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,320
They keep introducing new Rapishes.

591
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,800
It's like there's a cloning machine off camera and a new Cory emerges every ...

592
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,800
We got one.

593
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
He's ready.

594
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
Go, go, go.

595
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Ninety seconds.

596
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
They just send him right out.

597
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
Do a couple of monologue jokes.

598
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
New Cory.

599
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,800
That's their life.

600
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:59,280
They have to film fast because they're made, but they will melt in the Valencia sun and

601
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,880
cease to exist in three hours, so we just got to whip them through stuff.

602
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,600
Every Cory you're seeing on screen has a three-hour life expectancy.

603
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,560
You just can't keep it up.

604
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:14,880
It's so exhausting to both be and look at Cory because yeah, almost immediately there's

605
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,920
another guy, David, I think, and David is in ... It's crazy how fast ... David's in

606
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:26,880
like a sleeveless shirt with a gorilla on it and I think sometimes in a beanie with

607
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,400
flames on it, so you get David really fast.

608
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,400
Let me see.

609
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:38,720
David seems to ... Well, this is a point ... When you see David, you realize that this entity

610
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:46,960
has not decided whether the shortening of the show is SFL or 6FL and even when they

611
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,600
decide the logos are different.

612
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,000
Almost every time ... It's a little detailed, but almost every time you see a little mic

613
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,080
cover in this special, it is a different type of ... It's a different logo, a different

614
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,080
branding.

615
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:04,640
If they were an advertising company, I think they should have had eyes on that better.

616
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,000
Our eyes were on the prizes, baby.

617
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Am I right?

618
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Blah, blah, blah.

619
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
That's it.

620
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,640
That's the whole special in five seconds.

621
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,200
There's no script supervisor.

622
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,200
There's no continuity person.

623
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,200
There's no script supervisor.

624
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,160
I'm beginning to think there was no script supervisor on Six Flags.

625
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,440
What was the executive producer doing during this?

626
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,520
More simply, there's no one following any consistency, but it just boils down to people

627
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,560
going like, blah, blah, blah.

628
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
Yes.

629
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:39,120
Well, it's like if any boring nerd talks for more than four seconds in coherent English,

630
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,680
then that has to be quickly interrupted by, blah, blah, blah, blah, and then a word that

631
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,120
doesn't exist, like, yeah, we know we're scrazzin', all right.

632
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:55,360
They're always cutting off the people answering their questions, and then it cuts to indecipherable

633
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,520
stock footage.

634
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:02,520
There is, very early on, there's a shot of a woman kind of dancing, feeling herself,

635
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,840
and then she full-on rubs her crotch, and then it cuts away.

636
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,840
Yes.

637
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:13,000
It's almost as if they got footage where, if the footage kept going, you would see that

638
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,600
she was shooing a fly from her jeans, but they cut it at the frame where you're like,

639
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,600
oh, is she going downstairs?

640
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,240
Is she so excited by Six Flags Live she's just going to take care of business?

641
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,000
Who is that excited about Six Flags Live?

642
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,640
She's so turned on by the whole enterprise that she's got to do above-the-jeans stuff

643
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,640
to herself.

644
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
Oh my God.

645
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:43,800
But the most perplexing one is not, I mean, I guess it's sexual if you're stretching

646
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:51,240
a double entendre, there's a shot of a man with a hedge clipper or a bush trimmer, and

647
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,600
it just kind of trims a bush and then cuts away.

648
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,600
Really?

649
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600
Yeah.

650
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,600
It's bizarre.

651
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,600
Wow.

652
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,120
Subliminal MTV-style editing made me not even notice what you were talking about.

653
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
They do.

654
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,640
There is one piece of foot, almost every scene transitions with the same shot of just bare

655
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,120
midriff woman kind of low pants, and she's just moving her hand.

656
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,000
I don't know if that's the one you're talking about, Jason.

657
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,160
It's like, she's in khakis, it was the very beginning of the first clip, you should, but

658
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:27,880
they use this 30 times, every single, and then it'll say Los Angeles or Texas on top

659
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,840
of that, so you can keep track of where you are.

660
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,080
This doesn't help you keep track whatsoever.

661
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:40,200
No, there is one shot when they pan to the one guy, Nick, who's in a bunch, it starts

662
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,640
on a seal in an enclosure, and then it pans to him.

663
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:52,000
There's no mention of the seal, and it is on him for so, it's got a cut to him.

664
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
That's a good question.

665
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,400
Is that, okay, I'm trying to assess the whole thing.

666
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:01,120
How much actual, of the half hour, how many seconds do you consider actual theme park

667
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,120
content?

668
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,120
Oh, man.

669
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,120
Five minutes?

670
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:09,640
I don't think even four is going to say that, other than unless you count the existence

671
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,840
of roller coasters or slides in the frame.

672
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,080
I think there's one guy who's talking about the concert that's coming up, and he's like,

673
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,920
we got Texas Rattler back here.

674
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,920
Oh, yeah.

675
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,440
He yells the name of a ride, but yeah, you're right, we don't get any, we don't talk about

676
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
that seal.

677
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:30,800
No, if anything, the longest amount of time is spent on Willa Ford.

678
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,600
You get a lot of Willa Ford, yeah.

679
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,600
A lot of Willa Ford.

680
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,440
I, here, I'll get to Willa Ford, I'm just going to go in order, just because it's easier

681
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,440
for my notes.

682
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,440
Please.

683
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:47,320
Okay, so we're not long after that AJ alcohol abuse joke you mentioned.

684
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,320
Not long, yeah.

685
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:57,280
Really soon after, somebody brings up their segment, SFL music news and grooves, and that,

686
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,720
I think it's a woman, talks about how the rumors of Whitney Houston dying of a drug

687
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,080
overdose are not true.

688
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,040
She is alive and well, but we can't say the same about her career.

689
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,400
This is in the first five minutes, like the meanest state, like non sequiturs.

690
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
It's the first two minutes.

691
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Oh, Jesus.

692
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:24,400
They get two, which does make me like, I can remember feeling at that time, all of culture

693
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:31,280
was like, if somebody is dealing with a drug or alcohol problem, that means they're losers

694
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,520
who fucked up, and they should be laughed at.

695
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,160
Was that not the culture of the, yeah, yeah.

696
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,400
When you are getting a ton of that, I mean, it wasn't from this, again, I didn't see Six

697
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:47,920
Flags Live, but it's, boy, is it reflective of the culture of it.

698
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,400
Everyone was vicious to Lindsay Lohan and-

699
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,600
Yeah, I was rooting for the failure.

700
00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:00,640
I hate to make a point that a lot of documentaries have made recently, but I hate to tell you

701
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,320
guys, sometimes if you revisit those Jay Leno monologues, they are not especially kind to

702
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,760
the young women of Hollywood.

703
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,760
What?

704
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,760
Jay?

705
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760
Yeah.

706
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,760
Doesn't sound like a Jay.

707
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,760
I know.

708
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,760
Nicest guy in children.

709
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
He brought those donuts to the strike.

710
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
Well, striking writers.

711
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,160
The guy who did that do, he brought 12 donuts.

712
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,160
Horrible jokes about women's appearances for many, many years.

713
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,880
I feel like we need to turn one of Jay's lines against him.

714
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,120
We need to turn to him and go, what were you thinking?

715
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,360
His most famous line.

716
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,360
His famous line.

717
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
Yeah.

718
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,360
Was that cute?

719
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,080
He saved it all.

720
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,000
Something I continue to not understand.

721
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,400
Can you imagine anything of that nature today?

722
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,520
I guess the Jimmy Fallon hair tussle was one moment that kind of changed the fortunes of

723
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,520
the shows.

724
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
Yeah.

725
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:57,140
So I guess, but that's also like a, that's he's with the possible leader of the free

726
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,800
world who's a horrible man.

727
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,800
I don't understand how like Leno failure, bad, one Hugh Grant joke and everything changes.

728
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,800
So strange.

729
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Yeah.

730
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,320
Oh, one, not to pile on Jimmy Fallon, but I just listened to an episode about the whole

731
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,680
like bored apes, like NFT scandal and stuff.

732
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,920
And the Jimmy Fallon Paris Hilton segment is so funny.

733
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,920
That is something.

734
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,920
I think that deserves to be in the late night pantheon of like the things, you know, your

735
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,600
Don't Blame Conans, your things you've talked about over the week, things that from talk

736
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,440
shows that must be revisited at least once a year, the entire, the Fallon Paris Hilton

737
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:41,120
board segment is like, that is an unbelievable slice of the culture that I think much like

738
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:46,680
Six Flags Live that historians, I think that is more telling about the year that it was

739
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:53,600
made and then a lot of other culture, nobody from Paris to Jimmy to audience.

740
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,360
No one knows what's happening and why.

741
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,120
No one knows why it's occurring.

742
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:03,880
Any entity that caused that to happen is not in the room and has no control over it.

743
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:09,320
So you've just got baffled, 100% baffled people, even the people talking.

744
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,640
I'll shout out a recent episode of the show, Western Kabuki.

745
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,160
And they had a reporter on to talk about.

746
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:24,440
They did the whole board apes from the launch to the temporary blinding every, at one of

747
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:33,040
the board ape fest, they had UV lights at like one of the concerts and stuff.

748
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:41,720
However, there's UV lights for entertainment and UV lights for sterile cleaning, sterilize

749
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,720
like stuff.

750
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,280
And they had, they had the, and there were numerous people who woke up in the middle

751
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,560
of the night and were either in terrible pain or couldn't see and they had to go to the

752
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,560
hospital.

753
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,920
And the company eventually issued a statement.

754
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,920
So they were all fine.

755
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,920
Oh my God.

756
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,920
Oh my God.

757
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,920
But Jimmy Fallon was not there probably.

758
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,680
Jimmy Fallon was not at that one.

759
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,400
Amy Schumer may have been, there's some very funny.

760
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,560
Thankfully, he was busy jamming out with Billy Joel in Madison Square Garden, doing his funny

761
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,320
Mick Jagger impression.

762
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,320
That's insane.

763
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,480
I didn't know there were board ape fest either.

764
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:23,000
I would say that a relatively coherent host is Nick, who otherwise goes by NIC, as you

765
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,480
quoted at the beginning.

766
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:32,360
He is all right because he is the only person who speaks in a black manner who is black.

767
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,440
Yes, very good.

768
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,440
Makes it all a little bit more palatable.

769
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:43,480
He also, I feel like, is full of fun facts as he talks in front of Goliath, where he

770
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,480
mentioned it like, all right, all the summer, we've got Blue Cantrell, we've got Del the

771
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,920
Funky Homo Sapien, in case you didn't know, Ice Cube's cousin.

772
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,920
I didn't know that.

773
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,360
I did not know that.

774
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,280
I thought that was interesting.

775
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,520
And then we got hits coming up from, he seems to be introducing songs that are not played.

776
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,480
We got Nika Kosta, that's Frank Sinatra's goddaughter.

777
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,080
Also, I forgot about, I did know that.

778
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,080
You did know that?

779
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,080
Wow, you did.

780
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,080
I didn't know that.

781
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
Nika Kosta was Frank Sinatra.

782
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,080
And he makes a weird joke about us.

783
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,640
You might want to cop that album, because if you don't, you're going to end up with

784
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,200
a horse head in your bed.

785
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,080
Kind of mixing metaphors, but okay.

786
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,080
It's all over the place.

787
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:30,640
He also kind of introduces a backup singer-dancer who's going out on their own, but then at

788
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:37,240
that moment, a woman comes in a frame and starts holding him, and that is never acknowledged.

789
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,080
It is not the person he's mentioning, I don't think.

790
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,000
Yeah, yeah.

791
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,120
So I think not long after that, we start getting into, you kind of start to understand, oh,

792
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:54,120
they're probably doing the calculation that summer music festivals and concerts happen

793
00:39:54,120 --> 00:40:00,080
at Six Flags, so if we can incorporate that stuff into the show, and we get interviews

794
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:07,240
backstage with so-and-so, Mandy Moore you get, I'm like, well, that's pretty big.

795
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,960
There's somebody with a big career to this day.

796
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,000
I think there's a gentleman named Nader.

797
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,640
We have a new guy named Nader, a new Cory whose name is Nader, and he talks to a bunch

798
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,640
of people.

799
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,560
Willa Ford is his interview.

800
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,960
You get a little bit of concert footage of Willa Ford.

801
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:32,160
He talks to her before, walking by the bus, and then after the concert.

802
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,560
There's Mandy Moore by the bus.

803
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,600
Oh, there's Mandy Moore by the bus.

804
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,900
I thought it was extra Willa Ford.

805
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,320
You get a lot of Willa Ford concert footage?

806
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,680
Yes.

807
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,680
Okay.

808
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,680
That's what I'm thinking.

809
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,640
There's some discussion about why Willa Ford was called Gangsta Barbie in a certain age

810
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,920
of her life.

811
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,760
You see that she has a tattoo of the notes of Amazing Grace on her arm, as you referred

812
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,760
to.

813
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,600
And he asks why, and she goes, I favorite him.

814
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:04,760
They do talk about God for a second.

815
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,760
Very serious.

816
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,680
Yeah, you know, we're having fun here, but ultimately we got to give it up to the man

817
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,040
upstairs.

818
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,720
Hey, he created all these butts.

819
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,720
What are we going to do?

820
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,720
We got to look at his creations.

821
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,200
We got to pay tribute to his bountiful creations by getting our hands up on him.

822
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,280
Notorious G-O-D, Big Ups Baby.

823
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,960
Cory is created by God.

824
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,040
All of them.

825
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,400
Every strand of my spiked hair is created by the Lord above.

826
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,720
He created the inventor of the blonde hair dye.

827
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:39,360
Yeah, he didn't make my hair blonde, but he did create blonde hair dye in the man who

828
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,040
invented it.

829
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,760
So I am playing God, and I'm trying to play with you, God.

830
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,280
I love you forever, baby.

831
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:50,240
God created the creator of Dapper Dan and Dippity Doo, which I put in both my hair.

832
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,120
It might have been from Coen Brothers movies and not real.

833
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,120
Who knows?

834
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,120
Oh, well.

835
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,120
Sounds real.

836
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,040
It could be real.

837
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:05,880
Willow Ford had an ongoing Six Flags relationship, is what I figured out, that if you were,

838
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,800
I think possibly in Chicago, I think Kevin referred to this, that there was a type of

839
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:17,920
Six Flags ad that was intercut with a shot at Six Flags music video for her song, I

840
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,920
Want to Be Bad.

841
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,920
I don't know if this works.

842
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:40,200
Six Flags, St. Louis, save $10 with discount coupons from Burger King.

843
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,400
St. Louis, St. Louis.

844
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:46,480
I like at the beginning in the music video, she pulls off a modest dress to reveal a different

845
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,480
modest dress.

846
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:52,640
Yeah, it's not terribly, yeah, it's a little shorter.

847
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,000
They don't show you a lot, though.

848
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,480
It's still a little, and like, yeah, she has enough time to sing, I want to be bad.

849
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,640
And then the cut immediately is to new Scooby-Doo Ghost Blasters.

850
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,640
Being bad on a Scooby-Doo dark ride, is that the implication of that ad?

851
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:14,960
It's a lot of guests enjoying rides in a reasonable fashion.

852
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,760
I don't think anyone's being bad.

853
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,040
No one's being bad.

854
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,040
Yeah.

855
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,040
I don't know.

856
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,240
I think probably there were a lot of people being bad at Six Flags, St. Louis, but not

857
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,240
in that commercial.

858
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,680
Not inspired by Willa Ford's statement.

859
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,520
Was that Willa Ford song popular?

860
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,520
I know it.

861
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,920
It was around.

862
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,920
Did it chart?

863
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,160
Was it like a number one for weeks and I don't know that?

864
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,380
Or was it, it felt like it was so in the background of the time.

865
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:43,880
It felt like a, we got to pretend this is working and there's like a pipeline to create

866
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,560
new Britney's, but I don't know that it actually, here's my guess.

867
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,360
I think it's one of those, the way we say like, wow, nobody watched this show.

868
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,080
It was only number 40, but 8 million people.

869
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:59,480
I bet like it charted low, but charting low then was like enough money for her to live

870
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,480
forever.

871
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,480
I have here.

872
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:05,680
I have the, it's, it charted as a number 22 on the U.S. charts.

873
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,520
It was a U.S. dance charts, number four.

874
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,520
I don't know.

875
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,520
But I bet the sales were.

876
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,520
11.

877
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,520
Yeah.

878
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,640
And she is now one of the biggest donors to the Democratic party.

879
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,440
She has so much money.

880
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,440
That's not, that's a joke.

881
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,440
That's a joke.

882
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,440
Yes.

883
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,240
No, like we were saying, like she can live forever.

884
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,160
Like yeah, charting at number 22.

885
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,840
It's like, well, you're, you're set for life as are the next two generations.

886
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,880
She played Anna Nicole Smith and the Anna Nicole Smith story in 2007.

887
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,880
Wow.

888
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,880
Okay.

889
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,880
What was the story?

890
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,640
There was a lot of story left to go after 2007.

891
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,640
Yeah, really?

892
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,640
Geez.

893
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,240
Oh, Bobby Trendy is himself.

894
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,240
Hmm.

895
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,240
Nice Bobby.

896
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,240
Oh, they got Trendy.

897
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,800
She, well, for his uncle, the toast to men from 2003 that I've never heard.

898
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,800
I'll toast to that.

899
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:03,000
People call a podcast the toast to men, you know, you know what I'm saying?

900
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,760
Like you got three or four white guys in a row.

901
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,760
That's a pun.

902
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,760
You called them like a murder croons.

903
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,760
You called the podcast.

904
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,760
That's right.

905
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,280
Remember that joke from six or seven years ago?

906
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,400
Was not annoying the second time you heard it.

907
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,840
There's something, there's something strange that comes into effect around the concert

908
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,840
zone of this.

909
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,400
And it's not the fact that little Romeo does not appear.

910
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,400
Travel delays.

911
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,400
Yeah.

912
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,400
I know.

913
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,400
Yeah.

914
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,400
Yeah.

915
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,400
We're not sure if little Rome is going to make it.

916
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,880
And then later they admit that he does not make it.

917
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:39,680
But around, okay, there's, there's already a misfeeling about this special, but at the

918
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:44,200
concert, you get a date stamp of when the concert is taking place.

919
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,480
It is September 28th, 2001.

920
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,440
Now this is very, I don't know, Jason, would you like to do the honors?

921
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,440
Does that remind you of anything?

922
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:58,240
Honestly, I didn't know that big events like that were back in Groovin.

923
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,240
In Texas, I guess.

924
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,240
Yeah, yeah.

925
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,960
Big events like a Texas Six Hikes thing.

926
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,960
When did wrestling come back?

927
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,960
Wrestling came back like a week later or something.

928
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,960
Okay.

929
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,960
A week later.

930
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,960
Yeah.

931
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,080
Wrestling and the Onion were the first ones back.

932
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,080
Yeah.

933
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,080
And Six Flags Live.

934
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,080
Yeah.

935
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,080
They were cultural leaders.

936
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,080
They showed us the way.

937
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,080
Yeah.

938
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,080
Yeah.

939
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,360
You know, Mayor Giuliani said, you know, we were like, are we even still going to do

940
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,360
it?

941
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:26,320
Like, man, this could be the end for, this could be the last SFL we ever did.

942
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,920
But then Giuliani's like, we got to go back to normal sizzle.

943
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,240
So I'm like, all right, Cory, Cory's, all right, Cory's back up in it, y'all.

944
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,240
Just like that ass.

945
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,240
Woo.

946
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:44,200
Everyone is making bad stitch impression, like they had stitch noises.

947
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,800
For good stitch impressions.

948
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,800
Yeah.

949
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,800
Yeah.

950
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,800
What do you mean?

951
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,800
Yeah.

952
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,800
Better?

953
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,800
Yeah.

954
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,480
As the king of good stitch impressions.

955
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,480
But okay.

956
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,680
So then we knew while watching the rest of this that there was the shadow of Night 11,

957
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:08,760
then later, later in the special NIC is doing a little presentation in front of some flags.

958
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,840
And it was Aaron who said, oh my God, the flags are at half mast.

959
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,400
Oh, we are looking at half mast flags.

960
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:23,320
That is how close to that is how much right after 9 11 this was, they had to talk about

961
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,160
like maybe some of it was in the can.

962
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,360
They do talk about summer a lot.

963
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,320
So maybe some was in the can.

964
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,680
But I think this was awkwardly like a good amount was left.

965
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,680
Probably.

966
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,680
They lost Cory.

967
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,800
Remember, we only got Cory for two days because he's going to go be one of the extra guys

968
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,800
in a police lineup.

969
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,800
That's his day job.

970
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:48,040
Central Casting is paying, that's paying more than Central Casting.

971
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,120
We're lucky we're getting, he's like doing us a real favor.

972
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:55,120
That's lucrative.

973
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,280
But Nate, we got Nader and the concert's coming up, so we're going to close it out then and

974
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,760
and oh my God, it's the kind of if anyone wanted a documentary about this and they like,

975
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,400
yeah, I remember them, you know, we were getting we were on the phone.

976
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,560
It was a normal morning.

977
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,840
We were on the phone with Little Romeo's people.

978
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,680
And yeah, it should be fine.

979
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,640
I don't anticipate any big plane delays.

980
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,000
I think plane travel is going to be fine for the foreseeable future.

981
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,680
And then somebody said, turn on the TV.

982
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,320
Boy, Nader shed a tear that day.

983
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,680
Let me tell you.

984
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:32,040
There is not a verbal acknowledgment of like in the country was very divided, but we're

985
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,040
all together now.

986
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,040
Right.

987
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:41,320
And there's no verbal acknowledgment of that or the troops or any of that.

988
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,800
But you have the half mass flags.

989
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:49,000
No, it's like right now, like we're all united under one flag and also six flags.

990
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:58,000
Tweety Bird, if only the tattoos were crying, if only the Tweety Bird was shedding a single

991
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
tear.

992
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Boy, you know what?

993
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,600
I got to say, the least magic mountain on earth has got to be that one where Osama's

994
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,600
got his cave, y'all.

995
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,200
Ain't no magic in that mountain.

996
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,840
We're going to make sure there ain't no magic in that mountain soon enough.

997
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,840
Yeah, baby.

998
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,200
Shout out George W. Bizzle.

999
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,600
There's no there's no way this wasn't like that.

1000
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,880
That joke wasn't in there and they cut it.

1001
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,280
There's no way that maybe the cutty nature of it was less than aiming for hyperactive

1002
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:35,560
MTV editing and more cutting every Islamophobic statement, every warmongering statement made

1003
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,000
by Nader and Corey.

1004
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,880
They do have a political joke though at the end.

1005
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:46,760
And I can't remember word for word, but it's like something about like a lying snake or

1006
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,120
something.

1007
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,120
And then he holds up a picture of Bill Clinton.

1008
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,120
Oh, yeah.

1009
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,120
What is that?

1010
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,120
That's really confusing.

1011
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,120
That was on a card.

1012
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:59,800
They cut out the picture and pasted it on a card and someone had to bring it to Six Flags

1013
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,480
so that he could hold it up for two seconds.

1014
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,360
I'm not offended by that.

1015
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,000
I'm just saying that's the only political joke in there.

1016
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,280
So I feel like maybe there was an agenda by the makers of this.

1017
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:15,760
Well, and it was, you know, we were thumbing our noses at the last guy, you know, in such

1018
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,400
a pro Bush era when his approval rating was never higher.

1019
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:24,920
But there's no joke about like the Florida Supreme Court handing the election or the

1020
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,400
Supreme Court handing the election to George W. Bush or anything.

1021
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,200
There was no, there was no joke about hanging Chad, just a guy named Chad who's hanging

1022
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,000
out here at the pool by Hurricane Harbor.

1023
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,600
There's no joke.

1024
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,920
And Nader, look, Nader's in there.

1025
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,400
There's no joke about Nader giving the election to Bush either.

1026
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,400
No, no.

1027
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,400
You know?

1028
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,040
That's a perfect opportunity for a joke.

1029
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:48,760
There's one Nader's not messing anything up except maybe the sheets, baby.

1030
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:56,680
With Pee and Poo, Nader's mad incontinent, y'all.

1031
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:00,880
They let Nader go because he was like, yeah, George Bush leading the nation, but he was

1032
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,520
also president when the attacks happened, so think about that.

1033
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,320
No, no, you do not say that, Nader.

1034
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,320
You do not say that.

1035
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:12,880
No, no, General Ashley Clark said he tried to brief him, but he wouldn't listen.

1036
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,080
We are pulling you from the LFO interview.

1037
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,280
You have lost the right.

1038
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,040
Oh, Rich from LFO.

1039
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,280
That's a great interview where Rich is like, you know, it's two things, you know, I want

1040
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,560
as many people as possible to hear the music, but also I want to eat and make my living

1041
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,560
on record sales.

1042
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,560
Rich good, yeah, he gives both sides.

1043
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,560
Rich gives both sides.

1044
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,840
It's a pretty, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1045
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:38,240
He does reason, well, the calculation everybody has to make, you know, giving away their media

1046
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,240
for free.

1047
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:44,160
It's really prescient for what the next several decades of media was going to be.

1048
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,280
I don't know when the release of these episodes, this is the second Rich Cronin mentioned in

1049
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,280
the few weeks.

1050
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was maybe a little while ago now, but there was a Rich Cronin, yes,

1051
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:57,160
yeah, because I'd recommend his Howard Stern clip talking about Lou Perlman.

1052
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,160
Right.

1053
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,160
It's unbelievable.

1054
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,160
He's a truth teller, basically.

1055
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,160
Yes.

1056
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,720
I mean, there's a, I like this guy.

1057
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,720
He's got a vibe.

1058
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,720
Yeah, I like it too.

1059
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,880
He's, yes, rest in peace, Rich, but the reason it came up was because you thought one of

1060
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,520
the members of LMFIO died.

1061
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,520
Well, yes, I did.

1062
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,520
I did think that.

1063
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,840
And I thought you were thinking of LFO, which two members have passed away, including Rich.

1064
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,800
I was not, but that would have been a little more.

1065
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,320
Did we ever figure out what, who you thought you were thinking of?

1066
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,320
No, no.

1067
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,320
Why not?

1068
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:29,960
I knew they broke up and I thought they had broken up and also one of them had died, but

1069
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,960
that is not the case.

1070
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,480
Well, and I thought Destro was a DC villain and it's a G.I.

1071
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,000
Joe villain, so we're all making mistakes left and right on these shows.

1072
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,760
Hey, this heat wave that's rocking the country.

1073
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,760
Yeah.

1074
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:44,760
Oh, it's not like the heat wave when Shrek and Moulin Rouge were in theaters at the same

1075
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,760
time.

1076
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,760
Wow.

1077
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,760
Was there a heat wave during that?

1078
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,760
It's a move.

1079
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,360
No, they were just lighting up the box office.

1080
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,360
Oh, okay.

1081
00:52:54,360 --> 00:53:01,320
And sexy late, we got Nicole Kidman and we got Fiona after the transformation.

1082
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,320
Before it ended.

1083
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:15,160
I think now we move to a segment called The Stink on Ink and it's kind of an inane conversation

1084
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:21,880
about tattoos and what color ink you think would come off, it would be the hardest to

1085
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,880
take off.

1086
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,880
Everybody guesses red.

1087
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:24,880
It's green.

1088
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,320
I don't know what that means or who cares, but.

1089
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,320
But green was the hardest?

1090
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,320
Green was the hardest.

1091
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,320
Yeah.

1092
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,320
It was 20 times or something?

1093
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,320
Yeah.

1094
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:35,960
20 times through whatever the process.

1095
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,200
But let's cut to the chase.

1096
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:43,160
Where this goes is anybody got a tattoo that they want to show off and oh boy, the luck

1097
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:49,040
of the Six Flags Live people that it is somebody wanting to show a butt, a tattoo on their

1098
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:56,160
butt and the tattoo that is revealed is Tigger.

1099
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,880
And she really has to unbutton and pull her pants down a little to show this.

1100
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,920
There's a process.

1101
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,360
She goes pretty far.

1102
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:10,240
Not only Tigger, but Tigger looking kind of upset, kind of aghast, kind of open mouthed

1103
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,640
like oh, oh no.

1104
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:19,240
It's actually Tigger making the face that anyone would make when seeing a Tigger tattoo

1105
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,240
on a butt.

1106
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,760
It is a lot of a cheek.

1107
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,920
The next one, the woman just kind of lowers her pants a little and it's a Tweety Bird,

1108
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,600
which is a little more Six Flags on brand.

1109
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,600
It is.

1110
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,600
Yeah.

1111
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,960
And I know that there's Tweety tattoos.

1112
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,960
It's still a little.

1113
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:42,440
I'm like of this group, there is both a Tigger and a Tweety and the Tigger is so inexplicable.

1114
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:47,280
Why would you want not just a Tigger, but an upset looking Tigger?

1115
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:53,400
It actually kind of looks like a Tigger that is about to get a load of something.

1116
00:54:53,400 --> 00:55:00,680
I mean, I didn't think of that, but now that you say it.

1117
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:01,680
Content warning.

1118
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,680
Come, come, come, come, come.

1119
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,680
What was that?

1120
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,680
Was that zoom, zoom, zoom?

1121
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,680
Oh, that was me doing the bouncy, bouncy, bouncy.

1122
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,680
Oh, okay.

1123
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,680
Come, come, come, come, come.

1124
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,680
I should have done the full line.

1125
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:21,680
You should have been a writer for Six Flags Live.

1126
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,680
Yeah.

1127
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,680
We're flipping the Winnie the Pooh songs.

1128
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:25,680
We're making them dirty.

1129
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,680
We're doing it all.

1130
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,680
I can get you a job on this new show.

1131
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,840
I'm working on with this guy, Jason down at Knott's Berry Farm.

1132
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,840
Really?

1133
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,480
Is it a, it's kind of a filthy talk show.

1134
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,480
That's the word on 10.

1135
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,080
Well, that's what I'm going to convince him to do.

1136
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,560
Does the host agree?

1137
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,560
Yeah, he does.

1138
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:43,440
Well, the host is unconscious and temporarily not alive for a few minutes and then he gets

1139
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,440
back in the wave pool.

1140
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,440
All right.

1141
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,180
I have a pitch for this show that you make the host go unconscious again while he's unconscious.

1142
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,860
Give him a Tigger tattoo on his butt.

1143
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:54,860
This is extreme.

1144
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:55,860
I like that.

1145
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:56,860
Yeah.

1146
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:57,860
That's good.

1147
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:03,700
I feel like for brand propriety, it should, it should probably be Whittles.

1148
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:04,700
You want a tattoo of Whittles?

1149
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:05,700
Because we're at the Knott's.

1150
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,700
We're at the Knott's.

1151
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:07,700
We're at the Knott's.

1152
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:08,700
We're at the Knott's.

1153
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,700
Okay, fine.

1154
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,700
I got Whittles on my seat.

1155
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,700
Whoa.

1156
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:15,500
Do you know that during, speaking of characters getting messy, do we know that during the

1157
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:20,740
Boysenberry Festival that you, the Whittles, the Prospector with a big white beard that

1158
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:25,980
you can meet, just during Boysenberry Festival, his beer is full of Boysenberry splashes.

1159
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:30,220
I think I've seen a picture of him with Boysenberry smears on it.

1160
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,220
It was pretty fun.

1161
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:32,220
Yeah, yeah.

1162
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,380
It's hard to call that suggestive because it is purple.

1163
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:35,380
No, yeah.

1164
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:36,380
What would it be?

1165
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,380
Yeah.

1166
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,380
I don't.

1167
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,380
I mean, I could make a little comment.

1168
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:41,780
I mean, Barney the Dinosaur is calm.

1169
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:42,780
I don't know.

1170
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:43,780
What am I?

1171
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,780
I could.

1172
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,060
Barney the Dinosaur is purple cum.

1173
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:48,060
Yeah.

1174
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,380
I wasn't happy saying it.

1175
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,420
Now I know you like doing a Barney impression.

1176
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:53,420
I do, yeah.

1177
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:57,940
Can I open the floor to what Barney might say while blowing a load of his purple cum?

1178
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:58,940
He could just say that.

1179
00:56:58,940 --> 00:56:59,940
Oh, my purple cum.

1180
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:00,940
That's what he would say.

1181
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:01,940
Oh, I did it again.

1182
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:02,940
I love you.

1183
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:03,940
You love cum.

1184
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:04,940
By virtue of talking about this, this is one of the filthier episodes.

1185
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:21,220
Oh, I don't want to say that.

1186
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,700
My macaroni painting.

1187
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:28,180
I'm using it for my art.

1188
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:34,700
You know what's funny is that for a show that is kind of explicit or thinks it is, I think

1189
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,460
there's so many bleeps.

1190
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:37,460
Oh, yeah.

1191
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,940
I think they even bleep the word sex.

1192
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:46,500
It's this perfectly, not even PG-3, this is PG-6.

1193
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:53,980
It's exactly like the combo of Six Flags, we'll kill you, $10 up with Burger King.

1194
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:58,540
It's exactly that level of edginess that is immediately softened.

1195
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:59,540
Yeah.

1196
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:00,540
No, they can't.

1197
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:06,380
I'm hoping that it would get like an 11-year-old audience, so this is the closest they can

1198
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,380
get up to the line.

1199
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,380
That's the time.

1200
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:14,860
Well, let me, okay, since you said an 11-year-old audience, there's a part, another Cory shows

1201
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:15,860
up.

1202
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,500
This one is Ryan.

1203
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:23,340
Ryan is coming at you from Hurricane Harbor.

1204
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:29,380
Now it's like he's surrounded by girls in bikinis and his shirt is off, so we're doing

1205
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,540
some sexy talk.

1206
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,940
All right, let's get real about it.

1207
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:34,140
Who's sexier, Brittany or Christina?

1208
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:37,900
But the girls are all clearly like 15.

1209
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:38,900
These are not.

1210
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:39,900
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1211
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,780
And that's not the case in all of the segments necessarily.

1212
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:48,220
I think completely there's a lot of women over 18 in this, but not this part.

1213
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:54,940
And it doesn't get that bad, except then it becomes like, they're talking about like,

1214
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:59,300
what's the coolest thing this summer, accessories, short shorts?

1215
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:04,700
And then somebody brings up halter tops and he says, yeah, all right, well, we ain't wearing

1216
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:05,700
halter tops, right?

1217
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:10,220
Because all I see around here is my ladies in bikinis, yeah, baby.

1218
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:15,580
And he's pointing to the women on either side of him.

1219
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:18,300
For sure, they're like 15.

1220
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:21,320
And I'm not going to throw this at Ryan.

1221
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,320
It's not his fault.

1222
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:26,340
He didn't turn around to see, but when he said, yes, okay, he noticed this too.

1223
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:27,340
I saw it.

1224
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,340
I saw it.

1225
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:31,940
Yeah, because I'm like, well, hold on now.

1226
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:37,820
He like when he does that, all my ladies, the direction that he points is to a girl

1227
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:42,380
who has wandered up right behind him during the discussion.

1228
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:46,780
He doesn't know that she's there, but for sure, this girl is like 12.

1229
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:50,980
Yeah, there is a full ass child, like has one.

1230
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:55,940
It seemed like her and her friend were just using the path to get by and just kind of

1231
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:57,780
wandered into frame.

1232
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:58,780
That's happening.

1233
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:02,260
It's a very unfortunate point from Ryan.

1234
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:04,060
And they didn't do a second take.

1235
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,060
No, no time.

1236
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:08,300
And they didn't cut before that.

1237
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:09,300
Right.

1238
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,740
There's not like a good like, oh, wow, that was such a good segment that what the discussion

1239
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:15,220
they got into about who is hotter was so good.

1240
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:16,700
We can't do a second take.

1241
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,100
Could have easily done that.

1242
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,720
The button is the halter tops thing.

1243
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:25,780
Maybe somewhere in this organization, though, with some idiot like, could we do it with

1244
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,780
computers?

1245
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:30,740
Can we get the 11 year old out with computers?

1246
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:33,980
I watched the thing about the new star, new Star Wars.

1247
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,700
They apparently did computers on it.

1248
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:36,700
Can we do that?

1249
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:42,180
Well, it also the content of what they're talking about a little before that, the girls

1250
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:47,060
like, I don't know, Christina has that big hair and it just doesn't seem like what everyone

1251
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,140
else has.

1252
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:53,700
And they appear to be talking about Christina and get later in the Lady Marmalade music

1253
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:54,700
video.

1254
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:58,620
I'm not specific to that because specifically, I don't believe she was full on in the dirty

1255
01:00:58,620 --> 01:00:59,620
era yet.

1256
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:00,620
No.

1257
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:04,820
Dirty was like 2003, 2002, 2002, 2002, maybe two.

1258
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:10,900
So I don't quite they didn't seem to know what they were talking about.

1259
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,160
So yeah, I think so.

1260
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:16,780
So her new look as dictated by specifically Lady Marmalade.

1261
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:21,900
It's all like half remembered everything everyone is talking about, unless they're holding the

1262
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:24,140
literal magazine it came from.

1263
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:26,860
And even then, who knows if they looked at it.

1264
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:28,300
Yeah, yeah, that too.

1265
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:34,100
A lot of like, OK, I imagine a show with only one take of everything and where all of the

1266
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,740
content is taken from magazines.

1267
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:41,380
And then we're going to read lists that were already bought up by a magazine writer.

1268
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:45,900
And then the very end is a lot of like talking about technology.

1269
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,620
It seems like they realized, oh, shit, we've got to talk about the phone and the little

1270
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:50,620
camera.

1271
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:54,740
Well, I think, yeah, I think they, yeah, they well, they frontloaded the sexier stuff and

1272
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:57,100
then they get into the tech tie-ins.

1273
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:00,740
My guess is that they didn't have any actual tech tie-ins and they were just demonstrating

1274
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:05,460
like this is the kind of spot where we could do a promotion for Motorola.

1275
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:12,220
I bet they hadn't secured that the sponsors and secure the Motorola sponsorship for this

1276
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:16,700
underage facets, underage creep fest.

1277
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,260
This could be you.

1278
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:23,140
Instead of just a finger, he could be holding up a phone while gesturing toward a 12 year

1279
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,140
old girl.

1280
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,140
Yeah.

1281
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:29,940
There's somebody named Amber who has a very pink vibe.

1282
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:34,740
And at some point she wears like a just a full rose that's bigger than her neck on her

1283
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:35,740
neck.

1284
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:39,140
Seems like it'd be irritating in a hot theme park environment.

1285
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:43,660
She does a talk about like the Britney with the big snake from the VMAs.

1286
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:48,740
And that's what I remember that at the time it was like, what's pop culture?

1287
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:51,020
Well, it's all about Britney and the big snake.

1288
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:55,460
And then two days later, 9-11 happened and wow, can you just a week ago, all we were

1289
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:58,100
thinking about was Britney and the big snake.

1290
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:03,420
And now we're confronted by the bigger snake of terrorism that may swallow us all.

1291
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:08,340
And this is like, this is, this, this is the people go at like, you know, how can we care

1292
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:09,860
about the big snake anymore?

1293
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:13,580
Well, they can't, they have to, they can't talk about, yes.

1294
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:20,860
They can't, they can't have somebody broadcasting live from Six Flags, Afghanistan.

1295
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:22,860
That was everything out there.

1296
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:29,260
They can't, they can't, they had to cut that segment where they asked me on the street,

1297
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:30,740
like see any good movies lately?

1298
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:31,740
What have you seen the movies?

1299
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:38,340
And everyone just goes hardball, hardball, hardball, like the inexplicable blockbuster

1300
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:39,340
hardball.

1301
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:43,260
Do you remember that Keanu Reeves coached the Little Lake team?

1302
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:48,620
That was like, oh, America wants a feel good movie after these tragic events.

1303
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:49,620
After comedy died.

1304
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:50,620
Yeah.

1305
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:51,620
Yeah.

1306
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:52,620
Yeah.

1307
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:53,620
Comedy died.

1308
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:54,620
I remember that.

1309
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:59,100
Are you going to do a two part, like a double header tonight, Domino and hardball?

1310
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,100
Oh yeah.

1311
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,300
They're all so good.

1312
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:08,020
Oh, there's a part where there's some shade thrown at movies of the era.

1313
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:11,660
There's like, at some point they're talking about a, well, there's the segment blockbuster

1314
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:19,980
or bust in which there's some pre derisive conversation about the now classic, is it

1315
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:20,980
called on the line?

1316
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:21,980
Yeah.

1317
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:22,980
Joey Fatone.

1318
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:23,980
The movie with some of in sync.

1319
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:24,980
Last pass.

1320
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:29,700
I believe I have now, I believe I have seen all of on the line.

1321
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:30,700
Is there a kid in the hall?

1322
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:31,700
Oh yes.

1323
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:35,780
Dave Foley, Dave Foley and Jerry Stiller in that film.

1324
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:42,860
But then there's some stories talking about scary movies and he says, all right, so we

1325
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:46,300
got some scary movies coming out and get your goosebumps ready.

1326
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,860
Get your goovers just that.

1327
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:48,860
Get your goosebumps ready.

1328
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:49,860
All right.

1329
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:50,860
You ready, fellas?

1330
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:51,860
You're going to be popping out tonight.

1331
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:54,860
You know, the kind you didn't really use on Jeepers Creepers.

1332
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,620
What's the problem with Jeepers Creepers?

1333
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:57,620
Yeah.

1334
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:58,620
Was that not scary?

1335
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:02,340
Not scary enough for you, Corey, whose name I didn't even write down.

1336
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:04,820
And then he talks up Joyride.

1337
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,020
Did anyone know what Joyride?

1338
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:07,260
I remember Joyride.

1339
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:08,260
Yeah.

1340
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:13,980
It's about like teens go Joyriding and then they get chased by like a killer, I think.

1341
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:14,980
Okay.

1342
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:15,980
It was a horror movie though.

1343
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:16,980
It was a horror movie.

1344
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:17,980
Yeah.

1345
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:23,060
That's a Paul Walker before his more famous car oriented franchise.

1346
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:24,060
Yeah.

1347
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:25,060
Joyride.

1348
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:26,060
Yeah.

1349
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:27,060
2001.

1350
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:28,060
Oh.

1351
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:29,060
JJ Abrams wrote it.

1352
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:30,060
What?

1353
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,060
Yeah.

1354
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:32,060
Yeah.

1355
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,060
I knew there was a factoid about that.

1356
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,060
Paul Walker and JJ Abrams.

1357
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,300
Yeah.

1358
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:36,300
Steve Zahn star.

1359
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,300
Oh, I love Zahn.

1360
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,300
Steve Zahn and Paul Walker.

1361
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:39,300
This is a good cat.

1362
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:40,300
Maybe this is a quiet.

1363
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,300
Is this good?

1364
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:48,900
And just the voice of Ted Levine as a villain to somebody named Rusty Nail.

1365
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:49,900
Wow.

1366
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,500
That's the scariest voice there is.

1367
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:54,500
There's Joyride 2 and Joyride 3.

1368
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:55,500
Like straight to DVD.

1369
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,500
It looks like it.

1370
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,500
Yeah.

1371
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:00,060
I think there's some Jeepers Creepers sequels as well.

1372
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:01,060
Wow.

1373
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,060
This is a bad robot.

1374
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:03,460
It's part of the bad robot universe.

1375
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:04,860
Wow.

1376
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:05,860
That requires attention.

1377
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:08,940
JJ, come back to the Joyride.

1378
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:13,340
This is all has been, he's just been building momentum to be able to get Joyride 4 off the

1379
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,140
ground.

1380
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:17,700
So what did I miss there?

1381
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:22,020
There's a part where it just cuts to somebody who just says with a bleep, crotchless panties

1382
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:25,340
have been taken off the shelves in Stockholm and then it keeps going.

1383
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:26,340
Yeah.

1384
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:29,460
I had to replay that because I didn't know what he was talking about.

1385
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:30,460
Yeah.

1386
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:31,460
That made no sense.

1387
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:32,460
Completely incoherent.

1388
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:36,300
Crotchless boob have been taken off the shelves in Stockholm.

1389
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,300
Okay.

1390
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,300
That doesn't work.

1391
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,300
Also with misunderstanding.

1392
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,300
Then it goes to Cory.

1393
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,460
He says, what's up, Cory here.

1394
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:46,380
Six Flags Marine, what?

1395
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:48,620
If you say it like that, anything's cool.

1396
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:50,420
In this one, they bleep sex.

1397
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:52,180
Everybody talks about where they like to get freaky.

1398
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:58,380
And then somebody says, where's the craziest place you've gotten freaky?

1399
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:00,540
And there's roller coasters going by everywhere.

1400
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:03,740
So this illustrates why that's a bad idea.

1401
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:05,620
It's probably in the casino.

1402
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:06,620
In Encino?

1403
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:08,860
No, in the casino.

1404
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:10,420
On the craps table.

1405
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:11,420
What?

1406
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:13,020
What are you talking about?

1407
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:14,500
This guy's crazy, he likes to dice up his butt.

1408
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:21,100
Anyway, we're going to take it over to Nader in Texas, bye.

1409
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:23,900
Also another part where clearly some of the girls are younger.

1410
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:26,140
And this time it is Amber, it's a woman doing it.

1411
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:31,460
She just does a big screed about what women want on the first date.

1412
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:33,460
First of all, you pay.

1413
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:37,900
Second, no farting.

1414
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:41,780
It's probably the best part of the whole thing, honestly.

1415
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:44,420
Third, don't just think about fucking her.

1416
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:45,780
You got to romance her.

1417
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:48,460
And then that's where you're like, these girls, these are young.

1418
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:49,380
They're very young.

1419
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:51,260
Fourth, don't talk about your ex.

1420
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:53,860
The bitch don't matter anymore.

1421
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:55,460
All right, let's go talk to these girls.

1422
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:57,540
And then approach a nervous 14-year-old.

1423
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,940
Yeah, that's pretty much what you said.

1424
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:01,540
Treat me like a person, don't you?

1425
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:04,460
Check your outfit, open the doors.

1426
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:06,780
I'm not allowed to say some of the words that you said,

1427
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:09,860
but if my mom sees me saying them on this, whatever this is,

1428
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:10,940
I'll be grounded for months.

1429
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:14,700
But the sentiment about the flatulence, I would also agree with.

1430
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:19,100
We all got 16-ounce bottles of Diet Coke to do this.

1431
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:24,020
There's like, maybe they would.

1432
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,780
We all had to share, but you know, technically,

1433
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:28,380
it's up to us how to divvy it up.

1434
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:32,540
Thinking back to your childhood,

1435
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:34,900
you had friends and people in this room.

1436
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,060
There were shows you couldn't watch,

1437
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:37,940
people I knew I didn't watch as Simpsons.

1438
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:41,540
And as I grow up, I was like, ah, that's not gonna be me.

1439
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:42,580
I'm never gonna do that.

1440
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:46,420
But if my daughter was watching Six Flags Live,

1441
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:48,820
I will turn this off right now.

1442
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:51,660
You are not to watch this filthy show.

1443
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,340
And then she's gonna be upset.

1444
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:55,380
I'm like, I guess there are things.

1445
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:56,740
I'd be like, you have to turn this off.

1446
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:59,740
The vibe of, this is an evil vibe.

1447
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:01,660
I don't care for this.

1448
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:02,700
And then she'll fight with me.

1449
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:03,820
So I guess there is something.

1450
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:05,500
I guess I would draw the line somewhere.

1451
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,900
Yeah, well, you're, look, you've got a journey ahead of you

1452
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:10,380
of finding out how much of your mom is in you.

1453
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,300
Oh, I know.

1454
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:13,420
And I know there's already a lot.

1455
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:14,980
There's a lot there already just from-

1456
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:17,340
When you find yourself yelling about paper sheets.

1457
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:20,460
Well, when I'm discussing that this bread

1458
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,660
is technically expired because it says it on the package,

1459
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:24,780
and Lindsay's like, well, no, it's a day older.

1460
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:25,620
It's fine.

1461
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,940
And I go, yes, but we must listen to the date

1462
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:28,780
on the packages.

1463
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:29,620
So I-

1464
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:31,180
I'm with Lindsay on that one.

1465
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:32,740
Yeah, I'm with Lindsay on that one too.

1466
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:35,140
I've gotten better about it, by the way, too,

1467
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:35,980
over these years.

1468
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:39,260
I've gotten better at throwing stuff out, you know.

1469
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:41,580
Oh, cause you're, as long as it's in the calendar year,

1470
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:42,420
you'll still eat it.

1471
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:45,860
Cause Jason's like, I will save one ice cream scoop

1472
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:47,740
in the freezer for two weeks.

1473
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:49,500
I don't mind the ice crystals.

1474
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:51,580
They're my friends.

1475
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:57,220
You and Albert Brooks' mother in the movie Mother.

1476
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:59,740
Oh, Glenn Close?

1477
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:01,220
No, not Glenn Close, but Debbie Reynolds.

1478
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:02,900
Debbie Reynolds, oh, okay.

1479
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:04,620
No, I haven't seen that full film,

1480
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:07,780
but is that maybe a comp for the Mike and Jason relationship?

1481
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:09,100
That Jason's my mother?

1482
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:09,940
Yes.

1483
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:12,140
Then I'm Debbie Reynolds and he's Albert Brooks.

1484
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:14,620
I think that's probably close.

1485
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:16,780
I could see that being absolutely right.

1486
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:18,420
Well, Debbie Reynolds loves the old times.

1487
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:20,260
She was a song and dance lady.

1488
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:21,380
She sure was.

1489
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:24,060
Yeah, you know, the particularly youthful actor,

1490
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,740
90s Albert Brooks, it's just like Mike.

1491
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:28,580
I think he knows exactly what he was saying.

1492
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:30,940
Well, maybe there's a suggestion that Mike

1493
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:33,500
has some components that are not as youthful

1494
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:34,420
as he advertises.

1495
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:36,580
Well, I don't, wait.

1496
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:37,420
What the fuck? I was gonna say,

1497
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:40,060
I don't disagree with that, but I don't wanna say that.

1498
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:42,500
I was upset saying it, even if I think it's true.

1499
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:46,460
There is, I mean, there's a lot of tastes, what?

1500
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,620
Do you still have taffy frozen in your fridge?

1501
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:49,460
Or freezer?

1502
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:51,060
Yeah, there's taffy floating around.

1503
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:52,620
Is it frozen? In the freezer?

1504
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:56,340
I don't know where it is, come to think of it.

1505
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:58,300
You lost your taffy? I saw it in the box the other day.

1506
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:00,540
Keeping it safe in the toilet in the,

1507
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:01,380
but he did tell the tank.

1508
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:03,420
There's a decorative box floating around.

1509
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,420
But you did tell us how to make sure

1510
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:06,420
the taffy is fresh. You can freeze it

1511
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:07,260
and then you roll it between your hands.

1512
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:09,820
As long as you rub your taffy every couple months,

1513
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:10,660
you keep it fresh.

1514
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:12,060
No, no, when you wanna eat it,

1515
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:15,380
you heat it up by rubbing it between your hands.

1516
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:17,020
No, it's not a maintenance issue.

1517
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:18,700
No, it's just once you only have to do it.

1518
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,340
I thought you had to do it every year.

1519
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:21,180
No.

1520
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:22,820
Well, this also clearly needs to be mentioned

1521
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:23,660
every once in a while,

1522
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:25,380
because Mike forgot what the tip was.

1523
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:26,220
I guess I did.

1524
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:29,500
So Jason, just make sure once every at least four months,

1525
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,900
you say the taffy fact on the show.

1526
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:33,580
Rub your taffy before eating it.

1527
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:37,740
You don't need to do it periodically to remember that.

1528
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:39,100
Let me take this right into,

1529
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:42,620
let's keep this on the Jason food brand,

1530
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:44,980
because this knocked me out

1531
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:47,460
when I was deep into the special.

1532
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:50,660
I think I was having a little light cocktail

1533
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:52,740
and this will flip me out of my chair,

1534
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:55,420
that we were even considering talking about this on the show

1535
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:57,380
and then we get to a guy,

1536
01:11:57,380 --> 01:12:00,540
it ends up being promotion for some weird meat product

1537
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:02,420
that's Godzilla-oriented, but the important part.

1538
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:04,820
Oh, don't even mention me in the same breath

1539
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:08,020
that this is probably the most tasteless thing

1540
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:09,420
in the whole thing. Well, you walked

1541
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:11,020
right into it, because. I guess so.

1542
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:14,140
Yeah, and you'll see where I'm going with this.

1543
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:15,500
Here, I'll do it out of order.

1544
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,700
I'll make the second the third,

1545
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,980
because it has to be the topper.

1546
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:23,700
It starts with one of the Corey's saying,

1547
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:26,140
hey, has your Vienna sausage become limp?

1548
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:28,580
Has your Spam lost its wham?

1549
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:33,580
Has your Scrapple become Crapple?

1550
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:35,180
Wow.

1551
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:37,780
There's a Scrapple joke in this thing.

1552
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:38,620
That's wild.

1553
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:42,660
Wow, is Six Flags Live and our show

1554
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:47,140
the only media post-2000 with jokes about Scrapple?

1555
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:47,980
Good question.

1556
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:49,460
I don't know about that,

1557
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:52,540
but I still think it's pretty popular back East.

1558
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:56,500
Where do you suppose I might hear a joke about Scrapple in?

1559
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:59,700
Oh, God, the dine, the line cooks at the diner.

1560
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:01,860
You were saying it's gonna be on.

1561
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:03,180
I'm talking about television or.

1562
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:04,580
Yeah, like, yeah.

1563
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,460
Or podcast media. Oh, and street jokes.

1564
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:07,900
These are street jokes,

1565
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:08,940
which is really funny you said that

1566
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:10,340
because in my mind I was about to make a joke

1567
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:11,700
that you were about to say street jokes.

1568
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:13,380
Oh, that's more of a street joke.

1569
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:14,220
Scrapple, that's what, yeah.

1570
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:16,340
It's a street meat and it gets street jokes.

1571
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:18,980
Yeah, you hear it in the old neighborhood, you know?

1572
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:22,620
I could see some of the East Coast late night shows

1573
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:24,060
making a Scrapple joke.

1574
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:26,340
Some of the, you mean the ones in New York?

1575
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:27,980
The ones that air everywhere?

1576
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:31,140
I was like, do you mean a Pennsylvania late night show?

1577
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,500
Well, they're, oh, I have to look into that.

1578
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:34,820
Hey, Philly Live.

1579
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:37,300
You might need to move back and host one of those.

1580
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:40,020
Quit this job.

1581
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:42,740
Two premises, it's Philly and a lazy river.

1582
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:44,140
You can only do it during the summer.

1583
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:47,500
Those ones in Pittsburgh, the yinzers are out again.

1584
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:53,180
How do you feel with your beloved meat,

1585
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:55,020
the food most associated with you,

1586
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:57,060
being involved in a body joke?

1587
01:13:57,060 --> 01:14:00,260
It doesn't quite make sense.

1588
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:02,260
And what they, where it gets to

1589
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:04,180
doesn't make a lot of sense either.

1590
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:05,740
Why doesn't it make sense?

1591
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:07,180
Well, what does it have to do

1592
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:10,460
with this novelty Godzilla meat toy?

1593
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:11,300
What he's talking about.

1594
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:12,140
Well, I mean, that's the thing.

1595
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:13,740
He's talking about floaters, but like.

1596
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:16,620
But actually, I guess it becomes about

1597
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,020
the some weird Godzilla meat.

1598
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:20,900
So actually, the double entendre,

1599
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:22,660
it's not even about the double entendre.

1600
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:24,300
It's like you're trying to make you think.

1601
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,900
It's actually very clever writing if you think about it.

1602
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:29,540
You think you're talking about my sausage or my spam?

1603
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:31,660
No, we're talking about literal meat.

1604
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:34,780
So it is that, you know, you're so sick of,

1605
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:36,580
I think where Jason's having a hard time relating to it

1606
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:39,740
is the idea that literal Scrapple could become crapple.

1607
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:41,740
No Scrapple is crapple for Jason.

1608
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:44,340
Well, no, I mean, you don't want to undercook it.

1609
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:45,420
It'll be too soft.

1610
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:47,140
Well, I guess that's crapple.

1611
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:50,060
If you want that crispy, you want it soft in the middle

1612
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:52,300
and crispy on the outside, basically.

1613
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,020
When was the last time you had it?

1614
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:55,060
Not in a while.

1615
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:55,900
Okay.

1616
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:56,740
Well, that's sad.

1617
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:57,820
We gotta fix that.

1618
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:58,900
Yeah.

1619
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:01,020
Let's talk about the other side of it though.

1620
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:04,020
Scrapple being involved in a double entendre.

1621
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:05,940
You have mixed feelings about that.

1622
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:09,580
I'm okay with that, but it doesn't really pay off.

1623
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:10,780
No, not particularly.

1624
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:12,140
No.

1625
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:16,380
I guess third question, because you are Mr. Sex Positivity,

1626
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:17,620
acknowledge you as a sexual being.

1627
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:18,460
Yeah.

1628
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:20,100
I talk about sex on the show.

1629
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:22,380
Has your Scrapple become crapple?

1630
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:23,620
Gosh, I hope not.

1631
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:28,780
Oh, the rest of my body is out to lunch,

1632
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:30,620
but that still seems to be working.

1633
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:33,900
As long as the Scrapple holds on is a fighting chance.

1634
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:36,300
Yeah, walking a block, it sucks,

1635
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:39,900
but the rest of the stuff, I mean, it's fine.

1636
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,620
This is the bodiest episode of all time.

1637
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:44,860
This is our Six Flags Live episode.

1638
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:47,020
I think Scrapple is confusing too,

1639
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:48,420
because as you Google image it,

1640
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:51,420
it's mainly served in loaves and squares.

1641
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:53,620
So it doesn't, a sausage, sure,

1642
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:55,940
but I don't think anybody's got a big,

1643
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:59,740
like a boxy brick-sized penis.

1644
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:01,620
I think some people do.

1645
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:02,460
Maybe.

1646
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:03,820
You think with angles?

1647
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:07,260
The loaves are cut into slices

1648
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:09,940
so you can pan-fry it or fry it on a grill.

1649
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:10,780
Ouch.

1650
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:11,620
Ouch.

1651
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:14,860
I think there are unique penises out there

1652
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:18,060
that you can't even imagine, you can't even visualize,

1653
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:18,900
I believe.

1654
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,020
Well, all right, we gotta pose this

1655
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:21,140
to the ladies in the audience.

1656
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:26,140
Yo, does your boy got dick corners?

1657
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:27,500
Let us know in the comments.

1658
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:32,100
When you have sex, is that like

1659
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,900
putting a square pig in a round hole?

1660
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,700
Some people like the bird corners.

1661
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:48,380
Then there's a promo for the Motorola i85.

1662
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:51,900
Oh, but where the Godzilla meat package goes,

1663
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:54,540
it goes to a bad dubbing joke.

1664
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:57,940
It's like, oh my god, I can't believe they're doing this.

1665
01:16:57,940 --> 01:16:58,780
You can't?

1666
01:16:58,780 --> 01:16:59,620
Even in two-pounds.

1667
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:00,460
You can't?

1668
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:02,500
I guess it's like this same time period

1669
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,700
of what was that re-dubbed movie called?

1670
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:06,900
Like the Kung Fu Enter the Fist?

1671
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:10,220
Oh, yes, I have watched all of Kung Pao Enter the Fist.

1672
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,060
Kung Pao Enter the Fist.

1673
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:12,580
Wow, I watched it too.

1674
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:15,060
There's some part, oh wait, you were guys all there

1675
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:16,700
for my screening of Kung Pao Enter the Fist.

1676
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:17,540
Oh yeah, I think so.

1677
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:18,380
I don't know.

1678
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,900
I don't remember, maybe not that memorable.

1679
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,660
No, I saw it, yeah, I watched it.

1680
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:24,980
I feel like there were two funny parts

1681
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:26,100
and the rest fell off.

1682
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,260
It was a not big time, very good.

1683
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:29,100
No, I wouldn't say so.

1684
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:29,940
No.

1685
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:31,940
So.

1686
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:35,140
The Motorola using the walkie-talkie feature.

1687
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:38,100
I knew a couple people who had that

1688
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:40,660
and they were very annoying about it.

1689
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:41,980
The phone is also a walkie-talkie.

1690
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:43,940
I feel like any time there are people around,

1691
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:46,780
they're really making sure to use the walkie-talkie.

1692
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:48,500
Didn't you have family walkie-talkies?

1693
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,620
Yeah, family walkie-talkies.

1694
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:52,860
I think there's a New York Times piece about that.

1695
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:57,860
The short-lived window between the full cell phones

1696
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:00,180
just becoming totally ubiquitous.

1697
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:04,340
And they try to pass off walkie-talkies as like,

1698
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:07,540
keep in touch if your family splits up on vacation.

1699
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:11,500
Did you use the walkie-talkie at a Disney park?

1700
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:12,740
Well, that's the one where, yeah,

1701
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:14,940
I ended up on a security channel.

1702
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,740
Oh, right, right, right, okay, that's what I,

1703
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:18,820
okay, that's why I thought that then, I guess.

1704
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:19,860
I was on a boat.

1705
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:21,940
I was on the boat from the boardwalk.

1706
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:27,220
But now, are these phones walkie or no?

1707
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:29,700
I don't think Jason's walkie-talkies

1708
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:31,780
could have given you real-time sports scores.

1709
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:33,380
No, we couldn't have gotten the sports scores.

1710
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:34,500
Via the web.

1711
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,820
That's where like, you know, yeah,

1712
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:38,260
you could watch ESPN and get your scores

1713
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:39,580
the day that they happen.

1714
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:42,380
Or you could watch Corey and Ryan

1715
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:46,580
hold up their Motorola i85 and say,

1716
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:48,500
we on the web, it's Sunday,

1717
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,420
so we're checking out the scores.

1718
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:54,260
Yo, Padres are, and then not being able

1719
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:55,780
to show them to you.

1720
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:57,940
And this presumably was months ago.

1721
01:18:57,940 --> 01:18:58,780
Uh-huh.

1722
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:00,300
This is the strangest,

1723
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,980
the whole show is the strangest pitch.

1724
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:04,620
I don't know how, I know it's a pilot,

1725
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:07,140
but I don't know in what, are they gonna,

1726
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:09,060
if it's gonna be, if there's gonna be

1727
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:10,580
up-to-the-minute sports scores,

1728
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:12,180
they have to make one of these every day.

1729
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:14,340
I was gonna say, I think it's gonna be a daily show,

1730
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:16,220
like a TRL.

1731
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:17,300
There were graphics. I mean, I would assume

1732
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:18,140
that's what they're looking for.

1733
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:20,300
That aired on TV or in lines.

1734
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:23,220
It said, back tomorrow at 7 p.m.

1735
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:24,900
I don't know what that meant.

1736
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,020
Where? Where it was just

1737
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:27,780
at the end of the video.

1738
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:29,300
Oh no, I know that, but yeah,

1739
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,780
where is it back tomorrow?

1740
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:32,140
That's the big question.

1741
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:34,460
The full throttle lounge does seem

1742
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:36,980
like the only appropriate place to play this.

1743
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:37,980
Mm-hmm.

1744
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:39,580
I also just don't believe that a lot of,

1745
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:42,580
I think that today, a lot of the Six Flags TVs

1746
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:44,340
run off of VHS.

1747
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:48,300
And unless they're burning off tapes daily,

1748
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,220
running them from the post house,

1749
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:51,940
should we get it to Valencia?

1750
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:53,820
Should we shoot a Six Flags live

1751
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:55,860
during Fright Fest opening night?

1752
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:56,980
Oh, that's a good idea.

1753
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:58,260
That'd be a good way to cover it.

1754
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:59,100
Yeah, yeah.

1755
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:01,820
Okay.

1756
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:05,340
The opening night of Fright Fest

1757
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:07,220
is the same as Scary Farm this year.

1758
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:09,300
We'll go to both, I'm just saying.

1759
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:10,140
I like going to both.

1760
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,540
In the same night, we'll go to both.

1761
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:12,380
Oh yeah, we should go.

1762
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:13,700
Oh, that'd be a time, yeah, yeah.

1763
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,220
Or we have to send two teams.

1764
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:17,380
Oh wow, oh, we split into two on that night.

1765
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:18,220
We can split into two on that night.

1766
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:19,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1767
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:20,580
All right, back to you over at Fright Fest.

1768
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:24,740
Like, yeah, you know, hey, this girl's got me

1769
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:25,940
feeling like Frankenstein,

1770
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:27,220
because I'm getting stiff.

1771
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:28,060
Ha ha ha.

1772
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:34,180
Fright Fest, all right, for Fright Fest Live,

1773
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:35,300
for Double FL.

1774
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,180
Yo, we're here in the sewer of souls.

1775
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:39,820
We just walked by a big pile of shit.

1776
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:40,660
Yeah.

1777
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:42,660
Ba ba bam.

1778
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:43,500
That's newer, that noise.

1779
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,980
Did you know that butts aren't just for sex?

1780
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:46,420
There's this other stuff that comes out of them.

1781
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:48,780
Fun fact, it's called poo, and they got a lot of it here.

1782
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:49,620
Ha ha ha.

1783
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:54,260
There's a new movie coming out.

1784
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:55,420
Starring Zachary Levi.

1785
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:57,180
It's called Herald and Purple Crown.

1786
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:58,940
Blockbuster bomb, what do you think?

1787
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:00,780
Ha ha ha.

1788
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:02,700
That delivery was as good as some of those people.

1789
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:04,300
Yeah, yeah, that was perfectly,

1790
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:07,260
yeah, perfectly halfway to sleep.

1791
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:08,700
Hey, there's a new movie coming out.

1792
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:09,580
They feature him in fall.

1793
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:10,900
You might call yourself Fall Guy,

1794
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:13,140
but this Fall Guy stars Ron Gosling.

1795
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:15,100
Ha ha ha.

1796
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:18,820
These are pretty good promos.

1797
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:20,220
We're gonna send you to Fright Fest this year.

1798
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:21,060
Oh, no.

1799
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:21,900
You got anything to say?

1800
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:24,100
What does Cory share, and I have to say,

1801
01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:25,780
about Twisters.

1802
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:26,740
Ha ha ha.

1803
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:29,100
Whoa, hey, did you get all spun around,

1804
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:30,460
and your friend did too?

1805
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:32,180
Yeah, I guess you're a couple of Twisters,

1806
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:34,820
but there's Twisters starring Glenn Powell

1807
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:36,420
in Peter's Now.

1808
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:37,820
You're a couple of Twisters.

1809
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:38,660
Right.

1810
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:39,700
These guys spin around so fast,

1811
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:41,340
you end up getting called Twisters,

1812
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:44,740
but for now, the original Twisters are Twisters.

1813
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:45,580
Oh, sorry, Good Packs.

1814
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:47,060
In Peter's Now, Glenn Powell.

1815
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:49,140
Good Packs is not back, he's dead.

1816
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:49,980
Ha ha ha.

1817
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:50,820
Ha ha ha.

1818
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:55,060
Anyway, I'm getting to the end of the list.

1819
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:57,020
I mean, I could shout out, you know,

1820
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:59,100
they talk about the hardness of tennis balls.

1821
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:01,500
They're hard, harder, and morning wood.

1822
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:02,660
They make, at the very end,

1823
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:04,900
they make a woman do a hot dog eating contest,

1824
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:05,740
and at that point, you're like,

1825
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:08,340
no, she doesn't know the context

1826
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:10,180
that she is being presented in.

1827
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:12,420
Dude, now, if you knew what the rest of this show was,

1828
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:14,940
you would not try to put four wieners in your mouth.

1829
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:16,300
Don't do this to her.

1830
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:17,980
Show her the rest of the pilot

1831
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:19,380
before you put her in this position.

1832
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:21,740
The pilot should have ended with, like, a raid happening.

1833
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:25,420
Like, the police, the SWAT team coming in,

1834
01:22:25,420 --> 01:22:26,580
and arresting every quarry.

1835
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:30,460
We are liberating all of these women from the quarries.

1836
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:34,220
Whoa, it's the SWAT team who liberated Ellian Gonzalez

1837
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:35,060
when they're here.

1838
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:35,900
Ha ha ha.

1839
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:39,940
Ellian Gonzalez was stuck in Miami for a while.

1840
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:42,340
Miami's home to some of the hottest parties of the summer.

1841
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:43,180
Ha ha ha.

1842
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,340
Ha ha ha.

1843
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:50,900
Anyway, I mean, this is, unless you have any to throw out.

1844
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:53,020
That's about all the highlights you've hit, I think.

1845
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:53,860
Yeah, yeah.

1846
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:56,700
Mainly, I feel like we have just described

1847
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:00,620
a culture of spiky-haired creeps

1848
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:04,580
and gratuitous butt shots,

1849
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:09,580
and there's just this grime to this thing.

1850
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:13,260
Everything, now you know how true it was

1851
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:16,460
that Kevin said it's like the video from The Ring.

1852
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:20,740
It is like halfway between MTV's Spring Break TRL

1853
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:22,740
and Girls Gone Wild.

1854
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:23,580
Yeah.

1855
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:24,420
It is like the-

1856
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:25,900
It's Girls Gone Wild without any flash.

1857
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:26,740
Right.

1858
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:29,460
But it's that level of like, douchebag with a microphone,

1859
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:31,220
and I'm here, I'm talking really fast,

1860
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:32,140
and I'm putting a microphone in your face,

1861
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:33,540
and you can't question what's happening.

1862
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:34,380
Yeah, and it's-

1863
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:35,300
Yeah, woo.

1864
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:36,700
And you do feel like, again,

1865
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:38,580
I don't think I could have articulated it back

1866
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:40,180
when I was that age watching it,

1867
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:44,140
but there would be a friend with a Girls Gone Wild tape,

1868
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:48,300
and there's just a feeling, a bad feeling watching that.

1869
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:51,740
That's not, that was not that exciting.

1870
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:53,180
I mean, on some level, I'm sure it was like,

1871
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:55,940
oh, cool, even though it's probably hiding my eyes,

1872
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:58,140
but it was still a bad vibe.

1873
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:02,780
I like that you had weird Girls Gone Wild viewings.

1874
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:03,620
I don't know about that.

1875
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:04,940
You had to pretend to be chill with it.

1876
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:08,460
I don't remember, I know I saw it.

1877
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:10,180
I don't remember where, I don't remember who.

1878
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:11,020
I guess I'm trying to block it out.

1879
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:13,820
I saw it without the words covering up the boobs.

1880
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:17,580
It was not a fun vibe.

1881
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:19,540
The seedy, the seedy-est, yeah.

1882
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:21,500
This manages to be incredibly seedy

1883
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,540
while not ever actually revealing anything,

1884
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:28,540
while not really putting, while bleeping a lot of words.

1885
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:34,780
Aaron was using it as shorthand for how far we've come.

1886
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:36,620
There was something that was,

1887
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:38,380
we were talking about something that involved

1888
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:42,660
like LGBTQ progress or something.

1889
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:44,540
There was something that felt like, wow,

1890
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:47,700
and in 2024, this is possible, and she said,

1891
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:50,180
and that's crazy, because just a few decades ago,

1892
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:51,500
it was Six Flags Live.

1893
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:56,500
It's like a demarcation of what,

1894
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:59,860
it's a shorthand for this is where it was.

1895
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:02,740
So any progress now, and she's right.

1896
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:08,300
There is just this palpable evil to this piece, I think,

1897
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:12,620
that reflected the time, and I guess it's what they had to do,

1898
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:16,460
but I started questioning, is there a further explanation

1899
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:19,020
of the palpable evil of Six Flags Live?

1900
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:23,340
And the YouTube description on Retro Six Flags

1901
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:25,900
just attributes it to the ad company that made it

1902
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:28,180
that I mentioned earlier, Ackerman McQueen.

1903
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:32,020
So Ackerman McQueen is an Oklahoma-based company.

1904
01:25:32,180 --> 01:25:35,060
Also in Oklahoma was a group called Premier Parks,

1905
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:38,420
and they were working together in the early 90s.

1906
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:42,540
Premier Parks ended up buying Six Flags mid-90s,

1907
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:45,940
I forget when, thus making Ackerman McQueen,

1908
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:50,220
the in-house ad entity, and the group that would do this.

1909
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:55,820
I even saw a quote of somebody were putting another guy

1910
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:59,220
in charge, somebody named Lipson, maybe it was Dan Lipson,

1911
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:03,340
that this guy is being looked to generate edgy,

1912
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:08,180
even controversial work, said he's our most aggressive

1913
01:26:08,180 --> 01:26:11,860
and irreverent person in the agency, said Angus McQueen,

1914
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:16,100
one of the particular partners of Ackerman McQueen.

1915
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:19,900
So this was part of that mandate, and you have to wonder,

1916
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:23,780
if the ties were severed in summer 2003,

1917
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:26,380
and this was being done in late 2001,

1918
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:29,300
was Six Flags Live possibly one of the things

1919
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:32,660
that burnt the bridge, and thus causing them

1920
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:36,140
to go to a new ad group, and causing the creation

1921
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:37,060
of Mr. Six?

1922
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:41,260
We might owe Mr. Six in some weird way to Six Flags Live.

1923
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:43,020
I owe him all my success.

1924
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:45,140
He's your idol.

1925
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:48,460
Early mentor, early encourager.

1926
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:50,020
He taught you how to be weird.

1927
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:53,500
But anyway.

1928
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:55,580
Stop me to be weird.

1929
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:56,940
Yeah, you said a mess.

1930
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:00,020
My comedy hero.

1931
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:05,020
So I was like, what was the rest of the ad,

1932
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:09,420
the representation world of Ackerman McQueen?

1933
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:12,740
And I looked them up, and I found that they remain

1934
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:17,660
a very thriving entity, and did a ton of business,

1935
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:20,660
in especially the 90s, 2000s, and up until 2019,

1936
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:22,260
when they lost this major client.

1937
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:25,540
But for three solid decades, they raked it in.

1938
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:28,900
They made a ton of money from their biggest client,

1939
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:30,980
and it's a client that you may have heard of,

1940
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:32,940
that is the NRA.

1941
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:37,460
The company that made this, Ackerman McQueen,

1942
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:40,020
or ACMAC, as it's called for short,

1943
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:45,020
was the PR firm, represent doing all public relations

1944
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:50,620
for the NRA, from the 90s till 2019.

1945
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:54,020
Every piece of media we've ever seen,

1946
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:58,260
print, there's a list, they provided public relations work,

1947
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:00,180
marketing, branding, corporate communications,

1948
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:04,260
event planning, web design, social media engagement,

1949
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:05,980
digital content production.

1950
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:08,020
All of this was done by the same group

1951
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:09,500
that made Six Flags Live.

1952
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,020
Wow.

1953
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:14,580
So they had to deal with that pesky Michael Moore.

1954
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:17,900
Yes, that was probably one of their biggest challenges,

1955
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:22,900
was getting the organization to look combative

1956
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:25,580
and in fight and shape when that movie came out.

1957
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:29,340
They operated something called NRA TV,

1958
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:32,220
which was on for a little while, and I think is no longer.

1959
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:35,940
Here's, okay, the group's called Ackerman McQueen.

1960
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:40,940
Here is a photo of Angus McQueen.

1961
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:43,980
That is the male in this photo.

1962
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:44,820
Okay.

1963
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:46,700
And that is him next to a roller coaster,

1964
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:50,260
showing his association with Six Flags.

1965
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:51,100
Of course.

1966
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:53,540
When this person died in 2019,

1967
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:55,260
the New York Times headline was,

1968
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:58,500
Angus McQueen, the NRA's image maker.

1969
01:28:58,500 --> 01:28:59,340
Wow.

1970
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:02,660
That is how much, this is, the head of this company

1971
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:06,020
is like one of the main people attributed

1972
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:08,700
with the NRA that we know today.

1973
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:11,820
Because at one point in time, in the earlier 90s,

1974
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:15,380
they were not this flagrant, disgusting.

1975
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:17,580
There was kind of a proto version of the NRA.

1976
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:21,620
Was it like a sportsman organization?

1977
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:22,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1978
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:25,020
And I think it was less of like a pack

1979
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:28,100
and this awful kind of militia type.

1980
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:30,660
Right, they turned it into such a crazy issue.

1981
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:31,500
Yeah, yeah.

1982
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,780
As far as just like basic regulations.

1983
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:36,460
And I think the main way that they did that

1984
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:38,620
is with this ad company.

1985
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:39,900
You can find quotes saying,

1986
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:43,500
they are credited with the modern success of the NRA.

1987
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:46,980
They gave PR counseling to Wayne LaPierre.

1988
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:47,820
My god.

1989
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:50,900
He started as like a lower level guy in the NRA,

1990
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:52,860
just kind of like timid, quiet, just did what.

1991
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:56,100
And they hooked onto him as the guy they could ride

1992
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:59,780
to get more power as their advocate within the company.

1993
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:02,820
So they gave him PR training so that he could give

1994
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:05,180
like a real barn burner of a speech.

1995
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:09,860
They made, the Six Flags Live people made Wayne LaPierre

1996
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:11,340
the villain that he is today.

1997
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:12,660
Wow.

1998
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:14,020
What a twist.

1999
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:16,580
I never, doesn't it, but don't you feel it?

2000
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:17,420
Don't you feel it?

2001
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:18,380
I feel it feels bad, yeah.

2002
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:21,340
It all makes sense in some weird way.

2003
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:22,180
The New Yorker said,

2004
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:24,820
the NRA and Ackerman McQueen have become so intertwined,

2005
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:27,820
it is difficult to tell where one ends and the other begins.

2006
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:28,660
Oh my god.

2007
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:30,420
Remember that ghoul, Dana Loesch?

2008
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:31,260
Yeah.

2009
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:34,020
She was on their payroll, not the NRA's.

2010
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:34,860
Wow.

2011
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:35,940
Oh god.

2012
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:36,940
That's how it works.

2013
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:37,780
How long?

2014
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:38,620
Because that's the spokeswoman.

2015
01:30:38,620 --> 01:30:39,780
Who oversaw the edits?

2016
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:40,620
Do we know?

2017
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:41,700
For the Six Flags Live?

2018
01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:46,260
Well, look, what we know is that,

2019
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:48,220
I mean, that's 2001,

2020
01:30:48,220 --> 01:30:53,220
and their NRA dealings were 90s up through 2019.

2021
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:56,220
So, absolutely, there were people

2022
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:59,300
who would earlier in the day take a call from the NRA

2023
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:02,020
and then go and work on the edit

2024
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:05,020
and try to get more midriff into the Six Flags Live cut.

2025
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:05,980
Oh my god.

2026
01:31:05,980 --> 01:31:07,180
100%.

2027
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:08,140
These people.

2028
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:10,300
Here's, let me get it, let me go a little bit deeper,

2029
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:13,940
and the rollercoaster guy I showed you, McQueen,

2030
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:17,820
in 2019, a tape was discovered by NPR

2031
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:22,020
that was all of the main brain trust of the NRA

2032
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:24,260
the day after Columbine,

2033
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:27,140
discussing what are we gonna do now?

2034
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:31,900
And it wasn't quite the horrible NRA that we know today

2035
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:34,700
that only doubles down after there's a horrible tragedy.

2036
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:37,500
This was a group that was truly shaken by it

2037
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:38,980
as human beings would be.

2038
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:39,820
Sure.

2039
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:44,820
In that call is LaPierre and this guy,

2040
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:47,300
and he specifically was,

2041
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:49,820
he's on tape talking about how

2042
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:51,380
we have to show our best face here

2043
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:53,340
because if we get some of the nuttier people

2044
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:55,860
in our organization, some of those hillbillies,

2045
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:58,460
some of those idiots going down to the school,

2046
01:31:58,460 --> 01:32:00,100
then that's gonna look horrible for us.

2047
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:05,100
He's on tape knowing that the worst people in the NRA

2048
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:06,620
are nuts.

2049
01:32:06,620 --> 01:32:07,460
Right.

2050
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:11,260
Just like a weird slice of time

2051
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:14,220
and of a certain time for the organization,

2052
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:17,780
but what I just love is the possibility

2053
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:21,100
that this guy, he's on a call going like,

2054
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:24,860
if Clinton comes after us, this is gonna be,

2055
01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:26,380
if he makes a scapegoat out of us,

2056
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:28,260
then we could be in trouble forever.

2057
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:29,980
Anyway, I gotta go because we're deciding

2058
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:33,300
between Corey and David and I'm not sure,

2059
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:36,420
David's got energy and Corey's a little edgier,

2060
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:38,380
but maybe edgy is what we want, so I don't know.

2061
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:39,780
Maybe we'll hire them both, I'm not sure.

2062
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:41,540
Anyway, gotta go, Wayne, see ya.

2063
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:42,580
Charlton, see ya.

2064
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:47,140
Anyway, one of them's gonna be on Six Flags Live,

2065
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:52,140
one of them's gonna be the spokesman for Surge Soda.

2066
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:55,380
And I don't wanna lose him, frankly.

2067
01:32:55,380 --> 01:32:58,620
No, no, no, we agree, we'll deal with it,

2068
01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:00,700
we'll write the speech for Charlton,

2069
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,340
but we've got some catchphrases brewing,

2070
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:04,700
but please go deal with the Corey situation.

2071
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:09,700
Anyways, one more little bit to that,

2072
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:14,700
is that this ACMAC and NRA who were previously intertwined

2073
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:19,260
as the NRA has come into a lot of financial trouble,

2074
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,260
they couldn't afford to pay this,

2075
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:24,780
I think ACMAC soaked them for money for many, many,

2076
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:26,540
where ardent NRA members were like,

2077
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:28,540
you gotta drop this group, how much are we paying?

2078
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:31,180
And they laundered Wayne Lumpier's money,

2079
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:32,620
there's a whole thing, so it fell apart

2080
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:34,380
in a mess of lawsuits.

2081
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:39,420
And recently, in a lawsuit in 2020, in January 2020,

2082
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:42,780
this is just like dry legal documents

2083
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:44,300
you can go find online.

2084
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:47,940
And here is a little snippet.

2085
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:51,100
On January 24th, 2020, the NRA subpoenaed

2086
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:54,100
non-party Six Flags Entertainment Corporation

2087
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:55,980
to produce the following documents.

2088
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:56,980
And then there's a list of eight,

2089
01:33:56,980 --> 01:33:59,740
and number eight is documents reflecting any concerns

2090
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:02,260
about a request to Akram McQueen

2091
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:04,620
for information on Six Flags Live,

2092
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:06,540
including but not limited to documents

2093
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:09,620
concerning Akram McQueen's response.

2094
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:12,180
Number nine is documents and communications

2095
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:14,020
prepared by Akram McQueen that relate

2096
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:16,260
to the following projects, Six Flags Live.

2097
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:21,540
This video that came to us as lost media,

2098
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:26,540
be fun to see that again, was being sought by the NRA.

2099
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:28,580
For what reason?

2100
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:30,580
Why did they need to see it?

2101
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:33,380
And is there anything that could have like,

2102
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:36,540
was it something, were they maybe like,

2103
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:40,500
okay, we think they're stealing a lot of money from us.

2104
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:42,740
We never watched Six Flags Live.

2105
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:45,540
If we put it on and find the most expensive,

2106
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:48,060
multi-take endeavor we've ever seen,

2107
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:52,740
then we'll know if we look at the host's shiny spiky hair

2108
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:56,860
and we know that it's done with the topest quality

2109
01:34:56,860 --> 01:34:59,740
of 2001 hair spikery.

2110
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:02,060
The researchers watched the pilot.

2111
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:05,060
It appears they shot it for $300

2112
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:08,140
and pocketed the other $20,000.

2113
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:10,860
Maybe it was proof that these are money launderers.

2114
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:13,380
Look, look at the shabby production.

2115
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:15,660
Not one, there's nothing on the screen.

2116
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:17,660
We have a lot of doubts of whether these girls

2117
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:19,820
were actually paid in Mountain Dew bottles.

2118
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:22,700
Yeah, what if they said Six Flags Live

2119
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:24,900
cost us $100 million to make?

2120
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:27,940
Yeah, maybe that's it, yes.

2121
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:30,340
And they needed to like, your honor,

2122
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:32,580
look at the results of this.

2123
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:37,580
And there was some, the heat's on us, all right,

2124
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:40,300
we gotta do, we need a bigger PR campaign

2125
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:41,140
than we've ever had.

2126
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:42,260
Sir, we don't have the money,

2127
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:44,780
we just lost a bundle on Six Flags Live.

2128
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:47,740
I mean, we're talking nine digits there.

2129
01:35:47,740 --> 01:35:49,100
Can we see it?

2130
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:52,420
It's lost, we lost the media, it's lost media.

2131
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:54,500
I would love to show it to you, but.

2132
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:55,900
No way we can, yeah.

2133
01:35:56,820 --> 01:35:59,300
This was, I mean, we're talking height,

2134
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:03,140
you know, like IMAX cameras and explosions,

2135
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:04,420
I think, in every shot.

2136
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:06,060
We blew up a lot of rides.

2137
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:10,780
The hosts arrived into every frame in a helicopter.

2138
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:13,900
We spared no expense for Six Flags Live.

2139
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:17,060
Each quarry cost $30 million to pay

2140
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:18,100
because they're so in demand.

2141
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:20,620
Well, that cloning machine is expensive to run.

2142
01:36:20,620 --> 01:36:22,140
The cloning machine, yeah.

2143
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:25,100
What's this quarry line item that's just a question mark?

2144
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:27,100
It's like, well, we made a quarry,

2145
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:28,780
put goggles on his forehead,

2146
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:31,780
and just the weight of the goggles just melted him.

2147
01:36:31,780 --> 01:36:32,620
Psh.

2148
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:36,060
But keep in mind, the quarries in the production

2149
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:37,580
are just the quarries you see.

2150
01:36:37,580 --> 01:36:39,140
There were tons of quarries who died

2151
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:40,580
due to their own stupidity,

2152
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:43,780
who immediately were released out of the machine and drowned.

2153
01:36:43,780 --> 01:36:46,300
This more, do you know the prestige?

2154
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:49,940
There's all the tanks under the, anyway,

2155
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:53,380
so that's, we got a whole warehouse full of quarries

2156
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:54,220
like that.

2157
01:36:54,220 --> 01:36:57,100
$200 million on green tattoo removal.

2158
01:36:58,180 --> 01:37:00,460
It's very expensive if you didn't know.

2159
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:02,380
Green takes 20 times when you're doing

2160
01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:03,220
one of those laser treatments.

2161
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:04,980
I would bet the green was the easiest to erase.

2162
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:05,820
No, believe it or not.

2163
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:06,660
No, it's art.

2164
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:08,900
We actually, we had to give them the Tweety Bird

2165
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:10,420
and the Tigger tattoos.

2166
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:12,300
The artist accidentally used green,

2167
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:15,020
so then we had to do 20 times taking the green off

2168
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:17,260
to put the yellow and orange on.

2169
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:18,100
That's ridiculous.

2170
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:20,980
If somebody has a Tigger tattoo that they want to take off,

2171
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:24,100
just use a gun and just blast it off

2172
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:28,060
If you aim precisely, it'll blast that tattoo right off.

2173
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:30,700
That's not a solution to every problem, Wayne.

2174
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:31,980
We told you that.

2175
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:35,620
Not with that attitude, it's not.

2176
01:37:36,580 --> 01:37:39,900
Anyway, what a, I could not believe that turn

2177
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:40,740
in the Six Flags.

2178
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:41,580
That's wild.

2179
01:37:41,580 --> 01:37:42,540
Live tale.

2180
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:47,540
I just kinda zone out and I see ad agency names

2181
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:50,780
and I really gotta look them up to go, like.

2182
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:53,540
Well, yeah, I know, maybe if you have future clues,

2183
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:54,580
I guess, coming.

2184
01:37:54,580 --> 01:37:56,380
And again, they switched to donor,

2185
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:59,820
who I guess are just as evil as a regular ad company.

2186
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:00,660
Oh, yeah.

2187
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:04,060
Specifically, super villain evil.

2188
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:08,100
Anyway, so boy, the more you know, the stuff you find out,

2189
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:10,020
now you know everything about something

2190
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:12,660
you never heard about until we started talking.

2191
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:15,020
And with that, you survived Podcast The Ride,

2192
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:16,100
the second gate.

2193
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:17,180
Thanks for subscribing.

2194
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:19,580
And if you wanna dig even deeper,

2195
01:38:19,580 --> 01:38:21,380
if you wanna go even dirtier,

2196
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:22,820
if you wanna be a real dirty dog,

2197
01:38:22,820 --> 01:38:24,580
come on down to Club Three.

2198
01:38:24,580 --> 01:38:26,980
We don't, none of this fucking talk.

2199
01:38:26,980 --> 01:38:29,100
As Club Three subscribers know,

2200
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:31,420
it's mostly yelling and woos.

2201
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:35,380
We mostly just say ass and then the rest of us woo.

2202
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:39,740
So if you don't want any of that intellectual horse crap.

2203
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:41,900
Yeah, there's drawings of both before

2204
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:44,460
and after Fiona on Club Three.

2205
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:46,540
If you wanna find out where Jason has a tattoo

2206
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:50,180
of Yosemite Sam on his body, go to Club Three.

2207
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:52,740
Spoiler alert, it's under my belly button

2208
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:56,780
and then he's shooting my dick with his guns

2209
01:38:56,780 --> 01:38:58,820
and he's saying dance, partner.

2210
01:39:00,980 --> 01:39:03,300
I'm gonna make Scrapple out of that thing.
