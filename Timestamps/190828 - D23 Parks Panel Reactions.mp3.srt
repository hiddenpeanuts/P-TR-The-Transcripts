1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,160
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate,

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,980
hosted by three guys who have finally recovered

4
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,440
from their T23 weekend hangovers.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,480
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Jason Sheridan.

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,320
Hello.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,140
And Mike Carlson.

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,980
Yep.

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,820
Oh, wild.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,320
Oh my God, I'll never forget having a beer and a half,

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,120
you know, 100 feet away from who might've been Joe Roady.

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,800
Friggin' wild, dude.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,800
I didn't have any alcohol on Saturday, I realized.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,840
I should have, I guess, but I should have loosened up,

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,320
because I felt like I was really wound up.

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,360
But that being said, I was still having a wild ass time.

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,240
Driving around Anaheim, went to Burger King before the show.

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,960
Damn, oh man, I hit up CPK, yo.

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,800
Yeah.

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,400
I went to Pizza Press, connected to the hotel.

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,280
You had.

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,360
It was crazy, man.

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,560
I thought, I ordered a six ounce pour,

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,560
but then the waiter, because it was coming a little late,

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,160
he just gave me the nine for free.

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,520
Whoa, free nine.

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,360
Yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,180
Wow.

29
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,320
And then I cut it off after six,

30
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,160
because we had a show to do, and I gave Aaron the other three.

31
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,880
But nonetheless, I could've gotten three ounces more of wild.

32
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,440
Whoa, that is wild.

33
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,600
I wasn't drinking, because I was still getting over a case

34
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,800
of the Phase Four Heebie-Jeebies.

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,720
The Marvel Phase Four?

36
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,720
The Marvel Phase Four.

37
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,560
Oh, I see.

38
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,120
The Willys, the Gooseys.

39
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,080
From Comic-Con Phase Four?

40
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,400
No, they were talking about Phase Four at D23.

41
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,640
But they didn't have one division.

42
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,120
No, but they had it on the big screen, it said Phase Four.

43
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,080
I saw, so you were like.

44
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,120
Just seeing the words gave you Heebie-Jeebies.

45
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,960
Yes.

46
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,680
So you didn't get a flare up at Comic-Con when it was announced,

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,600
you just had it happen when it was D23.

48
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,320
No, I was dealing with damp bedding at Comic-Con.

49
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,160
Oh, right, right, right.

50
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,720
Yeah, you had your whole other thing.

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,560
Different problem.

52
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,400
Yeah.

53
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,880
I mean, it was a weekend just full of amazing timeline charts.

54
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,000
I mean, just to finally understand how Star Wars works.

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,840
Yeah.

56
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,080
That there was the age of Darth Maul,

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,400
there was the age of the Plagueis and the age of, you know,

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,160
the Han looking cool and the age of whatever it is now,

59
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,640
the age of the Hinged Lightsaber.

60
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,480
Did you see that?

61
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,280
There was some like chart because they had to explain

62
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,560
where Mandalorian lands.

63
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,400
Right.

64
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,560
I mean, it's a little helpful,

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,960
but it's so funny that we're in,

66
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,840
well, it's between Return of the Jedi and Force Awakens.

67
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,680
Oh, okay.

68
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,520
It bridges those.

69
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,360
Yes, that's an era that hasn't been bridged yet.

70
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,120
It's explored except in like three dozen novels

71
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,720
that are not canon.

72
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,160
But are also now being canon again slowly.

73
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,400
Because people like them and pay for them.

74
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,240
Maybe they shouldn't have been so mean to all that stuff

75
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,160
because it really put the pressure on the new ones.

76
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,520
Yeah, yes, I did see that.

77
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,720
They couldn't fit it all into one picture.

78
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,960
So it looked like there was like these branches

79
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,960
coming off of it.

80
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,520
I, as a comic fan, I'm used to stuff like that

81
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,360
on a page maybe listed.

82
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,480
There's the current X-Men comic.

83
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,360
Jonathan Hickman has like maybe 10 charts per issue

84
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,480
of like what happened in the timeline.

85
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,280
And I won't spoil it.

86
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,400
But it is funny to feel like you have to show that

87
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,760
and to feel like that even reads well in an arena

88
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,040
or wherever they're showing it.

89
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,480
In the X-Men comic, it's good.

90
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,640
And X-Men famously convoluted continuity.

91
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,040
So like I would actually feel okay giving these to someone

92
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,880
because they are kind of self-contained

93
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,240
and self-explanatory.

94
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,560
I'm a fan of charts.

95
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,880
I always said Back to the Future 2 is my favorite movie

96
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,680
because it gets so confusing.

97
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,120
A character has to make a chart for you in the middle.

98
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,120
But I do think it's funny where like now we gather

99
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,960
in arenas to cheer for charts

100
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,080
and brand alliance announcements.

101
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,960
What we're doing here today, by the way,

102
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,760
so we have our own confusing timeline.

103
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,240
We're doing this, having recorded our live episode

104
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,240
this past Saturday night near D23 with Jenny Nicholson

105
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,840
and you the listener who weren't there,

106
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,240
we'll be hearing that this upcoming Friday.

107
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,360
And it was a great time.

108
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,200
It was a weird time I might say, but a lot of fun.

109
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,160
We made some earth shattering announcements

110
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,720
about our own show and some extremely incorrect predictions

111
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,040
about D23.

112
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,640
I don't think we were that incorrect.

113
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,000
I was incorrect about one major thing.

114
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,240
I guess I can reveal that's not that such a spoiler

115
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,280
to feel like people are gonna go,

116
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,560
oh, what was he incorrect about?

117
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,080
I can't wait till Friday.

118
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,120
The only thing I was incorrect, I think about was Avengers.

119
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,560
Yeah, that they wouldn't announce the Avengers ride.

120
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,080
The bulk of this episode will be

121
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,360
about the parks announcements.

122
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,600
Yes, which we recorded our live show before that.

123
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,920
We were just guessing, but now it's happened.

124
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,880
And Scott and I were awake and live tweeting it

125
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,160
as people were live streaming it.

126
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,440
We got to watch it from the comfort of our own homes.

127
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,680
Mike, you woke up with about half an hour.

128
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,520
I actually woke up,

129
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,640
Lizzy took the dog out in the morning on the Sunday.

130
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,240
So I got to sleep in, which was nice.

131
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,120
Yeah, cause I had to catch up.

132
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,160
But so yeah, I came in halfway

133
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,280
and then I was scrubbing through the live stream.

134
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,560
And like I saw Bob Chapek talking about

135
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,360
Runaway Railway and stuff.

136
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,480
You didn't feel the electricity emanating from like

137
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,320
Gizmo Gerald's live stream

138
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,960
when Bullseye the Target Dog came out.

139
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,440
Was that the actual name of the man?

140
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,040
No, I forget the name.

141
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,200
The name wasn't that bad.

142
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,040
It's rare you get to be part of an in-mass experience,

143
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,280
like the finale of MASH or the Super Bowl

144
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,560
or the finale of Breaking Bad or something.

145
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,160
And that's how, I know you watched Bullseye

146
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,680
the Target Dog come out later,

147
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,000
but it just wasn't the same as having watched it

148
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,320
20 minutes prior as it happened live.

149
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Yeah, I know, I hear that.

150
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,720
You're always gonna be at a little bit of a deficit.

151
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,600
Yeah, no, that's true.

152
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,840
There'll be a little piece of my life

153
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,120
that's not as complete as yours.

154
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,880
Yeah, it's also a little sad we weren't there

155
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,480
to get the $10 gift card.

156
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,960
That was my big regret.

157
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,200
Right, yeah, I assure you.

158
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,280
We could have, oof, we could have cleaned up with that.

159
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,120
Cleaned up.

160
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,600
So I don't wanna get too ahead of myself or ourselves,

161
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,000
but why was that at the Parks panel?

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,840
Okay, I will tell you why.

163
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,320
Because Parks falls under consumer products now.

164
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,160
Oh, so the, oh, oh man.

165
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,920
Consumer products and experiences,

166
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,680
including the experience of tiny little Disney stores

167
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,800
coming to Target's throughout the country.

168
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,120
You know what, fine with that,

169
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,160
but I just don't want it in my Parks panel.

170
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,960
It was oddly corporate for something that you're turning,

171
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,520
you're tuning in to see if they're gonna build a panel

172
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,440
or if they're gonna build a pavilion of Brazil

173
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,480
or Disneyland India, some of the crazy things.

174
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,720
That was a rumor, yes.

175
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,520
Rumored about and then you instead get,

176
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,480
and now ladies and gentlemen, the CEO of Target.

177
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,440
It's like, why wasn't that just a press release?

178
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,240
Who was excited, who was so jacked up about that?

179
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,320
I marked out when the dog came out.

180
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,240
Sure. I will say.

181
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,080
Because it was, Bullseye had the red, yeah, the red.

182
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,760
They painted a real dog with the Bullseye.

183
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,120
They did, they defaced a dog.

184
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,480
Ladies and gentlemen, a defaced dog.

185
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,840
And because I will say before that, it was a lot,

186
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,320
besides some new footage from within Rise of the Resistance,

187
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,360
which I feel like is just different footage

188
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,120
from a different angle,

189
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,960
similar footage from a different angle,

190
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,800
it was a lot of stuff of them saying,

191
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,960
here's some stuff that already opened.

192
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,040
I did see, I saw a little bit of that trailer

193
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,080
and I had to turn it off because I did see a scene in there

194
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,400
that I didn't know was in there.

195
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,960
Yep, I didn't wanna know, I didn't look at it.

196
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,680
Good, that's good, because there was a thing that happened

197
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,280
and I was like, oh shit, that's awesome.

198
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,920
I didn't know that was in there.

199
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,320
And then I turned it off so I didn't see anything else.

200
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,000
I kind of forgot a lot of it.

201
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,480
I was still, I was awake but kind of grounded.

202
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,840
I was still tired from the show.

203
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,360
That's the cool effect that I think they're gonna do.

204
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,920
Yeah, I agree.

205
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,760
Carly Weisel tweeting today,

206
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,920
she went to a Star Wars thing

207
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,360
in some press event in Florida

208
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,120
and she, I think, got a walkthrough of Rise of the Resistance

209
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,840
and said, this will absolutely change

210
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,680
your perception of Galaxy's Edge.

211
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,160
Sure. She seems to be supporting

212
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,160
that any odd deflation or disappointment

213
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,920
that anybody's feeling will be corrected

214
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,520
by Rise of the Resistance.

215
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,640
Did she go through the whole thing this time?

216
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,680
Because when we were interviewing her,

217
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,440
she said she just walked through the first part of it.

218
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,560
Did it seem like she's actually walked the whole thing now?

219
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,920
I don't know that, can't tell you.

220
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,160
They were a little further along on it in Florida

221
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,680
because they didn't have to rip out the sensors.

222
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,080
Right, they didn't have to, yeah.

223
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
So I wonder if she got to,

224
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,480
because I think before she got to go

225
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,680
into the main hangar area with the loading,

226
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,080
I think she got up to the loading

227
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,840
when their actual trackless ride begins.

228
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,680
So I wonder, we'll ask her.

229
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,960
She's at the opening right now

230
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,800
for Galaxy's Edge in Orlando.

231
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,000
We hope they can get this thing working.

232
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,880
That's the main issue, I would say, yes.

233
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,800
Well, why don't we, while we're talking Star,

234
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,320
let's bang out all the Star Wars crap first.

235
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,600
Sure.

236
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,920
Rise of the Resistance coming,

237
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,480
showed a little extra footage,

238
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,040
showed kind of a too long montage of people saying

239
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,720
they like Galaxy's Edge.

240
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,560
Yeah.

241
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,280
Which, yeah, people do like it.

242
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,600
There was a lot of, this is,

243
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,360
we shouldn't get into other parts of it,

244
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,080
but the Star Wars, they showed a minute of Star Wars,

245
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,160
you reference the double lightsaber with Rey,

246
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,000
evil Rey or whatever.

247
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,680
But they show like a minute and a half of the old Star Wars

248
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,280
and you're like, yeah, okay.

249
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,120
But, I guess we know.

250
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,240
But it's all like, hey, remember this, you like this.

251
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,640
It also really illustrates how these are not one story

252
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,720
because they're just so aesthetically,

253
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,080
radically aesthetically different.

254
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,080
So putting Samuel L. Jackson next to Princess Leia

255
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,640
next to the new stuff next to the Hugs,

256
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,360
it's just not one thing at all.

257
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,880
I'm just saying it feels a little,

258
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,040
both of these moves feel a little bit insecure

259
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,880
with Galaxy's Edge.

260
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,280
We love Galaxy's Edge.

261
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,920
It's like, yeah, fine, just show us the ride.

262
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,740
It's fine.

263
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,120
I'm excited you and McGregor's coming back.

264
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,960
Yes. Sure.

265
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,040
Yeah.

266
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,240
I'm on board for that.

267
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,840
Okay, yeah, me too.

268
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,520
What, what other, oh, the Galactic Star Cruiser.

269
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,360
Oh yes, we gotta talk about it.

270
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,560
The inclusive hotel.

271
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,280
Galactic Cruiser, there's no star in that title.

272
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,360
Are you sure?

273
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,280
You seem very thrown by this.

274
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,120
Yeah, well.

275
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,960
It's not, it wouldn't be called

276
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,080
Star Wars Galactic Star Cruiser.

277
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,120
That's too many stars.

278
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,200
I think it might be.

279
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh boy, all right, it's on.

280
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,160
But is it called, is that the official name

281
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
that Disney's calling it?

282
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,960
And then in the canon, it's a Star Cruiser?

283
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,440
I'm proud potentially.

284
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,680
Cause the Star Cruiser in Star Wars is real, I think.

285
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,440
So basically what it is, what I understand,

286
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,800
it's like now they're like presenting it

287
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,760
as like it's a cruise ship in space.

288
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,600
Yes, apparently.

289
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,440
Yes.

290
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,280
Which I do think is better

291
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,600
than what I was thinking where it was like

292
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,420
a very cold transport that you were just on for two days.

293
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,960
Like a cold, like alien, you were on the ship from Alien.

294
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,720
And you're meant to imagine that every time.

295
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,560
In this world, every time.

296
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,440
In fact, that is the headline of CNN Travels articles.

297
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,640
Is a cruise ship in space.

298
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,720
Disney Star Wars Hotel is a cruise ship in space.

299
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,560
Right.

300
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,400
It's pretty fun.

301
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,220
I like that.

302
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,360
It's a really fun idea.

303
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,080
I still am worried people are gonna freak out

304
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,040
and have like madness from not being able

305
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,280
to see a window for two days.

306
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,400
That was my concern, yeah.

307
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,800
Can they give you the option to step outside of?

308
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,640
That would be a thing.

309
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,400
A port day at Galaxy's Edge.

310
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,480
Right, so you do leave for a little bit,

311
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,400
but it's a two day experience.

312
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,360
But I mean, can the screen,

313
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,000
like can you have a space or not?

314
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,440
That's an ops question.

315
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,280
Yeah.

316
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,120
Where they must,

317
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,960
cause I don't think the screen though

318
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,560
is a window behind it.

319
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,400
You know what I mean?

320
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,520
I don't think, unless they're gonna have the option

321
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,520
where it turns off.

322
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,640
Disneyworld.go.com,

323
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,480
Star Wars colon galactic star cruiser

324
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,840
at Disney World Resort.

325
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,660
Really?

326
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,680
A two night all inclusive.

327
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,120
Ah, all right.

328
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,960
Yeah.

329
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,800
You know what?

330
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,880
I copied it from something that was wrong then.

331
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,000
Galactic cruiser.

332
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,640
I kind of read a bunch of articles

333
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,480
just cause every now and then one would mention a detail

334
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,920
that another one missed.

335
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,440
Like I was trying to find this off this topic,

336
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,040
but like Mary Poppins, the attraction,

337
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,600
I think you go through the front door of the bank's house,

338
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,040
which I only saw one place mention that,

339
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,360
but I think was in the presentation.

340
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,200
That I think could be.

341
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,960
Nothing about the ride isn't.

342
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,800
No, nothing at all.

343
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,640
No one knows anything.

344
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,080
That is called, that's called galactic umbrella cruiser.

345
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,920
We do know that.

346
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,760
Yes.

347
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,600
That's true.

348
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,440
There's a consistency.

349
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,280
Yes.

350
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,560
Like, God, everything's named the same way now.

351
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,480
Well, hey, congrats to you.

352
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,320
Apologies for either.

353
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,400
Oh, that's okay.

354
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,920
A victory for Jason.

355
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,600
I don't, so I was on Blue Loop,

356
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,800
the themed entertainment industry kind of trade magazine.

357
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,320
They were quoting our past guest, Lynn Testa,

358
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,360
as this for a family of four,

359
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,600
this two night experience will cost $2,500.

360
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,880
Which if that includes.

361
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,040
All of, for everyone?

362
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,880
Yeah, which I was trying to break down.

363
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,360
If that includes food and lodging and the experiences

364
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
and a park ticket.

365
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,400
Why do we think it's food?

366
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,320
It's not bad.

367
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,160
What's the indication of food?

368
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,480
Because they said,

369
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,080
because they were saying the buffet,

370
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,960
like breakfast, lunch, and sit down dinners,

371
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,040
if it's all inclusive, like a cruise ship,

372
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,280
food is included.

373
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,640
Okay.

374
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,480
So maybe.

375
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,240
Again, I'm sure like liquor is probably an add on.

376
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,440
That's how it works on cruise.

377
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,920
Again, if this is being the cruise ship model on land,

378
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,600
stuff is included and then there's plus up add ons.

379
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,560
Do you get bands past their prime?

380
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,440
Do you get a modal nodes tribute bands

381
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,000
of like sadder fatter?

382
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,640
Well, like a, but like a max,

383
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,640
yeah, max Rebo band tribute.

384
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,480
Yeah.

385
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,800
Dressed as max Rebo.

386
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,640
Yeah.

387
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,800
But the max Rebo experience.

388
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,760
Oh, I know it's a female max Rebo tribute band

389
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,920
called max Shebo.

390
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,840
Pretty good.

391
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,680
Pretty good.

392
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,880
Yeah. I don't know.

393
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,280
They haven't mentioned the bands yet in the press release.

394
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,040
And it's not a true cruise ship experience to me,

395
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,160
unless you got a zip line

396
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,120
and you got and all you can eat Ronto.

397
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,240
If it should be like a gross pile of Ronto that's right.

398
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,040
Like the little miss colored, like, I don't know.

399
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,520
This isn't prime Ronto.

400
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,120
Right. And then like for certain weeks,

401
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,440
it'll be like a singles cruise.

402
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,960
And like you can't have families there.

403
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,160
It's a hookup.

404
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,680
It's a hookup on the spaceship type of a situation.

405
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,120
There's a rumor that the velvet sessions,

406
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,280
which are the intimate performances by bands done

407
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,560
in the hard rock hotel lobby at Universal

408
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,920
will be moving to collect.

409
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,040
That's a lot of info in one sentence.

410
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,880
I actually didn't know.

411
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,000
I have been there.

412
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,160
So I was, I must've told this story.

413
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,880
Well, I was there like when I was in college,

414
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,640
but like under 21, too young to go and the fix played.

415
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,720
And my dad's like, Oh, tutoring center.

416
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,600
I'm going to go to this.

417
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,000
You guys just go to the park.

418
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,440
And then when I was there two years ago in 2017,

419
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,280
the velvet session that night was the fix.

420
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,520
So. And your dad was a member.

421
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,360
Yeah.

422
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,360
He joined the band without you knowing.

423
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,400
This guy seems cool.

424
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,040
Does indeed lead to another.

425
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,400
The first time I was there was around the time

426
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,800
Grand Theft Auto of like city was big.

427
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,040
And that song is in that nonstop.

428
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,880
Oh, sure.

429
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,720
Very exciting.

430
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
Yeah.

431
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,440
Some good go West in there too.

432
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,760
Yeah.

433
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,880
Stan go West.

434
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,920
There's a, on the star cruise, the star cruiser,

435
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,360
they have like, I saw it.

436
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,040
So they have like a room for kids to play in,

437
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,000
but it looks like just sort of a cargo bay area.

438
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,840
Okay.

439
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,000
Where they crawl in vents.

440
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,840
Oh yeah.

441
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,160
Which like on one hand, I'm like, that's cool.

442
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
But also like, it doesn't look that big.

443
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,000
We'll see.

444
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,320
I don't, we don't know what it looks like for real.

445
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,920
Mom, I want to go back to the boiler room.

446
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,120
It does look, actually that's a better way to describe it.

447
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,560
It does look like the boiler room.

448
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,840
And it looks like kids are like climbing in the vents,

449
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,800
which I guess I liked the idea of climbing in the vents

450
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,880
as a kid.

451
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,040
And then there's a room where you go in the captain,

452
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,520
you go in the bridge and like, I guess an attack happens

453
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,880
and you got to like go and press buttons or something,

454
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,880
which is cool.

455
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,880
My, my, here's my two concerns.

456
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,720
Number one, somebody's-

457
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,880
People think it's weird if when you go by yourself

458
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,720
and without children.

459
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,960
That's way down the list of concerns, honestly,

460
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,920
for this specifically.

461
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,160
Yeah, I don't think you're the only one with this problem.

462
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,040
This will be less down like to 15 or 16 concern.

463
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,480
Is that the, first of all, somebody will go mad

464
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,760
from not seeing the sun.

465
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,600
Space madness.

466
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,680
Space madness.

467
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,520
Yeah.

468
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,120
And then two is that like the families are not gonna

469
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,040
want to do it.

470
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,440
Families, if they do it, they're gonna hate it

471
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,600
because they're like stuck in this weird building

472
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,800
and there's too many themed experiences.

473
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,120
And it doesn't look like this is,

474
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,240
this is a controversial thing.

475
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,200
I think I said a day or two ago, I said,

476
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,240
I think that an Avatar hotel would be a more sure bet

477
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,000
than a Star Wars hotel, not because of the IP,

478
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,480
but because Avatar aesthetically is so pleasing.

479
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,520
People like the hallelujah mountains.

480
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,880
They like the colors.

481
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,720
If you could see.

482
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,960
I love being in a screensaver.

483
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,800
Yes.

484
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,000
If I could just live in a screensaver

485
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,320
for two days straight.

486
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,960
I think a sure bet is like, if you could see

487
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,920
the mountains outside the window

488
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,080
and you were sort of being taken care of by the Navi

489
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,520
and it's a very like a spa kind of a thing,

490
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,000
that to me, I was like, mom and dad who don't care maybe

491
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,960
about the IP as much, that would be a slam dunk.

492
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,680
I think the Star Wars is a little cold.

493
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,000
What percentage do I disagree with you?

494
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,640
120%?

495
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,160
No, I think that I'm just saying like,

496
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,040
if you look at it without the IP,

497
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,880
what are mom and dad gonna like better?

498
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,560
The one where it's like this kind of earthy thing,

499
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,680
very beautiful or this kind of cold spacecraft

500
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,320
with some kiddy, like fun kid stuff

501
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,600
when they can't see out the window and there's no sunlight.

502
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,880
I think I agree with both of you.

503
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,760
Scott, I don't think you're wrong.

504
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,200
I think Mike, there is some truth in what you were saying

505
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,320
because just comparing like what they've done

506
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,520
with what I've seen of Avatar and Animal

507
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,480
Kingdom, it's a lot of lush greenery, a lot of foliage.

508
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,840
More like a resort is already.

509
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,320
Yeah, but just seeing pictures of that,

510
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,280
I find it pleasing in the same way that like a lot

511
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,520
of the new Epcot landscape architecture,

512
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,480
multi-level parks, I'm like, if you just fill this

513
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,000
with like a glut of green space, I'm into that.

514
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,200
I'm actually into that.

515
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,120
I guess I am too.

516
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,560
As I'm parsing what Mike was saying,

517
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,680
maybe where I depart is being taken care of by the Navi.

518
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,520
Well, that's just a fun.

519
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,080
Are they craving you like a baby?

520
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,520
That's just a fun extra little add on.

521
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,200
They don't have to necessarily take care of it.

522
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,560
I mean, I don't need a massage from a Navi.

523
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,280
I picture these berries.

524
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,120
I like that.

525
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,240
I mean, I like them telling me they have berries for me.

526
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,960
Do the employees have to be?

527
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,800
There could be some humans,

528
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,160
but there has to be some sort of Navi experience.

529
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm just saying.

530
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,240
A tuck-in experience?

531
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,400
The big like banana leaf blanket.

532
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,240
Can they even, are they even?

533
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,080
They're so tall, aren't they?

534
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,560
I was gonna say they're so tall.

535
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,400
Is it gonna be hard for them to get in the room?

536
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,240
Well, then maybe they're gonna build all the rooms

537
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,760
like 11 feet high.

538
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,920
Yeah.

539
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,800
Or how big are they?

540
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,600
15 feet?

541
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,040
How tall are they?

542
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,240
I'm not sure.

543
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,800
I'm just saying, yeah, maybe the, look,

544
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,200
it doesn't have to be fully everyone's dressed up as a Navi.

545
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,400
I'm just saying, I think that my concern is,

546
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
is that if you just take the,

547
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,360
if you took the Star Wars out of it,

548
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,080
all these experiences better be like crazy cool.

549
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,720
They better be so next level cool.

550
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,840
Because kids are gonna break down,

551
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,560
like I wanna go to the Magic Kingdom.

552
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,160
It's like, well, no, we're on the Galactic Star Cruise.

553
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,360
Yeah, cause it's like.

554
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,800
For another.

555
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,920
But you can't, they're not gonna make you stay,

556
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,320
just you're paying for it.

557
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,160
Yeah.

558
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,480
But will there be bus service?

559
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,320
Well, it's weird, cause it's a whole.

560
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,520
I think so.

561
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,880
I mean, you're wearing clothes.

562
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,520
They give you clothes.

563
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,360
Like Star Wars clothes.

564
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,200
It's a whole narrative thing.

565
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,480
They say like you get in with, it's like a cruise.

566
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,600
You get in with the same group of people

567
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,520
and then you all leave at the same time.

568
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,360
And then they take.

569
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,280
You have to coordinate?

570
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,600
That's what it sounds like.

571
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,440
All guests will, again, cruise ship rules apply.

572
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,280
So all guests will board at the same time.

573
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,720
It's a little claustrophobic.

574
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,120
I assume there has to be a way to get out.

575
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,760
There has to be.

576
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,600
They wouldn't do that to you.

577
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,440
But.

578
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,200
It's not a Logan's Run scenario.

579
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,640
You don't get like electrocuted upon your attempt to exit.

580
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,480
Yes, exactly.

581
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,320
Yeah.

582
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,160
I don't think.

583
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,000
We have a runner.

584
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,520
It's possible.

585
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,760
It's possible you get electrocuted if you leave.

586
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,760
One of my sons got sniped.

587
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,280
Stormtroopers like leave that turkey like at the door.

588
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,120
Sith trooper.

589
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,480
I'm just saying all of that stuff to me sounds

590
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,480
a little bit like you're a little bit too regimented.

591
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,320
And then the experience itself better be.

592
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,160
You're in a war.

593
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,320
You're in a literal.

594
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,160
Yeah.

595
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,880
I think, well, I think it's people will put it

596
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,760
at the start or end of their.

597
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,600
Right.

598
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,480
Disney World stay.

599
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,960
It won't be in lieu of it.

600
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,880
It'll be at the end of their lives when they go insane

601
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,320
and kill their entire family.

602
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,720
But like parents who don't like Star Wars

603
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,240
aren't gonna wanna go back.

604
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,560
Cause like dad at night is just gonna be,

605
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,400
can we go to the beach?

606
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,200
Can I sit on the beach with a drink?

607
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
Well, they said different levels,

608
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,000
different levels of commitment or immersion.

609
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,840
Sure.

610
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,680
So you'll be able to customize that.

611
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,960
Right onto the beach with a beer.

612
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,200
Like again, at a cruise ship,

613
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,640
you pick what restaurant on board.

614
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,680
You want to be your dinner restaurant

615
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,880
or you pick whether you drink or not.

616
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,120
If it was that enterprise hotel,

617
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,720
I think that's a different story.

618
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,720
The Star Trek thing that we're gonna build in Vegas.

619
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,560
Cause the enterprise I think is a much warmer situation,

620
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,920
much warmer place.

621
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,720
And then going on that bridge, that's an iconic bridge.

622
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,960
That's a little bit more fun.

623
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,400
There's a little bit more like recognition there.

624
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,880
So I'm just saying that might be a little bit

625
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,720
of a different story.

626
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,560
But I'm still-

627
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,000
So you wouldn't have wanted to leave the Star Trek bridge.

628
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,840
Well, as a child,

629
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,960
I fantasized about living on the enterprise D.

630
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,800
So no, I would not have wanted to leave.

631
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,400
As long as all these experiences line up to your taste,

632
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,920
which is very Avatar centric.

633
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,720
This Star Cruiser does,

634
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,440
your experience does end with Admiral Hodo

635
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,280
suicide lightspeed into a-

636
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,200
You're yelling at her, what is your plan?

637
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,800
And she's like, yeah, I don't need to tell you.

638
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,560
And then she kills, she kills herself on the ship.

639
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,480
You're the finest actress of your generation.

640
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,080
You're wasted standing behind consoles.

641
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,880
She goes on to blaze of glory.

642
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,000
Yeah.

643
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,040
That was cool.

644
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,880
Sure.

645
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,360
So we'll see, I wanna do it.

646
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,200
Don't get me wrong.

647
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,020
I wanna do it.

648
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,080
I'm just interested to see what happens.

649
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,640
Cause they want, this is expensive and-

650
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,560
Very, they're heading into Westworld territory.

651
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,400
Yeah.

652
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,080
With the costumes.

653
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,760
So yeah, I'm just interested to see what happens.

654
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,960
And those are my two main concerns.

655
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,800
Yeah.

656
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,620
Space madness.

657
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,520
Space madness.

658
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,560
And it's a little bit not fun.

659
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,760
There's gonna be shinings happening every day.

660
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,600
Yes.

661
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,000
Many, many dads going and talking to ghost bartenders,

662
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,160
force ghost bartenders.

663
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,520
Yeah.

664
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,360
I think that's possible.

665
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,240
Paintings on the wall and it'll be nothing but out of time.

666
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,200
Frozen in the painting now.

667
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,400
A hundred insane dads in this tableau.

668
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,880
The Imagineers are actually designing the hotel.

669
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,360
So when you look at furniture,

670
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,160
look away and look back, it's moved slightly.

671
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,440
Little drones unsettlingly in every room,

672
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,640
moving chairs just a little bit.

673
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,040
But for a nod, there is a lot of Minotaur imagery

674
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,880
everywhere.

675
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,680
That they didn't change.

676
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,000
That they're just like, this is for Stanley.

677
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,080
We love Stanley.

678
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,360
An incredible technology to clean up

679
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,360
elevator blood hourly.

680
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,520
Blue elevator blood.

681
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,240
Blue elevator blood.

682
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,640
Just don't stay in room 237 on this cruise ship

683
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,480
is what we're saying.

684
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,640
Just avoid that room.

685
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,920
Okay.

686
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,080
Should we go on to the thing

687
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,920
that we all probably care about the most?

688
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,760
Epcot?

689
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,600
Sure.

690
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,440
Yeah, all right.

691
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,360
You think that's what we all care about the most?

692
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,280
It is.

693
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:52,280
And yet nothing in this block of news super excited me.

694
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:57,280
Except that I love the sort of new, old Epcot aesthetic

695
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,480
that they're playing with.

696
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,040
They're embracing those awesome little emblems

697
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,160
that our logo is based on.

698
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,080
I like the new logo of the park in general.

699
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,240
I like it because it points the way to a Tomorrowland

700
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,920
that just is 80s future.

701
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,040
Because why have we overshot it?

702
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,240
That was the future.

703
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,920
It always was.

704
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,160
And Epcot seems to be embracing it.

705
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,040
Well, so Epcot, someone pointed out online,

706
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,400
it kind of made me sad.

707
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,640
It's like, well, we lost Future World.

708
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,640
So they're dividing Future World into three neighborhoods.

709
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,960
World Nature, World Discovery, World Celebration,

710
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,720
World Showcase stays the same.

711
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,240
And in fact, that's what inspired

712
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,560
these new namings clearly.

713
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,360
Now we were, Jason, you and I were talking yesterday,

714
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,400
this naming device gives me a headache

715
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,960
because World Showcase is because you go

716
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,120
and visit places in the world.

717
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,080
Yes, and World Fair was copyrighted probably.

718
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,160
Sure. They couldn't use it.

719
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,680
But then World Nature is where, it's like, okay,

720
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,920
World Showcase, the theme part is the first word.

721
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,740
Right.

722
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,760
World Nature, the theme park is the,

723
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,600
the theme word is the second word.

724
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,160
So Showcase, what does Showcase have to do

725
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,320
with seeing Germany and Canada?

726
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,160
Right.

727
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,680
It's retroactively made the original name make no sense.

728
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,520
Right.

729
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
You know, right? Yes.

730
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,160
Well, I mean, it's kind of like how it doesn't make sense.

731
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,880
Pixar Pier has a Ferris wheel with a giant Mickey on it.

732
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,720
Sure.

733
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,400
But people like that and they don't want that to change.

734
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,240
Yeah.

735
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,280
So that just stays as is.

736
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,120
It's just like a complication that you just have to deal with.

737
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,160
I think I'd just rather be Discovery World,

738
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,680
Celebration World, Nature World.

739
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,520
Yeah, list, okay, list them again.

740
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,680
World Nature?

741
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,520
Huh? World Nature.

742
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,560
List them again for me.

743
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,720
World Nature.

744
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,560
World Nature.

745
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,400
I'll break it down to World Nature

746
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,440
is the land and the seas.

747
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,280
Right.

748
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,120
Pavilions.

749
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,200
World Discovery is test track mission space

750
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,440
and Guardians of the Galaxy, colon, cosmic rewind.

751
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,040
World Celebration is new.

752
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,280
It's the entryway and spaceship earth

753
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:07,280
and that three tiered park sort of thing.

754
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,320
I like that.

755
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,960
There's a park, yeah, there's a park on top of a building now.

756
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,920
And there's like a beer garden on top of it or something.

757
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,960
Something like that.

758
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,000
I think that's where they'll have a lot of the festival stuff,

759
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,200
but like green space and you'll be able,

760
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,080
it'll give you views of the park.

761
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,680
Yeah, the green space is in World Celebration,

762
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,160
not World Nature, get out of here with your green space.

763
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,000
That does not, that has no place in World Nature.

764
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,720
The content art of the Play Pavilion

765
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,360
has a lot of greenery around the entrance.

766
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,880
I'm for all this greenery

767
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,160
because it's better than beige clay or beige cement.

768
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,040
Now Play sounds like celebrating to me.

769
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,440
Is that in World Celebration?

770
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,800
No, it's in World Discovery, idiot.

771
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,480
Play is discovery.

772
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,280
Get it through your thick skull.

773
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,520
The world thing also just makes everything like,

774
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,760
it doesn't differentiate the two parts anymore.

775
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,600
No.

776
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,200
What it does is it makes it so Future World

777
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,680
does not have to try to outrace the actual impending future.

778
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,240
Right, I get why Future is gone.

779
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,040
I agree with Sky, it's weird that everything

780
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,920
is branded World.

781
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,480
World Celebration, where a big space orb is.

782
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,000
It still is Futuri.

783
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,080
They haven't, it's not like they've lost that.

784
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,480
Well, but yeah, it is Futuri,

785
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,840
they're changing Spaceship Earth, I just read.

786
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,680
Yeah.

787
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,720
Yes, it is no longer about the history of communication,

788
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,360
it's about the history of storytelling.

789
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,600
Does Disney like storytelling?

790
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,000
I say throwing my head against a wall.

791
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,640
Yeah, but they're gonna keep some scenes.

792
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,600
By the way, whatever we're about to goof on,

793
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,720
I'm sure it'll be great.

794
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,560
I'm sure it'll be fine.

795
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,680
It's an original IP ride, at least.

796
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,400
But there might be characters.

797
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,240
Oh, is that what they're saying?

798
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,080
In the storytelling, yeah, there might be some characters

799
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,920
in there.

800
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,920
And the spirit of storytelling will guide you.

801
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,960
There's a great character, the spirit of storytelling.

802
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,800
There's a little.

803
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,640
Who is a light.

804
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,480
Right, right, right, right.

805
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,320
Who you follow.

806
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,160
There's a little light.

807
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,640
I think there's something, there's like some kind of like,

808
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,480
weird like color bat.

809
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,600
There's like a, is the spirit just an abstract light?

810
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,560
I remember seeing some footage that had some like,

811
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,200
more winged creature.

812
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,840
Almost like a little more avatar-y.

813
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,680
I didn't see that.

814
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,640
I could see the spirit of storytelling transformed

815
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,200
just as it transformed throughout the ages.

816
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,320
Ah, good, yes, and took different forms

817
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,280
to inspire different storytellers.

818
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,160
Now, I think the majority of the forms will be like,

819
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,600
when a regional theater, a community theater,

820
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,920
does Peter Pan and puts a kind of rigged up camping lantern

821
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,360
to be Tinker Bell hanging from the ceiling.

822
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,280
A slightly expanding and compressing light.

823
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:39,120
The most technologically advanced Tinker Bell light dot

824
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,400
will guide you through Spaceship Earth now.

825
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,240
So it's.

826
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,960
And Josh Gad is replacing Judi Dench.

827
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,600
So we'll all off be on this ride too.

828
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,400
We're floating on a spaceship.

829
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,920
We're little floaty boys.

830
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,600
It's called, it's called Spaceship Earth still.

831
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,880
Press and roll around the hot dog for a dinner

832
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,160
everyone will enjoy.

833
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,000
Is that the Pillsbury Dole Boy?

834
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,840
Yeah, that's the Pillsbury.

835
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,680
Nothing.

836
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,080
He's also the Pillsbury Dole Boy.

837
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,920
I'm also the Dole Boy.

838
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,400
So, but it's still called,

839
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,640
it's not called Storyship Earth.

840
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,280
No, it's still called Spaceship Earth.

841
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,400
Still called Spaceship Earth.

842
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,480
Yes, it's Spaceship Earth,

843
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,760
which is always about the history of communication.

844
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,280
Space-ship Earth, the communication ride.

845
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,560
Now it's the story ride.

846
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,400
It's very easy.

847
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,240
I mean, I guess, I guess that didn't make any sense either.

848
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,080
It's probably fine.

849
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,880
They're clearly keeping like the,

850
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,520
thank the Phoenicians and like something else.

851
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,960
But is that the storytelling?

852
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,840
You call that scene, thank the Phoenicians.

853
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,000
Thank the Phoenicians.

854
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,840
That's the thing I just say.

855
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,440
They sell a lot of merchandise that says,

856
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,440
thank the Phoenicians.

857
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,280
When I'm relieved.

858
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,120
I'm not kidding.

859
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,960
Really?

860
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,800
Wait, yeah.

861
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,640
That scene where it's like,

862
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,200
if you can read, thank the Phoenician.

863
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,040
That's a phoenician.

864
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,880
That scene.

865
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,720
Oh, okay.

866
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,320
They have started branding that.

867
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,200
Branding that, yeah, merchandising that.

868
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,560
I don't know if the like Steve Jobs garage

869
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,080
will still be there.

870
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,920
You know, that was a newer edition.

871
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,040
Wanna get beat up when you go back to school?

872
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,840
Wear a thank the Phoenicians t-shirt.

873
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,800
I'm looking up, thank the Phoenicians t-shirt.

874
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,680
I wanna find it.

875
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,640
This is crazy.

876
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,320
I see a, okay, so thank the Phoenicians t-shirt.

877
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,120
Oh, it's Phoenicians, not Phoenicians.

878
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,360
No, it's pH, right?

879
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,400
Don't you pronounce that?

880
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,240
Phoenicians?

881
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,080
Phoenicians.

882
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,920
Okay, yeah, okay.

883
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,760
So P-H-E-I'm out of it.

884
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,600
I do not have a spaceship.

885
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,680
Oh, not people of Venice.

886
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,120
Oh, I was confused.

887
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,960
I was confused.

888
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,800
Phoenicians.

889
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,640
I see.

890
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,480
It's where phonetic.

891
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,880
Right, right, I know that.

892
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,120
I thought you meant Venetians.

893
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,280
Do you like phonetic language?

894
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,120
Yeah.

895
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,940
Thank the Phoenicians.

896
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,780
Yeah.

897
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,620
Thank the Phoenicians.

898
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:43,280
I see like a lot of teespring, T-Public things.

899
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,040
Is it official merch?

900
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,720
I think they, I mean, there's definitely unofficial merch,

901
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,120
but I feel like I saw at Disney official merch.

902
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,320
I see like Redbubble, I see Etsy,

903
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,520
but I don't see an official one.

904
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,360
Wow.

905
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,200
All right, well, we'll get to, we'll really.

906
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,040
People have an affection for that.

907
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,880
Can we steal it?

908
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,720
Can we make our own?

909
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,540
Yeah.

910
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,380
Yeah, why not?

911
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,440
Yeah, whatever.

912
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,440
So Michelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel,

913
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,600
that was, is that storytelling?

914
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,440
Probably, yeah.

915
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,920
It counts as both communication and storytelling.

916
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,960
So at a certain point,

917
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,880
it's just gonna switch over though to like, and then.

918
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,880
Some narration changes, probably some projection effects.

919
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,040
And then it'll just be.

920
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,000
Maybe Moana shows up.

921
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,840
That's what I was gonna say,

922
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,800
like is Moana to show up or something?

923
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,440
Cause like, it's gonna be a hard split

924
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,800
between old ass animatronics

925
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,640
that we're talking about communication

926
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,280
versus all of a sudden now we're talking about Disney.

927
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,720
Well, Captain Jack Sparrow's been.

928
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,120
They'll move Captain Jack Sparrow in there

929
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,720
and they'll build robots of, you know,

930
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,120
people who've told stories for Disney,

931
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,800
like the lost guys, like Carlton.

932
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,600
Cruise.

933
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,520
Cruise, there'll be a robot of Carlton Cruise.

934
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,360
Oh, okay.

935
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,480
Is he the legend Jack Kirby?

936
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,480
Yes, yeah.

937
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,640
A person who had never worked for Disney, Jack Kirby,

938
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,360
will be in Spaceship Earth.

939
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,440
Yeah, that was a weird one.

940
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,720
Is it gonna dismay,

941
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,560
are they just gonna project the characters

942
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,200
on the, at the end of the.

943
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,000
The ending is kind of like going back to Earth,

944
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,840
quote unquote.

945
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,280
That is kind of just a room with like,

946
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,480
pink gong ball lights in it.

947
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,720
Which is fun, but I mean like,

948
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,920
is that gonna be the time when,

949
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,440
cause there's the big glorious finale to Spaceship Earth,

950
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,680
which is like both cool and underwhelming.

951
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,520
You know what I'm talking about?

952
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,360
Yeah, it's like.

953
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,720
They pump in cool music to make you,

954
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,640
it's like cool at first,

955
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,400
and then you got like six minutes to go.

956
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,240
Yeah, because.

957
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,060
Winding down.

958
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:33,900
Cause you can see then,

959
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,080
you're finally, you're at the top of the, of the ball,

960
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,720
and you can see how big it is,

961
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,560
and you're inside it,

962
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,840
and it's really cool, and the music's cool,

963
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,640
and there's some cool like lasers,

964
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,560
but then it's like, there's not much going on.

965
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,120
So now is it gonna be like,

966
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,680
Will Smith Genie projected on the inside of the ball,

967
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,520
or something.

968
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,360
Genie.

969
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,800
A montage of all your favorite IP.

970
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,600
That seems like the room that could easily be plused up.

971
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,000
Yeah, I think I read somewhere that that was a big,

972
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,960
yeah, they're gonna really,

973
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,640
that's gonna be a lot different.

974
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,720
It'll be Jon Favreau explaining

975
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,120
why the photorealistic animals.

976
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,800
Just a junket interview.

977
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,640
Right.

978
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,460
For four minutes.

979
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,560
And they can sub out different junkets

980
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,280
with different movies he's remade.

981
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,120
Oh.

982
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,960
So that'll be good.

983
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,120
It can always tribute Favreau's newest realistic film.

984
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,240
Yeah, so that'll be nice.

985
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,360
I love Space Your Birth,

986
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,140
so I'm excited for a little refresh.

987
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,600
Yeah, I'm sad it'll be closed for a while

988
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,080
to get all this stuff in.

989
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,920
Cause I like it.

990
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,760
We'll get to go on it though, right?

991
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,600
We'll go on it.

992
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,440
Before?

993
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,280
I hope so.

994
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,560
Yeah, and we'll get to see that Epcot Forever show.

995
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,400
Epcot Forever, I'm psyched to see that.

996
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,400
That's gonna be a short-lived show,

997
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,400
but it's got all the classic music in it.

998
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,240
Oh, that's cool.

999
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,560
And then they're gonna replace it with.

1000
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,520
And the logos, like projected.

1001
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,120
And that's over the lagoon.

1002
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,960
Over the lagoon.

1003
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,000
I'll wait for this show.

1004
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,480
This is a show I will watch.

1005
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,600
That's like the only show.

1006
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,440
Yeah.

1007
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,280
Yeah.

1008
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,920
We might have a day, when we're in Orlando,

1009
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,720
we might have a day we're at Epcot

1010
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,920
for like 16 hours or something.

1011
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,320
Yeah, I was thinking about our upcoming trip.

1012
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,160
Like, what do I need?

1013
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,680
What are the big new attractions I need to see?

1014
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,120
And Epcot doesn't even really have one,

1015
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,800
but I'm like, but I need to.

1016
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,120
What's, oh, Frozen.

1017
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,960
Frozen.

1018
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,800
Oh, true, I'm not frozen yet.

1019
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,440
Yeah.

1020
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,520
Cause you haven't seen Diagon yet, have you?

1021
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,360
Nope.

1022
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,200
No.

1023
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,360
And I haven't seen Avatar.

1024
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,200
Yeah.

1025
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,200
We both haven't seen Avatar.

1026
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,040
Right, right.

1027
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,880
I'm gonna be kind.

1028
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,680
I feel like it's gonna be a speed run.

1029
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,520
Yeah.

1030
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,360
Yeah, yeah.

1031
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,200
Yeah, we're gonna have to jam a lot.

1032
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,720
I can only stay like six days.

1033
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,440
You guys should stay two weeks.

1034
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,840
I've been many times in the last two years.

1035
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,520
Sorry, we haven't done our homework.

1036
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,360
I'm just saying for your fun.

1037
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,560
I'm not chastising you.

1038
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,400
My stay is dependent on how aggressive

1039
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,640
Dunkin' Donuts is marketing their SIPPEO Win contest.

1040
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,120
Well, let's put that out to the listeners.

1041
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,240
They tell Dunkin' you love this contest

1042
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,080
and you wanna see more of the commercials.

1043
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,760
Keep this contest going.

1044
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,480
Jason's in an ad is what we're talking about.

1045
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,320
Yeah.

1046
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,360
Yay, it's good.

1047
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,360
It's a funny ad.

1048
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,680
Well, what won't be there

1049
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,000
and we'll have to make a return trip just for this

1050
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,400
is to visit the most exciting new area, Dreamers Point.

1051
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,040
Well, overlooking the lagoon where you get to sit

1052
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,360
maybe next to a new statue of Walt

1053
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,320
who is casually sitting and looking.

1054
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,560
Yes, Casual Walt is what he's referring to.

1055
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,000
Casual Walt is really the biggest takeaway

1056
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,040
from the panel.

1057
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,600
It was fun watching a feed of that

1058
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,760
streaming live on YouTube in here

1059
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,440
and with a new Walt statue and somebody going, yeah.

1060
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,720
There was one yeah like that.

1061
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,560
What about me?

1062
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,200
There was one yeah like that for a lot of the announcements.

1063
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,040
Single, yeah.

1064
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,760
One single, but different people.

1065
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,040
Like it struck a chord with one person in the audience.

1066
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,160
It was like, yeah.

1067
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,880
Someone collated all the tweets where someone said

1068
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,960
like they searched the term Walt statue crying

1069
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,000
and just people going new Walt statue, I'm crying.

1070
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,880
And I'm like, oh, I don't know.

1071
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,920
I think he's a lot more complicated of a figure than that.

1072
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,200
I think it was an interesting man who did a lot of good.

1073
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,040
But there was some weird stuff.

1074
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,240
Well, but also regardless of that, it's a statue.

1075
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,080
Yeah, it's a statue.

1076
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,920
Yeah, yeah.

1077
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,760
They bring him back to life.

1078
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,960
You don't have to like relitigate his past sins.

1079
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,160
It's a statue.

1080
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,000
Yeah, yeah.

1081
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,040
It's an odd thing to make you cry.

1082
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,120
I think you're like ready to cry at almost anything

1083
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,960
if you're crying.

1084
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,120
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1085
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,760
These aren't people who are,

1086
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,280
this is their only cry in 10 years.

1087
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,120
Yeah.

1088
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,760
I think I think there's maybe a lot of tears.

1089
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,480
They also, it's a good point.

1090
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,720
They also, it's definitely like,

1091
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,120
it's the most made for a photo op statue they've ever done.

1092
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,440
It's a really Instagramable.

1093
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,440
Cause I assume it looks like you can go sit next to him.

1094
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,640
You can chill with Walt.

1095
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,400
I would assume that is the idea.

1096
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,520
So like they'll, it's like a tribute to him,

1097
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,680
but also like it's going to be great for our Instagram.

1098
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,040
It's going to be great for promoting Epcot.

1099
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,960
People with like used car dealerships,

1100
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,200
they're going to be trying to get the t-shirt logo,

1101
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,600
like get a t-shirt on it, like take a picture,

1102
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,400
take a picture with the logo.

1103
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,400
Walt statues wear the logo for my used boat dealership.

1104
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,320
No, but with this, you can like, you can put a hat on him.

1105
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,160
Good point.

1106
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,000
You can dress him.

1107
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,880
If you have a watch brand you're promoting.

1108
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,360
If you have a knockoff fit bit that you're hogging.

1109
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,040
You can get it on him.

1110
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,480
You can't get his arms, his statue arms

1111
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,080
through this shirt though.

1112
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,160
Well, that's tough.

1113
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,320
Well, you could, anything that zips up from the back.

1114
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,800
Cause then you could put a vest.

1115
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,080
You could put like a vest on him,

1116
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,760
but you could put a vest on the one in California Adventure.

1117
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,600
That's true.

1118
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,840
Should we try to put a vest on him?

1119
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,920
Yeah, no, we've never tried in all our times there.

1120
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,560
We've never tried to put clothes on Walt.

1121
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,480
Cause you can walk right up to that thing.

1122
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,040
It's not like the one in Disneyland.

1123
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,880
Yes.

1124
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,000
That's guarded by an armada of characters.

1125
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,840
Right.

1126
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,480
He's got attack, he's got his attack dog, Pluto

1127
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,000
and his attack chip, monks, Chippendale.

1128
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,680
I'm just saying people are bringing props.

1129
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,520
Maybe.

1130
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,480
People like space mountain people

1131
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,160
or splash mountain for the picture.

1132
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,600
People will bring props.

1133
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,880
You're announcing this is a new like meme area.

1134
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,800
This will be memed.

1135
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,640
Yeah.

1136
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,480
That's interesting.

1137
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,300
I'm calling it now.

1138
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,140
I like it.

1139
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:56,980
Yeah.

1140
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,800
Yeah.

1141
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,640
We're wristbands.

1142
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,480
You could put like, I guess you probably

1143
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,880
can't get under the legs.

1144
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,080
I was going to say leg warmers,

1145
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,280
but you could put like kind of aerobics arm bands on him.

1146
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,120
Yeah.

1147
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,040
What if you give him like a Ninja turtle mask

1148
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,320
and the belt and the weapons.

1149
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,320
We could do that to the California Adventure one too.

1150
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,160
Yeah.

1151
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,000
We should do it.

1152
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,560
We should go to Oogie Boogie's bash,

1153
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,120
get a little drunk and then start putting

1154
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,480
the Ninja turtle outfit onto Walt in the statue.

1155
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,320
The wildest night of Mike's life.

1156
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,160
Yeah.

1157
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,120
This is what I'm talking about.

1158
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,480
This is me being bad.

1159
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,160
Cause it'll be Halloween though.

1160
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,240
Cause it'll be fun.

1161
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,080
Yeah.

1162
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,560
You know, cause Walt's dressed up too.

1163
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,400
Yeah.

1164
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,680
You know who would endorse that idea?

1165
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,520
Oogie Boogie.

1166
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,880
He likes mischiefs.

1167
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,840
He loves chaos.

1168
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,000
He's made of bugs.

1169
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,720
So I'll say this.

1170
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,800
New dress up Walt.

1171
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:50,080
Or do we, I was just going to say this Epcot picture I love.

1172
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,920
Yeah.

1173
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,760
There's some great concept art.

1174
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,600
Very like, yeah.

1175
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,760
The spaceship earth has new colors on it.

1176
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,400
There's a prism of colors.

1177
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,760
There's a lot of sparkles.

1178
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,480
The new fountain looks cool.

1179
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,600
And new olds, the, the, the embracing of that old,

1180
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,480
like updating that new Epcot.

1181
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,120
It's painted in the seventies, early eighties,

1182
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,480
like marketing style.

1183
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,160
Yes.

1184
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,960
Which all that concept art is nuts.

1185
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,880
For sure. Epcot is going to look nice.

1186
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,320
It was a little low on announcements of like crazy new, big,

1187
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,680
like, Oh, a mission space that doesn't hurt you.

1188
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,080
Like they didn't announce that that's still going to be there.

1189
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,920
I guess.

1190
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,960
A lot of word salad, story telling,

1191
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,560
harmonious night time.

1192
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,400
Yeah.

1193
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,160
Like harmonious hurt my head.

1194
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,840
Moana the journey of water,

1195
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:39,440
like a water conservation sort of exhibit with splash pads.

1196
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,560
I think Carly thought I was making fun of her saying,

1197
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,760
are the dancing water by journey into imagination,

1198
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,160
is that one of the most positively reviewed things at Epcot?

1199
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,400
But I was being sincere.

1200
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,240
Cause when I was a kid,

1201
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,040
I would spend hours playing in those like jumping fountains.

1202
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,000
Hours?

1203
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,080
Like over the course of a trip,

1204
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,520
I'd always want to go on journey to imagination and then go

1205
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,200
like, well, can we, are we going back to the hotel soon?

1206
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,640
Can I get a little wet at the dancing fountain?

1207
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,400
Like, and so kids like splashing

1208
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,120
in those a whole Moana themed one with like living water,

1209
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,960
dancing water.

1210
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,200
It's sort of misty.

1211
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,040
And it's kind of misty.

1212
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,440
Yeah. I like that.

1213
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,280
Yeah. Yeah.

1214
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,560
Yeah. I would agree.

1215
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,440
And we're getting a new movie at the land.

1216
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,520
Awesome planet.

1217
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,360
Awesome planet. Right.

1218
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,200
I saw that.

1219
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,320
Not to be confused with new park, epic universe,

1220
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,520
awesome planet and epic universe.

1221
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,960
Totally different things.

1222
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,600
And that's going to be a fun look at our awesome planet.

1223
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,440
Yeah.

1224
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,560
Which I don't know in that space.

1225
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,320
I don't know about the word fun.

1226
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,400
I think those movies need to be as boring as possible.

1227
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,400
Yeah, that's true.

1228
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,240
In the history of symbiosis.

1229
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,280
Well, Canada foreign wide 360 is coming.

1230
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,120
Hell yeah.

1231
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,440
How many Canada movies?

1232
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,440
Wondrous China.

1233
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,280
That one creeps me out.

1234
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,400
Wondrous China.

1235
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,840
I for one welcome our new Chinese overlords.

1236
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,080
This is a good thing to say on the, on public record.

1237
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,920
Sure. Yeah.

1238
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,760
You're matching your bets.

1239
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,320
I think we should take those, all the tariffs away.

1240
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,280
And frankly.

1241
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,520
Wondrous China is followed up by horrible,

1242
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,080
misbehaving Hong Kong.

1243
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,920
Oh yeah.

1244
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,040
You watch a three minute film about how Hong Kong sucks.

1245
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,880
Are they tore down our beloved facial recognition poles?

1246
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,760
That was something.

1247
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,440
The pride of wondrous China.

1248
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,360
They blitz through the castle of magical dreams.

1249
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,600
The new Hong Kong castle and like their frozen land.

1250
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,400
They blitz through Hong Kong.

1251
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,240
I want to hear more.

1252
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,080
On this presentation.

1253
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,360
I want, wait, what's the castle called?

1254
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,080
Castle of magical dreams?

1255
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,880
I believe so.

1256
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,720
Yes.

1257
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,760
The castle of magical dreams,

1258
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,040
themed to 13 different Disney heroines.

1259
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,880
You look cool.

1260
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,720
It does look cool.

1261
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,160
It looks less psychotic than the first concept art

1262
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,400
looked so.

1263
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,560
They should have just made it a cake.

1264
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,640
They should have just made it a cake.

1265
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,520
One of these castles will be a permit cake.

1266
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,600
Should be a cake.

1267
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,720
Yeah. They ripped through that.

1268
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,080
That's someone with a frozen roller coaster too.

1269
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,920
Yes.

1270
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,120
Which looks like a snow white.

1271
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,800
Snow white roller coaster now.

1272
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,560
What's that name?

1273
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,480
Wandering Oaken's sliding sleigh.

1274
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,320
Yes.

1275
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,160
Wonderful.

1276
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,800
What's supposed to be trackless originally?

1277
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,320
They switched to the coaster.

1278
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,160
Interesting.

1279
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,840
Little coasters are,

1280
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,600
they've been pretty successful in that area.

1281
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,800
I didn't get to go on the little crush coaster

1282
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,800
in Disney Studios Paris,

1283
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,200
but that seemed like a lot of fun.

1284
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,040
Yeah.

1285
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,040
Seven dwarfs mine train's great.

1286
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,040
I think it's a good little like, you know,

1287
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,520
D to Z genre.

1288
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,360
Yeah.

1289
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,560
I don't know if you've ever been on any coaster.

1290
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,360
Remy's Ratatouille Adventure.

1291
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,200
Yeah. When is that open?

1292
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,040
Coming next summer.

1293
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:41,880
Next summer.

1294
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,720
2020.

1295
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,400
I am kind of charmed by like,

1296
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,080
they're putting a recreation of Cherry Tree Lane

1297
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,080
from Mary Poppins.

1298
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,920
Yeah, that's great.

1299
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,740
In the British Pavilion.

1300
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:51,580
Total surprise.

1301
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,420
That's probably the one that came out of nowhere.

1302
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,240
That in the England Pavilion in Epcot,

1303
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,240
there'll be a new Mary Poppins attraction.

1304
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,120
Yeah. There was a rumor for a while.

1305
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,000
People were downplaying that rumor.

1306
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,360
I feel like some people were like,

1307
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,120
it's going to be like nothing of a ride,

1308
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,920
but I don't know if that's what this is.

1309
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,880
It's unclear.

1310
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,600
Like it'll be in a show building.

1311
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,800
So probably more than just a carousel.

1312
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,640
Cause that's the rumor.

1313
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,480
That was a rumor.

1314
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,800
It was going to be a little Mary Poppins mini-land,

1315
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,160
but it just have like a carousel.

1316
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,160
So hopefully this is a little bit of a step up from that.

1317
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,880
Hopefully it's that Tony Baxter drawing

1318
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,480
that he made in the 60s or 70s.

1319
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,840
Also, I really liked Emily Blunt in that movie.

1320
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,280
It was Emily Blunt, right?

1321
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,200
Am I fucking that up?

1322
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,040
Yeah.

1323
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:30,860
However, it was Mary Poppins.

1324
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,860
I liked Tick Van Dyke.

1325
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,040
They wheeled that Tick Van Dyke.

1326
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,320
So you want to ride with Emily Blunt and Dick Van Dyke.

1327
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,160
And Dick Van Dyke.

1328
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,000
And that's all.

1329
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
You don't want Julie Andrews and you don't want Lynn.

1330
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,200
I don't think Julie Andrews like already didn't come back

1331
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,040
for the sequel.

1332
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:45,880
I don't know that she would come back for the movie.

1333
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,160
You don't want a portrayal.

1334
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,880
Right, I was just saying like a portrayal.

1335
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,000
I would love Julie Andrews.

1336
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,320
No, I would love Julie Andrews,

1337
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,600
but I feel like she is like,

1338
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,000
I feel like she has kind of been like, I mean,

1339
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,840
Well, she, I think she.

1340
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,880
Her voice is shot.

1341
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,720
Sorry.

1342
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,240
Whoa, the truth is coming out of your ears

1343
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,760
about Julie Andrews.

1344
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,320
No, but like medically,

1345
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,400
like she had an issue with her voice.

1346
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,240
Isn't that right?

1347
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,080
She can't really sing.

1348
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:11,920
Yeah, she had an issue with her voice.

1349
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,320
I'm not saying she's like washed up.

1350
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,160
I'm saying like she has like a condition.

1351
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,680
I didn't mean not knowing the medical issue.

1352
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,960
It sounded like, whoa.

1353
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,080
She cannot sing anymore.

1354
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,480
She's very sad, but the way you said it was very funny,

1355
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,320
especially when you're now,

1356
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,640
you feel like you're on trial for not liking Julie Andrews.

1357
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,200
No, I love Julie Andrews.

1358
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,640
No, I just don't need,

1359
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,680
I don't need Lynn telling me to have a good morning.

1360
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,880
Like, I don't need that.

1361
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,720
I do.

1362
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,000
I'm so fucking sad.

1363
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,320
And the only thing that makes me feel

1364
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,440
is the announcement of a new Walt statue.

1365
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,560
And I maybe won't get out of bed

1366
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,720
unless Lynn tells me to get out of bed.

1367
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,000
So I want the ride to be,

1368
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,240
I start in a bed and then Lynn tells me, get up, get up.

1369
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,060
Good morning.

1370
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,360
Go inspire him, stunner.

1371
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,360
You're a number one stunner today.

1372
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,520
Kiss, kiss.

1373
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,880
Okay, so you want Lynn and Julie Andrews on the ride.

1374
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,200
Yes, let's do, there should be competing.

1375
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,040
Wait.

1376
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:03,880
Lynn and Julie Andrews,

1377
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,040
Jason wants Dick Van Dyke and Emily Blunt.

1378
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,720
I want the opposite of Jason.

1379
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,720
This is like the Civil, Captain America Civil War poster

1380
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,560
with half the Avengers on one side and one the other.

1381
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,040
Two brothers, one wants Lynn and one wants Blunt.

1382
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,960
And I want just Lynn and Dick Van Dyke.

1383
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,920
No Mary Poppins on the ride.

1384
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,760
I don't care for the character.

1385
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,840
Hey, two charming chaps.

1386
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,080
Yeah, and I want them not to be a portrayal.

1387
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,400
I want them to record new stuff

1388
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,320
so it's 93 year old Dick Van Dyke and 40 year old Lynn.

1389
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,240
I mean, in reality, I just want the Admiral.

1390
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,080
I just want.

1391
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:36,920
Oh yeah, hell yeah.

1392
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,760
Yeah, that is in the concept art.

1393
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,000
Really realistic robot.

1394
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,840
Oh yeah, are they gonna do the cannon?

1395
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,680
Are they gonna do the cannon every hour?

1396
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,520
Holy shit.

1397
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,340
Or every 10 minutes?

1398
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,180
I would love the cannon.

1399
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,020
That would be incredible.

1400
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:46,860
That'd be great.

1401
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,080
I mean, I would like an animatronic Ben Wishaw

1402
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,160
like saying, let's go fly a kite.

1403
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,400
Like he was cocking a shotgun in a zombie movie.

1404
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,240
Yeah.

1405
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,640
Cocking a string, tightening it,

1406
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,160
which makes a big loud sound.

1407
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,760
Emily Mortimer also kind of underutilized in that movie.

1408
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,040
Yeah, it doesn't have a lot to do.

1409
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,280
A wonderful actress.

1410
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,600
I never saw the new movie,

1411
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,440
but a couple of people sent me the clip of Lin-Manuel

1412
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,480
singing like, I'm such a lucky guy.

1413
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,720
Look, the song is good.

1414
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,600
It's still, he has a breakdown.

1415
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,120
It's like a British music hall song.

1416
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:20,940
I don't know.

1417
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,240
Mark Shaman writes a new song every hour of the day.

1418
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,080
I want.

1419
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,760
I want Paul.

1420
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,200
I want Ed Wynn to be in the ride.

1421
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,440
Love to laugh sequence.

1422
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,280
That would be great.

1423
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,100
That would be good.

1424
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,600
But will we have the newer version of the character?

1425
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,440
Topsy?

1426
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,840
Meryl Streep's famous character, Topsy.

1427
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,680
Oof.

1428
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,000
I'm unfamiliar.

1429
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,400
From maybe the worst scene in the movie.

1430
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,240
Jason is laughing more than a third.

1431
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,360
This might be the hardest ever to last on the show.

1432
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:56,000
Remembering Meryl Streep's character named Topsy.

1433
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,520
And what scene?

1434
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,880
The song is called Turning Turtle.

1435
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,160
Yeah, it's just like another, they're just trying.

1436
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,000
I see it.

1437
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,840
Can we get a little snippet of it?

1438
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,640
Well, I honestly, I don't remember the tune at all.

1439
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,640
Lucky turtle.

1440
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,800
I don't remember the tune at all.

1441
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,040
It's just, I actually enjoy the movie,

1442
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:18,880
but there's like a lot of,

1443
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,240
there's too many callbacks to things.

1444
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,960
And then this is clearly like turning things upside down,

1445
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,640
which is very similar to being on the ceiling.

1446
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,080
Is Topsy the uncle's widow or something?

1447
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:32,960
It's unclear.

1448
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,840
It's not really, it's kind of.

1449
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,680
Let me play.

1450
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,520
It's a spiritual heir.

1451
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,720
It's kind of like.

1452
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,160
His friend from the crazy house.

1453
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,800
Right, I don't think that's at all referenced,

1454
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,080
but I can't remember.

1455
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,520
It's confusing on the level of the Ghostbusters

1456
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,440
answer the call cameos.

1457
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,680
Yeah, who is, why is there another Dan Aykroyd

1458
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,160
in this world?

1459
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,000
Was there another Bill Murray?

1460
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,920
Only Sigourney Weaver one,

1461
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,720
to me was really satisfying in terms of cameos.

1462
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,920
This is a foreign version of turning turtle.

1463
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,000
Here's the real version.

1464
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,640
What exactly does that mean?

1465
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,120
It means my whole world.

1466
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:07,960
That's Meryl Streep.

1467
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,880
Goes flippity flop like a turtle on its back.

1468
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,880
And I don't know, my up from my down,

1469
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,200
my east from my vest, my topsy from my bottomsy.

1470
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:21,200
If you ring me something broken on a Thursday.

1471
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,760
She's doing the voice of any time a fortune teller

1472
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,480
character shows up on The Simpsons.

1473
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,280
This is going to be based on a song, I think.

1474
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,920
Children's Saturday, Sunday, Monday.

1475
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,600
Does she deserve an Oscar for this?

1476
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,560
Of course, always.

1477
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,280
Do I like it?

1478
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,080
Maybe not.

1479
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,400
Every second Wednesday.

1480
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:47,920
Easy.

1481
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,920
I mean, you get the gist of it.

1482
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,440
I sure do.

1483
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,840
Anyway, so Topsy is on the ride, I think.

1484
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,680
You know what else?

1485
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,240
I really like the girl from that movie

1486
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,720
who played Ben Wishaw's daughter.

1487
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,440
I thought she was good.

1488
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,160
If we're going to bring classic Disney musical numbers

1489
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:10,760
to life, I think they should honor in the parks

1490
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,800
the newest best Disney musical number,

1491
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,200
The Simpsons Squad versus Trump.

1492
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,040
Oh my God.

1493
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,920
You should get out of America.

1494
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,720
If anyone didn't see this.

1495
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,800
Disney?

1496
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,520
Congratulations on your bye.

1497
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,880
We know the history of that, but we can't say it on the air.

1498
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,960
So ask us after.

1499
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,960
Oh, good.

1500
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,960
Oh, no.

1501
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,400
How am I supposed to finish the episode now?

1502
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,000
Just remember, I'll let her know to myself.

1503
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,560
It's the Democratic candidates.

1504
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,400
That's a better Trump than.

1505
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,640
Yeah.

1506
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,040
One last Epcot thing.

1507
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:54,320
Le Creperie de Paris in the France Pavilion from Chef

1508
00:50:54,320 --> 00:51:01,040
Jerome Bocou, son of Paul Bocou, who made Chef Paul,

1509
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,320
the restaurant in the France Pavilion.

1510
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,360
He has passed away.

1511
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,680
He was a famous French chef.

1512
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,280
Yeah, so that's kind of a cute little nod to the history.

1513
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,320
Could I real quick, Cosmic Rewind?

1514
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,240
Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind?

1515
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,040
Which honestly, I hope the name, I think,

1516
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,800
is going to be double meaning name because it's Rewind.

1517
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,840
You start it's a backwards launch, which is fun.

1518
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,120
And the coaster spins.

1519
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,280
But I do think Rewind maybe suggests

1520
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,320
that we're going to get some classic Epcot stuff.

1521
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,680
But you think they would have shown some of it,

1522
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,280
but they didn't.

1523
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,640
So I'm worried.

1524
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,240
I'm worried.

1525
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,120
But also the name suggests to me Rewind means like retro.

1526
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,760
Because they love their cassette tape.

1527
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,400
Yes.

1528
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,720
Rewind is like a cassette tape.

1529
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,760
So it's like a cassette tape, but hopefully also

1530
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,560
is like retro-y and we'll get Figmen in there.

1531
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,440
Also no mention of what happens to Figmen.

1532
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,600
There's a Figmen sized hole in the Epcot presentation.

1533
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,080
Yeah.

1534
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,480
Which means he's going away because they

1535
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,040
didn't want to say anything.

1536
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,600
Wait, what?

1537
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,960
You just think he's going away?

1538
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,320
Well, he's not mentioned in one of the neighborhoods.

1539
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,760
I mean, we're going away from the ride.

1540
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,760
That's what I meant.

1541
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,800
And you'll hear on.

1542
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,560
You think?

1543
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,840
Yeah, because Jenny Nicholson pointed out,

1544
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,440
obviously you'll hear what she has

1545
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,240
to say on the live show on Friday.

1546
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:11,040
But the rumor is like there'll be like a show maybe

1547
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,240
or a video that you'll get to watch,

1548
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,840
but that the journey will be turned into Inside Out.

1549
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,440
Really?

1550
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,120
That's been the rumor for a long time.

1551
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:19,600
OK.

1552
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,680
And I'm worried that they're going

1553
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,760
to move Figmen to something else.

1554
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,080
Yeah, but maybe not.

1555
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,720
I mean, there's a theater right there.

1556
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,960
Yeah, they'll put him in the theater

1557
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,680
and you'll see a little movie with him.

1558
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,160
I guess that at least he'll still be there.

1559
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,360
If there's something of Figmen, then fine.

1560
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,320
Because I don't think anybody's winning with him

1561
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,560
his current iteration.

1562
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,080
No.

1563
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,720
I wouldn't be sad if that went away.

1564
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,520
If he is like.

1565
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,000
No, that's true.

1566
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,640
A playful antagonist for Peter Quill.

1567
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,440
Like if he's like if he was like

1568
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,760
messing with the Guardians in a fun way.

1569
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,280
Sure, that would be good.

1570
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,040
But I don't know if they're going to go that hard.

1571
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:52,800
No, I doubt that.

1572
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,440
My hands don't scan.

1573
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,840
Anything scans with your imagination.

1574
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,800
They haven't.

1575
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,920
That's the one thing they haven't explained

1576
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,920
about Cosmic Rewind.

1577
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,680
What's the hand scan situation?

1578
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,960
Yeah, are they going to need us or this time

1579
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,440
will Rockets hands be able to scan?

1580
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,520
It's a different place.

1581
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,520
Yeah, it's a different place.

1582
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,080
We know his hands don't scan in the Collector's Mansion,

1583
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,040
but in Cosmic Rewind Fortress,

1584
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,280
do his hands scan or don't they scan?

1585
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,120
We don't know.

1586
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:19,960
They haven't announced it yet.

1587
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:20,800
Well, Topsy.

1588
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,720
That's actually where Topsy will show up.

1589
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,600
Topsy's going to be on Cosmic Rewind?

1590
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,600
She's in the Guardians.

1591
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,920
Guardians of the Galaxy has had a very large roster of members.

1592
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:34,920
It's Gamora, Peter Quill, Drax, Star-Lord Groot and Topsy.

1593
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,480
Topsy.

1594
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,240
Topsy.

1595
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,040
Topsy.

1596
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,480
I don't know my Topsy from my bottomsy.

1597
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,360
Oh, Topsy.

1598
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,400
Surprise Topsy hasn't come up yet.

1599
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:45,920
Yeah.

1600
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,440
Yeah.

1601
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,680
I talk about Topsy a lot.

1602
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,000
It's being something that delighted Jason so thoroughly.

1603
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,920
Yeah, I talk about Topsy a lot in my personal life.

1604
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,520
So that's what's surprising.

1605
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,040
Congratulations to Lindsay.

1606
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,040
Yeah.

1607
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,600
She loves a good Topsy reference.

1608
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,880
You just, you ask her.

1609
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,680
Hey, Lindsay.

1610
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,800
There's a space restaurant.

1611
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,640
I mean, we knew about that.

1612
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,120
Oh, yeah.

1613
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,680
That's opening soon.

1614
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,840
Space 220.

1615
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:14,200
220 referring to the amount of miles up it is.

1616
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:14,720
Is that right?

1617
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,840
Above Epcot.

1618
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,360
Above.

1619
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,440
It's like you're going into space.

1620
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:18,960
Oh.

1621
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,480
And then you come back down to Earth on Epcot.

1622
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,040
That's cute.

1623
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,400
In a crazy elevator like the Disney Quest one?

1624
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,440
Oh, I don't know.

1625
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,160
I think something like that.

1626
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,160
I do think they're going to do something like that.

1627
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,760
Then they're testing it out for the Star Wars hotel.

1628
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,280
Like, that's what Jim Hillis said.

1629
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,760
They're testing out the screens and how it looks.

1630
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,160
And the transport ahead of the Star Wars hotel.

1631
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:39,680
OK.

1632
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,520
Restaurant run by the Patina Group.

1633
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,400
Hell yeah.

1634
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,960
Hell yes.

1635
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,400
Yeah, I went, yeah, for Patina.

1636
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,880
We're going to be talking about Patina a lot in the Denta

1637
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,560
and Disney ordeal, that's for sure.

1638
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:55,000
So I'll save my Patina.

1639
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,240
Hey, we didn't talk about the thing

1640
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,520
they said in the Play Pavilion.

1641
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,040
Oh, yeah.

1642
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:01,680
You'll have the chance to help legendary fashion icon Edna

1643
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,400
Mode on her quest to rid the world of uninspired style

1644
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,600
or make a splash competing in a water balloon fight hosted

1645
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,160
by Huey, Dewey, Louie, and Webby.

1646
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,960
You get to visit DuckTales water balloon fight.

1647
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,800
That's the kind of thing that's in play.

1648
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,320
Sure.

1649
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,840
And is it the real water balloons?

1650
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,800
No.

1651
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,200
I bet it's digital magic.

1652
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,440
It has to be digital.

1653
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,320
Do you get to float?

1654
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,360
Maybe you get to do the ultimate float

1655
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,480
near the ceiling experience hosted by Topsy.

1656
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,520
Very possible.

1657
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,000
Topsy could be going in every new direction.

1658
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,480
Could be in Mary Poppins ride.

1659
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,880
Could be in play.

1660
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,680
Could be storytelling.

1661
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,480
She tells a story of not knowing her Topsy from her bottoms.

1662
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,000
Right.

1663
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,280
And then that new Epcot logo, the T in it

1664
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,560
was much more whimsical than the rest of the letters.

1665
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,360
Was that a clue?

1666
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,120
It was upside down.

1667
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,000
Wait a minute.

1668
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,800
Analyze that.

1669
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,360
Who is Topsy?

1670
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,520
That's a T that doesn't know it's Topsy from its bottom.

1671
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,120
I'm going to say, well, I feel compelled

1672
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,360
to say this phrase 12 more times.

1673
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,120
We've barely covered anything yet.

1674
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,160
So you'll get a lot more chances.

1675
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,760
Well, you want to leave Epcot behind.

1676
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:10,880
And we saw art for Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway

1677
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,000
in 2022, at least the version here.

1678
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,280
Which is like in Florida.

1679
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,200
It's inside the Chinese theater recreation.

1680
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,480
Here we'll be in a new building, the El Capitoon.

1681
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,480
Capitoon.

1682
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,600
Very cute.

1683
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,120
I do like that.

1684
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,480
It's got a little marquee, as if it

1685
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,760
was a movie theater in Toontown.

1686
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,480
I think Toontown's getting a little bit of a facelift,

1687
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,640
so it looks nice.

1688
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,320
I hope so.

1689
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,600
Man, just paint it.

1690
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,960
Having been in that Tokyo Toontown, oh my god,

1691
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,960
the difference is so clear.

1692
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,240
We got to catch up.

1693
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,080
Or they'll get it.

1694
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:42,840
Maybe.

1695
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,600
Yeah, maybe they'll do the same thing.

1696
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,240
I saw a picture of the ride, or I saw a little maquette

1697
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,760
of the ride vehicle on the show floor, a picture of it

1698
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,120
from the show floor.

1699
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,480
Looks real cool.

1700
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,000
Little train.

1701
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,520
Big cartoon train.

1702
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,040
Yeah.

1703
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,200
And I think track was right?

1704
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:56,560
Yep.

1705
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,440
Yeah, great.

1706
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,480
Yeah, this feels like it's going to be a sleeper.

1707
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:04,160
It's just going to, without the hype of something

1708
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,280
like Smuggler's Run, it's going to just sneak up and be like,

1709
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,440
man, that is a delightful little ride.

1710
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,560
I think message board rumors for years have said,

1711
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,040
oh, this is going to be amazing.

1712
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,680
People are going to really be blown away by this technology.

1713
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,480
I think this is another one where it's like,

1714
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,200
they just got to get it to work.

1715
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,440
But the technology of it, the screens flipping and switching

1716
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,080
around to different scenes, I think people are going to love it.

1717
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:27,840
That's what it sounds like.

1718
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,880
Oh, with you different technology,

1719
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,280
we didn't talk about in this Star Wars Star Cruiser,

1720
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,640
the you can do lightsaber training.

1721
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,480
Oh, yeah.

1722
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,920
Training like Luke did in A New Hope.

1723
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,320
That's fun.

1724
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,720
3D glasses, probably.

1725
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,920
Maybe.

1726
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,840
Because you got to shoot.

1727
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:47,680
There's a copy.

1728
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,120
There was like a trademark for it.

1729
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:49,440
Right.

1730
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,480
I mean, they've tried.

1731
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,160
They've been trying to do it without it.

1732
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,560
But I would distill some maybe 3D.

1733
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,800
We were acting as if like we've barely gotten through anything.

1734
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,920
But I'm looking at my list is not a lot left.

1735
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:06,160
I mean, I guess we do have to talk about the new island that the cruise

1736
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,960
ship goes to, Elu Thera.

1737
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,560
Well, the Marvel stuff, there's all the.

1738
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,400
Yeah, there's more.

1739
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,440
There's more Disneyland stuff.

1740
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,120
Oh, sure, sure.

1741
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:19,680
Well, but hang on, because I can't unseat Elu Thera and your landing

1742
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,680
point lighthouse point different than Dreamers Point Lighthouse.

1743
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,240
Right.

1744
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,160
But the main headline with this is that this is a new.

1745
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,680
This is Disney's second island.

1746
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:32,640
Yeah, and it will be designed by famed Imagineer Joe Rody.

1747
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,560
Yeah, this is Rody Island.

1748
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:38,760
Rody has been given an island to design.

1749
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,560
And they brought Rody out to just make sure everyone knew that they were not

1750
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,600
going to just destroy the Bahamas.

1751
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,960
Yeah, like they were like, go out there and make people not think

1752
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,520
we're just taking or not just taking over, which they are, I think.

1753
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,640
But he's going to do it with care.

1754
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,680
Successful than when the fire app took over the Bahamas.

1755
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,800
Yeah, he will probably have a better plan in place.

1756
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,000
Yes.

1757
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,400
They this was all before this was after they talked about the new cruise ship,

1758
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,760
which they ended the presentation with all this stuff.

1759
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:16,920
Yes, they ended with Make-A-Wish and cruise ship stuff, which I Carly and I

1760
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,960
were talking and she's like, that was kind of a weird ending.

1761
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:23,520
Right. Do you think it seemed like something got pulled like because

1762
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,920
they usually you want to end on a bang.

1763
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,560
Yeah. And there's already there's been a big musical number in Dick Van Dyke.

1764
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:34,880
And then we're then they're talking about Ellu Thera and that Rapunzel

1765
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:39,760
is on the Disney Wish on the stern on the stern permanently.

1766
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,520
Rapunzel's on the stern.

1767
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,360
Goodbye, everybody.

1768
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,240
Yeah. Validate parking. See you.

1769
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:49,080
It was so odd because I was watching it going and there, you know, we've heard

1770
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:53,320
and I think, yeah, I was saying that there won't be any sort of fun

1771
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,360
Tomorrowland announcement.

1772
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,160
There was a Tomorrowland and figment sized holes.

1773
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:01,160
But I was thinking, oh, man, they've been doing this dry stuff,

1774
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:05,120
which, yeah, this dry stuff for 10 minutes now.

1775
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,400
Got to be a big thing to go out on.

1776
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,760
Yeah. Because like you'd go out with the Avengers ticket or something.

1777
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,600
You'd go out with something where it's like, you know, people like the ride.

1778
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,160
They want a big ride announcement.

1779
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,320
That's what they want.

1780
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,360
Especially if it's Anaheim, even better.

1781
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:22,200
Like our show people you'll hear if anyone who wasn't there,

1782
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,560
you will hear what we go out on for shattering news.

1783
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,560
Yeah. So let me build that up as much.

1784
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,640
I you will not believe it.

1785
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:32,920
You will. You will not believe what Michael did.

1786
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,640
No, no, no, no. Yeah. Yeah. No, you're right.

1787
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,560
Yeah. You will not believe what Michael did.

1788
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,280
Yeah. What a clue.

1789
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,840
What Michael did. Yeah.

1790
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,880
Which Michael? I don't know. I don't know.

1791
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,800
Could be any Michael.

1792
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,120
So you're right. We're on the risk of saying too much.

1793
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,440
So yeah, look, we know we're showmen.

1794
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,400
You go out with a go out with a bang.

1795
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,960
These guys doing I would you would.

1796
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:59,080
It was structured weird, like Epcot should have been at the end.

1797
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:02,760
Or yeah, like you're saying Avengers, that's all the Marvel stuff.

1798
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,520
Sure. They're down the street.

1799
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,680
They're in Anaheim. Right.

1800
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,080
And people like it like, yeah.

1801
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,200
So it's very odd that they did that.

1802
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,640
It does feel like something outpolled.

1803
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:17,240
I'm assuming that in a world where Galaxy's Edge broke records all summer,

1804
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,320
we have a big thing at the end of this presentation.

1805
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:23,240
I do think that chain because that historically happens

1806
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,920
when something in the company isn't performing as well.

1807
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,240
Records of most angry YouTube videos ever made.

1808
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,680
Yes. Seampark topic.

1809
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,000
But Disney, but that's not something that they're after.

1810
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,400
Yeah, they can't monetize that as well. No.

1811
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,720
So, yeah, so it does feel like something got pulled.

1812
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,600
Who knows how last second.

1813
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,400
There's always rumors or word of like, oh, yeah, and then this got pulled

1814
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,080
right at the last second for this and this got pulled.

1815
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:51,240
And there's probably 50 other, probably more, probably like 100 projects

1816
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:55,080
at various parks, and they're deciding what to put in and what to pull out.

1817
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:59,480
People being spotted in the parks, you know, but still move something around.

1818
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,960
I mean, Chaypeck's not great with that teleprompter.

1819
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:05,640
So maybe he had been rehearsing and they were like, he goes, no, no,

1820
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,280
if you change things around, I don't know.

1821
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:12,320
There's an order in my head and I can cut stuff like we can just cut the end,

1822
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,080
but I cannot move something around.

1823
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:19,040
Yeah, the incredible stage presence of Bob Chaypeck.

1824
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:23,240
Yeah, I was I went back to the beginning just to see where he started from.

1825
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,760
Do we have any parks fans here today?

1826
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:32,400
I knew it. Well, and then just so much like because the parks have always been

1827
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,200
about the magic of dreamers and about dreaming up new magic.

1828
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,800
And what makes good dreams?

1829
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:45,920
Excellent storytelling and all of us together.

1830
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,000
Storytellers have always been the ultimate dream tellers

1831
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,440
and imbued each story they tell with magic.

1832
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,960
Don't change course in midstream.

1833
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:57,840
I was impressed.

1834
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,000
We were watching.

1835
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,720
Lindsay was watching some of it with me.

1836
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:05,600
And then Rody comes out and Rody is just like a great public speaker.

1837
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,240
He's great. I'm going to see him.

1838
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,240
The day this comes out.

1839
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,320
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1840
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,080
Speaking at the Getty.

1841
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,400
You're seeing him today. Oh, really?

1842
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,920
Yeah. How fun.

1843
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,040
Yeah, these are the Getty.

1844
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,160
Yeah. So I was like, oh, the contrast here.

1845
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,080
Yeah. So who knows?

1846
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:24,080
Who knows what it was supposed to be or wasn't supposed to be at the end of that presentation?

1847
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:25,280
We can go out with a bang.

1848
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,680
What with Marvel, we're doing the order that they should have done.

1849
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,440
Right. Yeah, I forgot about all of that.

1850
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,720
Well, let's not forget, magic happens.

1851
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,160
The new daytime parade.

1852
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,800
Magic happens celebrating the stories of dreamers.

1853
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,520
Right. Dreamers, wishes.

1854
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,360
I love when they announced the cruise ship.

1855
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,240
They're like, and the new name.

1856
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,920
It's like there's literally seven words you guys use.

1857
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,040
No, there's seven different words.

1858
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:51,680
And it was a wish.

1859
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:52,880
Dream, wish.

1860
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,960
Wonder, please let it be wonder.

1861
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,400
Magic, wonder, wish, dream.

1862
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:01,920
I what I like about that picture, the promo art for the

1863
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:08,160
the parade is that Mickey isn't a very like Tokyo Disney looking robe to me

1864
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,240
because I love the costumes in Tokyo Disney for the characters.

1865
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,360
For some reason, there's there's so much better.

1866
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,840
I don't know why they're more interesting.

1867
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,360
But the art there looks cool.

1868
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,400
I liked his little colorful robe.

1869
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,320
So that's what I'm looking forward to.

1870
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,600
Robe. I'm looking forward to an outfit.

1871
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,920
Or Mickey. Mickey's got new clothes.

1872
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:29,280
But that's not that's not a new thing for me.

1873
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:30,840
I like his clothes.

1874
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,960
You've always been on the record liking his clothes.

1875
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,640
But you like the classic to red shorts, two buttons.

1876
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,160
Can't go wrong with the classic.

1877
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,960
Yeah, no classic look.

1878
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,080
Always in style.

1879
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,640
But Marvel. Yeah, I totally forgot.

1880
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,560
I was like scribbling notes and it's not on my notes stupidly.

1881
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:52,160
But yes, we do know more about although none of it is really different

1882
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,000
than anything we. Yeah.

1883
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,720
Names were clarified.

1884
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,240
Pim's Pim's Test Kitchen.

1885
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:04,280
Pim's Test Kitchen seems to be implying shrunken foods and enlarged foods.

1886
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,680
Right. Pim and Webb are coming to DCA.

1887
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:11,160
The Worldwide Engineering Brigade.

1888
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:15,600
I will say the art look, the full art they reveal looks a little bit more

1889
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:19,600
promising as far as an interesting thing to look at than initially it did.

1890
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,800
Because I am going to hear like you're going to YouTube Space LA.

1891
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:26,160
Yeah, I was goofing on it in the hear me goof on in the live show.

1892
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,680
And I'm still goofing on a little bit.

1893
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:31,440
But like it does, like with the Avengers headquarters with the Quinjen.

1894
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,720
OK, I like that a lot.

1895
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,480
So that is going to be cool.

1896
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:38,680
I was pretty confused by what the Avengers attraction is, but it is.

1897
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:42,720
He took it. I have some speculation on that, and I have not seen anyone else

1898
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,160
with this speculation, too.

1899
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:47,400
So let's go. Well, let's go through the rest of the not as cool stuff.

1900
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,960
Pim's Test Kitchen, a Dr.

1901
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,840
Strange little sanctum show kind of like in the.

1902
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,400
OK, good.

1903
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,240
That that would probably be cool.

1904
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:01,960
The Spider-Man ride an open house at the Worldwide Engineering Brigade.

1905
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,600
Web goes wrong.

1906
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:06,440
The folks, they love it when open houses go wrong.

1907
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:09,840
So I think God, look, my mom is a teacher for a long time.

1908
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:13,280
If there had been any hijinks at her open houses, I would have been horrified.

1909
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:17,800
But in the realm of magic and dreams and storytelling.

1910
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:21,400
Well, that's what you know, to make an open house go right, you need

1911
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:26,080
an itinerary, you need some wristbands and you need a bottle of Chardonnay.

1912
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,800
Am I right, folks?

1913
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,960
I just remember Disney Genie.

1914
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,400
Oh, fuck.

1915
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,120
No, no, hold on.

1916
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,560
We'll go through Marvel.

1917
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:40,080
Disney Genie, real quick, is just I don't care for it

1918
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:43,640
because it's a computer that plans your trip for you and checks for you.

1919
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:47,120
And I can do a better job than you're like, John Henry. Yeah.

1920
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:51,760
I'll show you.

1921
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,840
I'll check faster than that machine ever could.

1922
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,640
Me versus Disney Genie.

1923
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,440
No contest for come on.

1924
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,320
Yeah. All right. Anyway, back to Marvel.

1925
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:03,200
And you can do more celebrity impressions, too. Yeah.

1926
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,480
You got good ones. Yeah.

1927
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,720
You got Jeff Garland, Pillsbury Doughboy.

1928
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,640
Jeff Goldblum, finding out all sorts of facts about the world.

1929
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,440
You could do that, isn't it, Fresh?

1930
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,480
I could, but it's not one of the ones I do. OK.

1931
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:21,480
We're all going to be doing it soon with our new favorite show.

1932
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,440
That's true.

1933
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,520
Friggin Goldblum.

1934
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:25,800
All right. Yeah. We're going to go.

1935
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,520
Blum, that's a friggin random.

1936
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,520
Goldberg, Goldberg, I called him.

1937
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:35,160
Jesus, I was in my mind where he's approaching like the Bill Murray.

1938
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,320
Yes, we're being we're fighting.

1939
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:41,320
Yeah, it's inherently funny to reference him and add nothing.

1940
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,880
Yeah. To the reference.

1941
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,160
Yeah, it's it's that that's this is the Chuck Norris rule.

1942
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,840
You're right. Yes. Say the name.

1943
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,320
And I'm laughing already. Right.

1944
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,880
You're like this guy, real character.

1945
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,640
This cage kind of cross that.

1946
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:54,800
Yeah, that's true.

1947
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,920
Mm hmm. Different flavors.

1948
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,240
But yeah, same deal. Mm hmm.

1949
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,160
What were you saying? You were saying microbrewery.

1950
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:04,320
Well, it was originally plugged as a microbrewery,

1951
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,760
like promote as a microbrewery.

1952
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,080
And now they're going more with test kitchen.

1953
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,240
Yeah, I guess a little more family friendly. Right.

1954
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:15,320
This all sounds like they if especially if he gets evicted,

1955
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,840
this seems like a good place for Dr.

1956
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,720
Nigel Channing to work. Oh, yeah.

1957
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,400
Now as his test experiments shrinking.

1958
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:22,600
Yeah, yeah.

1959
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,800
Shrinking experiments.

1960
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,200
Spider bots, spider bots out of control.

1961
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:29,080
This is the premise of the ride that you have to help him.

1962
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,000
The spider bots start replicating.

1963
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,040
You have to help him gather them like no one gets hurt.

1964
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,000
You get to shoot webs at Dr.

1965
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,280
Octopus, though. Oh, no, no.

1966
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,640
This is what we got to round up his like failed experiments.

1967
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,040
There's robots that roaming around.

1968
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,080
We got to shoot him.

1969
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,480
We'll probably be in mask the whole time.

1970
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,080
Yeah, fine. With the Sony stuff.

1971
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,840
We have to capture Spider Man's sperms.

1972
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:56,480
There's robot sperms, genetic outcasts and.

1973
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,440
Geez. Yep.

1974
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,960
Maybe Spider Man splooged all over the lab.

1975
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,160
It's his friends.

1976
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:06,760
So I'm hoping Ned and MJ like are around.

1977
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,320
They're not going to pay those people.

1978
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:09,720
I guess. Yeah.

1979
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:12,160
I think Zendaya's quote is probably very high.

1980
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,000
He's going to be friend.

1981
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,720
His friend is going to be Bob Chapec or something.

1982
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:16,560
It's going to be just like.

1983
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,920
No, they're not going to get him either.

1984
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,480
Maybe they'll get Favreau.

1985
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:24,480
Maybe. But MCU now, is that a problem?

1986
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,960
Maybe that'll be resolved in like a month.

1987
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:30,320
Oh, you think so? Yeah, it's just a play.

1988
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,840
There's already like a counter offer.

1989
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,360
I read. Oh, I don't know about that.

1990
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,360
Well, I've talked about that off air, too.

1991
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:39,160
Maybe you have insight. Insight.

1992
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,560
Anyway, I don't. I was just clicking around.

1993
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:42,880
All right. Great.

1994
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,800
So we're going to.

1995
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:47,800
WGA and the agents be able to break bread at Pym's Test Kitchen.

1996
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,440
Will that be resolved?

1997
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:53,120
What's your inside information there?

1998
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:56,480
Do you. Well, my information there is that I was a gog when I learned that

1999
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:01,600
someone running for WGA office is the son of Elia Kazan,

2000
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,760
the rat, Elia Kazan, who named names.

2001
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:09,080
So he definitely should have input on a labor union.

2002
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,160
He definitely seems above board.

2003
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,520
Yeah. That family.

2004
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:13,520
Very regular.

2005
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:17,200
Do not have a tight up Elia Kazan in the 50s.

2006
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,280
That's the right I want to do.

2007
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:21,280
That would be great.

2008
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:24,920
Like how like Captain America punching Hitler.

2009
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,240
Yeah.

2010
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,880
So OK, so it's robots, Spider-Man.

2011
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,080
We have to get his robots.

2012
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,520
Whirling in the webs.

2013
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,520
Spider-Man.

2014
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,280
Robots. Why can't we shoot them at his villains?

2015
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,800
Why can't I already a ride?

2016
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,760
But we're not shooting at them in there and they use different villains.

2017
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,800
Give me other villains.

2018
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,840
Yeah, there's a lot more, it seems like.

2019
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:47,960
There's tons.

2020
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:51,120
So no villains on the ride, just spider robots.

2021
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,200
And we don't know that.

2022
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,320
We don't know that.

2023
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,480
We'll see. Maybe there is a villain behind all of it.

2024
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,960
And yeah, who knows?

2025
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,240
Your theory about the Avengers attraction.

2026
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,360
OK, so the Avengers attraction, they announced it.

2027
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:06,480
There's been a lot of rumors for years now that first it was, I believe,

2028
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,640
Captain America, E-Ticket Ride.

2029
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,960
That was originally what I always read was the first thing.

2030
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,000
Then it was Avengers E-Ticket.

2031
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,160
They've supposedly redesigned, designed different concepts

2032
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:20,880
that would be like crazy E-Ticket roller coasters.

2033
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:26,760
They wanted it to be like a teen, teen boy thing, which means, I don't know, fast.

2034
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,280
I guess that's what I've read.

2035
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,400
That means you got to go fast.

2036
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,720
And it's been a big problem.

2037
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:34,160
And obviously, there's no work being done on it right now.

2038
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,520
They're just working on that little land.

2039
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:39,320
So it's been very mysterious as to what this big ride is going to be.

2040
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,560
So I thought it was not going to be announced.

2041
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:43,040
They did announce it.

2042
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,960
It's going to go like they they have the promo art of that

2043
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,720
Avengers area with the Quinjet.

2044
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,680
And then all of a sudden, they the big building appears behind it

2045
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,760
during the presentation.

2046
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:55,320
Like, so they're just going to be building it sort of behind Guardians,

2047
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,280
which is the rumor for forever.

2048
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,440
What's there right now? Nothing. Parking parking. Yeah.

2049
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:03,280
So they'll just build this big building behind it.

2050
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:06,400
And now it's going to be flight to Wakanda.

2051
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:09,160
Essentially, you're going to be on a Quinjet.

2052
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:11,480
But you go to Wakanda. Right. Yeah.

2053
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:14,120
And you know, Black Panther is going to be on the Avengers.

2054
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,720
He's been on the Avengers before.

2055
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:21,240
Rumor I read there is difficulty maybe putting Wakanda in Orlando

2056
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,920
because on one of those single paintings at Islands of Adventure,

2057
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,800
Black Panther is represented on a pillar.

2058
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,360
So he technically exists in Universal.

2059
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,400
Someone just to face it. Cross.

2060
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,640
We'll see. We'll go do that.

2061
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:35,960
We'll go spray paint over it.

2062
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,320
So then we get a Wakanda.

2063
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:42,520
He could be they could put Wakanda in, but Black Panther is not here.

2064
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,440
So you can use like Shuri and Dora Milage.

2065
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,200
Yeah, you can use all the claw.

2066
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,520
You can use them all except Black Panther.

2067
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,640
So anyway, so they showed a picture, which I don't have right here,

2068
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:58,960
of like guests in the cockpit, which is first like honestly,

2069
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:02,640
is a person who's been waiting for an e-ticket Avengers ride.

2070
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:07,240
I rolled my eyes at it because I went, oh, it's like a simulator ride.

2071
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:09,360
This sucks.

2072
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,280
But then they I saw this art they released also.

2073
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,000
And it's this. And I don't know if you saw it.

2074
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,760
I've already shown given Jason my theory via text.

2075
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:20,640
I figured I'd do this to you live, Scott.

2076
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,680
So you didn't get to.

2077
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:26,720
Heroes are all running around and punching and throwing other characters.

2078
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,320
Yeah. So it's a big battle scene.

2079
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,680
And it's just like, OK, this feels like, oh, that'll be like one of the scenes

2080
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:33,840
you'll see when you're like flying around or whatever.

2081
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:37,760
But take a look at these three characters.

2082
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,360
Can you see them from where you're sitting?

2083
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:49,280
Oh, these people, these are people in flying machines with their legs dangling.

2084
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:52,040
OK, jetpack chairs.

2085
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,160
So no one again, I have not seen this.

2086
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,360
I'm sure somebody has speculated about this.

2087
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:01,920
My speculation is if there's a photo of people in the Quinjet and then here

2088
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:06,600
that this could be some sort of ride where maybe you start out in the Quinjet.

2089
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,400
It's simulated for the first part.

2090
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:15,480
Then the bottom drops out, dropping everybody into maybe a circle vision, 3D theater.

2091
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:20,440
This is a guess, obviously, with, you know, you have 3D glasses on or whatever.

2092
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,480
And then you're spinning around maybe in a circle,

2093
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,560
being directed at the action on the 3D screens.

2094
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,520
Are you in rows with people still?

2095
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:30,880
Is it a Soren? I don't know any of that.

2096
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:34,720
But that's I'm just trying to figure out where you would be able to figure

2097
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:39,600
like navigate that scene being in the plane and then being out here in the action.

2098
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:44,080
This looks very thinking about being in a chair like that

2099
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,800
and seeing the kind of intense action you're seeing.

2100
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,920
Yeah, this like that's I see.

2101
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:51,000
That's a screen right. I can get behind.

2102
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,640
Yeah. If you get like a lot of you aren't just in some big car like Star Tours,

2103
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:55,960
because we've seen this many times.

2104
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:00,520
Right. I'm I don't think we're opposed to screen rides, but no, should be innovative.

2105
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:06,040
I mean, if it was like, well, like an war, if you could look in all directions

2106
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,920
and you're surrounded, you're in the middle of a giant superhero fight.

2107
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:12,000
I mean, that would be most I mean, most directions.

2108
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,040
Obviously, there's going to you're going to have to have like a cord and stuff.

2109
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,680
So like they could put something over your head so you can't look up up.

2110
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,040
You think we're maybe in

2111
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:23,160
like a helmet void kind of territory, potentially?

2112
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:24,960
I don't know.

2113
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,360
It's still not a quick way to get those helmets on.

2114
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:32,200
Yeah. And also, like the size of the building to me from this picture

2115
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:35,200
they showed, like the size of it suggests a big ride.

2116
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:38,560
Yeah. So I would they don't need that much space if it's a void thing.

2117
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,720
But if you could imagine a soaring, you could look down.

2118
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:46,080
Yeah. There was stuff and people were maybe a little further apart from you.

2119
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:50,440
I mean, yeah, even even even with a limited range of motion, like

2120
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,360
if you imagine there was a row of people and they were all kind of being

2121
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:56,960
dropped down by a cord and then turned around, like you can still direct

2122
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,800
people's view.

2123
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,880
So it's like it's it's honestly kind of more like the next flight of

2124
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,920
like the next logical step from flight of passage or soaring.

2125
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:09,880
Yeah. And it lets you be feel like a hero who's flying around in a suit,

2126
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:13,320
which is there's there hasn't really been a ride that gives you that sensation

2127
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,680
like your Iron Man or whatever.

2128
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:15,960
Yeah, that's true, too. Yes.

2129
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:19,720
This is also a regular device in comic books, the Quinjet or the Blackbird

2130
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:24,280
or the Batwing blows up and the character is like flying in midair

2131
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,400
or like falling in midair or something.

2132
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:29,960
Yeah. And it does it does sort of solve the problem because I want a lot of robots

2133
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:33,600
on the ride. But you can't really have a bunch of robots

2134
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:38,000
fighting at the level of the Marvel superheroes in the movie.

2135
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,480
So this does solve the problem of putting you in the middle of the action

2136
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,880
and getting to see like a really fluid, insane battle

2137
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,160
that you're taking part in in some way.

2138
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,560
I like your guess.

2139
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:51,560
Thank you for analyzing that photo. I think you're right on.

2140
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:55,800
I mean, I hope. Yeah, because like it'll I would assume they would know

2141
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,800
that just being in a plane with a simulator isn't that interesting.

2142
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,240
Yeah, I would say this steps a bit.

2143
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:04,880
It's like not unlike a rise to the resistance.

2144
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,600
It's like a multi stage.

2145
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,320
Yeah, I mean, I would hope. Yeah.

2146
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,880
And yeah, because I guess if you really think about it, it's like Soren flight

2147
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:14,440
of passage, tower of terror.

2148
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:18,360
Like it's a dry could be a drop right potentially to drop into

2149
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,480
because like that would be awesome.

2150
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,280
Like you're doing we're going to drop because that makes a lot of sense to like,

2151
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,120
OK, you're all recruits. We need help.

2152
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,240
We're going to drop you in the middle of the action.

2153
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,200
The bottom drops out.

2154
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:33,440
You shoot into the battle and then you shoot up and down as stuff happens.

2155
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:37,320
And like, you know, giant man tries to grab you and then lifts you up.

2156
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,520
Like there are the possibilities of that are endless.

2157
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,200
We're kind of in

2158
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:45,080
Harry Potter land a little bit to like the ability to bob up and down.

2159
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,880
Yeah, with like a kooka arm.

2160
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:47,880
I mean, it could be that, too.

2161
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:52,080
It could be maybe like the kooka arm basically is like in the ride

2162
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,760
and pulls you down and flips.

2163
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,640
Who knows? So it could be anything.

2164
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,920
Oh, hey, I'm excited now.

2165
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:00,720
Yeah, it sounds like they will maybe deliver on

2166
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:03,320
what I hope is the promise of this type of ride.

2167
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:07,480
Also interesting that it seems like they I mean, this was probably always the plan

2168
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:10,920
for this Marvel stuff in DCA, but they're kind of

2169
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:14,640
spinning it of like, well, like Galaxy's Edge,

2170
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,920
where the big ride is coming in the second part of it, you know.

2171
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,080
Yeah, they are. And they didn't announce a date for this.

2172
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:24,560
No. What's the date for the first leg of it next year?

2173
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,800
Twenty twenty. Yeah. Oh, so like it is quick.

2174
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:31,960
But I I have a feeling that this will be twenty twenty three.

2175
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:36,200
Yes, that's because Runaway Railway is in 20 is until 2022.

2176
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:41,160
And I can't imagine that like they've already built most of that one.

2177
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:42,800
So they're just cloning it.

2178
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,880
And this is going to be a totally new ride.

2179
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:47,560
I can't imagine this opens before Runaway Railway.

2180
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:51,280
That's a nice piece of a few years of big new attractions in Anaheim.

2181
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:55,400
Sure. Yeah. And the new Tomorrowland and then to 35.

2182
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:00,560
Sure. That is the I mean, I was so hoping I was wrong about that prediction

2183
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,160
and that we would get a big announcement.

2184
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:06,840
But yeah, that feels like that's now another world away.

2185
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:10,840
Yeah. I feel like the cast of Tomorrowland

2186
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:14,960
looking into that future seeing device where they see only disappointment.

2187
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:17,440
Yeah. Just about Tomorrowland.

2188
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,880
Just all this other stuff seems cool.

2189
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,680
As relatable of a reference as Topsy.

2190
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,600
Yes. Same thing. Yeah.

2191
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,200
Topsy. Yeah. Yeah.

2192
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,320
They yeah. And there's.

2193
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:32,160
They yeah, when they say Marvel phase two, also, like

2194
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,880
I was hoping that they would announce like and we're ripping out

2195
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,200
the rest of Hollywoodland to make it.

2196
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,560
Yes. A notable thing about the concept art Hollywood stays.

2197
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:44,600
I mean, for now, and they just built a new marquee for Philhar Magic.

2198
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,440
That's opening soon. That's cool. It looks cool.

2199
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:50,280
It's right next to Ward Wieners.

2200
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,160
And it looks nice. A timeless marquee.

2201
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:55,640
Timeless marquee. And also, like, you can be able to they can change the thing out here.

2202
01:19:55,640 --> 01:20:00,080
So I don't think I don't think they're doing anything to any of that anytime soon.

2203
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:05,560
I think there might be a plus up or redo of the Hollywoodland stuff coming.

2204
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,440
Really? I guess all that rumored some one website

2205
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:13,840
that I'm not going to name was dropping unconfirmed rumors

2206
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:17,280
all weekend, along with breaking official rumors.

2207
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:20,400
And that was a little. Yeah. Confusing.

2208
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:22,680
You can name them.

2209
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,640
We all know what I'm talking about. OK, I got it.

2210
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,720
I got the one. The one. The one.

2211
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,200
Got a controversial one.

2212
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,600
They did know that Ron John surf shop was coming.

2213
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:33,680
Anybody else did.

2214
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:37,280
It's very funny tweet to very funny tweet about like.

2215
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,720
We know we told you about Ron John.

2216
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:44,040
Remember Ron John?

2217
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,240
You support Bob J.

2218
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:48,040
Beck, you support the destruction of Ron John.

2219
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,320
Oh, that. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2220
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,640
What was that? Yeah, there was a lot of it.

2221
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,080
You were if you were applauding Mr.

2222
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:59,120
J. Beck and you are applauding the end of original ideas.

2223
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:03,480
And he lands plane hotel rooms, hotel rooms.

2224
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,440
I feel like Disney has kind of upped the game on their hotel rooms

2225
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:07,880
this in the last few years.

2226
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:10,600
Like, well, yeah, they were in the dumps for a little while.

2227
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:11,920
A little while. Yeah.

2228
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,240
I mean, the deluxe ones were always nice, but they've kind of adjusted to like,

2229
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:19,000
well, people want places to put their luggage out of the way

2230
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,040
and they want a lot of outlets to charge devices.

2231
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,760
Murphy beds are back.

2232
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,400
Hey, I love the return of Murphy bed.

2233
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,240
They only sleep one in Florida. Who knows?

2234
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,360
If you're lucky, if I was so lucky. Yeah.

2235
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,600
Does he remember clapping for Bob J.

2236
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,600
Beck is clapping for all of this?

2237
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,760
An alien and droid list.

2238
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,160
Galaxy's Edge. Not true.

2239
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:43,120
Plane hotel rooms and resort parking fees.

2240
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,880
You are plotting a war criminal, sir.

2241
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,680
What a crazy. Oh, my God.

2242
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:52,520
You could tell, you know, you know, I you know, my life is in a good place

2243
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:56,200
where I was out to dinner with friends talking about this particular

2244
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,640
news site and their recent tweets.

2245
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:02,280
And then I checked my phone and you had texted me something different about this

2246
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:03,840
particular.

2247
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:10,320
I got double news coming at me, but angry, angry

2248
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:12,600
Disney tweeters.

2249
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,400
Yeah. Yeah.

2250
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,320
Anyway, hopefully some tomorrowland news coming soon.

2251
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,320
And the Avengers ride looks great.

2252
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:21,920
Trying to end on a positive. Oh, I see.

2253
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:25,560
Look, I can end on a positive because we look we covered this a little bit earlier,

2254
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:29,360
but I wanted to read just relive my absolute favorite part of the power.

2255
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:35,680
Fifty one panel, which is the the introduction of

2256
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:38,360
target CEO Brian Cornell.

2257
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:44,040
Imagine like the day before they got to see the rock come out in a jungle cruise

2258
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:49,320
boat. They saw Emily Blunt and Julia Louis Dreyfus and Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey.

2259
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:53,280
But the next day you got to see Brian friggin Cornell.

2260
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,960
It right. Right.

2261
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,080
It led not to say nothing of bullseye.

2262
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:02,680
But my my absolute favorite part of this panel was the the introduction of Brian

2263
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:05,000
Cornell and tears. I have it queued up.

2264
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:10,360
And to tell you more, I'd like to welcome the CEO of Target, Brian

2265
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:11,360
Cornell.

2266
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:16,720
The giant Target logo on screen.

2267
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,040
Brian Cornell's walkout music.

2268
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,520
His name is Brian Cornell.

2269
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:30,040
He's the man with the Target plan.

2270
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:34,160
Brian Cornell, every idea he has is a big old bullseye.

2271
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:35,160
Brian Cornell.

2272
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:37,880
He is here.

2273
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,800
Got to tell us all about it.

2274
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:43,920
His blood runs red and white with circles.

2275
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,000
He's Brian Cornell.

2276
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:48,080
I wish they'd allowed me.

2277
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:48,880
We stand. We stand.

2278
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,720
We stand. Brian Cornell.

2279
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,320
I think you could tweet a version of that, Adam.

2280
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,680
Yes, I could sample that.

2281
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:59,240
Maybe I'll record the song later.

2282
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:00,920
I mean, do a song, Brian.

2283
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:04,920
I mean, I didn't invent your walkout music, which is very for that's Johnny's

2284
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,560
theme. Dan and Dan Dan.

2285
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:12,000
Right. Johnny's theme and Brian's theme are the most iconic instrumentals.

2286
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:15,280
But who's to say some lyrics couldn't help out.

2287
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,720
Yeah, I think that is he on Twitter?

2288
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:19,800
We can find out.

2289
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:23,040
Roll out the red and white circle carpet.

2290
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,040
Brian Cornell.

2291
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:30,040
And then you just list that on your resume as you wrote the words to Brian

2292
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,960
Cornell's entrance music.

2293
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,040
Yeah.

2294
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:39,160
If that weren't enough, he's going to show you bullseye Brian Cornell.

2295
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,600
It is also like almost like his SNL sketch music,

2296
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:48,120
like a character who just like a Brian Fellows or something.

2297
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:50,320
He's the massive head wound Harry.

2298
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,880
Right. His jingle for his sketch.

2299
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,040
He's what I'm looking for.

2300
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,040
Yeah.

2301
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:58,360
The game of the sketch beforehand.

2302
01:24:58,360 --> 01:24:59,560
Yeah. Yeah.

2303
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:00,760
Debbie Downer had what?

2304
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:03,360
Yeah. Yeah. It's very much that that spirit.

2305
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:07,080
And the game of Brian Cornell is he's the greatest guy.

2306
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:12,320
He's going to blow our minds, telling us about Instagrammable Disney

2307
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:15,040
moments coming to our local target.

2308
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:19,560
If it's one of the 20 that was chosen, right.

2309
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:20,960
The game 20 out of five.

2310
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,000
The scene Brian Cornell being awesome.

2311
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,240
Hell, yeah. You got it.

2312
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:27,920
Thank you for always having Nature Valley granola bars on sale, Brian.

2313
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:29,280
Yeah, you're making this joke.

2314
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:30,920
But Jason's thinking he is awesome.

2315
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,360
It was a great target.

2316
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:34,280
I look. Target has good clothes.

2317
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:35,640
Target has groceries now.

2318
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:39,000
They have affordable prices, especially if you're buying food in bulk for his

2319
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,200
shoot or some such thing.

2320
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,800
It's true. I think the aesthetics are good.

2321
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:47,680
Great. The best prices on canned goods, dry goods, you know, really good.

2322
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:49,600
My mom is not as good.

2323
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,840
Yeah. My mom loves Target.

2324
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:53,360
It's where you get your soup, cereal, peanut butter.

2325
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:59,080
It's great. Some of them, the recently built ones are like pretty cool looking.

2326
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,480
Some of some there's architecture of Target.

2327
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:02,720
Yeah. Yeah. It is all right.

2328
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:05,880
They redid the Glendale one just recently.

2329
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,560
Mm hmm. It's very interesting.

2330
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:08,960
It's where it's recently redone.

2331
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:09,800
Yeah. Really?

2332
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:10,360
In the last month.

2333
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:11,720
Already very cool.

2334
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,880
The multiple the three story Target.

2335
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:15,440
Yeah. Shopping cart escalators.

2336
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:19,280
I was a little bummed when CVS took over their pharmacies because Target had those

2337
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:23,560
crazy like proprietary bought those crazy upside down bottles

2338
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:26,600
and then they stopped having them.

2339
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:30,080
Oh, I don't know what you're talking about, but that's I'm sorry.

2340
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,920
People will know the bottle upside down bottles.

2341
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:35,200
Who thought of this topsy?

2342
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,240
Wow. I wasn't even.

2343
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,640
Wow. Magic relief is all around us.

2344
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:43,000
I don't know the topsy from the bottomsy.

2345
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:46,960
Well, I think you survived podcast the ride on that note.

2346
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:50,000
Check Twitter for my anthem to my

2347
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:51,560
friend of devotion.

2348
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,160
You got a quick turnaround time on that.

2349
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:56,200
Yeah, I know. Boy, I got to go home and knock that out, I guess.

2350
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,760
Hey, did I?

2351
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,680
Hey, I think I'll I think I'll nail it.

2352
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:02,480
I'll hit the bullseye.

2353
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:05,040
Just like Brian always does.

2354
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:09,360
Yes. And just remember, folks, dreams are wishes you make with storytelling.

2355
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:14,960
Check out our check out the D23 show coming on on Friday.

2356
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:15,640
Thanks, everybody.
