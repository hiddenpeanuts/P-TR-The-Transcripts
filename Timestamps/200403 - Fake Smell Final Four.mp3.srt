1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Smells.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,080
They're all around us, and they're often talked about and debated.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,480
Is the smell of freshly cut grass better than the smell of baked goods?

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,080
Is the smell of a chocolate factory better than the smell of an open sewer?

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,240
Eavesdrop on any water cooler in the country, and these are the words and sentences you'll

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,240
hear.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,200
But we on Podcast the Ride decided to tackle a less talked about, yet equally important

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,920
type of smell.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,600
The fake smell.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,640
The backbone of the olfactory experience in any theme park.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,000
The thing that can make you hungry, make you laugh, or simply make you want to hurl.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,760
Join us today as 16 of the top fake smells in theme park history are pitted against each

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,100
other for ultimate fake smell supremacy.

16
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,520
Which fake smells will dissipate quickly?

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,640
And which fake smells will linger in our sinuses forever?

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,040
It's the fake smell final four on Podcast the Ride.

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:26,680
Ooh, that smell.

20
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,920
It goes a song that no one likes.

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:38,280
But today we will determine which smell in theme park world makes people go ooh the most.

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,720
And which make people go you the most.

23
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,520
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by this for this very important event by Mike Carlson.

24
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,520
Hello.

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,760
I am here.

26
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,760
And Jason Sheridan.

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,840
Hi, I'm here.

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,760
And just to clarify, we're talking fake smells.

29
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
Yes.

30
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,760
Not actual.

31
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Yeah.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,440
This is the fake smell final four, which we felt like was a worthy follow up to last year's

33
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,720
fake rock final four.

34
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,200
We love these things as long as they are fake.

35
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,560
Because by saying fake, which sounds like a dismissive word, we are tributing the people

36
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,900
who worked hard to create these.

37
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,520
We're honoring the fabrication.

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,240
But there's certain smells in theme park world.

39
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,840
I don't think we would quantify as fake smells because they just are the real smell that

40
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,920
exists in that setting.

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,920
They weren't crafted.

42
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,640
Do we have some examples of this?

43
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:44,920
Certain food items like cooking a churro is the churro smell itself.

44
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,840
If there's a fake churro smell, which I do kind of think there are versions of it.

45
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,400
They may be pumping in something to add to what's practically there.

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,560
It's unclear sometimes exactly what is fake and real.

47
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,720
I think a lot of times it's fake.

48
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,320
But yes, if you were actually to go up to the churro or say the popcorn stand, you go

49
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,920
up and you can actually smell popcorn because you're right standing there and that's where

50
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,060
the popcorn is.

51
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,880
That is not in this tournament.

52
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,640
That is just food cooking.

53
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,280
That is the side effect of food cooking.

54
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,280
Don't think that counts.

55
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,920
I think maybe the big one that people are going to point out is not in this tournament

56
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,320
is the smell of the Pirates of the Caribbean water.

57
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,920
Because I believe that also to be not a contrived smell, but just an accidental smell that people

58
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
are fond of.

59
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Oh yeah.

60
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
But I don't think it's calculated.

61
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,480
I don't think at all it's calculated.

62
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,960
Haunan Mansion also is a smell that we all have affection for.

63
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,760
But that's just whatever the building materials.

64
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,500
Yeah, a combination of plastic and age and humanity.

65
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,100
They don't have like a little canister that says old house on it that's blasting in the

66
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,540
smell of old house.

67
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,380
I don't think so, though you never know.

68
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,540
There's a thing.

69
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,660
They're not public with all this stuff either.

70
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,220
So we may be making a big mistake on one of these.

71
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,460
We may be missing out on something.

72
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,580
Somebody is going to be very upset because they're going to say, you know, that thing

73
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,500
you thought is fake, it's real.

74
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,700
Or you're missing out on this thing that's actually fake and you thought it was really

75
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,700
fooled you.

76
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,700
Yeah.

77
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,700
Yes.

78
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:28,900
Maybe more than the previous might require a recount and like a sort of fact session.

79
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,740
We need to fact check these.

80
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,980
So that's really up to you, the listener, if you know more than we do.

81
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:41,980
But I feel pretty confident about these 16 that we narrated to that they are contrived

82
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,860
smells, that they are created smells.

83
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,940
I think there's one that may be snuck in and I think we can allow for a little bit of wiggle

84
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,220
room on that one.

85
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,220
OK, interesting.

86
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,220
I'm not trying to know offhand.

87
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,220
Yeah.

88
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,220
Yeah.

89
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,100
Is there anything else we want to say about the formulation of these before we kind of

90
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,340
unveil the 16?

91
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,820
I think I just want to say in case like you're really you don't still know what we're talking

92
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:11,380
about like at Disney, if you walk down Main Street and you smell something, oftentimes

93
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,380
it's fake.

94
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,380
It's not a real food item.

95
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,380
It's a fake thing.

96
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,500
When you're on a ride, there'll be a blast of something and it'll be a smell that's supposed

97
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,700
to go with what you're seeing.

98
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,740
I just want to fill in in case you don't really don't know what we're talking about.

99
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,740
Smellarize?

100
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,260
Is that the trademark term?

101
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,260
There's technology.

102
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,260
Smellarize?

103
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,260
Smellarize?

104
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,260
Really?

105
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,260
So we smell it.

106
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:38,380
Smellitzers seems to be the mechanism that dispenses the smell in some settings.

107
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:43,340
I'm not sure every smell that is released is released by a smellitzer, but certainly

108
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,340
some of them are.

109
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,020
Can I have a picture of what Universal might use?

110
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,980
That's true because some of these are universal.

111
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,260
So it's not like Disney has the market cornered on fake smells.

112
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,260
So universal factors in.

113
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,460
And you know what?

114
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,900
Actually it has the official name supposedly of one of the things we're going to do, which

115
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,900
I'm realizing now.

116
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,900
Oh really?

117
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,740
So feel free to correct.

118
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,260
This is all a loose process.

119
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,640
We tried to name these things, but some of the names could be incorrect.

120
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,940
There could be better names that we determine as we go.

121
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,940
Right.

122
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,260
So before what I was just trying to sum up is that we've chosen what we believe are the

123
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:21,260
top fake smells that you would run into on Main Street, that you would run into on the

124
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:26,220
top most well-known rides in the country.

125
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,100
Often the most, I think we've also kind of quantified them as the most memorable because

126
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,100
I don't think you would call all these the best, the most pleasant because sometimes

127
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,740
often there's unpleasant smells released.

128
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,060
So these are remarkably unpleasant.

129
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,460
A lot of them are.

130
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,420
There might be some people who think every one of these is unpleasant.

131
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,420
Interesting.

132
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,420
Yeah.

133
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,940
If I get too much of a blast, I have a very sensitive sense of smell and it can really

134
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,440
be irritating.

135
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,060
So people probably are going to wonder how are we judging these?

136
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:03,000
What are the criteria of which we're deciding?

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,380
What are we using in our thought process when we are deciding what is going to be in the

138
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,620
fake smell Final Four and ultimately win the whole tournament?

139
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,980
Yeah, it's obviously extremely official.

140
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:19,260
We have our list of 12 aspirational smell qualities.

141
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,900
Detail them all now and certainly not just make them up.

142
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,160
Mine is all mathematics.

143
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
It's all moneyball.

144
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
That's smart.

145
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
That's smart.

146
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,160
Moneyball.

147
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,160
Moneyball holds up.

148
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,160
You see moneyball lately?

149
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,160
Moneyball holds up.

150
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,060
Yeah.

151
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,060
It was very good.

152
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,100
It's the social network too.

153
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,100
Remember that?

154
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,580
I thought it was like the social network.

155
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,460
Every Bill Simmons, everything on the Bill Simmons network is just, every podcast is

156
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,500
to remind you that moneyball and the social network are good.

157
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,860
I bet because I really like social network and I bet if I went back and rewatched those,

158
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,820
I bet a lot of that still holds up.

159
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,820
Just because, but I also really like David Fincher as a filmmaker.

160
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,820
Sure.

161
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,820
So.

162
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,220
These are not insane opinions.

163
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,380
I'm confused by these podcasts that are like such and such holds up.

164
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,420
And it's like, that's two years ago.

165
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,820
Like Birdman holds, yeah, that was really recent.

166
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,380
Like, are movies supposed to just expire?

167
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,860
After five years.

168
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,220
Or like five months.

169
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,220
Yeah.

170
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,300
A movie from a year ago is still good.

171
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,300
Parasite held up.

172
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,300
I watched it last night.

173
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,300
It held up.

174
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,780
Was that your first viewing?

175
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,460
I never saw it before, but it held up.

176
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,500
It did hold up.

177
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
From its Oscar win.

178
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Yes.

179
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
It was still good after winning.

180
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,500
Yeah.

181
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Good for Parasite.

182
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,220
You weren't up frustrated with all the reading.

183
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,620
No, I was all right with the reading.

184
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,620
Yeah.

185
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,620
It's fine.

186
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,100
It held up.

187
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,820
That was the winner of the Oscars, a lesser competition than the one that we're currently

188
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,820
engaged in.

189
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,820
Yeah, that's, yes.

190
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,500
Obviously that's on the way down.

191
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,500
These fake something final fours are on the way up.

192
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Yeah.

193
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,940
And this one has three hosts, so it's three times better.

194
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,940
Oh yeah.

195
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,940
That's true.

196
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,180
Zero times three is three.

197
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,780
Three non-controversial hosts.

198
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,780
Yeah.

199
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,780
Controversy free.

200
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,340
Well, we'll see though, because also, yeah, if you go back into past tweets and we've

201
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:19,340
like said that we didn't like smells that we champion now or vice versa.

202
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,860
Oh yeah.

203
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,620
Delete your tweets now, boys.

204
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,460
Look for your own name and smell and make sure nothing contradicts what we're about

205
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,460
to do.

206
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,460
Yeah.

207
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,460
What are the criteria?

208
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,940
Does anyone have any in mind?

209
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,540
I mean, look, it's going to have to factor into a lot of different things.

210
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,780
Everything's going to be, you know, you're going to see the matchups.

211
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:43,220
You're going to see what kind of a thing, like what these two, are they, you know, a

212
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,900
ride versus just standing on Main Street.

213
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,900
That's going to factor in.

214
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,100
And obviously you're going to have to adjust based on each lineup.

215
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:56,100
But in general, I'm going to be judging on if I think that isn't an effectively used

216
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:02,820
in the place it's at, if it smells like the real thing or makes it improves on the real

217
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,820
thing in any way.

218
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,700
And I will try to divorce myself from just saying, well, this is on a ride I like.

219
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:15,900
I'm going to try to really just examine it as a piece and then examine the other thing

220
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,900
as a piece.

221
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,020
Oh, like the moment in and of itself.

222
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,860
Yeah.

223
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,820
Although it's hard to totally separate, because it is if it's contributing to an

224
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,420
experience that you're very fond of.

225
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,980
Yes, it's going to be very hard.

226
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,420
There's a couple I already know I'm looking at and it's going to be very hard to just

227
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,660
separate myself from this ride or experience.

228
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,820
Yeah. Yeah.

229
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:44,740
I think I've been reading this book that Joe Rodie was posting about called Places,

230
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,020
Places of the Heart.

231
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:54,540
And it's how it's about how humans experience locations, like especially built

232
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,860
locations, constructed places.

233
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,100
And how much are other senses?

234
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,660
Like how much are senses come into play?

235
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,900
And I do think sense is a very it's a very powerful one.

236
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:14,220
So I think like the the impression it makes some of these I just plain like, like some

237
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,820
of them I will just go on gut.

238
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,300
Like, no, that's great.

239
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,540
Some of these I do not care for.

240
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,740
Yeah. Yeah.

241
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,900
We tried to put ones we don't care for against each other here and there.

242
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,300
Yeah.

243
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,660
But that's just what you're judging it on.

244
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,020
Maybe it's like maybe you almost go the most unpleasant in that regard.

245
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,980
I think creativity has to be taken into account.

246
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,500
I agree with that.

247
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,460
It's like you wouldn't like automatically think to create a smell and incorporate a

248
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,100
smell of this.

249
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,460
Yeah.

250
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,780
You know, if it's just kind of like, well, we put the smell in that should be there.

251
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,820
Can you really reward that?

252
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:55,900
But sometimes maybe it's atmospheric and it's it's crucial and tied into the place.

253
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,260
Yeah.

254
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,180
I mean, any rules we try to make now, they could all go out the window when push comes

255
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,140
to shove, when we have matchups that we just don't know what to do with.

256
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,060
Yeah.

257
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:11,180
And it's funny, we that, you know, we do kind of moneyball the first categories a

258
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:16,460
little bit. We try to make them either like fair fights or like thematically similar.

259
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:21,740
But, you know, I think that what I found with the fake rock final four last year is

260
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,100
the first categories were a little easier than the second.

261
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,540
Yeah.

262
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,900
The second where total mismatches.

263
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,140
I never thought about having to align these two.

264
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:30,380
Right.

265
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,620
Like I could I kind of have in my head all of the first round.

266
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,100
But the second, we're just going to be going off the dome.

267
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,020
It's going to be scary.

268
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,260
We're going to be going to try the waters.

269
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,620
I can already call some chaotic energy real chaos.

270
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,940
Because it's radically we're going to end up with so all over the map.

271
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,660
Yeah, I think by the second round, I also will say if I if my memory serves me correct,

272
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,500
you're in for probably the least funny episode of podcast to write all year, the most

273
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,980
taking seriously episode where we're just sitting going, I don't I don't know what to

274
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,860
choose here.

275
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,620
So if you want jokes, tune out.

276
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:11,940
If you want, if you want a lot of hemming and howling, if you want a lot of just sincere,

277
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,340
God, I can't do that.

278
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,700
I can't I can't do it.

279
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,660
Yeah, there's going to be pauses.

280
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,940
We'll have to leave and go like, you know, climb a mountain and think about the choice

281
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,540
and maybe come back tomorrow.

282
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,420
I don't know if we're going to be seamless for you, the listener, but this might take

283
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:26,940
us a week.

284
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,260
Yeah.

285
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,500
I mean, just listen to doughboys if you want the laughs because they're not happening.

286
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,580
Sorry.

287
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,580
This isn't funny.

288
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,540
This just isn't funny.

289
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,580
Sorry, it's going to be so unfunny.

290
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,220
It's going to be a real bummer.

291
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,300
Listen off book.

292
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,860
Listen to doughboys.

293
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,140
There's a lot of podcasts that have humor in it.

294
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,820
Not this one and a lot of podcasts that tell you that moneyball holds up.

295
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,900
And if you want, if you're looking for that, we've said it once in this episode, right?

296
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,860
Not a bunch of times.

297
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,140
Right.

298
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:59,340
We're here to do what we have to do, which is be very nervous about choices with no

299
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,300
stakes whatsoever.

300
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:03,540
All right.

301
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,900
Nevertheless, I am nervous.

302
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,700
So maybe we dive into the first round and then once you've heard our first 16, we can

303
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,700
talk a little about.

304
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,580
We didn't list off all 16 at once last year, did we?

305
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,380
No, I think we did.

306
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,020
Round by round.

307
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,340
I believe we did it one at a time.

308
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,300
And then we talked about what didn't make it.

309
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,620
Yeah.

310
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:19,860
Yeah.

311
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:26,220
Now, if you go to Twitter, unless you're hearing this at midnight and we haven't gotten up

312
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,700
to post it yet, at some point on true, you could look at the whole thing and follow

313
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,380
along with us.

314
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,980
But if you just want to hear, if you want to be surprised, then sure.

315
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,340
Just be surprised with us.

316
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,100
Yeah.

317
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:37,940
Okay.

318
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,540
Are we ready?

319
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,460
Do we do we sort of like round robin unveiling them?

320
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,140
Yeah, that's good.

321
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,940
You can go first, Scott.

322
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,060
Okay.

323
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,500
All right.

324
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,300
Round one or not round one bracket one.

325
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,580
What do we call the individual bracket one say?

326
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,380
Okay, sure.

327
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:55,780
All right.

328
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,700
Bracket one stage one bracket one.

329
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,220
These are levels, levels of brackets.

330
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,500
How are we going to do this without somebody keeping us on track?

331
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,900
I wish we have no sweet smells of his vapes.

332
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,740
Oh, man.

333
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,580
Joining us.

334
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,340
Oh, wait, the bracket keeper is here.

335
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,260
It's a different character.

336
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,500
The bracket keeper.

337
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,580
Hey there.

338
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,220
Hey.

339
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,460
Where is Bruce?

340
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:19,740
Hey.

341
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,220
Move along.

342
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:23,500
Okay.

343
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:23,980
Joke.

344
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,140
No fucking way.

345
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,300
That's not what this is for.

346
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,540
All right.

347
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,740
No bracket key left.

348
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,780
Bracket keeper left.

349
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,940
Get out of here.

350
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:32,740
All right.

351
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,700
So bracket one.

352
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,700
I almost feel I don't even know if I like the name.

353
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,900
Why don't we just I have the official name of it.

354
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,140
Oh, then let's do it right here.

355
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,260
Wait, then you take it.

356
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,460
Okay.

357
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:51,420
This is the scent officially named if this is a correct photo, the evergreen

358
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:56,660
forest from the ET adventure ride in Orlando only existing now.

359
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,260
Who I like.

360
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,660
And I land on much better name evergreen forest.

361
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,580
I was calling it damp forest.

362
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:01,900
Yeah.

363
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,900
I like damn forest, but this is a little like a kind of a black.

364
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,540
It's called sent air, which is where it comes from.

365
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,420
Supposedly.

366
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,260
This is what somebody posted on a message board saying.

367
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,420
I believe this is what universal users.

368
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:15,940
Supplier.

369
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,260
Yeah.

370
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:16,620
Yeah.

371
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,580
Sent air.

372
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,220
Wow.

373
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,060
Evergreen forest.

374
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,340
I have a number on it too.

375
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,820
Nine five six.

376
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,860
Then there's a code that says SWC 10 40.

377
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,620
We'll rank the individual evergreen forests.

378
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,860
Well, we should all skew.

379
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,780
And at this point, maybe we could call them and see if we could each get

380
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,820
one of these and pump it in.

381
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,100
All right.

382
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:40,700
So services evergreen forest versus African grass from Soren over the world.

383
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,020
Right.

384
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,060
Yeah.

385
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,540
Yeah.

386
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,180
Yes.

387
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,980
From Disney's California version.

388
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:51,740
You're in Africa and you're flying over the elephants and the animals kind of

389
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,620
scary and away from you.

390
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,060
Yeah.

391
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,940
And of course the evergreen forest, I guess it's in the ride too, but it's

392
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,580
primarily the line.

393
00:16:59,580 --> 00:16:59,780
Yeah.

394
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:05,020
I think we would say all of the trees and where you meet to botanicals.

395
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,540
Yeah.

396
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:13,020
Um, now you don't want to skew anything, but it's hard evergreen forest is a strong,

397
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,580
I think it's there's a reason why it's for the first one that we named.

398
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,860
It's definitely one of the like, one of the ones you think of an evergreen

399
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:27,580
favorite fan favorite versus a young upstart, thrilling, thrilling match in

400
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,460
this competition.

401
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:28,780
Yeah.

402
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,220
Grassy, both earthy.

403
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,340
Both pleasant.

404
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:32,980
That's what I felt like a good.

405
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,620
One of the few pleasant brackets.

406
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,340
There is.

407
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,060
I would call a lot of them.

408
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,020
I would call a lot of them.

409
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,980
I would call it.

410
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,300
Yeah.

411
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,140
There's a nuance to the African grass smell.

412
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,700
I feel like that's like kind of a, there's like subtlety to the smell.

413
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,660
Cause you could, and I don't know if it's just my brain screwing with me when I

414
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,620
see the visuals of the dirt and the grass, but it feels like I'm smelling both.

415
00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:00,180
It feels like in my head, again, this is a lot of scent can, I'm sure is deceiving

416
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,580
depending on what visual cues you're getting.

417
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,780
But when I see that and I smell it, I do really think, Oh, I'm smelling dirt and

418
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,340
grass.

419
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,940
It's like cut grass, right?

420
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,900
You're smelling cut like a lawnmower cut grass.

421
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,460
Yeah.

422
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Which it's, you know, and it's clever in that regard.

423
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,340
I think, you know, you're going to see Soren on here a couple of times.

424
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,900
It's probably no surprise.

425
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,260
Right.

426
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,700
I really the ride that most prominently uses multiple fake smells.

427
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:29,340
And I think this is, it is one of the more unique smells that they use.

428
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,740
It's one that you, you know, if you're being kind of dour and grumpy, you might

429
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,540
say, well, they're just blasting in like air freshener and this is not really an

430
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,460
air freshener.

431
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,980
It feels sophisticated when it comes to theme park smells.

432
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,420
Yeah.

433
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,700
It feels like it's maybe the next level of them.

434
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,420
It's very creative and a fun point in the ride.

435
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:47,980
I feel.

436
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,460
Yes.

437
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:54,700
I'm going to jump in here, not with counterpoint, but kind of, um, I have a

438
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:00,180
hand soap from Target that smells just like this at a cost 99 cents.

439
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,740
Oh, so I am knocking points for that.

440
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,100
Okay.

441
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:10,100
Honestly, I was impressed at how the hand soap captured this smell and, and, and

442
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,140
in that your hands then smell like it.

443
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,140
Do you have a name on that?

444
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,700
Did you buy it for that reason?

445
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:14,980
Smartly.

446
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,940
That's a smartly.

447
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,820
Smartly?

448
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,380
That's one of their newer house brands.

449
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,380
What's the name of the brand?

450
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,300
Smartly.

451
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,060
Oh, I thought, I got confused.

452
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,100
It's kind of an up and up level.

453
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,660
They have all these fucking house brands now.

454
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,100
It's so hard to keep.

455
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,580
Do you know the specific smell?

456
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,580
That's what I meant to ask.

457
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,020
Flavor.

458
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,420
What do you call it?

459
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,180
Variety?

460
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:31,900
Or would you call these?

461
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,260
Yeah.

462
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,580
Literally the bottle says smells like a meadow.

463
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,180
Oh, and it smells like dirt.

464
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,700
No, it smells like, like cut grass.

465
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,260
Okay.

466
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,580
Just the cut grass elements.

467
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,220
Just the cut grass.

468
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:42,580
I see.

469
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:42,780
I see.

470
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,780
I'm going to double check.

471
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,260
Okay.

472
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,740
I would like you washing your hands with a dirt soap.

473
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,620
There's like earth and kind of sense.

474
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,460
That doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility.

475
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:52,820
Yeah.

476
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,780
So, I mean, there's a lot of the good things you could say about this.

477
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:01,980
However, I feel this is, I think that African grass is kind of cursed.

478
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:07,780
I think this is kind of, this is when like the top seed and the lowest seed.

479
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,500
Yeah.

480
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,100
And seed appropriate, what with grass and forests.

481
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,700
But what are you going to do?

482
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,820
This is a juggernaut.

483
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:16,700
Yeah.

484
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,300
This is a evergreen.

485
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,340
It's evergreen forest.

486
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,300
It's, I mean, it's got to be.

487
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:20,700
Yeah.

488
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:26,180
I think that unfortunately I wanted to say some nice things, but how do you possibly not pick?

489
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,060
I should probably.

490
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:29,700
Yeah.

491
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:36,540
I, it's just that it's such a, the mood in there, it's such a great line.

492
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,980
It's one of the best lines, cues of all time.

493
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,140
And Botanica is being there.

494
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,820
ET's teacher, in case you're behind.

495
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,580
ET's teacher appears every 10 minutes, maybe.

496
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:56,260
And it's just a perfect presentation of a wise old, Broto-Azojan appearing.

497
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,260
Which is also if you're behind, what is that?

498
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,900
That is the name of ET's alien.

499
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,220
That's the name of the alien race species that alien, the alien is.

500
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:14,100
Uh, the whole package is so fantastic and the smell is such a big part of it.

501
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,020
It's excellent place making.

502
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,820
It's really certain.

503
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,460
It's sort of perfect.

504
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,500
Unfortunately.

505
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:19,860
Yeah.

506
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:24,500
There's just, you're not going to beat standing in that queue, seeing Botanica's

507
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,660
smelling the evergreen forest.

508
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,060
It's just, it's going to be hard to top.

509
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,780
And it's like, I'm just going to say it's taking, it's looking very good for the

510
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,980
tournament is all I'm saying.

511
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,420
Yeah.

512
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:35,780
Yeah.

513
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:35,940
Yeah.

514
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,340
Uh, I don't want to like call it a foregone conclusion because I think there's

515
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,380
some very strong competitors.

516
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:41,780
We'll see.

517
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,820
The, the, it also is one of those things that when you're older, when it's not

518
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,500
either when the ride was gone, when you haven't thought about theme parks in a

519
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,260
little bit and you're starting to connect with people.

520
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,700
I just remembered a lot of conversations with people like, oh, you grew up around

521
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,140
universal or you went to universal a lot.

522
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,420
Oh, ET adventure, right?

523
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,300
Oh, the smell.

524
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,740
Remember the smell in the line?

525
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:00,980
Yeah.

526
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:06,260
Just one of those like slightly deeper cut details that people bring up and

527
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,580
don't think that other people remember.

528
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,180
Do you remember the smell?

529
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,140
Oh my God, the smell.

530
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:11,540
Yeah.

531
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,300
Just such a, uh, it's a, it's a real franchise.

532
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,140
It's like a UCLA Duke.

533
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,980
You know, it's, it's a big one.

534
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,380
Yeah.

535
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:19,540
Yeah.

536
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,020
Probably going to be beat around.

537
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,420
I got a little gassy.

538
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,940
Uh, that was it.

539
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,060
I thought you were getting choked up.

540
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,940
Oh, no, no.

541
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,940
It was probably going to go pretty far.

542
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,900
It's probably going to be around.

543
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,220
Yeah.

544
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,180
Yeah.

545
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,620
You really sounded like you were like announcing the death of a president on the

546
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:47,220
news services today and be held like you just had to, you just got handed the

547
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,020
bulletin tragedy in Dallas.

548
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,420
President Johnson will, uh, the center.

549
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,900
Well, let's, uh, let's keep moving it along.

550
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,420
Then anybody want to, Hey, Mr. Mr.

551
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:00,820
Sweets.

552
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,820
Maybe, uh, no problem.

553
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,420
Um, all right.

554
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:11,220
Uh, we have the chocolate smell from Hershey's chocolate world versus the

555
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:18,900
waffles and vanilla smell outside of, uh, the ice cream shop on main street.

556
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,060
It's probably any, I think they're called different things in the various magic

557
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:27,620
kingdoms, but I think whatever, wherever you are, uh, the whatever, wherever, uh,

558
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,780
sweets are being sold in a main street, whatever the smell being pumped outside

559
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,340
of that place.

560
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:32,580
Yeah.

561
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,420
It's a, it's sort of, it ends up being, I think a catchall for trying to get you

562
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,260
to buy sweets of any kind.

563
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,900
It's a confectioners kind of general.

564
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,140
Yes.

565
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,420
Confectioners smell.

566
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:48,660
And it's the strongest main street smell, I believe my, in my memory, at least

567
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,580
that you have when you walk by, especially the confectionary area, but

568
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,980
they're pumping into other places in the park to make you want sweets.

569
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,460
Yes.

570
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,020
Yeah.

571
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,500
Yeah.

572
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,900
This is the one that I said snuck in because I'm a little conflicted because it is an

573
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:08,580
ice cream shop next to a confectionary where they make the actual product, but this is

574
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,700
so noticeable.

575
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,500
And it's for sure smell itsers are deployed.

576
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,300
This is like where I'm thinking of, and you can see photos of the little kind of a dot

577
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,860
at circles, the way they're being pumped out of.

578
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,300
And that's like an early one.

579
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,260
That's like a one.

580
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:26,340
If you're a little kid, I, I'm sure you don't realize that fake.

581
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,260
You're probably possibly an adult and not realizing or, or if not totally fake, then

582
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,420
exaggerated, uh, you know, supported and.

583
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:34,980
Yeah.

584
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,780
Puffed up.

585
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:41,620
I mean, a lot of, I grew up going to a lot of like, uh, old fashioned ice cream

586
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,260
parlors that still did the soda fountain and the, you know, waffle press and everything.

587
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,820
At the Jersey shore, there was still a lot that you would sit down and you get it in

588
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,100
the glass, you know, dish and all that sort of thing.

589
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,740
And they definitely had a similar smell because they're like churning out so many

590
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,740
just all day long.

591
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,060
Right.

592
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:01,700
Yes.

593
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,380
Not always a contrived smell.

594
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:03,620
Yes.

595
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,700
No, completely real at the time.

596
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,340
Yeah.

597
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:11,460
Um, uh, and then versus, I mean, I think there's multiple places where you're, you're

598
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,900
smelling fake chocolate.

599
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:18,420
And we even talked about the, the tooth some, uh, Emporium at universal studios is a place

600
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:22,100
where you, where you could smell real strong, like piped in chocolate smell.

601
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,500
Yeah.

602
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:29,220
But we went with Hershey's chocolate world, which is the ride that's technically not in

603
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,020
the theme park.

604
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,460
No, it's next to the parking lot.

605
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:37,140
So for a long free ride, Hershey's at one point in time did give tours of the actual

606
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:37,860
factory.

607
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,900
And then as they expand theme park, they built a visitor center called chocolate world.

608
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,900
That is different than chocolate land.

609
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,580
The soon to open land at the entrance to the theme park.

610
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,380
It's kind of a deescalation in naming, but it looks like it's going to be very nice,

611
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,980
but chocolate world.

612
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,740
I mean, I, it's free for one thing.

613
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:05,060
It's got restaurants, got lots of candy, different candy shops inside.

614
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,380
There's tastings and educational stuff, but there is a dark ride in it.

615
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,860
And, uh, now a lot of that dark ride is singing cows.

616
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:20,420
Uh, but it usually used to be mostly simulations of the factory, including large

617
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,540
vats of like chocolate looking goo being stirred.

618
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:28,020
When there was less cartoony stuff in there, the chocolate smell being piped in is almost

619
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,100
the primary interaction.

620
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,660
It's like a, just a realistic recreation of a factory and just glued in my mind, like

621
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:41,700
glued in my sense memory in terms of like stuff lodged in my memory of these.

622
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,540
This one might be the strongest.

623
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:48,580
Would you say, and I have not smelled this particular, I've obviously smelled the

624
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,940
toothsome chocolate.

625
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,020
I've not smelled the Hershey chocolate.

626
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,700
Would you say this is the same smell?

627
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,940
Scott specifically as the M and M world store in Las Vegas?

628
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,500
Uh, huh.

629
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,060
Now I, now is there, is there a fake smell in there in the M and M store?

630
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:05,300
Yeah.

631
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,420
Yes.

632
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:06,900
Okay.

633
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,220
Okay.

634
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,300
So maybe it wasn't on when you were there.

635
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:09,780
I don't know.

636
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,660
Or I just don't.

637
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,700
I was in such a fog trying to get to the movie.

638
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,300
You would know because it's one of the worst smells.

639
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,180
Oh, okay.

640
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,340
Smell smell.

641
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,020
This is very comfort.

642
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,420
Like this is much more like your mom's baby.

643
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:24,660
Right.

644
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:29,460
This smell in the M and M store in Las Vegas, when we were there and did the video,

645
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,780
did the movie, um, was trying to imitate the smell of M and M's.

646
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,740
It smelled like shit.

647
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:42,420
It smelled the whole three store, four stories or whatever up and down every floor smelled like

648
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:48,100
this fake M and M smell, but like maybe mildew had gotten in the scent air or something.

649
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,500
There was something stale about it.

650
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:56,100
It was like stale M and M's that were cooking in the sun where it was wafting through all

651
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,900
four levels, five, whatever it is of the M and M store.

652
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,700
It feels like burnt.

653
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,820
It feels like overcooked.

654
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,980
That would even be too good.

655
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,300
I think like wafting in the sun is more right to me because it like,

656
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,620
you could feel like it would mutate it more, the smell.

657
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:10,580
Okay.

658
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,940
So it's not all right.

659
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,460
That's more, that's more pleasant.

660
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,220
And a little preview, I guess, of your feelings about the M and M

661
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,900
Vegas movie, which I think Jason, I think hopefully you get a chance to.

662
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,940
I'm on my way soon.

663
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,180
Yeah.

664
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,500
Great.

665
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:22,820
Great.

666
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,700
That's, I'll be staying in that neck of the woods and that is on the list.

667
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,060
That's on the list of things to do.

668
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,420
It's got to be.

669
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,380
Yeah.

670
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,260
There's no way it couldn't be.

671
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:36,660
Going to Vegas when it's like the cold time of year or the very mild time of year.

672
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,380
So it's like, yeah, what are the indoor activities to do?

673
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,780
Oh, that's a top.

674
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,340
Oh yeah.

675
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,100
You better get there.

676
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,780
Probably ride the death trap monorail.

677
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,820
I don't know if it's a death trap.

678
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:47,860
The monorail is fine.

679
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,500
Oh, is it?

680
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:48,740
Okay.

681
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,060
Yeah.

682
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,500
The new monorail.

683
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,060
Is it new?

684
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,980
Isn't there, it's a newish one?

685
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,860
I don't know.

686
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,580
There's a monorail.

687
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,260
I've never had a problem with the monorail.

688
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,620
Like 2006.

689
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,620
I just don't think it goes a lot of places.

690
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,740
Maybe I'm thinking of a different thing.

691
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,020
There's a whole side essentially you can't really get to.

692
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,460
I think it's services pretty particular.

693
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,100
It goes from like MGM to the link, right?

694
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,820
Like that's kind of.

695
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,220
Yeah.

696
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:14,020
You can get down to, well, you know where it takes you is the Hilton where the Star Trek thing was.

697
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,900
Oh, interesting.

698
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,740
That's one of the furthest outposts.

699
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:23,540
As a Patreon, we should all get into the link high roller Ferris wheel, but with the open bar.

700
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,500
Oh, the eye.

701
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:24,660
Yeah.

702
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,540
The eye.

703
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,420
Do you know about this?

704
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:30,020
That's that the, well, the, I guess I didn't know what it was called.

705
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:34,020
But you can pay for like an open bar for 45 minutes.

706
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,740
In the Ferris wheel?

707
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,780
In the Ferris wheel.

708
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,100
Whoa.

709
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,700
So you get to just drink an open bar as you go all the way around.

710
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,340
Well, well, well.

711
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,140
Right?

712
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,620
Huh.

713
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:41,860
Yeah.

714
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,260
So.

715
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,620
Do you have a bartender in here?

716
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,020
Yeah.

717
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,900
Oh, yeah.

718
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,220
Whoa.

719
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,300
And it doesn't seem like it's not crazy.

720
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,020
It's obviously more expensive, but it's not crazy.

721
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,260
It's like $30 a person or something.

722
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:52,580
Wow.

723
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,140
Which obviously are you going to just like be chugging?

724
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,660
Just crank through.

725
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,980
But still you get like probably a shot or two and a drink.

726
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:03,060
If everyone had two or three drinks, I mean, that's a short amount of time.

727
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,340
And you go around the thing.

728
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:04,980
It's Vegas.

729
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,860
Which would stress me out.

730
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:10,180
I keep looking up stuff like places to go and everywhere is like specials or like well

731
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,100
drinks, 20 ounce pour.

732
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,140
And I'm like, whoa, I thought this was the fancy restaurant.

733
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,180
Or like.

734
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,660
Shitty.

735
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,140
Vodka.

736
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,740
Slushies two for one.

737
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,740
And I'm like, this is the nice restaurant.

738
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,060
Well, that's the ticket to just be.

739
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,780
I think I would be upset.

740
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,300
Like, yeah, I'm not doing it.

741
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,660
Well, we'll get back.

742
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,700
We'll get back to your Vegas.

743
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,020
We'll see.

744
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,660
Yeah.

745
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,220
Yeah.

746
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:31,700
Do a trip.

747
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,420
Um, so.

748
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,100
Uh, yeah.

749
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,060
Where do we, where do we land here?

750
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,020
I have smelled better chocolate at theme parks, though.

751
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,420
So I won't lump Eminem store in there.

752
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,140
Yeah.

753
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,620
I mean, for me, look, this is no contest.

754
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,540
The vanilla waffle smell is such a fantastic smell.

755
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,860
I associated with Main Street so hard.

756
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:56,580
I like that chocolate stuff, but vanilla and waffle smell is just the perfect smell.

757
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,020
Is it me?

758
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,940
Like I would miss it if it wasn't there.

759
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,860
Main Street is the most iconic part in any theme park, especially Disneyland's.

760
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,620
It's got to be for me.

761
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,300
The vanilla waffle smell.

762
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,020
Sure.

763
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,420
Jason.

764
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,860
Uh, you know, I'm biased on this one.

765
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,500
I, I, it's again, so glued in my mind.

766
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,260
I have to give it to chocolate world.

767
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:18,740
Wow.

768
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,140
Tough.

769
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,340
This is a tough round.

770
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:20,740
Yeah.

771
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:24,660
I, I don't know that this, my choice will come out the victor.

772
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,220
So like Scott, I'm going to let you break the tie.

773
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,380
Yeah.

774
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,020
That's what I felt.

775
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,900
I figured it would land outside.

776
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,180
I figured it would last.

777
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,900
Um, I'm extremely fond of chocolate world and my, uh, trips there.

778
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:40,020
My, my trip there as a kid, uh, but for pure iconic reasons, I think you have to go.

779
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:40,820
Yeah.

780
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,300
Yeah.

781
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,660
Vanilla and waffles.

782
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:48,260
It's clever the way it's kind of hidden the way it's, uh, you know, that it's, it's luring

783
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:53,300
you and it's, it's like, uh, the, you know, kind of quiet creativity from the, from the

784
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,020
imagineers.

785
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:59,060
It feels like a Walt's deployed thing, whether or not it was, it seems very possible.

786
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,100
It could have been, um, yeah, I think you got to go with that.

787
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,260
I am not looking forward to deciding about this second round.

788
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,140
I'll tell you that now.

789
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,860
Evergreen forest versus waffles and vanilla mainstream.

790
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,100
All right.

791
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:12,900
Two icons.

792
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,780
Oh my God.

793
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,420
Uh, okay.

794
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,380
Do you want to introduce, uh, the next one or am I up?

795
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:17,700
Introduce?

796
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,980
I think Europe.

797
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,860
Okay.

798
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,260
Uh, number three bracket.

799
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:34,820
Number three, uh, the orange Grove from horizons versus the orange Grove from Soren over California.

800
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,540
This is orange versus orange.

801
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,140
We're pitting the oranges.

802
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,900
This is a clash of the Titans.

803
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:45,700
Also to correct ourselves from earlier, Soren over California, Soren around the world.

804
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,580
Soren around the world.

805
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,060
What did I say?

806
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,780
Across the world?

807
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,260
Uh, I think over the world.

808
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:50,580
Okay.

809
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,020
No way.

810
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:57,220
So, but this is over California Soren over, over those beautiful California orange groves.

811
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:57,700
Yes.

812
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:03,860
That, that part I think is maybe a Camarillo is what that's portraying, which I always find

813
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,020
funny because Camarillo is a place I spent all the time.

814
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,900
I had a good friend out there.

815
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,980
It was like an hour away from where I grew up.

816
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:14,020
So I ended up in Camarillo a lot and it's just, you know, I've had, I had fun out there,

817
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,820
but a very sleepy place and a very agricultural place.

818
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,220
Yes.

819
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:23,060
Very suburban outlet malls, outlet malls, very suburban and agricultural, like, like

820
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,660
right next to each other.

821
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,060
Yeah.

822
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,460
Yeah.

823
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:30,820
And just really always funny to me when you're in the Soren over California line as they bring

824
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:35,940
back every once in a while and see Palm Springs, Camarillo.

825
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,260
Is so why not just like recita?

826
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:40,500
Yeah.

827
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,300
A lot of fun golf course.

828
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:45,860
Yeah.

829
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,780
I really, I mean, maybe it's just the way I go to Palm Springs, but I really don't associate

830
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,140
it with a golf course.

831
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,060
I think plenty of people would.

832
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:57,540
A lot of tournaments down there and so many of the housing developments are along.

833
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,580
Oh, the housing.

834
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,700
Yeah, that does it.

835
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,020
Yeah.

836
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,740
Oh, and back in the dip in the Bob Hope days.

837
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,300
Sure.

838
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,660
They're down there for, yeah.

839
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:09,060
We could do a Patreon on all of our personal favorite Soren over California routes

840
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,060
of our landmarks in California where we would want to soar over.

841
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:13,700
Oh, wow.

842
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,860
Oh, that's like build a Soren.

843
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,020
Yeah.

844
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,700
You each build our own Soren over California specifically.

845
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,620
That's mine would go to recita because of the American, well, the American Legion that's

846
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,500
gone now.

847
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:24,980
Oh, yeah.

848
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,020
PWG was.

849
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,540
You get to see the vents.

850
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:27,780
Yeah.

851
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,420
You've all been there.

852
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,060
You guys have been there.

853
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,620
To see where all the sweat is released.

854
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,100
Oh, yeah.

855
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,820
In the air.

856
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,100
It's been destroyed though.

857
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,340
Oh, it's that building is down.

858
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,980
Yeah, it was it was bought by somebody.

859
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,540
Oh, wow.

860
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,740
Anyway, we're talking about an indie wrestling venue essentially.

861
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:49,940
So it was so in your version, would it release the smell of 200 sweaty men of big bearded

862
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,380
guys in a small room of wine that's turned?

863
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,260
Yeah.

864
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,780
Yes, honestly, that is that would be the smell here.

865
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,980
That's all the alcohol has turned somehow.

866
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:05,940
Sore over an American Legion hall and you would smell just you just smell like you wanted

867
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,340
to die.

868
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,300
Build a Soren is a good idea.

869
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,540
And you have there are only three smells in total.

870
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,620
Like if we had to build it, do we have to like keep ourselves to three smell?

871
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,300
Like not every scene could have smells.

872
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:26,020
Yeah, that's yeah, we should we should put the limits of Soren that exist on our own

873
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,340
version.

874
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,620
Same amount of scenes.

875
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,180
Yeah.

876
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,300
Yeah, that's that's nice.

877
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:29,940
That's a good idea.

878
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:37,220
So yeah, we got the smell of Camarillo, a famous Camarillo.

879
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,020
Is that where the balloons there to is at the balloon scene?

880
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,300
I think so.

881
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,980
I think that is somewhere else.

882
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:46,020
Well, there's also balloons in Soren over the world.

883
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:51,380
Oh, but I think isn't this where or is that like a winery kind of area?

884
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,180
I don't remember.

885
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,260
Yeah, I think that's more NorCal.

886
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,060
I don't recall.

887
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,540
Anyway, versus Horizons.

888
00:35:59,540 --> 00:35:59,780
Yeah.

889
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,180
This is pretty historic stuff.

890
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:08,740
Was there a ride smell before the Orange Grove and Horizons?

891
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,180
That's a good question.

892
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,980
Yeah, because it's some I was looking at that.

893
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,580
What was the first ride smell?

894
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,660
And I'm not sure.

895
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,540
It might be the oldest one on this list.

896
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,420
I think that's correct.

897
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,220
I think it is.

898
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:25,780
And it's hard to say when they started pumping in vanilla and waffles, but talking on rides.

899
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,020
Yes.

900
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,060
Well, now.

901
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,140
Sorry.

902
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,220
Yeah, that one is that's an opening day.

903
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,700
That's an opening day when Horizons is not opening day.

904
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:33,940
Right.

905
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,740
So that might be it.

906
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,460
The last round.

907
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,980
I'm really distracted by whatever this shush was about.

908
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,620
Well, it was this.

909
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,060
Oh, it was the I almost said.

910
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,260
We didn't want to say what it was.

911
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,100
Oh, I said another seat.

912
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,580
Oh, I thought I was being set up for something.

913
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,300
Shucko was going to come in here.

914
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,180
Jason, I got to spring.

915
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,340
16 more on you.

916
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,580
The smell of Casamico's tequila.

917
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,740
Come on out, Randy.

918
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,300
Quality.

919
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,460
Randy's been in my bathroom for 45 minutes.

920
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,940
Um, so I see what you're saying.

921
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,980
There's maybe an older one left.

922
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,980
But so all right.

923
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,260
What's the what's the context of this in the ride?

924
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:15,700
I went on Horizons, but I don't have it super memorized.

925
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:20,260
This is like one of the future paths like the like or the the world of the future that

926
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,980
you could be in involved.

927
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,300
This is where the giant machines are harvesting.

928
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:27,860
Yeah.

929
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,780
Oranges, correct?

930
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:30,980
Yeah.

931
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,300
OK.

932
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,260
My memory was as hazy, obviously only from video.

933
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:41,220
Now, do I fully remember or do I think I remember going on the ride?

934
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,140
It's been so long.

935
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,100
It definitely did.

936
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:44,980
I mean, I may have.

937
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,980
I think I for sure did.

938
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:51,380
Yeah, I think this is where my memory is starting to fail me because I kind of had to go like,

939
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,220
oh, yeah, yeah, there was oranges.

940
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,780
So there are people for whom if you if you did get to go on this ride alive,

941
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,780
then the oranges are a huge deal.

942
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,660
I think it's one of the things you like about this, right?

943
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,580
No, this is a very important attraction.

944
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,700
And yeah, that was a very, very memorable thing.

945
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,660
But how do you explain for any listeners who don't know?

946
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:15,620
Because there's listeners who have horizons memorized and like you don't take time to

947
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,780
explain horizons, but there might be people who do.

948
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,380
How do you explain horizons in a sentence?

949
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,420
I got it.

950
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:24,820
The thing I've always heard that I think really sums it up best is it's sort of like the next

951
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:34,900
extension of carousel of progress and the original Epcot project of like this is what

952
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,540
this is what mankind can reach.

953
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,580
This is the future.

954
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:42,500
This is a ride of like it's a ride about future possibility.

955
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:47,620
Future possibilities of like if technology were to keep going in a similar direction,

956
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:54,020
this is where we could be and not dissimilar from Spaceship Earth because it's kind of an

957
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:58,820
ever moving like like constant ride vehicles.

958
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,700
Yes.

959
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,380
Yeah, it was an omnimover, right?

960
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:06,900
I mean, it's definitely in the same tradition as the carousel of progress in a way too,

961
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,820
where it's like this is the other part of it.

962
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,260
It's like this is where we came from.

963
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,300
This is where we're going.

964
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,540
You sort of can think of it in that way.

965
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,260
I feel like too.

966
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,100
Didn't I say carousel?

967
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,900
Did you say that?

968
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,380
Yeah.

969
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:17,700
All right.

970
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,500
Well, I'm losing my mind.

971
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,860
That's the thing I've seen pointed at most.

972
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:27,380
Now that might also have been part of its undoing of like carousel of progress boring.

973
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,180
We already have it.

974
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,540
We don't need.

975
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,060
Let's make people sick going to space here instead.

976
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,100
That's got to be one of the worst.

977
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,220
I think that's a competition we could have is like worst trades.

978
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:43,540
We're like from quality of attraction to quality of attraction.

979
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,140
On paper, I get it.

980
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,980
Simulate space flight.

981
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,300
Yeah.

982
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,340
At Disney World.

983
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,180
Using real technology.

984
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,380
Real technology.

985
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,260
I even liked it a couple of times when I wrote it.

986
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,940
As I've gotten older, my brain does not care for it.

987
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,260
Yeah.

988
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:58,740
No, it's unpleasant.

989
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,820
My whole family got off it last time we wrote and we all needed to take a second.

990
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:06,260
Was Horizons in such bad shape that they had to get rid of it?

991
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,340
Is that in hindsight a big mistake?

992
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,700
Is it a maintenance issue?

993
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,020
Yeah.

994
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,420
Was it like really like, did it look like shit?

995
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,220
What was the deal?

996
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:18,980
It might've just been a combination of guest satisfaction and how many people were going on it.

997
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,220
Yeah.

998
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,020
Maintenance.

999
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,500
I wonder.

1000
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:25,220
I think there's a swath of people that is us, and I include myself in this,

1001
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:30,340
that just has nothing but warm glow about that ride and rides like it.

1002
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:30,580
Yeah.

1003
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:36,660
I think it's probably a lot of regular folks who don't go to Disney World all the time who

1004
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,380
would go on some of those Epcot rides and go, boring, didn't like it.

1005
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:43,380
But like a journey, like energy though, totally understand.

1006
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:44,500
Yeah.

1007
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,260
This one though you watch and you go, well wait a minute, did this need to go?

1008
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,340
There's robots, there's cool scenes.

1009
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,860
Couldn't this have been updated or something?

1010
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,340
I don't know.

1011
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,220
That's another episode.

1012
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:53,860
There has to have been a way.

1013
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,740
That's another episode.

1014
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,020
We'll do Horizons.

1015
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:01,300
Honestly, I think if they left Horizons and just re like plussed it up a little,

1016
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:06,980
they would not be having to spend so much money to make a new Epcot,

1017
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,780
which is just the spirit of old Epcot.

1018
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,420
Yeah.

1019
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:15,860
Like the whole premise of this Epcot redo is just like, hey, Epcot will be like it used to be.

1020
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,780
Like Epcot will be good and we fucked up.

1021
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,260
Sorry.

1022
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,260
Yeah.

1023
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:20,580
Yeah.

1024
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,180
But it wasn't one of those that just like, you know, where there's nothing redeemable

1025
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,500
and it has to go like living with the land.

1026
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:31,300
It's not one of those where, you know, it's just not, there's nothing there.

1027
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,060
It is odd though, living with the land.

1028
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:35,540
Scott Fracken.

1029
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,100
Scott Fracken-Garretter.

1030
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,180
Living with the land, I guess.

1031
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,180
He loves to get rid of that land.

1032
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,620
He just loves it.

1033
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,380
I am an enemy of.

1034
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,500
Enemy of Mother Earth.

1035
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,740
Tear it up.

1036
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,580
We're alive now.

1037
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,700
Time to drill.

1038
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:51,940
Yeah.

1039
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,380
That's very funny.

1040
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,140
I guess because.

1041
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:55,860
Clearly.

1042
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,580
Because of the lab.

1043
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,820
Because of the labs, they couldn't get rid of living with the land.

1044
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:04,260
But it does feel like that would have been a quicker thing to go than Horizons with robots.

1045
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,780
Anyway, again, another episode.

1046
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,280
Yeah.

1047
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:07,700
Okay.

1048
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,740
We got to decide between these.

1049
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:12,500
I sense that these orange smells were probably the same.

1050
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,700
I think it's possible.

1051
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,700
Exactly the same.

1052
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:20,900
So that leaves us to, because we'd have to admittedly not just judge specific.

1053
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,460
Right.

1054
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:24,100
The smell itself, because we don't have them in front of us.

1055
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,460
So we do have to think about context here.

1056
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,940
Do context.

1057
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,140
Do you guys know already?

1058
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,260
Because I'm not totally sure I do.

1059
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,380
I'm not sure I do.

1060
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:40,900
I mean, part of it is I am biased of like, it's not coming to me as well from Horizons.

1061
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,300
When I think about these experiences.

1062
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:47,140
But that's also just like, well, how old?

1063
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:50,420
I was the oldest I was when I wrote Horizon.

1064
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,940
Maybe 14.

1065
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,900
Maybe 13.

1066
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,540
So it's just not sticking around with me.

1067
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:01,540
But Soarin', I mean, I guess you see orange grows in both.

1068
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:08,020
But maybe the fact that it's footage versus, you know, illustration or mock-ups.

1069
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,940
Is it a mural back there, potentially?

1070
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,440
Yeah.

1071
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,120
Yeah, I don't want the age bias to factor in.

1072
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:20,600
Because I know this, if we were there in the heyday of Horizons more often, I think we'd

1073
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,840
be like, it's Horizons all the way.

1074
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,960
I definitely did.

1075
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:29,160
And when it comes back, I do the Soarin' Over California still.

1076
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,200
And just, it is an, you get a good waft.

1077
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,400
It just hits you all of a sudden.

1078
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,960
The wave that hits you is very exciting.

1079
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,920
And I associate it with like this probably little move that comes with it.

1080
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,520
And a little bit of wind hits you.

1081
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,520
I think it's an especially exciting moment of that ride.

1082
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,200
Yeah.

1083
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:53,160
And I associate that, you know, that ride was the one thing in the original California

1084
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,040
adventure that worked.

1085
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,000
And this was one of the aspects of it that worked the best.

1086
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:06,120
So to me, when I think of DCA surviving, I think of this orange smell as a big factor.

1087
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,320
Yeah.

1088
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,680
I have to say you've swayed me.

1089
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,400
I was in the fence a little bit, but that's right.

1090
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,120
You have to give it to, because it's really, it's the iconic smell.

1091
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,320
Can smells be iconic?

1092
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,120
The iconic smell of the ride.

1093
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,560
It's the signature smell.

1094
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,760
I think it's what everybody like my mom would have, like, you know, she'd go, oh, the orange

1095
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,080
smell.

1096
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,000
I love when the orange smell happens.

1097
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,720
I think a combination of the music cue there, the orange smell, and the sound cue of the

1098
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:36,920
sprinklers.

1099
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,280
The sprinklers are going off.

1100
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,600
That always sticks with me, too.

1101
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,560
Such a refreshing, how relaxed do you feel?

1102
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,120
Yeah.

1103
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,440
I always say this is the most adult ride.

1104
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,760
It's like a wine tour of a ride.

1105
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,000
Yes.

1106
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:54,040
But tricks, like tricks, this, I think I get more almost is tricked.

1107
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:59,320
The Imagineers talked about in the Imagining story about like, yeah, when we first like

1108
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:05,160
tested it, then you went over the water scenes, people do lift their feet up instinctively.

1109
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:06,200
Right.

1110
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:06,440
Yeah.

1111
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,600
It's so nice.

1112
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:13,160
And I also don't know that it paved the way for some of the other entries on this list.

1113
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,280
There probably aren't as many.

1114
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,280
They probably don't go crazy with the smells as much as they did in the World One without

1115
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,960
this orange one working so well.

1116
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,520
Jason, are you ruling?

1117
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,520
I'm going to go for Soarin'.

1118
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,560
I'm going to go for Soarin' too.

1119
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,520
I think that's unanimous.

1120
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,640
This is a tough one.

1121
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,480
This is no Dis of Horizons.

1122
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,480
I think people might be a little mad about this one.

1123
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:33,720
Yeah.

1124
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,880
But I don't think it's only bias.

1125
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,960
I think it's such a strong moment in California and in theme park history.

1126
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,440
I agree.

1127
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:42,920
I agree.

1128
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,520
Do not drag my ass.

1129
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,120
Mike, do you want to take the next one?

1130
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:48,840
Oh, God.

1131
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,160
Oh, yeah, you don't have to.

1132
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:57,720
It is Skunk Smell from Journey into...

1133
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,480
I didn't write it down.

1134
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,640
It's a Journey into Imagination with Figmen or Journey into Your Imagination.

1135
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,080
They renamed these.

1136
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:05,560
The bad one.

1137
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,840
The Figmen ride, the bad one.

1138
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:12,760
And then Chili Dog from Stitch's Great Escape.

1139
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,320
This is the full unpleasant bracket.

1140
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,320
This is unpleasant versus unpleasant.

1141
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,440
It's just a matter of which one works the best.

1142
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,760
Which unpleasant thing works the best.

1143
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,120
What a terrible category.

1144
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:24,600
It's a really...

1145
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,080
Yeah, I'm not looking forward to this.

1146
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,880
After a very refreshing one where both entries were great.

1147
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,680
Skunk, the part where you get hit with Skunk,

1148
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:36,040
you're already at the point in the ride where you are just so cranky about that ride in the way it is now.

1149
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:39,000
Because the ride used to be great and now it's weird.

1150
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,600
Now there's a toilet on the ceiling.

1151
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,840
That doesn't make any sense.

1152
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:47,480
What does that have to do with imagination, as Tony Baxter said on podcast, the ride?

1153
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,160
Famously.

1154
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:49,720
Famously.

1155
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,280
We all know.

1156
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,200
As you famously said the last time.

1157
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,240
He famously said it.

1158
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,200
He famously said it.

1159
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,280
And then you get hit with that Skunk and it's just like one insult after another.

1160
00:46:59,080 --> 00:46:59,800
And then you get hit.

1161
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:05,400
Then you smell that and it's not full on Skunk, but it's close enough to just make you mad.

1162
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,800
That new way that Figman is.

1163
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,040
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

1164
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,600
Yeah, dream finder.

1165
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,920
That's like a more grating Olaf.

1166
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:23,720
Okay, in defense of this, I have heard people say, oh, my family would always like,

1167
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,320
we would do that all together.

1168
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,600
Everyone could get on it.

1169
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,040
No one was too short or anything.

1170
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,680
That was a thing.

1171
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,720
And Figman is there.

1172
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,560
A lot of people have affection for Figman.

1173
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,240
He's wearing a jacket now.

1174
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,280
He's wearing a jacket.

1175
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,280
Well, he always had a sweater sometimes.

1176
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,440
He has like a track jacket.

1177
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,800
He's got a bunch of outfits.

1178
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,400
Yeah, urban outfitters.

1179
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:48,280
And people have affection for Stitch, but I can't say I've ever heard anyone go like,

1180
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,880
oh, I love Stitch's great escape.

1181
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,640
Even the first once or twice I rode that ride and I was like,

1182
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,280
there's little elements of Alien Encounter.

1183
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,680
I want this to be good.

1184
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:58,920
Yeah.

1185
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:05,720
I don't think I gotta give this one to the skunk because at least my friend Figman is there.

1186
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,400
Well, let me before we make the before we lock anything in,

1187
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,680
I have to admit I never did Stitch's great escape.

1188
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,240
So I never experienced this chili dog.

1189
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,000
I have experienced the skunk and I find it to be terribly unpleasant.

1190
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:19,720
Yeah.

1191
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:26,040
I hear what you're saying, Jason, but and it's hard for me to vote for chili dog,

1192
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,880
but this here's what I'm thinking is maybe creativity.

1193
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,280
It is like thinking of releasing a skunk smell sort of makes sense.

1194
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,800
I feel like that's something that might happen in like a kid book where you smell like a scratch

1195
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,240
and like, oh, skunk you.

1196
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:39,640
Yes.

1197
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,040
Chili dog is pretty original.

1198
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,840
Yeah, it's original to a horrible extent.

1199
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:50,600
Can we explain the context is this is this lesser version of Alien Encounter

1200
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,760
where a lot of sound effects and like, you know, things are being dripped on you

1201
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,840
and it makes you think a scary alien is right in your face.

1202
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,160
Right.

1203
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:01,960
And they redid it in this horrible way where Stitch is released into the room

1204
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,600
and he's drooling on you and slobbering on you and just, you know, being a menace.

1205
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,200
And do you remember the actual moment when this happens?

1206
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,560
I don't remember the moment.

1207
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,400
I think it's at the very end, isn't it?

1208
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:13,960
I think so.

1209
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,280
I don't know.

1210
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,240
Somebody's gonna be mad at us again, but it's something around then.

1211
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,640
I just know that he's like slobbering and then you smell his food.

1212
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:22,440
Okay.

1213
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:23,640
Essentially.

1214
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,320
Do you remember?

1215
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,240
I think it's also let's take some we haven't talked about this audience reaction.

1216
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,840
Do you have any strong memory of what made people like yell more?

1217
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,240
That's the sign with an unpleasant.

1218
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,760
It's a good thing.

1219
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,480
A good question.

1220
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,640
I mean, yeah, that's a good question.

1221
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,480
I did this once and I don't remember much of it.

1222
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:49,640
I vaguely remember this, but I don't remember audience reaction.

1223
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,960
I remember my reaction to skunk.

1224
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,800
That's really the only reaction of the two.

1225
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,120
And I'm always displeased with skunk.

1226
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,240
Yeah, I think maybe we shouldn't spend too much more time on this

1227
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,120
because there's no way it makes it past the next round.

1228
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,920
Yes, it's going to go away.

1229
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,640
Go with our.

1230
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,400
I just go with chili dog because it's less offensive to me.

1231
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,160
Oh, oh, I get that's why I thought you were heading to skunk.

1232
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,520
Now I feel like I got to decide.

1233
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,640
You are going to have to decide again because I'm going chili because I skunk.

1234
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,760
I'm just I'm just upset.

1235
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,160
I understand Figman is there, but he's like different.

1236
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:30,120
I like his little track jacket, but I just by the end, it's just so I just I'm so displeased

1237
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:30,680
and I can't.

1238
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,280
Unfortunately, I guess I was saying I don't want to bring in some sort of personal bias

1239
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,440
and nostalgia, but unfortunately I am.

1240
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,440
I can't separate it in this instance.

1241
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,640
So the chili dog happens like in the middle of the ride.

1242
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,240
He eats a chili dog and burps.

1243
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:49,320
Stitch devours a chili cheese dog and burps accompanied by a foul smell effect being released

1244
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,680
into the chamber and destroys a cell phone.

1245
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:57,720
And I understand it's not fair because Alien Encounter was a better ride, too.

1246
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:01,960
But as we know from this podcast, I was too scared to go on that.

1247
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,120
Yeah, so my affection for it is lower.

1248
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,720
Unfortunately, again, I can't I can't pull personal bias out of it.

1249
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,200
It almost feels like less of sacrilege.

1250
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,560
That's what I'm getting at.

1251
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:17,560
Only a little, but like to take this like really sweet, shirming dark ride and put skunk smell

1252
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,280
all over it.

1253
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,960
You know what? I have that creativity point.

1254
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,400
I'm breaking the tie.

1255
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,200
Chili dog.

1256
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:22,600
Wow.

1257
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,100
Yeah.

1258
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:28,120
Now, get ready to fucking eat shit chili dog next time around.

1259
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,080
But you're done.

1260
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,160
I will let it pass.

1261
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:37,960
I can't believe we created a scenario where we had to vote for the stitch chili dog over

1262
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,600
anything else.

1263
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,840
I would like to say I think we didn't explain the rules that we would have to

1264
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,000
if we didn't unanimously vote what we'd have to have to see out of a tiebreaker.

1265
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:51,880
But I will say, Jason, if you feel very strongly, I would like to give or any of us,

1266
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,680
give us the opportunity to stand and filibuster a bit to try to change the other people's

1267
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,000
opinion.

1268
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,040
I think we should keep moving.

1269
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,800
I appreciate it.

1270
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:01,480
All right.

1271
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:01,800
Great.

1272
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,440
Yeah, I know.

1273
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,480
We're going to appreciate it.

1274
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,600
This one is maybe the most pleasant.

1275
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,320
Yeah, good.

1276
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:07,480
Perfect.

1277
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,840
One of the more pleasant ones.

1278
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:10,600
You want to do it?

1279
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:10,920
Yeah, you.

1280
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,240
Yeah, this is I don't quite.

1281
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:20,520
We were calling it the Pandora Forest smell from Flight of Passage.

1282
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:24,680
Also, it's also the tropical island smell from Soarin' Around the World.

1283
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,080
We made the decision we're going to call that the same thing.

1284
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,440
I do think it's the same thing.

1285
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:33,720
And there's a fragrance or a candle that somebody's making that do lump them together.

1286
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,600
Yeah.

1287
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:38,920
And then the Taj Mahal floral smell from Soarin' Around the World.

1288
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,880
Yeah, we're debating.

1289
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:40,760
Is it more rose?

1290
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,960
Is it more jasmine?

1291
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,840
I feel like things are calling it rose, but it's hard to say.

1292
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,480
It's a pretty unique one.

1293
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,160
That's a really nice moment in the new Soarin'.

1294
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:51,400
Yes.

1295
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,000
That music is great.

1296
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,360
It's like sitar-y.

1297
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:56,920
Yeah.

1298
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:57,400
It's really cool.

1299
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:57,960
That point.

1300
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,960
Soarin' coming out strong in this tournament.

1301
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,160
I think it was a guarantee.

1302
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,680
There's so much, so many great smells in it.

1303
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,000
Pandora Forest, though.

1304
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,600
And if we are calling this, is it unfairly

1305
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,160
making it like a titan?

1306
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:18,760
Because I also thought, let's talk about the tropical moment in Soarin', which is lovely.

1307
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,320
Yes.

1308
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,200
That's fantastic.

1309
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,520
You're in Fiji, I believe.

1310
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:22,920
Yes.

1311
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,720
Oh, it's great.

1312
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,960
It could be my favorite smell in Soarin' too.

1313
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:29,880
I think it is.

1314
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,360
You could argue that that is the best smell in Soarin' too.

1315
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,320
Which almost makes me-

1316
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,520
You've already decided then.

1317
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,040
That's almost me deciding.

1318
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:43,000
And then you toss in that if it is the same thing in Flight of Passage, does anyone want to argue

1319
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,800
whether- are there different smells in Flight of Passage?

1320
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,720
Because isn't the cave something different?

1321
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:49,320
Yeah.

1322
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,680
I've only done it once, so it's hard to say.

1323
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,180
Sure.

1324
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:58,120
The Avatar ride, Flight of Passage, is so good, I don't even register that there are fake smells.

1325
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,840
I registered this one because this is one of my favorite fake smells, period.

1326
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:09,800
If a hotel has this kind of smell in the lot, or a store immediately endears it to me.

1327
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:13,880
I'm saying there could just be a couple other fake smells that got shot in there that I wouldn't

1328
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:17,320
notice because I'm like, oh, well, I'm in a cave on the back of the Mighty Akron.

1329
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,240
I'm not actually-

1330
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,760
Feeling the beast breathe between your legs.

1331
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,200
I'm feeling the great beast breathe.

1332
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:22,760
Yeah.

1333
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:26,920
I'm just saying that I don't know how many smells are on there.

1334
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,920
Do we just know that we don't always have to take it along?

1335
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,440
No, I think we know what it is.

1336
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,040
All right, Pandoran Forest.

1337
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:32,600
It has to be.

1338
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,160
Moving on.

1339
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:33,800
Yeah.

1340
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:34,920
The other one is really good.

1341
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:35,560
The other one is really good.

1342
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,280
I know.

1343
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,880
It's very unique too, which you really should get at points, but unfortunately it has

1344
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,880
tied to two really great things.

1345
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,400
Some of these initial brackets are pretty unfair, and I think with a different-

1346
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,280
Yeah.

1347
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:52,920
There's a version of this where all the last four are sore, I think, but that's not where we're at.

1348
00:54:53,880 --> 00:55:03,000
We are now at number six, and that is Ginger in Monsters, Inc., Mike and Sully to the Rescue,

1349
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,480
one of the longest ride names in the world.

1350
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:11,080
There is a ginger smell when you go into the sushi restaurant in that ride.

1351
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:21,000
Ginger versus ginger bread in Haunted Mansion Holiday, mainly at Disneyland, also Tokyo,

1352
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:21,880
Disneyland.

1353
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:27,000
There is a gingerbread house every year that changes.

1354
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:32,520
I learned from some holiday special that they do a very different house every year

1355
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,640
in the ballroom scene on the table.

1356
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:44,280
That is a real gingerbread house, which I didn't realize until watching this special.

1357
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:50,120
It seems possible that that is a contrived plastic thing, but it is in fact edible,

1358
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,640
and they do a very good job with it.

1359
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,000
Ginger versus gingerbread.

1360
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,960
Well, Monsters, Inc. is a weird ride because it's pretty good.

1361
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:05,000
It's obviously reskinned superstar limo, but it is pretty good, and it's a fun thing.

1362
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,440
I don't go on it a lot.

1363
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,640
It's like the placement of it is weird.

1364
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,600
If it's anything over five minutes, I go, I'm not waiting for this.

1365
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,760
It's sort of not fair to it because this scene is really nice, the ginger,

1366
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,200
whether they go into the sushi place.

1367
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,760
Very fun scene, this sort of madcap, she's hiding under the takeout boxes.

1368
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:29,560
I don't know what it is when I'm in that corner of California Adventure when it's like,

1369
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,520
oh, you want to go to Monsters, Inc.

1370
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,080
I go, nah.

1371
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,680
If I think about it, I think it has to do with that area.

1372
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,120
It has to do with that queue.

1373
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,240
So industrial.

1374
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,600
I think it's a similar thing to what we were saying on the Living with the Land episode,

1375
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:45,800
where I think that the area around it influences it unfairly.

1376
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:53,160
It's a great option if you get to the paradox of crowds at California Adventure,

1377
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:58,040
because sometimes you can be in the middle of California Adventure and it's a busy day

1378
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,200
and everything is a burden.

1379
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,480
All the food is long.

1380
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,760
All the rides are long.

1381
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,320
And there's like two or three things you can do there.

1382
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,240
It's happened to me during spring break.

1383
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,040
This was like, well, I came all the way down here.

1384
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,520
I'm getting on a ride and I got on this ride.

1385
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,080
Right.

1386
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,680
I do think it's like kind of got flats outside.

1387
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,640
But when I'm thinking about this scene, it's really good.

1388
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,520
It's a really, as we just said, it's really fun.

1389
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:26,280
And then they decided to go with ginger over the fake fish smell they could have used.

1390
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,800
It's probably for the best.

1391
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,920
Probably for the best.

1392
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,960
Sushi restaurants don't really smell super like fish, I don't think.

1393
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:34,200
Right.

1394
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:34,680
Depending.

1395
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,000
Yeah.

1396
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,720
I guess if it's so stacked with like fresh fish.

1397
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:43,560
If you're doing the whole like table thing where the sushi chef is making it for you

1398
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,440
while you sit at the bar.

1399
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,080
I'll say this, though.

1400
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,640
You notice the smell.

1401
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:53,000
I don't think I could have called it out as ginger specifically.

1402
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,040
I agree with that.

1403
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:57,640
I think when I read, oh yeah, when I was reading up on smells and it was like, oh,

1404
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,440
ginger in that area.

1405
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,520
I go, oh, that is ginger.

1406
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,480
That's really smart.

1407
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,520
That's really original.

1408
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,840
I think that's a nice feeling, but I think it's a feeling that doesn't take you all the way

1409
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,880
to the end in this tournament.

1410
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,480
I agree with this.

1411
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,200
I think this in another category is a bit of a sleeper.

1412
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,800
I truly really think this is a nice subtle thing because I think you have to award subtlety

1413
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:23,000
in certain ways for just slightly adding to it, but not calling so much attention to it,

1414
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,080
which I think is tasteful.

1415
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,960
It's a tasteful little addition to this already fun scene.

1416
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,280
Yeah.

1417
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:33,080
Gingerbread, the gingerbread house can be overwhelming if you hit it at the right thing.

1418
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:36,760
Points dock to for the presence of actual gingerbread.

1419
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:38,760
Why would you say that?

1420
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,880
Well, because it's the item.

1421
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,480
It's the actual item.

1422
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,600
I don't think that's the smell is not coming from that though.

1423
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:45,960
It's added to it.

1424
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,560
Yeah, it's added in, but I'm a little skeptical.

1425
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,240
This is an interesting thing with you.

1426
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,880
We have only a scratch of service on this.

1427
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,400
You don't like it if the actual item is anywhere present.

1428
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,880
I like it, but in the context of this tournament,

1429
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,760
there's some very nice essence makers.

1430
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,280
There's some very nice scent makers who had to work very hard.

1431
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:06,520
Right.

1432
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:09,720
I know that, but I'm saying, and I think we'll talk about it once we're done with this first bracket,

1433
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:16,360
is that if something's around, you don't think it's as impressive if it's possibly partly real.

1434
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:21,800
I'm just verbalizing my thought process on how you pick a victor.

1435
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:27,560
The smell you're smelling is entirely a contrived smell.

1436
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,280
I do not think you are smelling that house.

1437
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,640
Yes, I think for sure.

1438
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:39,480
I think you're going to be right next to a gingerbread house to smell the gingerbread.

1439
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,560
I mean, they make some pretty big ones at the hotels and those smell, but yes.

1440
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,640
You can't smell it from across the lobby.

1441
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:47,800
I don't think so.

1442
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,200
Do you disagree?

1443
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,080
I can't really remember.

1444
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:54,840
You walk into Grand Californian, can you smell the gingerbread house?

1445
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,640
I feel like sometimes.

1446
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,120
Could they be fake smelling you in the Grand Californian?

1447
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:58,680
They might be.

1448
00:59:58,680 --> 00:59:59,160
They're working me.

1449
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,040
Yeah, maybe.

1450
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,320
They're working you with the smell.

1451
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,760
Hotels definitely pump in scents.

1452
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:09,240
The most egregious being the Universal Sheraton, the Universal City has one of the most aggressive.

1453
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:17,400
The Universal Hilton has no scent and the Universal Sheraton has a very potent fragrance.

1454
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:22,440
I didn't notice that when I was drinking alone there several weeks ago.

1455
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:26,280
But if you go, if you walk in looking for you'll find it.

1456
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:32,760
It dissipates when you get towards like the rooms, but it's a little much.

1457
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:33,960
Smell in a telly.

1458
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,000
That's telly, baby.

1459
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:37,880
That's the smell.

1460
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,280
It's been 25 years.

1461
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,480
The smell remains.

1462
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:43,880
Telly.

1463
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,920
The smell of robe and bald head oil.

1464
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,160
Bald head oil.

1465
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,680
Keep it nice and oily, baby.

1466
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,920
Ooh, lozier scent to air.

1467
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:58,840
I don't know, Mike, you may have unintentionally swayed my vote though with the subtle day note.

1468
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,400
You're allowed to vote however you want.

1469
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,320
I might have to toss mine to Ginger.

1470
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:04,200
Okay.

1471
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:04,760
Monster Zinc.

1472
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,560
Monster Zinc tics.

1473
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,800
I think I'll be in the minority.

1474
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:14,680
The reason I made that point is because this is probably my favorite part of Haunted Mansion Holiday.

1475
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:20,600
When you go into this room and you smell the gingerbread and you see the house,

1476
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:21,720
it's new every year.

1477
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,720
It's not the craziest impressive thing.

1478
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,240
I find it very charming.

1479
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,320
I love the smell of gingerbread.

1480
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:32,680
In any other category, Ginger maybe gets a little sleeper room, but not here because I gotta go

1481
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,800
gingerbread.

1482
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,520
I love this scene in Haunted Mansion Holiday.

1483
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,040
Gingerbread from me as well.

1484
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,080
And you know what?

1485
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:45,400
I think this ride needs the support because lately a lot of hatin' on Haunted Mansion Holiday and I

1486
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,440
don't understand it.

1487
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:50,440
I could see the point of starting it later, but I think that is

1488
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:55,560
morphed into this monster of it's bad and they shouldn't do it.

1489
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,080
Fuck that.

1490
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,480
I really like Haunted Mansion Holiday.

1491
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:03,240
We can talk timeline, but it's great.

1492
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,800
That's insane to say you don't want it to be done at all.

1493
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,480
I've said this before.

1494
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,280
Of course, I would.

1495
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,840
Yes, if we could do it for two months, great.

1496
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,200
The thing is you can't argue with the crowds.

1497
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:20,360
The thing is double the line of normal Haunted Mansion for the five months that it exists.

1498
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,920
It's obviously more popular than the regular one.

1499
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:29,160
So if it's like four or five months though, you're about almost getting the same.

1500
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:33,320
If you consider like downtime, it's probably pretty close.

1501
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,320
Maybe you get an extra month of regular Haunted Mansion.

1502
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:41,000
I'm just picturing us standing outside and hearing that music that plays outside.

1503
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,040
I love it so much.

1504
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:47,720
That little loop, that twinkly, scary, demented kind of.

1505
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:52,040
I think actually, even more so than just the Haunted Mansion,

1506
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:58,680
the Nightmare Before Christmas theming, I think it might be an excuse or a reason

1507
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:03,560
or a justification for going into the Haunted Mansion and really plusing it up.

1508
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:09,000
Because it does feel fresher because it's newer stuff.

1509
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:09,880
Part of it.

1510
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,480
I do think that might be part of it.

1511
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:17,560
I know I've said this many times, but that Midsummer Scream panel

1512
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:22,840
where Tony Baxter was advocating, go in there and really do it up.

1513
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:23,880
That's kind of the feel.

1514
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,440
You end up like, I'm looking at something from 2019.

1515
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,240
Why did I say 2019?

1516
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:29,560
I don't know.

1517
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,920
Last time I was there, probably.

1518
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,920
People are going to think we recorded this in 2019 though.

1519
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:34,520
Or really back loading.

1520
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:38,440
Yeah, you're seeing more modern stuff in there and I don't know.

1521
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:43,800
Well, be careful with that though because some of the 2000s added in stuff is not aging well.

1522
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,160
Like the Pride Projection.

1523
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:45,720
That's the test.

1524
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,920
That's not in well.

1525
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:52,280
But I feel like we are in more of a time where the projection has gotten a lot better

1526
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:55,320
and the people are favoring practical effects.

1527
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,840
Do you like Hatbox Ghost still?

1528
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:57,880
I love Hatbox Ghost.

1529
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:58,520
There you go.

1530
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,680
That's a good way to judge it.

1531
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:04,360
He's lasted five years and there's no sign of him looking dated.

1532
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,000
2010s.

1533
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:07,160
Oh, sure, yeah.

1534
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:11,080
But we'll get to his room probably in 2022.

1535
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,640
On our yes or anywhere Haunted Halloween.

1536
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:14,600
You think that's a little too early.

1537
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:15,560
Jason might be right.

1538
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,240
Well, I liked that.

1539
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,720
Yeah, let's get to it.

1540
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:24,600
Let's get to it.

1541
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,080
So this is what we're almost it's almost been an hour.

1542
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,040
We haven't said all of them.

1543
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,880
I think I think Mike, you're up.

1544
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:30,440
You're up next.

1545
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:30,920
Is that me?

1546
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:31,720
I believe so.

1547
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:37,720
Okay, we are going to be doing one very iconic one and one less.

1548
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,400
Like equally iconic.

1549
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,200
Equal iconic.

1550
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,640
Okay, we're going to do Banana Breath from.

1551
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:44,840
Well, two.

1552
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,400
King Kongs.

1553
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,080
Banana Breath.

1554
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:52,120
Both Kongs and then a which we determined before we started.

1555
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:59,400
Fart gun banana smell from Despicable Me Minion Mayhem.

1556
01:04:59,400 --> 01:04:59,720
Yes.

1557
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:00,920
Universal Studio.

1558
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,880
So let's explain this and I'll say this.

1559
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:09,720
We're going to post along with this concurrently over on the second gate behind the paywall.

1560
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:16,040
Patreon.com podcast, the ride we were we were discussing some of these issues of what was

1561
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:21,080
going to be in the final 16 and we broke off a little fragment and recorded it because there

1562
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,600
was an issue I really wanted discussed on Mike and I'm glad we did it.

1563
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:30,440
Yeah, the issue is that we originally had a category that was fart versus fart and I

1564
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,360
don't want to repeat things that we said over there.

1565
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,640
Please listen to our important fart versus fart conversation.

1566
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,440
That's a little bonus for the Patreon subscribers.

1567
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:43,800
But what that was was fart in Shrek 4D and fart in Despicable Me Minion Mayhem.

1568
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:47,960
And then I started thinking, wait a minute, I don't I'm not confident that there was a

1569
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,800
fart smell in Shrek 4D.

1570
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:53,080
No, we just talked about farts so much with Griffin Newman.

1571
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,960
It felt very possible that there could have been.

1572
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:58,920
I didn't blink when that was put on the list.

1573
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,760
Like, of course, and fart versus fart.

1574
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:01,720
We got to do that.

1575
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,400
Then I was like, but is there a fart?

1576
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,360
I'm not totally sure.

1577
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:08,280
And then in this case, Fart and Despicable Me, I was like, let me remind myself.

1578
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,320
What that part is, and it's in the line.

1579
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:18,200
It's in the pre show and Gru is threatening to blast you, his guests with a fart gun.

1580
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:23,960
Yeah, but then once blasted, I noticed the audience did not scream and recoil that.

1581
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:28,520
And that is because the minions got in there and they rewired everything.

1582
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,360
And it's instead of banana smell.

1583
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:34,360
Yeah, gives an excuse for the minions to yell banana a whole bunch.

1584
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,280
One of their favorite things.

1585
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,440
Several excuses to do this.

1586
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:43,080
So the fart gun in Despicable Me Minion Man is technically a banana smell.

1587
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:46,360
And we thought, well, then doesn't it have to go up against the banana breath?

1588
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:46,520
Right.

1589
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:49,080
We've had orange versus orange and now banana versus banana.

1590
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:49,320
Right.

1591
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:53,720
And as with the oranges, probably the same smell.

1592
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:55,160
I think so.

1593
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:55,880
Probably the same.

1594
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:59,080
Actual the same chemical makeup of these smells.

1595
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:02,600
But one was a trailblazer, you know?

1596
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,960
I mean, this, I think I don't think we got to labor around this.

1597
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,560
I like minion mayhem.

1598
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:08,520
I think it's fun.

1599
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:09,640
And I think it's good.

1600
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,000
If I was a kid, I love it.

1601
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:12,520
I would love it.

1602
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,080
Absolutely.

1603
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,680
But we don't need to labor over this.

1604
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:15,880
This is what have convoluted.

1605
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:16,680
What do you mean?

1606
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:19,240
It's a fart gun and then it's banana.

1607
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,520
So confusing.

1608
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:26,760
The clear less confusing thing is your tram is getting attacked by King Kong,

1609
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:32,520
who ate approximately 2000 bananas enough to make his old breath smell like bananas.

1610
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:38,520
And you have to also credit it because it may be an argument, whatever it goes up against,

1611
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:45,000
the fact that it's like referred to and that I can attest as a tour guide that it gets a laugh when

1612
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,880
you refer to it because people might kind of notice it, but then saying like, hey, get a load of that

1613
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:50,920
banana breath.

1614
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:55,160
And you watch everybody go, oh, that's right.

1615
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:58,040
It just gives people so much joy that that is there.

1616
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,920
So yeah, it has to be.

1617
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,360
Fuck you, fart gun.

1618
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:03,000
Get out of here.

1619
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:08,840
And for confusing us, making us have a sidebar conversation that's very essential that you can

1620
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,760
listen to at pitia.com slash pockets ride.

1621
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:12,440
Get out of here.

1622
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:12,920
You're out.

1623
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,120
Banana breath it is.

1624
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:14,620
Has to be.

1625
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:18,360
And Jason, does that make you read the final?

1626
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,880
The final round.

1627
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,240
This is the toughest one for me.

1628
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,680
I will say this is strange.

1629
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:28,040
You're going to see here that we sort of we try to make these

1630
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:32,440
understandable pairings and then we kind of ran out of ways to justify.

1631
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:39,000
Again, they all couldn't be perfect and they all couldn't be a hundred percent pleasant.

1632
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,200
And I think it's good.

1633
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,400
There are some oddballs.

1634
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,240
This is the might be the oddest one of all.

1635
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:49,160
Roam burning from spaceship Earth versus Maggie's mouth from the Simpsons ride.

1636
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:54,440
Maggie's mouth smells like baby powder, which is odd because mouse.

1637
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,440
That's not where baby powder goes.

1638
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,280
That's not what mouse smell like.

1639
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:59,160
Not really.

1640
01:08:59,160 --> 01:08:59,560
No.

1641
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:03,640
And even though her mouth and her big what's the thing that dangles in your mouth?

1642
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,520
Pacify.

1643
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,320
Oh, no.

1644
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:05,880
Uvula.

1645
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:06,440
The body part.

1646
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:07,320
The uvula.

1647
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,000
It looks big and plastic.

1648
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,880
You punch a plastic one on the way into the ride on crusty.

1649
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,200
Yes.

1650
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,640
But it's not plastic.

1651
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,240
It's yeah, that's that's human.

1652
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,760
It's the human body.

1653
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,640
Yeah, I guess it I don't know.

1654
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,080
Maybe something would smell kind of.

1655
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,600
She's probably like sucking a lot.

1656
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,720
She's the pacifier.

1657
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,400
Toys and such.

1658
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:30,440
But yeah, that's fun.

1659
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,160
This is a late cut.

1660
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:31,400
Weird.

1661
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,680
This is a last minute addition, I think, to our list because that is fun.

1662
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,560
That's it is fun.

1663
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,040
And you could say, OK, we could we could.

1664
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:41,080
There's a little bit of a leap in logic of like, well, she's a baby.

1665
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:43,080
She smells like baby powder a little bit.

1666
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:47,320
She just was freshly powdered before she grows giant at the end of the Simpson ride.

1667
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:47,880
Yeah.

1668
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,000
Thus, each powder molecule also grew.

1669
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:52,200
Exactly.

1670
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,440
You could like those are all the sizes of boulders.

1671
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:54,680
Right.

1672
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,880
Because that makes that actually makes a lot of sense because the whole town then

1673
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,320
would eventually smell like it.

1674
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:02,280
All those molecules burped correctly.

1675
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:05,000
Yeah, they would all tumble down the Springfield Hill.

1676
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,720
Crush everyone down below.

1677
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:07,960
Yes.

1678
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:11,320
And then you get to Rome burning, which I would say

1679
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,560
Rome burning is in the same category of smells as ginger is.

1680
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,680
It's a little stronger than ginger for sure.

1681
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:19,720
It could have been against each other.

1682
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,200
But ginger gingerbread was too good.

1683
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:22,760
Too good.

1684
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,520
The name is the same.

1685
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,720
Yeah, it's the same letters in the same order.

1686
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:34,120
So yeah, and this one's again, a stronger smell, but another sort of subtle smell

1687
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:38,760
that's just supposed to like ease you into the era and what's happening.

1688
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:42,200
And Rome is burning and you're smelling like, I don't know, how would you describe it?

1689
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:45,240
It's like burning wood parchment kind of crack.

1690
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,000
It feels really like books.

1691
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:52,520
Isn't that what it actually is portraying is like information is the library of Alexandria.

1692
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:55,720
Yeah, yeah, it's going knowledge is being destroyed.

1693
01:10:55,720 --> 01:11:00,040
Luckily, the scribes, there were scribes who kept the records.

1694
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,880
There was an Arabic scholars.

1695
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:05,720
Yes, sacred Jedi texts.

1696
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,760
Sacred Jedi texts.

1697
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,000
It's like really wonderful atmosphere.

1698
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:11,400
It is.

1699
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,440
Yeah, this ride, it leaps out at you.

1700
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:17,240
And it's going to be great when a little Olaf is there too.

1701
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,800
They redo this ride and like.

1702
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,520
Getting a note.

1703
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:24,200
I'm writing the words down too with the scribes.

1704
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,680
My arms are burning.

1705
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:29,240
I Lord Rick Moran is out of retirement.

1706
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:33,000
Titans.

1707
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:34,600
Follow me.

1708
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,840
Yeah, I mean, it's such a neat.

1709
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:45,320
It's a neat moment when you, you know, in trying to think of candidates for this,

1710
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:49,240
when you Google favorite Disney smells, this is always on there.

1711
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:49,560
Yeah.

1712
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:50,360
People love it.

1713
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,840
And it does maybe feel more to me like in a like a strong,

1714
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:58,280
like a thing you leave the ride talking about, maybe then Maggie,

1715
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,280
which is a more subtle detail like the ginger.

1716
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,960
Maybe that should have been paired.

1717
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,240
I mean, I'm thinking that now.

1718
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,680
Yes, that would have been a good.

1719
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:05,560
Which ones?

1720
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:09,560
Ginger paired with this one because they're both Maggie's mouth subtle.

1721
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:15,960
They're more subtle smells that like really make it like fill out the mood and the vibe

1722
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:20,760
as opposed to being like, oh, wow, you got a blast of some sort of smell that that sort of takes over.

1723
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:23,560
So yeah, we could have done that.

1724
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:24,600
Look, is this going to be perfect?

1725
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,120
No, look, it's not going to be perfect.

1726
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,040
It's not how the game played out this year.

1727
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,320
Yeah, maybe next year.

1728
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:31,480
I feel like this one's unanimous.

1729
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,600
Probably probably room burning room burning.

1730
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,440
Ah, not Michael.

1731
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:36,920
What?

1732
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:37,480
What?

1733
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:38,360
Maggie's mouth.

1734
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:38,860
Whoa.

1735
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:42,360
Would you like to try to convince anybody over to you?

1736
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:49,320
I think that I can't divorce myself from that moment when Maggie uses your vehicle like a pacifier.

1737
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,480
It's so fun to me.

1738
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,520
If you don't know what I'm talking about, she puts the vehicle in her mouth.

1739
01:12:54,520 --> 01:13:00,360
She sucks on the vehicle like a pacifier and it's a big blast of baby powder.

1740
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:04,200
And I don't know, that just sticks out to me as one of that.

1741
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:04,440
Right.

1742
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,200
Is a lot of crap going on.

1743
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:11,000
Some might argue too much crap, but that's maybe my favorite part of that ride.

1744
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:15,480
And it's such a big part of it is you're waiting for that smell.

1745
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:21,400
And yeah, I have to go with it, unfortunately, over room burning, which I like as well.

1746
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,000
I don't think anything.

1747
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,840
I don't think I appreciate the passion.

1748
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,840
Yeah, passion defense.

1749
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:30,760
And there's no, I don't think there's anything you can pull away from room burning, which is,

1750
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,280
I don't think there's any counter argument.

1751
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:40,680
No, I mean, look, the problem is I can't, I could never speak bad of Spaceship Earth's room burning scene.

1752
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:47,800
I would never, I all it's a, yes, it's a subtle thing and it's like the vibe of going up that slow,

1753
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,120
in the best way, boring ride.

1754
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:54,760
I can't, I can't even think of a thing to say bad about it.

1755
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:55,560
Yeah, yeah.

1756
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,760
It's just a personal choice.

1757
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:58,600
Well, we now have our choice and I'm sticking with it.

1758
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:05,480
So the next round will be Evergreen Forest from ET Adventure versus Vanilla and Waffles on Main Street.

1759
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:10,520
The Orange Grove in Soarin' versus the Chili Dog in Stitch's Great Escape.

1760
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:14,520
Pandorin Forest versus Gingerbread from Haunted Mansion Holiday.

1761
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:18,760
And King Kong's Banana Breath versus Roam Burning from Spaceship Earth.

1762
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,840
Some tough choices coming out, fellas.

1763
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:21,720
It's going to be tough.

1764
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,080
Let's, let's step away from it.

1765
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,600
Maybe not for too long.

1766
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:25,000
Yeah.

1767
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:25,720
Going a while.

1768
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:31,080
But do you want to talk about what didn't make the cut or what barely got pulled out?

1769
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,120
There were a couple things.

1770
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:37,800
I mean, we also talked about like, I love the smell of, we talked about hotel lobbies, the Polynesian lobby.

1771
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:38,840
Oh, of course.

1772
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,520
It's a fantastic smell.

1773
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:49,480
But we really tried to say like we wanted the smell, the fake smell to be something very specific versus maybe just a general pleasant scent.

1774
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:50,360
Yeah.

1775
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:54,200
Hotel lobby fragrances, I feel like are their own category.

1776
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,160
I think so.

1777
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:55,400
Yeah.

1778
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,520
But no knock on that.

1779
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,960
I'd almost rather that be in there than Stitch.

1780
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:01,560
But we are where we are.

1781
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:09,160
I threw out the idea of fried chicken, which you can smell at various places in Disneyland.

1782
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:13,240
Also, was there a fried chicken smell at Doc Brown's outside?

1783
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:13,720
Possibly.

1784
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:14,680
I believe so.

1785
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:17,880
So that's the vague.

1786
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:18,680
This is the argument.

1787
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,200
You convinced me on the gingerbread.

1788
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:26,040
I think the fried chicken that you can smell on Main Street, I think they are ventilating the kitchen.

1789
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:27,800
Like I think they are.

1790
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,560
I think you are being naive.

1791
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,440
I think you're being naive.

1792
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,400
Then call me naive, if you will.

1793
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:39,560
I think they're frying chicken there like a million hours a day.

1794
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:40,280
The argument.

1795
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,320
It's got to go somewhere.

1796
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:46,040
The argument that we had is that we smelled fried chicken over by Tomorrowland.

1797
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,240
The kit, it butts up.

1798
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:47,720
The kitchen.

1799
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:48,280
It doesn't.

1800
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:48,920
We looked up.

1801
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:54,360
I looked at an overhead view of the kitchen and there's like a couple buildings apart.

1802
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:58,840
It wasn't butting up to like PizzaPlanet or PizzaPorter or whatever the hell it's called now.

1803
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,880
I think it was like there were two buildings across.

1804
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:04,520
But was it just once you smelled this or can you always smell this?

1805
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,280
I've never noticed this before.

1806
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:07,400
I smelled it once.

1807
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:09,240
Maybe I've smelled it.

1808
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,520
I feel like I've smelled it since.

1809
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,160
So I don't know.

1810
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:13,960
It's possible.

1811
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:14,840
I don't know for sure.

1812
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:16,280
Let us know.

1813
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,080
Let us know if you have the answer.

1814
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:23,080
I will say when you brought up, I was like, oh, I guess you can smell fried chicken on Main Street.

1815
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:26,600
To me, it wasn't nearly the same as the candy, the ice cream.

1816
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:26,760
Yeah.

1817
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:27,160
For sure.

1818
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:33,800
It was more of, oh, I guess if I think about it, it didn't seem like so iconic.

1819
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,720
Lindsay is now confirming the smell.

1820
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:40,680
But it was the argument we were having is just, is it real or fake?

1821
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,720
In my argument, there was fake because there weren't.

1822
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,160
Yes.

1823
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:50,760
Lindsay is saying we were by the Tomorrowland.

1824
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,360
We were by like Star Traders.

1825
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:54,200
But there's no chicken.

1826
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,800
They aren't selling any chicken around there.

1827
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:56,760
Why are we smelling chicken?

1828
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:57,560
That's my argument.

1829
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,480
To make you want it elsewhere?

1830
01:16:59,480 --> 01:16:59,800
Yes.

1831
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:00,680
Yes.

1832
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:04,040
It's just using just good smells will make you hungry.

1833
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,240
Just smells in general.

1834
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,080
Just smells like that will make you hungry in general.

1835
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:15,080
But there's a place that does barbecue on Saturdays in Burbank, like in the parking lot of a grocery

1836
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:17,960
store, they have a big smoker and you can smell that a block away.

1837
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:19,400
That's true.

1838
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:19,960
Yeah.

1839
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,400
But that's, I think it's positive.

1840
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:22,280
It could be a waft.

1841
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:23,720
I don't think Jason's insane here.

1842
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:24,120
I don't know.

1843
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:29,480
I looked at an overhead map of where it would have to have been coming from.

1844
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:31,240
I think that's a city block.

1845
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,840
I don't think that's more than a city block.

1846
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:33,400
I think that's equidistant.

1847
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:33,800
Yeah.

1848
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,080
But that's outside.

1849
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:37,160
They were doing it in a parking lot or they were doing it?

1850
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,320
See, the parking lot's open air.

1851
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:39,960
That's true.

1852
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:41,080
It's like-

1853
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:46,040
Again, if you have industrial fryers cooking chicken for 12 hours plus a day.

1854
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:51,400
I think though the fact that I don't always smell it is an argument in my favor.

1855
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,440
Not enough people ordering chicken.

1856
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:55,800
I think it's an argument not in the favor of being on the list because if this is a

1857
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:59,320
thing that only you sometimes smell and it wasn't familiar to me.

1858
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:00,040
Well, that's fair.

1859
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:01,320
Or Jason.

1860
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,760
Jason, does that sound familiar to you?

1861
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:06,600
Well, I've smelled it around there, but I've eaten that fried chicken a lot.

1862
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,480
So I don't know.

1863
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:08,600
Maybe I've been fooled.

1864
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,160
That's fine.

1865
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:10,520
It's always on your brain.

1866
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,480
It's always on the brain for you.

1867
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,080
I don't want to ignore that I just said I smelled it.

1868
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:13,800
I know.

1869
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,640
We're not talking about you.

1870
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:16,120
It's not the-

1871
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,160
Email, air-free.

1872
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,640
We're not arguing that the smell wasn't smelled.

1873
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,160
We're arguing if the smell was real or fake.

1874
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:21,720
Here we go.

1875
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:23,640
That's what we're arguing about.

1876
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,440
I just don't think it's a top 16 contender is what I-

1877
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,040
Did it make it this year?

1878
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,160
I agree with that.

1879
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:31,880
Not this year.

1880
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,720
Phil Our Magic got dissed.

1881
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:38,040
There's pie and there's champagne.

1882
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:38,680
I know.

1883
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:41,160
And we just didn't- we were Heming and Han on those.

1884
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:45,480
I don't think we got the full extent of the attraction here in California.

1885
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,560
Yeah, that might be California advice.

1886
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:48,920
I caught the pie a little.

1887
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:50,120
Florida Erasure.

1888
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,200
I can't catch the champagne.

1889
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:56,360
We also dissed Stink Bug in It's Tough to Be a Bug.

1890
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:56,600
Right.

1891
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:03,240
Could have gone alongside either- maybe could have beaten Stitch or the Skunk.

1892
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:03,560
Right.

1893
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,520
But I don't know.

1894
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:08,360
I don't do not like It's Tough to Be a Bug.

1895
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:09,400
Yeah, I'm not a big fan.

1896
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:10,360
I don't like being poked in the back.

1897
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:11,160
I don't hate it.

1898
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:13,800
Yeah, to me it's a torture read.

1899
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:19,400
What else do we- I think that's mainly what we- I feel like something else came off.

1900
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:19,900
Yeah.

1901
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,200
I don't know.

1902
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:27,160
Listener, let us know if there was anything you really liked that you thought should be on here.

1903
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:30,200
Probably one staring us smack in the face and we can't see it.

1904
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:30,760
There might be.

1905
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:31,480
Can't smell it.

1906
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:35,080
Or we're wrong about wafting us right in the face.

1907
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:36,680
All right then.

1908
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:39,560
Well, round two we head into.

1909
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:46,360
And match of number one, the E.T. Evergreen Forest versus Vanilla and Waffles on Main Street.

1910
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:47,160
God damn it.

1911
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:52,520
Ooh, both atmospheric, both very pleasant, fond memories associated with both.

1912
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,200
Oh man.

1913
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:57,480
Man, this is- God, I don't know how it could be harder than this one.

1914
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:58,760
Honestly.

1915
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,160
Here's that himming and hawing.

1916
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:01,660
Yeah.

1917
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,000
Really mentally constipated.

1918
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:07,500
Mm-hmm.

1919
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,280
I want to start thinking about this.

1920
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,520
Dip a toe in the water of an argument.

1921
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:13,160
Here's the thing.

1922
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,060
Okay.

1923
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,840
E.T. Forest smell.

1924
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:18,600
I will say this about it.

1925
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:26,920
One of the best things about it is I think that it simulates the things we were talking about,

1926
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:32,040
whether on purpose or accidentally, when we talk about pirates or haunted mansion, natural smell.

1927
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:37,240
There's some element of that forest smell that to me feels like accidental.

1928
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:39,480
It smells like pirates water to me.

1929
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:40,360
I don't know what it is.

1930
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:43,800
I don't know if it's the nostalgia that's really infecting in my brain,

1931
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:46,600
or it's some weird off chemical because it's old.

1932
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,400
I don't know what it is.

1933
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,280
Do you know what I'm saying?

1934
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:51,080
There was a time where I thought it was a little accidental.

1935
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:55,480
And it seems like a cousin of theme park water.

1936
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:55,560
Yes.

1937
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,760
But I guess how could it be?

1938
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,960
There's no water in there.

1939
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,320
There's no real nature in there.

1940
01:20:59,320 --> 01:20:59,880
There's fog.

1941
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:01,080
Right.

1942
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:01,800
Maybe the fog.

1943
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:02,120
A little bit.

1944
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,880
But the fog is a fake thing too.

1945
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:05,400
But I don't think enough that they need to

1946
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:11,000
jack it up with bromine, which is a lot of what you're smelling in the pirates

1947
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,440
combination of water and bromine.

1948
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:13,560
Right.

1949
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:20,200
So you have to give it some points for that because out of all these smells,

1950
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:24,360
it's giving me that same vibe as the pirates water, which is hard to beat.

1951
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:32,280
So I do have to put one extra point on its board, so to speak.

1952
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:38,360
You feel like you're representing theme park water by choosing a fake smell.

1953
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,120
And it gives me it's an extra.

1954
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:41,480
I don't know what it is about it.

1955
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:45,320
It gives it an extra little edge when I'm just thinking out loud about it.

1956
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:51,480
It's hard, though, because again, that Main Street smell.

1957
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,600
I don't know if Main Street's the same without it.

1958
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:56,200
I don't know.

1959
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:59,240
Oh, that's a heavy thought.

1960
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:07,000
Main Street works as well without that fun smell of candy and waffles and ice cream.

1961
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:12,600
And we are talking about a smell that is being smelled somewhere in the world every day,

1962
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:17,400
constantly by everyone, as opposed to the ET Adventure, which sadly is closed in a lot of

1963
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:22,760
places, that if you are a theme park fan, ET Adventure is one of your top three things.

1964
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:26,840
If you're a regular person, you might not care about this ride or the smell.

1965
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:27,480
Right.

1966
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,320
But obviously we're theme park fans.

1967
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,000
Our listeners are theme park fans.

1968
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:36,520
And I mean, we look, I put over the whole experience with ET and everything from the forest,

1969
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:42,920
but it is also like without botanicus, does this hold up as well?

1970
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,120
We're talking about holding up.

1971
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,520
Sometimes he's not there.

1972
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:47,480
Sometimes he's not there.

1973
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:51,160
The smell is broken and the smells there and it smells still fantastic.

1974
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:52,520
Consistency, though.

1975
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:53,320
And atmosphere.

1976
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:54,040
Reliable.

1977
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:57,240
I don't know what I'm going to do here.

1978
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,440
I think the uniqueness.

1979
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:00,600
This is a tight one.

1980
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:12,200
I think the uniqueness will give it to ET for me because sometimes I do not want to

1981
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:15,880
necessarily smell ice cream, contrary to popular belief.

1982
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:21,240
Sometimes if I had a big meal or like I'm feeling like groggy and they're at Disneyland,

1983
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:25,240
the last thing I want to be blasted with like super sweet smells.

1984
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:26,280
Interesting.

1985
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:29,960
I've never really thought about that in like, oh, stop this stupid smell.

1986
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:34,360
It's sort of like maybe is it like a sickeningly sweet.

1987
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,320
Hey, should we have included?

1988
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:41,240
I know what I remember what we didn't do with the fucking the bathroom with all the giggling

1989
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:42,040
in Harry Potter.

1990
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:43,240
Oh yeah.

1991
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,200
What is the smell in there?

1992
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:45,480
Bubble gum, isn't it?

1993
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,400
Oh, is that supposed to be?

1994
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,680
I just assumed that was what it was.

1995
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:49,640
I didn't realize that.

1996
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:50,840
Am I wrong?

1997
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:51,560
You might be right.

1998
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:55,640
When I was Googling it, I was like, nobody seems strongly.

1999
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:56,040
I don't know.

2000
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:56,440
Fuck it.

2001
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:56,920
It's not on.

2002
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:00,680
No reason to go back there.

2003
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:05,480
Island of Adventure has started doing more thematic bathroom scents in the bathrooms.

2004
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,720
I remember that as a news story.

2005
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:15,000
So maybe you are right, but that's just a whole different final four.

2006
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,760
Yeah, bathroom scents.

2007
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:19,080
We could do it in general.

2008
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:22,920
We also didn't get, you know, I want to say we didn't put on any Galaxy's Edge and I

2009
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:27,880
think there are some great smells in Galaxy's Edge, but I don't think any of them have the edge.

2010
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,680
There isn't the one that's like that.

2011
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,240
But I think they did a great job.

2012
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:34,440
Similar Disney Sea.

2013
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:35,400
I think you can attest.

2014
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:38,920
Good smells all over Disney Sea, but there isn't the one maybe.

2015
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,800
I would just say they did a great job throughout.

2016
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,320
Journey to the center of the earth.

2017
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:45,000
There's a really good smell in that elevator.

2018
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,080
And the way that smells might be going in theme parks is what I'm saying with the subtlety.

2019
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:53,960
So perhaps there again, there are subtlety, subtle smells that somebody will point out for us and go,

2020
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:57,400
oh, wow, I didn't even notice that it perfectly makes the mood.

2021
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,680
I didn't even realize because it wasn't hitting it hitting you in the face so hard.

2022
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:01,180
Yeah.

2023
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:07,800
But with this, with what made it Mike, do you want to lock it in?

2024
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:08,680
Did you lock yours in?

2025
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:09,400
I haven't locked in.

2026
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:09,900
Should I?

2027
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,040
I'm locking in ET.

2028
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,160
You're locking in ET.

2029
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:13,660
Okay.

2030
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:19,880
More you need too.

2031
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:20,380
The burden.

2032
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:23,720
You can go to ice cream parlors and get a hit and get a little hit.

2033
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:26,760
And sometimes the real deal.

2034
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:27,880
That's true.

2035
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:29,480
It is a lot less unique.

2036
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:30,360
I agree.

2037
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:30,680
All right.

2038
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:31,080
Fine.

2039
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:31,640
ET.

2040
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:32,120
ET.

2041
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:33,080
It was ET for me.

2042
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,360
I just wanted to build the drama.

2043
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:34,920
It's ET.

2044
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:36,680
It's the evergreen forest.

2045
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:38,120
I'm not happy about it, honestly.

2046
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:39,400
I'm not happy about it, honestly.

2047
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,400
Mike, I believe you read the next one.

2048
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:41,720
Okay.

2049
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:42,280
We are down.

2050
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:42,840
We are here.

2051
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:46,360
This is Soren over California.

2052
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:50,760
Orange smell versus chili dog from Stitch's Great Escape.

2053
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,680
And orange moves on, right?

2054
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,560
It moves on.

2055
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,060
Yeah.

2056
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:57,880
No question there.

2057
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,320
In a long episode, we could save a little time.

2058
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:03,640
Number three of round two.

2059
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:05,900
Jason.

2060
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:09,400
We've got the Pandoran Forest tropical smell

2061
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:13,880
from Flight of Passage versus the gingerbread smell

2062
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:15,880
from Haunted Mansion Holiday.

2063
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:16,280
It's tough, too.

2064
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:19,320
Again, I don't think Haunted Mansion Holiday,

2065
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:22,680
even though I do like it, is going to top a favorite smell of mine.

2066
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:26,520
So I'm giving mine to Pandora.

2067
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:27,020
Okay.

2068
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:30,040
This one is interesting.

2069
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:31,160
This one's a little tougher for me.

2070
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,080
This is interesting.

2071
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:33,400
Okay.

2072
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:35,000
Because obviously we've gone over this.

2073
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,720
Whatever the actual physical smell is,

2074
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:41,960
it's on two things that we really like for the Pandoran Forest smell, we'll call it.

2075
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:42,460
Yeah.

2076
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,600
And then gingerbread.

2077
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,560
Obviously, Jason's mad that it has a real gingerbread house.

2078
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:48,920
He's docking at points, I assume.

2079
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:53,240
No, I just like the you have sold me a little more that,

2080
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:57,720
yeah, obviously they have to shoot gingerbread at you to really sell the picture.

2081
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:58,680
They're shooting it at you.

2082
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:00,200
I just like the first one.

2083
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:03,080
I find the first one so relaxing and so pleasant.

2084
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:03,880
And it is.

2085
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:04,600
I'm giving it the edge.

2086
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:05,560
It's fantastic.

2087
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:07,880
Look, they wouldn't be here if they weren't fantastic.

2088
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:08,360
Of course.

2089
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:12,520
We wanted to say that these are all good fake smells.

2090
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:15,240
We don't want to knock any fake smell that's on this list.

2091
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:16,200
They all belong here.

2092
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:18,440
I do.

2093
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:21,480
It's such a pleasant smell that Fiji thing is so pleasant.

2094
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:25,560
It's tranquility.

2095
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:30,840
It's truly like the smell of tranquility, which God knows we all need a little tranquility.

2096
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:33,000
You're going full Don Draper with this one.

2097
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:33,480
Yeah.

2098
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:36,040
I'm just trying to I'm working it out in my head now.

2099
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:37,400
We didn't plan this out.

2100
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:38,040
Paracel.

2101
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:44,680
It's you know, I haven't been to Fiji and I certainly haven't been to Pandora.

2102
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:45,160
Right.

2103
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,120
And it gives you a little taste of gives you really nice.

2104
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:49,160
It's really lovely.

2105
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:54,920
But I fucking love that gingerbread room.

2106
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:59,320
And I think I'm going to have to give it to the gingerbread room.

2107
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:00,840
Oh, boy.

2108
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:01,800
Oh, it's on me now.

2109
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:02,920
There's something about it.

2110
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:05,400
I look forward again.

2111
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,760
All of it's I mean, you know what?

2112
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:10,520
I talked a big game about subtlety, but all this stuff which hits me in the face with

2113
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:13,560
a big broad smell, that's the stuff I seem to like.

2114
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:16,600
So when I'm running the corner and I go, we're getting the gingerbread,

2115
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:19,880
I get real excited about it and I got to go gingerbread here.

2116
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:24,280
I really like that the gingerbread smell.

2117
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:24,920
I definitely do.

2118
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:32,840
I think, though, that that is that is in one attraction as opposed to what

2119
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:35,160
maybe unfairly is unfair.

2120
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:38,680
There's been a gerrymandering here of two attractions.

2121
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:45,080
But if we're taking into account guest enjoyment and Soren over the world and Pandora,

2122
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,360
that's three different.

2123
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:48,120
Oh, sorens in Japan, too.

2124
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:55,320
It's let me just let me just go there in my imagination.

2125
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:00,920
I mean, that shimmer and why I'm almost thinking of it more for Soren

2126
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:06,440
than Pandora, which is again, because I've been on that more and just that shimmering water,

2127
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:09,720
that music is the sound of the water, too.

2128
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,720
You can hear gentle waves lapping.

2129
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:17,480
Think of when you go on a mansion holiday and it's around Christmas and there's a festive

2130
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:22,520
vibe in the air and you get that gingerbread, which honestly still is one of the most festive

2131
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:23,080
smells.

2132
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:25,800
It really suggests to you the holiday.

2133
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:29,880
Gingerbread's not on the list for me for cookies.

2134
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:30,440
Really?

2135
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:32,360
Really?

2136
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:34,200
Because that makes sense to me.

2137
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:38,200
Chocolate chip, sugar, oatmeal, peanut butter.

2138
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:41,160
I might be five.

2139
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:43,800
I might be more aesthetically into gingerbread than.

2140
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:44,840
Well, that's what I'd argue.

2141
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:48,520
I would argue that it's not maybe my in my top five cookies.

2142
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,120
Well, then we're talking building material.

2143
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:54,680
But the smell gingerbread is such a festive holiday smell.

2144
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:59,160
I think I like gingerbread more than gingerbread cookies.

2145
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:00,600
Like actual bread?

2146
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,040
A slice of gingerbread.

2147
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:04,920
Yeah, I don't know that I've ever had a slice of gingerbread.

2148
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:05,960
Maybe I haven't either.

2149
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:06,840
I don't even know what that is.

2150
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:13,080
I am going to go with Pandoran Forest.

2151
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:18,360
I keep playing a tiebreaker and I keep messing with you, Mike.

2152
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:18,840
That's all right.

2153
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:21,400
Yeah.

2154
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:22,520
Ken, these are all great smells.

2155
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:24,280
We don't want to knock any of the smells.

2156
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:31,320
I remember being very excited going on a flight of passage and realizing,

2157
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:33,320
oh, it's that smell or a smell similar to that.

2158
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:38,040
So I get to not knowing what was coming, going like, oh, it's going to smell like this for a little while.

2159
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:38,600
Hell, yeah.

2160
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:40,040
It's a great smell.

2161
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:41,800
The unobtainium of smells.

2162
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:42,840
I can't smell.

2163
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,360
I'm already very fond of.

2164
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:44,860
Sure.

2165
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:47,240
This one's brutal.

2166
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:49,480
Yeah, but this one is easy, isn't it?

2167
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:49,960
I don't know.

2168
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:50,520
I don't know.

2169
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,080
I don't know.

2170
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:51,400
It is.

2171
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:51,880
I don't know.

2172
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:52,040
It is.

2173
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:53,640
To me, it is.

2174
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:58,360
We're talking King Kong's Banana Breath versus Rome Burning and Spish of Earth.

2175
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:00,760
Two innovators.

2176
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,360
Two early 80s.

2177
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,760
This is the 80s representing.

2178
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:05,320
Yeah.

2179
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:06,680
Go, go 80s here.

2180
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:07,240
I like that.

2181
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:09,880
This feels just a very analog time.

2182
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:16,760
Disney versus Universal.

2183
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,200
For the ages.

2184
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,960
For the ages.

2185
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:22,200
Fought for in our nasal cavities.

2186
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:28,040
I have to take personal bias out of it.

2187
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:34,520
What a victorious summer it was for me when I was facing having to work at one of several movie

2188
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:37,720
theaters and clean bathrooms essentially.

2189
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:42,120
And instead I got the dream job, the dream job of a lifetime.

2190
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:44,680
I was very happy early 20 something.

2191
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:49,560
King Kong's Banana Breath smelling that every day is when I felt the most alive.

2192
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:58,920
I don't want to be going all fast times at Ridgemont High here.

2193
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:03,880
I'm fondly recalling that King Kong's Banana Breath is my dazed and confused.

2194
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:05,720
For me, it's not the smell of weed.

2195
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:07,560
It's the smell of banana breath.

2196
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:09,880
Putting your earbuds in on your break.

2197
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:10,760
Just hearing those.

2198
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:15,320
I'm not a console, but I'm not a soldier.

2199
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:16,920
I've got soul.

2200
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:24,520
Is there any saying that because that was a hit of the time?

2201
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:25,320
Is that right?

2202
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:27,000
I think that's around then.

2203
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:27,720
Am I wrong?

2204
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:28,220
Hot fuss?

2205
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:30,520
No, that was on Sam's.

2206
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:35,320
I mean, that takes me back to the glory days of Southland Tales.

2207
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:35,960
Isn't that hot?

2208
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:37,000
It was quite a time.

2209
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,280
Southland Tales was number one at the box office.

2210
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:41,480
2004.

2211
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:44,200
King Kong was number one on the theme park charts.

2212
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:48,360
And Scott Gardner was cruising to adult happiness.

2213
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:49,960
2004.

2214
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:51,000
2004.

2215
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,160
So kind of a clap going back, oh, something from a few years ago.

2216
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:55,880
Yeah, it sounds good.

2217
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:57,880
OK.

2218
01:32:58,440 --> 01:32:59,400
Rumburg spaceship art.

2219
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:00,360
This is an important smell.

2220
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:01,720
This is an important smell to people.

2221
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,760
This feels like one that could go all the way.

2222
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:12,360
This, I think, heightens a theatrical presentation.

2223
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:16,440
I'll say this against Kong's banana breath.

2224
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:18,520
That's that's a gag, right?

2225
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:19,400
That's a gag.

2226
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,880
Like King Kong eats anything.

2227
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:23,800
And yeah, you're making.

2228
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:27,320
Yeah, he's eaten that many bananas that his breath smells like banana.

2229
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:29,000
But we're making fun of the car.

2230
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:29,560
It's true.

2231
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:30,060
Right.

2232
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,560
But room burning.

2233
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:36,280
It's a bit of drama of high drama.

2234
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:39,160
The burning of the library at Alexandria.

2235
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:40,760
You know, the fall of Rome.

2236
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:42,680
This is humanity.

2237
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:43,800
This is history.

2238
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,680
We're carrying the record.

2239
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:50,440
It's that we're talking about the written record being destroyed

2240
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:55,880
and the smell record preserving the record of records being destroyed.

2241
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:58,680
This doesn't go anywhere in the change.

2242
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:01,560
Like in the in the in the plus in the redo of spatial

2243
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:03,480
worth that they're talking about doing.

2244
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:05,160
No way this is taken out.

2245
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:06,360
It doesn't feel possible.

2246
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:06,860
Yeah.

2247
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:11,560
And it's atmospheric and it's a type of smell.

2248
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:12,040
They're good.

2249
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:14,360
Like chaos smell like smoky.

2250
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,560
That's what I'm talking about that I like in Galaxy's Edge

2251
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,800
and I like in journey to the center of the earth.

2252
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:24,840
These these kind of musty smoky things are bad.

2253
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:27,960
You know, it's another real smell we can include is like

2254
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:30,920
pyro and the smell of the Indiana Jones stunt show.

2255
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:34,040
And maybe this is the way to represent the smoky sector.

2256
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:34,540
Right.

2257
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:39,800
This yes, this is yes, there's a whole genre of smoky smells.

2258
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:41,560
Some on purpose, some not.

2259
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:45,000
I mean, yeah, it's done shows in like phantasmic.

2260
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,080
There's fire pyro water stuff.

2261
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:47,720
Gunpowder.

2262
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:48,440
Yeah, gunpowder.

2263
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:51,000
I wonder.

2264
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:51,800
Yeah, I wonder.

2265
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,960
There's probably places we haven't even considered.

2266
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,320
And this is a good representation of it.

2267
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:01,160
But that big monkey is so fun.

2268
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:05,320
And unfortunately, I've learned something about myself in this

2269
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:07,720
whole thing is that I'm not a subtle guy.

2270
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:11,000
I'm not a guy who likes subtlety as much as I wish I did.

2271
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:14,440
And this Kong, it's a big fun.

2272
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,320
I don't know if you call it body, but it's a gag.

2273
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:19,800
And I have to go with Kong.

2274
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,560
Well, I certainly wouldn't call it body.

2275
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:24,520
He does not have breasts.

2276
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:26,280
He's not wearing his underwear.

2277
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:26,760
Yeah, you're right.

2278
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,200
Is body always sexual?

2279
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:29,240
I think so.

2280
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:30,920
Let me look at the definition of body.

2281
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:31,960
It's always sexual.

2282
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:33,320
Your use of body.

2283
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:33,800
It's a whole.

2284
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,320
We don't have time to get into it.

2285
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:36,920
I would do an entire episode.

2286
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:37,320
Yeah, it is.

2287
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:40,360
So long just because this is it's.

2288
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:42,200
I meant I should just say crude.

2289
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:43,880
I should have said crude.

2290
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:45,640
Yeah, you think this is crude?

2291
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:47,080
Well, he's he's burping.

2292
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:47,880
He's burping.

2293
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:50,120
He's letting you smell his impolite.

2294
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:51,000
Yeah, it's impolite.

2295
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:53,560
It's the most prudish opinion.

2296
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:57,880
Yeah, it's reminding us of when we used to be wild animals.

2297
01:35:58,200 --> 01:35:58,840
The forest.

2298
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:01,880
King Kong is crude.

2299
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:04,360
King Kong is crude because he's letting us smell his breath.

2300
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:05,400
King K rule.

2301
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,280
That guy's really rude.

2302
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:10,120
You're locked in.

2303
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,080
I'm locked in with Kong.

2304
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:14,520
Yes, I'm going to lock in with room burning.

2305
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:15,240
Oh, man.

2306
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:17,320
Oh, man.

2307
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:20,600
On me again.

2308
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:24,440
Yeah, and of course, I'm turned off by the crudeness.

2309
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:28,760
Yeah, my bow tie has been spinning the whole time.

2310
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:30,120
We've been talking about.

2311
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:39,080
Yeah, the only crude I would hear about is that family of prehistoric guys who get out to mischief.

2312
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:40,760
The crude, the crude.

2313
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:51,000
Oh, oh, I really liked Rome burning on Spaceship Earth.

2314
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,600
I kind of forgot that detail.

2315
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:57,000
Spaceship Earth is maybe the ride I went on the most on our trip recently.

2316
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,120
I think I did it three times.

2317
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:00,840
It's really great.

2318
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:02,040
That is a really wonderful moment.

2319
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:03,560
It is.

2320
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:05,160
Yeah, Scott scratching his head.

2321
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:07,000
He's making he's grimacing at the moment.

2322
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:09,400
I think this is the toughest choice I've had to make.

2323
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:09,960
Interesting.

2324
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:10,360
Understand.

2325
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:11,560
The rest have all been.

2326
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:16,040
Say what's in your heart or your gut.

2327
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:17,560
Either one.

2328
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:19,000
Those might be different things.

2329
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,040
They might be different things.

2330
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,600
This is an easy.

2331
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:25,240
Banana breath.

2332
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:26,200
It's banana breath.

2333
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:26,840
It has to be.

2334
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:29,000
I got to go with I've been going against you.

2335
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,080
My I don't want to for the third time.

2336
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:31,720
You don't have to go.

2337
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,440
That has to be that has to be a consideration.

2338
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:35,400
It's not just that.

2339
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:36,840
It's not even just the personal.

2340
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:37,720
I just love that.

2341
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:42,280
It's like it's I think it's iconic because I agree it's referred to.

2342
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:45,800
And we had we just talked about confrontation.

2343
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:48,520
It factors into that.

2344
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:49,020
Yeah.

2345
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:52,440
Yeah, I'm sorry.

2346
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:53,800
I'm sorry.

2347
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:54,520
Rome Burnham.

2348
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:55,640
Sorry, Spaceship Earth.

2349
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:57,400
I'm a big fan of Spaceship Earth.

2350
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:58,920
Well, we've got a final four.

2351
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:00,280
We've got a final four.

2352
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:04,200
You know, I might have my my brackets wrong.

2353
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:06,680
How are you seeing the versus what I'm seeing?

2354
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:07,160
E.T.

2355
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:09,560
Forest versus Orange from Soren.

2356
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:11,480
Oh, yeah, that's what I have.

2357
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:15,160
Tay and then Pandora Forest versus banana breath.

2358
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:19,000
I really like the last four.

2359
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,200
I really like it.

2360
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:20,840
These are good.

2361
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:22,200
Is that too?

2362
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:23,240
Yeah, it is.

2363
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:25,080
It's two Disney's and two universals.

2364
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:26,280
Yeah, yeah, pretty good.

2365
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:28,200
Two forests.

2366
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,440
Yeah, forests and two fruits.

2367
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:33,880
Yeah, unfortunately, it's too bad.

2368
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:38,040
It's not forest versus forest and orange versus banana.

2369
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:38,920
That would be perfect.

2370
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:43,560
Us being like really just sweaty like, God, I can't.

2371
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:44,280
I don't know.

2372
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:45,800
Orange versus banana.

2373
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:49,480
We will have to get there.

2374
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:52,520
I like it.

2375
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:53,560
I like it.

2376
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:55,720
I think we should just be proud of where we are.

2377
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:56,360
Yeah, we should.

2378
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:57,960
We've done a lot of hard stuff today.

2379
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:00,840
We've had to make a lot of hard decisions.

2380
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:01,340
Yeah.

2381
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:05,400
So evergreen forest versus oof.

2382
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,800
This is this is tough.

2383
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:12,120
Soren Orange is yes is really, really fantastic.

2384
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:14,680
These are and it's such a I'll say this.

2385
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:16,680
OK, so I guess we're in in it already.

2386
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:18,280
Forrest E.T.

2387
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:21,560
Forrest Evergreen Forest versus oranges from Soren.

2388
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:27,160
Soren Orange is smell so much like a perfect version of an orange.

2389
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:31,960
I know it's fake, but it really like they nail it in a way that almost none of these

2390
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:38,360
smells do or it smells like the perfect version of like they've just ripped open a hundred

2391
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:41,320
oranges and you're smelling the perfect version of them.

2392
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:44,680
Yeah, like it's such a good fake smell.

2393
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:45,640
This is such a good.

2394
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:47,880
This is not air freshener.

2395
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:52,120
This is like this isn't just a well deployed smell you smelled before.

2396
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:53,480
I think this is top tier.

2397
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:58,520
Yes, like juicy, dewy oranges.

2398
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:03,160
Yes, whatever they're doing, whatever they're pumping into our nasal cavities,

2399
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:06,360
it's really triggering the right things in our brain.

2400
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:10,440
You can also just go to Camarillo.

2401
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:14,120
Well, sure, you can go to Camarillo.

2402
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:15,000
I think it's easy.

2403
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:21,000
I mean, you can get a really good orange if you pick the right time of year to go to Trader Joe's.

2404
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:27,320
I agree with what you're saying, but I'm saying this is almost a supercharged heightened version.

2405
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:28,440
It's an ideal.

2406
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,040
Yes, an idealized smell.

2407
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:34,520
And I'm saying they do that better than almost any of the other smells,

2408
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:36,520
idealized smell, maybe other than gingerbread.

2409
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:39,400
I might almost say pure quality.

2410
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:44,440
If we're talking smell only between these four, this might be the best.

2411
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:47,240
Context free smell.

2412
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:53,560
Yes, I would agree with that, I think, because the forest one is good, but it's.

2413
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:55,080
But where else can you get that?

2414
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:56,600
I hear what you're saying.

2415
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:58,040
Where else can you get that ET smell?

2416
01:40:58,040 --> 01:40:58,760
But it's not.

2417
01:40:58,760 --> 01:40:59,400
The forest?

2418
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:00,920
Anywhere, but that.

2419
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:03,320
That crisp.

2420
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:10,520
That kind of, kind of inside, kind of musty.

2421
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:14,200
But you can't quite describe it, which is both good and bad.

2422
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:18,360
I'm saying when you're talking about pure smell, just the smell on its nose,

2423
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:21,960
whatever you would say, this one, you describe it.

2424
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:27,240
You could truly, you could explain it to someone else and you could convey what it is,

2425
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,640
which I think is a strength of it.

2426
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:37,480
I think that there it would be hard to convey forest and ET and botanicals to someone who has

2427
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:41,240
not been there and you could explain to somebody the orange and they would go,

2428
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:45,000
oh, I know exactly what that is and I know exactly why you like it.

2429
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,520
Does that make it less special?

2430
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:49,000
I'm not saying it doesn't make it less special, but I'm saying that

2431
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:55,640
that the forest one is nostalgia plays into it, the mood plays into it.

2432
01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:59,080
And right now we're talking just smell alone.

2433
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:01,400
We're talking, we're just trying to piece together here.

2434
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:04,040
We're trying to deconstruct here.

2435
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:06,120
So we're just talking about smell alone.

2436
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:12,040
It's possible that context or that nostalgia is nostalgia and context.

2437
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:13,160
They're too tied together.

2438
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:15,960
As Scott was saying, if we have to analyze just smell alone,

2439
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:19,400
this orange is such a pure awesome version.

2440
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:21,960
Wait, do we have to just analyze smell alone?

2441
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:22,440
We don't.

2442
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:25,400
I'm just saying we're deconstructing here.

2443
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:27,000
We're deconstructing here.

2444
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:31,560
I don't know that I like the smell of citrus that much.

2445
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:31,960
Really?

2446
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:33,800
So the citrus is fantastic.

2447
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:35,320
Yeah, no, I do like it.

2448
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:37,160
But you don't like it that much.

2449
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:38,360
It can be a little much.

2450
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:39,240
You don't like gingerbread.

2451
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:40,280
You don't like citrus.

2452
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:43,080
What would you say your top smells are?

2453
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:46,600
What do you like the smell of?

2454
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:46,920
Bread?

2455
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:48,760
Baking bread?

2456
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:50,200
I do like baking bread.

2457
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:53,160
OK, you like that better than citrus and gingerbread?

2458
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:53,660
Baking.

2459
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:57,400
Rising chocolate chip cookies and brownies.

2460
01:42:57,400 --> 01:43:00,840
Chocolate chip cookies have a very good smell when they're cooking or baking.

2461
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,040
I think fresh citrus.

2462
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:05,240
I love the smell of citrus.

2463
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:11,160
So do I like the smell of a damn forest?

2464
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:13,960
Yeah, of course I do.

2465
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:14,600
You know what?

2466
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:15,240
Locking it in.

2467
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:15,880
ET forest.

2468
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:16,920
Yeah, I'm locking it in too.

2469
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:17,640
ET forest.

2470
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:18,840
I don't even have to vote.

2471
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:19,800
It's got to move on.

2472
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:22,040
It doesn't even matter what I would say.

2473
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:25,080
The length of the argument started me going, you know what?

2474
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:25,960
ET forest.

2475
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:27,240
Where else are you going to get that?

2476
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:27,740
Hit.

2477
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:29,880
What are you voting for?

2478
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:30,600
I hadn't decided.

2479
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:32,360
Do we know?

2480
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:34,760
Make it official for the record?

2481
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:38,760
ET forest.

2482
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:39,260
All right.

2483
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:42,600
I'm just trying to be honest.

2484
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:44,040
I'm trying to give a, you know.

2485
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:47,560
I think it's the guilt that we feel about eliminating.

2486
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:49,400
But this is what this whole thing is about.

2487
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:52,120
It's all about this and it's all about trying to analyze.

2488
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:53,320
We said at the top, ET forest.

2489
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:54,920
We're all banging our pens.

2490
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:56,760
ET forest is going to go far.

2491
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:00,920
I'm just trying to analyze and make sure that I'm doing this in the right way.

2492
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:05,960
I don't want to jump the gun and say because one of my favorite characters in fiction

2493
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:09,400
maybe my favorite botanicus is connected to this smell.

2494
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:09,960
You know what?

2495
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:11,480
That it doesn't deserve this.

2496
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:14,920
I don't think I'm even putting botanicus in there.

2497
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:17,720
I don't think that's even part of it because the moment for me

2498
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:22,840
is when those stage doors open, you've made it past the operators.

2499
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:24,040
You've given your name.

2500
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:24,520
Why?

2501
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:25,880
What could this be for?

2502
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:29,320
I'm holding a passport for to what end?

2503
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:33,560
And then you are out of this industry, this lobby.

2504
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:35,720
This is a place I feel like I'm at the bank.

2505
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:39,800
And then the doors open and now you're in a magical forest

2506
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:42,760
and the coolness hits you and the smell hits you.

2507
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:44,840
It's a magical moment.

2508
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:47,800
It's almost more special because it's only in one place now.

2509
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:49,640
Look, I don't disagree.

2510
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:50,920
I don't.

2511
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:53,160
I'm just trying to be honest.

2512
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:54,200
I'm just trying to be good.

2513
01:44:55,560 --> 01:45:00,520
This takes us now to Pandoran forest versus banana breath.

2514
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:07,560
Oh, versus new strap like blood pressure.

2515
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:09,640
So high.

2516
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:16,680
There's some like new versus these also are both like soren versus retro classic.

2517
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:17,560
Yeah.

2518
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:23,480
Let me start by saying the Pandoran forest versus the E.T. forest.

2519
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:26,120
Well, that'll have a match up.

2520
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:26,760
You almost can't.

2521
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:28,680
We can't do that because if it wins.

2522
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:29,400
Yeah, we can't.

2523
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:37,720
Let me just say that the Pandoran forest is such a wonderful smell, but it does.

2524
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:40,840
If you get if you separate the smell from the experience,

2525
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:44,200
to me feels like a really great hotel lobby smell.

2526
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:48,360
And then you took the hotel lobbies when we were even discussing this.

2527
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:50,200
And I just talked about Polynesian.

2528
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:51,000
We took it out.

2529
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:53,080
It's not as specific.

2530
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:56,120
I will say Kong's banana breath.

2531
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:59,400
When you put it up again, now we can do this comparison.

2532
01:45:59,400 --> 01:45:59,800
Orange.

2533
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:02,760
It I don't think is quite as good as the orange smell.

2534
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:06,120
It smells worse than the orange is.

2535
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:07,880
Yes, it does smell worse than the orange.

2536
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:09,320
And it's sometimes fainter.

2537
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:10,440
Yes.

2538
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:15,880
And I was all in the past, obviously, but it didn't always work.

2539
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:16,440
Yeah.

2540
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:16,680
Right.

2541
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:19,240
And again, I have to tie my experience in.

2542
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:23,800
I did not smell that banana breath every day when I worked there.

2543
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,280
So the inconsistency, I think you have to dock at points for it.

2544
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:32,760
You know there's no inconsistency on on plight of passage.

2545
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:34,920
They're they're keeping tabs on that.

2546
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:36,760
James Cameron calls and checks every day.

2547
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:43,320
I think the combination of the smell and the movement and the 3D visuals,

2548
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:46,520
you know, it's just great.

2549
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:49,320
I played a passage around the world.

2550
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:53,400
I will say the Kong reminds me and this is a good thing.

2551
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:55,720
Kong reminds me of banana runs.

2552
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:57,480
And I love banana runs.

2553
01:46:57,480 --> 01:47:01,960
They are a bit divisive, I hear, which is crazy to me because I don't know.

2554
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:03,320
I don't I don't like them.

2555
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:04,040
Yeah, divisive.

2556
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:04,840
I don't know why.

2557
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:06,040
I don't a lot of people.

2558
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:08,440
I think it's put it as my favorite kind of runt.

2559
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:11,160
See, it goes maybe strawberry.

2560
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:11,960
I would.

2561
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:15,560
They had cherry runs and they've got rid of them, which is crazy.

2562
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:18,120
But that's another podcast of fakie flavoring.

2563
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:20,120
I tend to prefer strawberry over cherry.

2564
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:21,240
Yes.

2565
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:24,760
But the fakie cherry, when you go like maraschino cherries,

2566
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:27,640
style fake cherries delicious.

2567
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:29,720
No, that's a plus.

2568
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:30,680
No, that's a plus.

2569
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:31,400
You do.

2570
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:32,760
I love a maraschino cherry.

2571
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:34,440
Like a Shirley Temple situation.

2572
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:36,040
Yeah.

2573
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:37,240
Which I've seen a lot of chatter.

2574
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:41,640
There's a little boy that really temple boy is the name the Shirley Temple King.

2575
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:43,320
I think so.

2576
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:45,640
It's too late to be getting in this episode with this.

2577
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:50,200
But there's a little boy who reviews Shirley Temples called the Shirley Temple King, I believe.

2578
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:53,080
And he'll be a future guest on the show.

2579
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:54,680
See you soon, King.

2580
01:47:56,360 --> 01:48:02,840
Maraschino cherries are a little ruined for me by the Luxardo cherries in the Carthay man.

2581
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:03,560
Oh, well, sure.

2582
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:06,120
I mean, those are fantastic sweet cherries as well.

2583
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:07,720
It's just now I can't go back.

2584
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:11,000
That's like you're right in first class.

2585
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:11,800
I can't go to.

2586
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:14,440
See, I don't really like the brandy.

2587
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:15,720
I like them OK.

2588
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:20,840
But give me the fucking Kroger brand fakie maraschino cherries.

2589
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:22,120
That's all day.

2590
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:22,920
All day.

2591
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:30,200
So I the forest is just such a pleasant, great smell.

2592
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:32,680
It doesn't feel that specific to me.

2593
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:33,480
It doesn't.

2594
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:37,560
Of all the four of these that are left, it doesn't feel as specific as those other three.

2595
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,200
It doesn't have as much character.

2596
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:42,760
I feel like it's wonderful and it's very pleasant.

2597
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:46,440
And it's again, combined with two experiences that are fantastic.

2598
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:48,040
It's not as specific to me.

2599
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:49,320
It's not as specific to me.

2600
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:51,720
And I got to give it to Kong.

2601
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:55,480
So I have voted.

2602
01:48:58,120 --> 01:48:58,680
Let's do.

2603
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:00,280
I don't know.

2604
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:00,840
Do you know?

2605
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:01,640
You go.

2606
01:49:01,640 --> 01:49:02,200
You can.

2607
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:02,840
I'll break the.

2608
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:05,560
I'll be the last this time.

2609
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,520
As much as.

2610
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:15,000
I really wish that we were ending on E.T.

2611
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:15,800
Forest and.

2612
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:17,720
Oh, wait, no, E.T.

2613
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:18,200
Forest.

2614
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:19,320
I kind of was the last two E.T.

2615
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:22,840
Forest in orange in a way, but we already made it through that one.

2616
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:23,080
Right.

2617
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:31,720
Because I actually think maybe Pandora is lesser than I would maybe go below orange on that.

2618
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:33,560
I know we are where we are.

2619
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:34,120
Disagree.

2620
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:39,640
And I I'm delighted by I want to look at this paper and see E.T.

2621
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:44,440
Forest versus King Kong's banana breath that I really like that.

2622
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:49,720
But if I'm being honest, I know where I think I have to say Pandora and Forest.

2623
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:53,400
I think the inconsistency and the sometimes faintness of it.

2624
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:53,960
I know where this is.

2625
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:54,840
I have to Jason.

2626
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:55,480
I know.

2627
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:57,000
And I'm giving it to Pandora Forest.

2628
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,680
Of course, this has been tough for you, Mike.

2629
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:03,160
I think the audience is going to side with me on a lot of these.

2630
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:04,040
I'm going to be very upset.

2631
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:04,920
We have E.T.

2632
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:06,920
Forest versus Pandora Forest.

2633
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:08,760
Which.

2634
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:13,320
And this is where my journey with Pandora Forest ends because.

2635
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:17,080
I'd like look, I'd like to belabor this.

2636
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:19,560
I'd like to do my whole analysis with it.

2637
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:21,480
But what are we who are we kidding here?

2638
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:21,960
Yeah.

2639
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:22,360
Yeah.

2640
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:22,840
All right.

2641
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:23,720
I mean, come on.

2642
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:28,280
It's got to go E.T. all the way.

2643
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:30,280
I mean, I don't think that one.

2644
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:30,920
Goodbye.

2645
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:32,360
It has to be.

2646
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:33,960
Pandora and Forest.

2647
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:36,600
It has to be the picture that I have here.

2648
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:43,160
SWC 1040 9 5 6 Evergreen Forest.

2649
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:44,120
Sent Air.

2650
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:45,960
It says, please recycle on it.

2651
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:46,840
Here's the photo.

2652
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:49,560
We'll post it for you on Twitter catalogs out.

2653
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:50,840
This is the one.

2654
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:54,120
The winner is this industrial.

2655
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:57,320
This weird little black machine.

2656
01:50:57,320 --> 01:50:58,680
This is the winner.

2657
01:50:58,680 --> 01:50:59,240
Yeah.

2658
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:00,200
For the 2020.

2659
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:01,080
Asbestos.

2660
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:04,200
Fake smell final for.

2661
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:04,840
Goodbye.

2662
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:06,360
E.T.

2663
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:08,120
Fuck you.

2664
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:09,240
Banana breath.

2665
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:10,840
Eat shit.

2666
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:13,000
Ginger.

2667
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:14,760
And ginger bread.

2668
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:17,480
It's so great.

2669
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:18,440
It's so great.

2670
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:18,760
Yeah.

2671
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:19,640
I don't even.

2672
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:20,120
And I.

2673
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,040
Yeah, I think you're right.

2674
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:22,840
Is it pure smell?

2675
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:23,400
But you can't.

2676
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:28,600
You can't fault things for getting nostalgia tied up into them.

2677
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:29,160
I try.

2678
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:30,600
There I tried.

2679
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:33,160
Is there a single smell like of any of these smell?

2680
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:35,240
Do you think anyone would be mad about this result?

2681
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:35,960
No.

2682
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:38,520
I don't think this ultimate victor.

2683
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:39,480
And he would be mad about.

2684
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:42,600
I think there will be people who would think that it number two should have been Rome

2685
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:43,080
burning.

2686
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:47,720
I think there will be a lot of controversy when it comes to brackets, but I don't.

2687
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:50,440
I think the majority of the audience will agree with us.

2688
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:51,640
And I do think it's what I said.

2689
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:53,000
I forget which round it was.

2690
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,440
I think that the forest combines almost everything.

2691
01:51:56,440 --> 01:52:00,040
It is got all of the elements of what we like.

2692
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:05,960
It's in a perfectly placed themed area that makes you feel a certain way that even accentuates

2693
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:09,160
the smell and your magical association with the smell.

2694
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:10,840
It also is.

2695
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:17,800
I was hitting it for not being you couldn't describe it, but probably that is actually

2696
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:22,200
a positive because it's so specific to this area.

2697
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:31,560
And again, it does to me at least remind me of the natural manmade weird smells from theme parks.

2698
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:35,880
Again, we don't know exactly if that's on purpose or not, or if there's like some

2699
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:38,840
decaying part of the ride somewhere that's helping it.

2700
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:44,920
But it does add to that feeling of like this is old or something like it's been here for a while.

2701
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:46,040
Musty and mildewy.

2702
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,760
And I think there was a point in time where I thought it was more accidental.

2703
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:53,000
I feel like we can see pirates in this choice.

2704
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:59,480
And universe a park that not terribly good at preserving its own history,

2705
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:02,040
usually bulldozes its own history.

2706
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:05,960
Two mixed results, sometimes two great success.

2707
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:09,960
We still still hanging on.

2708
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:15,240
And it's almost the fact that it's almost like if you name three things about this ride and what

2709
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:21,880
you like about it, I almost guarantee the three things are include the smell and botanicals.

2710
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:24,200
And then like he says your name.

2711
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:24,520
Yeah.

2712
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:25,240
Yes.

2713
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:26,440
Now, let me ask this.

2714
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:34,680
Do if we find a way to get this scent air, if we actually buy it, we smell it and it smells

2715
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:35,480
way different.

2716
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:42,760
And we realize that part of the smell of the right is the right itself, much like pirates.

2717
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:49,960
Can we disqualify this from much like, you know, with baseball, if somebody took steroids,

2718
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:51,560
they come out of the Hall of Fame.

2719
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:56,840
If we have somebody make a case that it's half this smell and half the actual old ride,

2720
01:53:56,840 --> 01:53:59,400
does this disqualify the forest smell?

2721
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:00,840
And can't change the results.

2722
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:02,360
They've been written down and signed.

2723
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:04,840
As we've learned in recent history.

2724
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:05,480
Okay.

2725
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:06,040
Locked in.

2726
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:11,320
I also think that like the smell being released, the place does matter.

2727
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:11,800
The place.

2728
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:12,040
Yeah.

2729
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:13,000
I think the place.

2730
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:13,320
Yes.

2731
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:14,680
Smell that you're okay.

2732
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:20,120
So this will stay and these smells might be different just in your apartment versus the.

2733
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:25,080
Yeah, I have to say, yeah, it came down to ET forest versus Rome burning.

2734
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:27,240
That would have been a much harder final round.

2735
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:29,240
Yeah.

2736
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:33,880
It's almost weird that against other competitors, I feel bad as the one who

2737
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:35,000
eliminated Roam.

2738
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,080
I guess we did together, Mike.

2739
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:40,120
If you had to, what's your number two?

2740
01:54:40,680 --> 01:54:41,960
Take the brackets out of it.

2741
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:45,880
If you just had to rank these 16, what's number two?

2742
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:47,560
Because mine is orange.

2743
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:51,320
I think it, I actually think the final two should have been ET in orange,

2744
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:53,320
but that's just, we got that one done early.

2745
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:54,840
I think it's Roam burning.

2746
01:54:56,840 --> 01:54:57,480
Mine is.

2747
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:02,360
Mine is between orange or gingerbread.

2748
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:02,920
Wow.

2749
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:03,400
Gingerbread.

2750
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:04,680
I love that gingerbread.

2751
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:06,840
I guess I just have such an association with the smell.

2752
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:12,600
I just, I can see the argument being made for orange for sure.

2753
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:13,080
Yeah.

2754
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:14,760
You included in there.

2755
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:15,080
Yeah.

2756
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:17,640
Listeners, tell us what you think.

2757
01:55:17,640 --> 01:55:19,320
Do you strongly disagree with this?

2758
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:23,240
Have we massively overrated the evergreen forest?

2759
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:24,200
You know what?

2760
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:28,360
If I was ever on the fence and I didn't like that it was, we were calling it damp forest before

2761
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:33,240
evergreen forest just gave me such a good feeling when you clarified the actual name.

2762
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:33,880
Right.

2763
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:38,200
Again, as long as this is accurate, but it does make it sound better and it seems right.

2764
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:41,720
There's no, none of these smells I would rather have in front of it.

2765
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:47,080
I would, I'd rather walk into a room full of it than the evergreen forest smell.

2766
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:47,560
Right.

2767
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:49,240
I wish I could, it's only Florida.

2768
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:57,240
And yeah, if you work on the ride and you can steal one of these forests, don't get fired.

2769
01:55:57,240 --> 01:55:58,520
Steal from your job for us.

2770
01:55:58,520 --> 01:55:59,640
Don't get fired.

2771
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:00,520
I'm just joking.

2772
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:03,480
I'm just making some fun, but seriously, if you want to, you know.

2773
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:04,760
Oh boy.

2774
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:08,760
Well, congratulations evergreen forest.

2775
01:56:09,640 --> 01:56:16,600
I think we sorta, the smart money was always on this, but it's still fun to acknowledge

2776
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:18,120
all these other great smells.

2777
01:56:18,120 --> 01:56:22,360
Is evergreen forest now a PTR legend or does that have to be a separate ceremony?

2778
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:22,840
Oh.

2779
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:27,480
Automatically put the winner of our final fours into the legends category.

2780
01:56:28,040 --> 01:56:29,080
I would argue yes.

2781
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:29,720
I think so.

2782
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:30,920
Yeah.

2783
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:40,840
So imagine we're raising to the ceiling a basketball jersey that smells like the evergreen forest.

2784
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:41,320
Right.

2785
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:44,120
And then also a basketball jersey.

2786
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:49,720
The radiator springs rocks are cut into a basketball jersey.

2787
01:56:49,720 --> 01:56:50,200
That's good.

2788
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:50,440
Yeah.

2789
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:54,680
Those are rising up into the rafters of Mike's apartment.

2790
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:56,040
Okay.

2791
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:56,280
Yeah.

2792
01:56:56,280 --> 01:57:00,360
So welcome to your legend status evergreen forest.

2793
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:00,920
You made it.

2794
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:03,480
So, okay.

2795
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:04,360
I'm exhausted.

2796
01:57:04,360 --> 01:57:04,920
Yeah, I know.

2797
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:05,480
Me too.

2798
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:05,720
Yeah.

2799
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:06,680
I don't know what else to say.

2800
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:07,560
How long did that take?

2801
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:10,920
I think honestly it was under, last time I think we went like two and a half.

2802
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:12,200
This is under two hours, I think.

2803
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:12,920
Yeah.

2804
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:13,800
It was a little easier.

2805
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:16,280
There was a clear, the final two was a lot tougher.

2806
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:17,240
It was.

2807
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:17,960
I agree.

2808
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:18,520
Fake rocks.

2809
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:21,240
What do we do next?

2810
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:22,680
Next year.

2811
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:24,520
Yeah, there's a lot of different things.

2812
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:27,720
I don't know who to suggest away, listeners.

2813
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:32,760
We've talked about some, you know, maybe less interesting things like best theme park song.

2814
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:40,520
Best maybe ride vehicle divorced from the actual ride itself.

2815
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:41,400
That's interesting.

2816
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:45,400
If you could like drive around, what would you want?

2817
01:57:45,400 --> 01:57:51,080
Omnimover, you know, Wi-Fi controlled vehicle like Luigi or Rise of the Resistance.

2818
01:57:51,080 --> 01:57:55,160
But is it like almost, can we not even do like a good one?

2819
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:56,360
Do they have to be sort of?

2820
01:57:56,360 --> 01:57:56,760
Do they have to be weird?

2821
01:57:56,760 --> 01:57:57,640
These are all good.

2822
01:57:57,640 --> 01:57:57,960
I mean.

2823
01:57:57,960 --> 01:57:59,080
Bathrooms.

2824
01:57:59,080 --> 01:57:59,720
Yeah.

2825
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:05,560
Well, we've set a, yes, we've set a precedent for maybe not picking the most obvious thing.

2826
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:08,680
Do they always have to be fake something?

2827
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:09,720
Is there anything left?

2828
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:12,680
I think, yeah, fake is a great component.

2829
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:13,800
Is there anything left?

2830
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:17,160
Fake sounds.

2831
01:58:18,040 --> 01:58:19,080
Sounds?

2832
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:21,720
Yeah, but most sounds are fake.

2833
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:24,680
Best like real animal.

2834
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:26,280
Best real animal.

2835
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:31,160
And then who goes up against like goats and main street horses.

2836
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:32,200
Okay.

2837
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:37,240
We could do one where we rank the main street horses throughout time.

2838
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:40,920
So ranking dead horses, you're saying.

2839
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:41,240
Yeah.

2840
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:42,440
And if you alive ones.

2841
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:43,240
Yeah.

2842
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:43,640
Yeah.

2843
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:46,200
Is there one named Duke or something?

2844
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:47,960
Didn't Duke retire?

2845
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:49,320
Am I thinking of a different horse?

2846
01:58:49,320 --> 01:58:51,080
100% there was one named Duke at some point.

2847
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:55,800
I think, but not long ago, you and I both tweeted congratulations to Duke for being

2848
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:56,840
a new main street horse.

2849
01:58:56,840 --> 01:58:57,320
Am I wrong?

2850
01:58:57,320 --> 01:58:57,640
It's Duke.

2851
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:59,640
Oh, they believed like they did a thing.

2852
01:58:59,640 --> 01:59:04,600
Because they'll post on like Twitter and stuff about the new horses or new positions.

2853
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:07,720
So what about best firework?

2854
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:12,280
It's Red Burst versus.

2855
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:16,120
White Stardust.

2856
01:59:16,120 --> 01:59:17,080
That's good.

2857
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:17,960
Those all have names.

2858
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:24,840
There's a firework called Chrysanthemum, which is like, you know, it looks like the flower.

2859
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:28,520
I guess Mickey years.

2860
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:31,240
If it makes a shape, that's something.

2861
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:32,360
Yeah.

2862
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:35,240
Best fake.

2863
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:39,400
I want to say like fake sky on a ride.

2864
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:40,920
I don't know.

2865
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:42,680
Or sky is pretty good.

2866
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:47,080
Indoor sky is not bad reason to talk about the Caesar's Palace.

2867
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:47,400
Yeah.

2868
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:47,960
Yeah.

2869
01:59:47,960 --> 01:59:49,640
Shops of I forget the official.

2870
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:55,240
The forum shops, I believe you can throw like Small World in there, which we've talked about before.

2871
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:58,120
Would you call that fake sky?

2872
01:59:58,680 --> 01:59:59,320
Oh, I see.

2873
01:59:59,320 --> 02:00:00,040
We could just.

2874
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:01,720
Yeah, you would truly be.

2875
02:00:01,720 --> 02:00:03,480
Sky fake Final Four's.

2876
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:05,560
I see what you're saying.

2877
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:06,600
Fake sky.

2878
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:12,600
And then maybe it's also the, you know, like the end of the Hollywood area.

2879
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:14,120
Of California adventure.

2880
02:00:14,120 --> 02:00:14,520
Yes.

2881
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:17,160
On the universal tour is a big like backdrop.

2882
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:17,800
That's right.

2883
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:20,280
Like where the TLC waterfalls video is filmed.

2884
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:21,160
Fake cities.

2885
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:24,440
London and Peter Pan.

2886
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:28,040
Mexico City and the boat ride.

2887
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:31,240
Like depictions of real fake real place.

2888
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:32,280
Fake real places.

2889
02:00:32,280 --> 02:00:33,640
Fake real places.

2890
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:34,360
It's funny.

2891
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:34,680
Yeah.

2892
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:37,640
Well, we'll think of more.

2893
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:39,560
There's got to be something else too.

2894
02:00:39,560 --> 02:00:43,160
Well, and how would we determine what one to do next?

2895
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:47,960
Possibly by getting a list of 16 and having them compete.

2896
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:49,480
Oh, that's great.

2897
02:00:50,360 --> 02:00:51,400
Okay, that's good.

2898
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:55,000
The fake Final Four Final Four.

2899
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,800
Maybe next year is the fake Four Final Four.

2900
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:02,680
And the year after we do it.

2901
02:01:03,240 --> 02:01:05,400
But it's just a year wasted on.

2902
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:09,080
It's a year wasted on deciding what fake thing we do.

2903
02:01:09,080 --> 02:01:09,320
Yeah.

2904
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:10,120
All right.

2905
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:11,640
Oh boy, that's funny.

2906
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:14,360
This is just as much as we can stretch.

2907
02:01:14,360 --> 02:01:16,040
That's the whole podcast that we do.

2908
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:18,840
We're stalling for something.

2909
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:19,480
For what?

2910
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:20,120
I don't know.

2911
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:21,000
I'm not sure either, but.

2912
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:23,400
Trying to put it off.

2913
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:28,360
We're just trying to make it to the end of the Trump administration with smiles on our faces.

2914
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:29,240
Yeah, 20 years away.

2915
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:30,120
We've got four more.

2916
02:01:30,120 --> 02:01:30,760
Oh yeah, right.

2917
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:33,000
Yeah, four.

2918
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:33,880
What am I talking about?

2919
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:39,000
Well, gang, on that less than positive note,

2920
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,440
you survived, I guess, the ride.

2921
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:42,680
The fake smell Final Four.

2922
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:44,840
Congratulations, Evergreen Forest.

2923
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:45,480
Congratulations.

2924
02:01:45,480 --> 02:01:47,000
Well deserved.

2925
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:47,640
Well fought.

2926
02:01:48,280 --> 02:01:48,780
Yeah.

2927
02:01:49,480 --> 02:01:53,800
I don't want to be crass, but Edwin is making a smell right now.

2928
02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:55,480
He has farted really bad.

2929
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:58,680
To really send us off with a smell.

2930
02:01:58,680 --> 02:01:59,400
You're kidding.

2931
02:01:59,400 --> 02:01:59,800
Really?

2932
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:00,840
I swear to God.

2933
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:01,720
Wow.

2934
02:02:01,720 --> 02:02:02,360
It's crazy.

2935
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:03,960
It's not fake though.

2936
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:04,680
It's not fake.

2937
02:02:04,680 --> 02:02:06,200
There's nothing fake about it.

2938
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:10,120
This makes me want to keep going to force you to stay over there where he is.

2939
02:02:10,120 --> 02:02:10,920
He just did it once.

2940
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:13,560
But you have the button so you could stop it whenever you want.

2941
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:14,040
That's true.

2942
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:15,800
And get far away from this fart.

2943
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:16,360
Yeah.

2944
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:17,800
Edwin, by the way, the dog.

2945
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:19,400
Edwin is Mike's dog.

2946
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:20,280
In case you don't know.

2947
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:24,760
Well, see you next year for something even stupider.

2948
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:26,140
Bye.

2949
02:02:26,140 --> 02:02:26,640
Bye.

2950
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:32,840
