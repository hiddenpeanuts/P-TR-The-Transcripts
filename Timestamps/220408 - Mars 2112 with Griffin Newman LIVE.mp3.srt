1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
...dog.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Warning!

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There have been some changes to tonight's performance of Mr. Saturday Night.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Billy Crystal has been replaced by his understudy. Three men talking about theme parks.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We apologize for the physical condition of the hosts.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
On the subway here, they yelled, we, this is like a ride, and were promptly stabbed.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
There's a lot planned tonight, but the hosts are open to just turning on a TV and watching WrestleMedia Night 2 instead.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Your call.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
For the first time ever from New York, it's Podcast The Rock Live!

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Muahahaha!

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh, my microphone is tangled!

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This salt comedy venue is surprisingly easy to break into!

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
New York City!

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Are you ready to get your free card?

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah, you know what they say, all the little Cliffords in the world are here tonight!

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
In New York City!

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
All the weirdos from out of town, that's right, that's right!

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Hey, but why settle for just one emotionally stunted podcaster when you could have three?

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Ladies and gentlemen, the bad boys of Burbank!

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh, no!

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We've got a man made entirely out of Chardonnay!

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's Scott Gerger!

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You want stories about Wallace Shawn?

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And shame about not clearing your plate?

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You got it! It's Mike Carson!

27
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And oh boy, oh boy, baby!

28
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
At ease, sailors!

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Coming to you on this wonderful shore leave from the good ship lollipop, it's Jason Sheridan!

30
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Here in New York City tonight!

31
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Wow, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Podcast No. 1!

32
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh my god, we should have...

33
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
There's masks a-flying!

34
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You guys! I can't believe this room we're looking at!

35
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Scott, hello!

36
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Hi! That's very nice!

37
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's nice!

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Guys, we do this in my garage!

39
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's been in my garage and on Zoom for two years! You couldn't all fit in my garage!

40
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
How is this worth? This is a sold-out crowd at the Bell House! We can't believe it!

41
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Geez, thank you so much for coming. Unbelievable.

42
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Can I get a little bit of an inside baseball here? You know blue-skying the term?

43
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It means, well, I'll educate. Some people here might be the first podcast.

44
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:31,000
My blue sky was that we'd get Patrick Page from this musical, and I would convince him to come out and do the full song.

45
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Which, we're doing it now. That's what it turned into.

46
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He's like, yeah, we'll play the track, we'll go, ehhhh. And that's how it turned into.

47
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We're going to book him a car from the Hadestown Theater to get...

48
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah, well, Scott and I saw Hadestown yesterday.

49
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh my god.

50
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Applause for us seeing something.

51
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
These eyes! Watch something happen!

52
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, so it was great, but it is really like, both of our brains are broken because the reason we went is because we're like, oh, the Green Goblin is in a musical!

53
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And not even fully the Green Goblin from the David Letterman performance.

54
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Which it was pointed out to us, it's funny, that we're like, we want to start a New York show. What's the ultimate New York thing?

55
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You all remember that 12-year-old reference?

56
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The debacle! The famous debacle!

57
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
For our show, though, 12 years is pretty recent.

58
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Pretty recent.

59
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So, pretty good. Anyway.

60
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I do have to say, guys, that opening bit went smoother than many performances of Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark.

61
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's true.

62
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No injuries yet.

63
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah, so anyway, just letting you in the... Thank you for coming.

64
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Thank you.

65
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's nice.

66
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
They are all around. This is nuts. Oh my God.

67
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And I think we'd also, bear to say, we just, we want to say it's incredible to be in the greatest city in the world.

68
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Right? Yeah.

69
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We want to say that, but of course we are not in Buena Park, California.

70
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Which is, you understand, they have a, there's a Medieval Times and stuff, you know, everything looks like a castle around there.

71
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But we like New York City, too. We've been really enjoying ourselves.

72
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Been around for a couple days. Anything we want to say about our time before we head into the main stuff?

73
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Oh, that's a good question. I'm trying to think. Mostly it's just about the Green Goblin on Broadway.

74
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yeah.

75
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You know, the lizard wasn't in Music Man.

76
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
No.

77
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So I don't have anything else.

78
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Well, Jane and I saw Company the other night.

79
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, wow.

80
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And that, I mean, Patti LaBeouf, incredible.

81
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I also, you know, we went through Central Park, you know, we walked around Central Park. I went to the Plaza Hotel.

82
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh, yes.

83
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Do you know what they said to me at the Plaza Hotel?

84
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't know.

85
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
They said you can use the bathrooms at Bergdorf's.

86
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
They're not, it turns out they don't want people just tramping through. That's what the woman at the Eloise store told me.

87
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Go to Bergdorf's and use their bathroom.

88
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So they invited you to use a restroom elsewhere.

89
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah, she said Bergdorf's are the Apple store, and I have never seen an Apple store with a bathroom, so.

90
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Just go pee on an iPad, I guess.

91
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah.

92
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I do like that we, it took us a sec, we weren't all together in one place until last night at incidentally Margaritaville Times Square.

93
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Hell yes.

94
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Outside of a Jimmy Buffett concert, when does that get that big of a pop?

95
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
In Brooklyn, in Brooklyn, when is there that amount of applause for Jimmy Buffett?

96
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But right now, right fucking now.

97
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah, yeah.

98
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But one thing that I like is that we were all starting to, it was like, well yeah, what have you guys been up to? You've been having a good trip.

99
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And I like that one of the first things out of Jason's mouth was about your hotel, and that it was like, this place has free waters.

100
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Like highlight number one of the vacation.

101
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Every hour last night, he would say, and we have free waters.

102
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And then at a certain point he goes, look what I got.

103
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And he showed me the bottle of free water.

104
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Look, you gotta save money when you visit the city somehow, because they discovered Las Vegas style resort fees, and they just fuck you.

105
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh, this is another thing.

106
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Wait, this is another thing that's happened a lot.

107
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Jason, Jason.

108
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But in what world are resort fees new and only Las Vegas? That's the confusion on my part.

109
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
They're not new, but they are out of control. They're newly out of control.

110
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh, okay. All right, all right.

111
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Well, this seems like a good stump speech for your trying to become the mayor of New York.

112
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I know.

113
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's the platform.

114
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I mean, the people have spoken, they've raised their voices, and they've said, we want a guy who's even weirder than Eric Adams.

115
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Free bottles of water for everyone.

116
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Free bottles of water.

117
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Pretty good.

118
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Look, we have had a fantastic time, I would say.

119
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But even in the good times, we have been walking around and feeling some areas missing, some things, some of the soul of the city.

120
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And we don't know exactly what happened to it.

121
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
There's a term we've used in some of our saga type things, fallen brothers.

122
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And we have seen, Mike, if you could hit a couple of slides here.

123
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Some of the fallen brothers that we have noticed, and we hate to bum you out, but right here.

124
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah.

125
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is Mike and I at three in the morning, paying our respects to the closed for now Planet Hollywood.

126
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What a bummer. It's a shame.

127
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
They should not have to move. They should never have to replace the carpet.

128
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It should only get filthier and filthier as the years go by.

129
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's their right.

130
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Jason paid some respects.

131
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
He noted the very sad absence of the Fashion Cafe.

132
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm sorry, buddy.

133
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I, you know, at least was able to drown my sorrows in a Magnolia bakery banana pudding shortly after this picture was taken at 730 in the morning.

134
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And then, of course, you've got that there is no longer the world, the WWE Times Square restaurant.

135
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What a bummer.

136
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yeah, oh my God.

137
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I mean, it is a hard rock now, so it's kind of a lateral, but you know, it's less unique.

138
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
There was only one of the wrestling place.

139
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm so sorry to see you, this downtrodden, Jason.

140
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah.

141
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And then what's the, wait, there's one more of like,

142
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, that's just me eating a hot dog.

143
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Hot dog king shouted in the audience. That's incredible.

144
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Another thing that only gets that big of a pop at like a Jimmy Buffett concert.

145
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I had a hot dog.

146
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I had a hot dog.

147
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So, you know, look, sad stuff, you know, and among other things that the toys are us with the big Ferris wheel inside.

148
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
There was the never built Lions Gate theme park that was,

149
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
No, right? You would have, you natives would have had it all the time.

150
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You would have been there every night at the Mad Men bar.

151
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The Hunger Games escape room.

152
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
How can you even live in a city without these things?

153
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And this is kind of what we're getting at.

154
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
We are wondering what happened to our New York.

155
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Our New York.

156
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The real New York.

157
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The New York of people who did not grow up here,

158
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
but just visited once when we were 13.

159
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
That New York, what happened to it?

160
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Or where has it gone?

161
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You know, I think everybody here and the native New Yorkers will tell you,

162
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
New York hit its peak between 1994 and 1999.

163
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You all know it.

164
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
These are fat. You know, New York, that New York, the New York of our, you know, Giuliani.

165
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Giuliani.

166
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That was the time.

167
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Boo!

168
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
How was it?

169
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Did something happen?

170
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
He was, I haven't been watching anything on the news lately.

171
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yeah.

172
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Look, say what you will about the recent events with the guy,

173
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
but when he ran things around here, there was a Disney store on every corner.

174
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And until the very, very end of his term, no 9-11s.

175
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Hmm. Hmm. Yeah.

176
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Remember that.

177
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
He did it. That man did it for us. For us.

178
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
People who aren't from here.

179
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yeah. I visited first when I was 27.

180
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
This is, you know, this is, I've been in Brooklyn before,

181
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
but this is the first time I've ever stepped foot in Brooklyn.

182
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I've only ever been here on a double-decker bus tour before.

183
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What feels a little too on point for our whole deal.

184
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So.

185
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It should have been all double-decker buses out there.

186
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's how everybody should have gotten here tonight.

187
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That's our New York. Dammit.

188
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yeah.

189
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So we, what we want to do tonight is figure out what happened to that New York.

190
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The dumb New York.

191
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
What became of it?

192
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And in order to do that, we had to enlist the help of somebody

193
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
who was on the ground, who watched it happen, who saw what we had

194
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
and then watched it all fall apart.

195
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And he's going to give us some of his expertise.

196
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I think we have a great guest tonight.

197
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Wait a minute, wait a minute. He's no mere guest.

198
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Why? Why this man is an accidental PTR legend.

199
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
From Blank Check, it's Griffin Newman everybody.

200
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
All hugging like we haven't spent the last 36 hours together.

201
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Oh my God.

202
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Pointing with every limb.

203
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I feel like every time I've come on the show since accidentally being anointed a PTR legend,

204
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I have said that accidental PTR legend is the credit I value most.

205
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That having been said, the audience response to he is an accidental PTR legend

206
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
broke my brain a little bit.

207
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Wow.

208
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I don't want to front load here, but we have a lot to talk about tonight.

209
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
We have a larger subject, but I think it extends to multiple subjects.

210
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But just because I wasn't sure if Mike was going to bring it up or not.

211
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Now that it's been invoked, I feel like I need to reveal a text conversation.

212
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Oh, yeah.

213
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
All right, all right.

214
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Huh, between who and what?

215
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
We should have put this up on the slide.

216
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Which I didn't know. I meant to ask you because I didn't know if you were holding back a secret.

217
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Well, I was sending you nudes.

218
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yes.

219
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
No, I didn't do that.

220
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's more embarrassing by the way.

221
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's more embarrassing.

222
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
We have a group text called Grifford's The Ride.

223
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But occasionally there will be siloed conversations.

224
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You and I will mostly talk about people who are professional comedians who we think are not funny.

225
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Congratulations, by the way, to Louis C.K. on his Grammy.

226
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Just happened, just happened.

227
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Louis, yeah!

228
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Boo!

229
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
We didn't pick it.

230
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Did something happen?

231
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
We've been backstage for the last 45 minutes.

232
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
We've been backstage for the last 45 minutes. Did something happen?

233
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Jason and I will talk about snacks and deals.

234
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And Mike will send me links to buy action figures.

235
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yeah, that's true.

236
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But, but I got on March 1st.

237
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
About a month ago.

238
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Seven days before my birthday.

239
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Unrelated, I don't know why I said that.

240
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Actually six, no it's the seventh. I'm wrong.

241
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I got a text and it was three photos.

242
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Okay, and the first photo was like a Google map.

243
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Sort of itinerary there of 23 minutes to get from Times Square to Union Hall.

244
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Okay?

245
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
All true so far.

246
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Or the bell house, sorry, excuse me. It's a bell house.

247
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
The second text was a performance calendar for Hadestown.

248
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And the third text was the personal website, PatrickPageOnline.com.

249
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
With the screenshot of the contact info for his manager.

250
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's online. I did not get this in some weird way.

251
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
No, it's public. It's public.

252
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It was just those three photos and then Mike texted, what are the chances?

253
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
What are the chances?

254
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So now that I feel confident that's not happening.

255
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Mike was asking me, as a person who understands the geographic layout of New York City.

256
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And the energy arcs of doing a Broadway performance.

257
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Do you think there is any chance we could solicit Patrick Page to come off of a Sunday matinee performance?

258
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Two shows, right? Two shows?

259
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I think only one.

260
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Okay, so it's a no problem then.

261
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The question was, would Patrick Page come here and do a Freak Like Me needs company?

262
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
If Mike offered to pay for the Uber.

263
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I sent you these pictures and I think you were like, you realize, first of all you didn't know what I was talking about.

264
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I didn't.

265
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You were just like, what?

266
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You said, what are the chances? And I said that you could see Hadestown and then do the show.

267
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I thought the contact information would be enough.

268
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
To explain what I was doing.

269
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You're a performer, right? You love an audience. Well, we've got one.

270
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
We had multiple texts about it and then about 15 messages later I said,

271
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I just want to point out it was insane of you to just share those three pictures and think I could put your full intent together.

272
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And then your response was, quote, this theater is surprisingly easy to break into.

273
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And then you admitted the error of your ways.

274
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You said, I realized that I needed to send one more of Green Goblin on Letterman to fully explain.

275
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
This is real Mr. Policeman. I gave you all the clues.

276
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I wasn't confused about who Patrick Page was or who he was to you. I didn't understand what you thought.

277
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Sometimes you get a little excited and you get overzealous and you think you can present an idea in a fun way.

278
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And it comes out confusing. That can happen. And that's what happened here.

279
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So I acknowledge that. Yes. This was, look, there were a lot of people I cornered and said, what do you think the chances are that this guy,

280
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
that this guy, my birthday, it was the last 45 minutes I had a party a month or two ago, whenever it was, March 7th.

281
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And I kept being like, what do you think he would do it? And no one knows him. Why would, I've had it in my head.

282
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And then, yeah, it didn't. Did you text Griffin after you presented the idea to Jason and I and the response was kind of, I don't know if this will.

283
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,000
When did I first present it? February? I think I saw. Was it a year ago?

284
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I've been sitting with this. When was the first time we did the podcast ever? Yeah. I think it was, I think I threw the idea out.

285
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And you were like, oh, okay, well, maybe, I guess. Yeah. And then I went home and got my chemistry set out.

286
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And I was like, if I find a formula, we can chuck this man and come from the Broadway show.

287
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Just to clarify, I thought you were texting me privately because it was a secret and you didn't want Jason Scott to know.

288
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:32,000
But in fact, you were texting me privately because Jason and Scott had already known and not been thrilled at the idea.

289
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
We mumbled, I think, is what we did. I needed some more enthusiasm for the idea. Sure.

290
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So, yes. So, so well, why don't we applaud the idea now? It was a nice idea. There's the enthusiasm.

291
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
He's great. It's right here. We love Patrick Page. He's on the Gilded Age right now too, by the way.

292
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Wow, a lot of Gilded Age heads in the audience.

293
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Let's have a seat. There's one thing to do. There we go. Ah, all right. And thanks. Yes, seats. All right.

294
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Seats is a thing we say, unfortunately.

295
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Oh, and you know what? Actually, now that we're in kind of a transitional moment, a little surprise for you, Griffin.

296
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
In honor of your presence here, we transformed our logo to be reminiscent of the logo of your favorite ride.

297
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
There you go.

298
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Great.

299
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:44,000
For the listener at home, there's a moon and it says, podcast the ride through New York, starring podcast the ride.

300
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
The ultimate New York attraction.

301
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Now, I have to ask. I don't want to expose you guys.

302
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
All three of you went to the live taping of SNL last night.

303
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
That's correct. Yes. Thank you, Kyle.

304
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
At how many different moments, and this is, it's three separate questions.

305
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Good.

306
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:18,000
At how many different moments did each of you clock something and go, wow, that looks just like the pre-ride queue for the Fallon ride?

307
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Yeah, constantly. Yeah, yeah. Yes. Well, the whole lobby is exactly like that.

308
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It's well-made. Yeah, yeah. Like, wow, the real 30 Rock is like the fake 30 Rock.

309
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Jason will tell you after we were leaving, when we were leaving and we were still in 30 Rock, I kept going, well, where's the Steve Allen representation?

310
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And he goes, yeah, where's Jack Parr?

311
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:51,000
So glass case for Conan that's this wide, wedged in between two Jay Leno cases.

312
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
The Conan Memorial sliver, yes.

313
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Yeah. No, it's, it was, look, being there last night was almost as good as being in Orlando on the ride.

314
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:10,000
That is why, yes, it was very impressive to watch Saturday Night Live happen, but one note I have is that the entire seating didn't dislodge itself.

315
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Yeah. And go into the river and up into the moon.

316
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Yes.

317
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
What if that ride was instead Lorne coming out?

318
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And going, you know, the show doesn't go on because it's ready.

319
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It goes on because it's 11.30. But it's 11.25. I think there's enough time for a ride.

320
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And then you chased Lorne Michaels to the moon.

321
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
That's a plus up. Yeah. You fixed it. You plused it up. That's a plus up. Wow.

322
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And then the Blues Brothers are on the moon.

323
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
The new Blues Brothers. Jim.

324
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It's Jim and Goodman. No Akron?

325
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
No, no. Well, we all have our different favorite configuration of the Blues Brothers.

326
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You know, we can argue who's first, who's better, but like I'm more of a three piece Blues Brothers guy. I like Jim, Danny and John together.

327
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
That's my dream. That's my team.

328
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Can we get Buster Blues in there? J. Evan Bonifant?

329
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
We totally can. Again, everyone has their own favorite configuration of the Blues Brothers.

330
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I like the licensed touring Blues Brothers when it's just like a couple guys doing the numbers.

331
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Clearly the only wrong answer is the original Blues Brothers. The answer no one has given and up here will not give.

332
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
How do you blue, I ask people.

333
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Feel free to hashtag that on your way out of the venue.

334
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
How do you blue? Want to hear how you blue? Your comments?

335
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
What was that? What? There's a video game?

336
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You guys don't know about the video game? No, no. We don't have time. Oh my God.

337
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Is it the Blues Brothers 2000 video game?

338
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
There's a Blues Brothers 2000 video game that I recently repurchased.

339
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Wow. I'm not kidding.

340
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I don't want to go off on too much of a side tangent here.

341
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It's too late.

342
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,000
There was a Blues Brothers 2000 video game. I've not replayed it since I purchased it, but I have an N64.

343
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Yeah.

344
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
The game as I remember it, because the Blues Brothers 2000 came out before 2000. It came out like 98.

345
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And the game by my memory came out in 2001. It missed it by years.

346
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And it was one of those games where you're like, they're going to cancel this.

347
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I remember seeing it in Nintendo Power Magazine and they kept on being like, it's been pushed back six months, but they claim it's still going to happen.

348
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And my memory was that it was sort of like a Parappa the Rappa type thing where you're matching up music notes.

349
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Am I right about this? It was like you're trying to hit a Dance Dance Revolution type.

350
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
The notes are dropping.

351
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You're trying to do the blues.

352
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
What songs are in the game? Sweet Home Chicago?

353
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I don't remember. I remember it being kind of like royalty free, generic blues type music with caricatured versions of the four members of the 2000 band.

354
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Mighty Mac.

355
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Right, yes.

356
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You don't have to name all of them.

357
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Elwood Buster.

358
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
So this is a very pivotal memory to why we bought this game. Video games were like forbidden in my household for a very long time.

359
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I was the oldest kid and my parents when they finally were like, Berlin Wall is coming down. We will allow a video game system in the Newman household.

360
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
They decided that like I had gotten too many things as the oldest child and that they had to even the score.

361
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So my brother was allowed to have the video game console. It was technically his. The N64 was technically his and he had the rights over it.

362
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And I would rent dumb games based off of movies from Blockbuster and be like, I need to play this. You have to let me play this.

363
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Move.

364
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I was playing the Blues Brothers 2000 video game and he was like, your time is over.

365
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And I was like, I'm so cl- you cannot, I have to, I'm in it.

366
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And we had such a big fight that my brother punched me in the head and broke his hand.

367
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And blamed it on me for having too hard of a skull.

368
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And I brought this up to him and I was like, I'm not misremembering and he was like, Blues Brothers 2000 video game? Absolutely.

369
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Like it's like a wedged point of our relationship.

370
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Wow. You know what would have softened that blow is if you were wearing a fedora.

371
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Griffey Blues. Old Griffey Blues.

372
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Oh, we should have come out dressed like the Blues Brothers.

373
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Next show.

374
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Next show.

375
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
It's coming. You know it's coming.

376
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Okay. Let's talk about some dumb New York. Some dumb Times Square stuff.

377
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Because, I don't know, it does seem like you were here in the peak age for stupid Times Square stuff.

378
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
What was it like, man?

379
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Zara Woodstock. When there were five themed restaurants.

380
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Who? Where were your places?

381
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I'll run through some of them.

382
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I'm New York born and raised. I'm a city boy.

383
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
You guys were making your jokes about like the New York, the people who visited once when they were 12 remember.

384
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I feel like I was the one, like, as a kid and still as an adult, local, born and bred New Yorker who stayed here who likes all the things that tourists like that New Yorkers hate.

385
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And I have a very distinct memory of at some point in the 90s, some like snarky New York Post headline about Giuliani and the disnification of New York and asking my parents, can you explain to me why this is a bad thing?

386
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Like that term kept on getting thrown out of like, Julie, there's a fucking Disney store in New York.

387
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And I was like, yeah, that's a great place to have a Disney store. What is the issue here?

388
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
All your favorite characters live there. They're all in one place.

389
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Yes. And this was also like, there were not the unlicensed costumed characters in New York in Times Square at that point. That's like a later phenomenon.

390
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:48,000
So I just remember having no impression of Times Square until the moment that everyone started complaining about Times Square being ruined.

391
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And then Times Square became the place I begged my dad to take me on the weekend.

392
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And a lot of my childhood was like horse trading where my brother was a big jock and my dad really liked sports and he coached all the teams.

393
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And there was years where I was forced to be in those leagues and then years where I was forced to sit in the sidelines and watch my brother play.

394
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
And there was often some balancing of like, what's the griff thing we're going to do this weekend?

395
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And the other part of the equation was that I hated food.

396
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I was like a dangerously underweight kid that everyone thought was going to die.

397
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And my mom wanted to be the kind of parent who raised children on health food, but immediately realized I can do that and lose a son at the age of four or I can give in.

398
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
He's stubborn and he refuses to eat anything.

399
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:52,000
So often for me I feel like so much of my relationship to food is based around did the place give me a toy or was there entertainment value around the meal?

400
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And so this period of time we're talking about the 90s, Times Square and also I'd say the Central Park West area was this golden age of theme restaurants where these are places that like tourists would go to one time and my dad had to cycle through them.

401
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Because it was the only way to get me to eat food.

402
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
What am I the least sick of? You would have to determine.

403
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So my memory was the one that was sort of like the most agreeable was the Motown Cafe.

404
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:33,000
It started, it was like 50th West 50s, near Central Park West was where there started to be this original movement of theme restaurants.

405
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And then it started to migrate into Times Square.

406
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,000
But the Motown Cafe had like by my memory relatively good food and was a theme that my father cared about.

407
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Like he liked he liked the ambiance.

408
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
He liked the music they were playing.

409
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I think their big selling point was they had like the world's largest record.

410
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
On the ceiling it was meaningless, but there was a gold record on the ceiling that was quite big.

411
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
But then it was like reasonable soul food.

412
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:16,000
In a restaurant that had a good playlist and otherwise was sort of like hard rock adjacent just like classy memorabilia on the walls.

413
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
These words reasonable and good. I can't I can't I have no use for these words.

414
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
That's right. I was like this is just a taste. This is a sample. Give me the real shit here.

415
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I want a place where people are serving me in character.

416
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I want a place where there is lore. There's a narrative for me to buy into.

417
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And most importantly and I think Motown maybe did okay on this front.

418
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I want to laugh when I have to order the food.

419
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I want the act of saying what I want off the menu to feel like delivering a joke.

420
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Yeah order the silly ass. I like to order the silliest thing on the menu.

421
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And I make hard eye contact with the waiter waitress.

422
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
The waiter waitress.

423
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Rooty tooty fresh and fruity.

424
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
And I look menacing too.

425
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
So where'd you go to up your game in that regard?

426
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
We should mention there's a three out of the four of us on stage went for a late lunch today.

427
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Oh that's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We had the pleasure of spending some time at Jekyll and Hyde.

428
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I'm glad that's got such a big response because they need some help over there.

429
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Yeah get over there. I think they declared bankruptcy last week.

430
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
If you haven't had the pleasure how do you describe this?

431
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I don't think is there one sentence that it's like it's a restaurant with a bunch of creepy stuff happening.

432
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
There's just so much stuff happening.

433
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I hadn't been there in so long and just I mean to go in like in sort of a macro here that I feel like was my gateway.

434
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,000
There was the West Village location we live fairly close to that and that was very themed but reasonably sized.

435
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And felt kind of and I think you guys it felt bespoke like it was odd compared to like the Robert Earl Empire and shit.

436
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Where it was like this is just some weird New York thing.

437
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Who's funding this? What is this? You know?

438
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And then that like it existed for a while it was kind of an odd New York curio and then it caught fire.

439
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
And then there was this expansion of like Motown Cafe, Television City, All Star Sports Cafe, Multiple Planet Hollywood locations.

440
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
The Knight Gallery put a pin in that one to come back to that.

441
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:56,000
The Fashion Cafe. Right there was sort of this like then there was this Harley Davidson Cafe.

442
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
All our favorite brands.

443
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
We love here in New York City.

444
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
We love our bikes, our hogs. That's us. That's the three of us.

445
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
We love our hogs.

446
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Yeah. But there are places like the, what is it called? The Starlight Diner?

447
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Which still exists in Times Square.

448
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
These are these places where it's like they had half of the equation.

449
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Which was that's a place where the bit is kind of like all the servers who work here are spying Broadway actors and every 30 minutes there's a show.

450
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And it's someone sort of doing their Broadway audition.

451
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
In Jekyll and Hyde it's every four minutes.

452
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Well and those people are in character and you're entering a world.

453
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You know? Yeah.

454
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Like there were places where it's like this place is themed to look like this.

455
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Or there are places where people perform.

456
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And Jekyll and Hyde I feel like was the breakthrough.

457
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I was like we can have full immersion into this kind of thing.

458
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And then Jekyll and Hyde moved.

459
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
The West Village location that's still there was the original one.

460
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And then they made like a huge expansion.

461
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I think it was like 57th and Central Park West.

462
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And they had this multi-story place that was absurd.

463
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And this was around the same time.

464
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I was like such a big we were saying today like I was really into horror as long as it was the appropriate level of funny.

465
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Yeah. Scooby-Doo levels of horror.

466
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Yeah sure.

467
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Which that fit for me perfectly and then I loved magic.

468
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
So the David Copperfield Magic Times Square Cafe.

469
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Oh I wish.

470
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
It was just circulating at the same point.

471
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
But at its peak Jekyll and Hyde the Central Park West location had some of that.

472
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Where it was like you sit in a booth and there's a painting and 45 minutes into your meal the holes might open and the eyes behind the painting and someone starts talking to you.

473
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Or you're sitting under a sphinx and then all of a sudden when you are not warned the sphinx's mouth starts moving and it's the loudest object you've ever heard in the world.

474
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Clap clap clap clap clap.

475
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
And if you were louder than the dialogue.

476
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And if you were like a little taller it would like give you a concussion.

477
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
It was just clacking like this and if you're like under it you're like ah.

478
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
We were lucky that you were sitting you weren't sitting on the inside of the booth.

479
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I would not have made it to the show.

480
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
The sphinx would have taken my life.

481
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And my soul.

482
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
If you want to see Mike that he's currently bleeding out in Jekyll and Hyde.

483
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Folks go pay your respects.

484
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
This is quite a set.

485
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Like I know when I'm eating I am looking forward to be spooked and startled.

486
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
You know.

487
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
That doesn't seem like it could lead to catastrophe at all.

488
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I don't want to blow the lead here.

489
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I know it was invoked but no it was said that you had been staying at the Margaritaville Hotel.

490
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And yes in the main restaurant they do a show like once an hour.

491
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
They do like a sort of light show where they play a Buffett medley and they project stuff on the wall.

492
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Once an hour get ready on the hour there's like a little brief show.

493
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And I hadn't been Jekyll and Hyde that location maybe 20 years.

494
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
We're going there at 3.30 on a rainy Sunday one week after they filed for bankruptcy.

495
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Not a meal time.

496
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
What do we get?

497
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
You guys are outside and I was like is it open?

498
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
And you went like we don't know.

499
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Sure.

500
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
It might not be open.

501
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
It didn't look open.

502
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I like touched the door like I was afraid.

503
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I like touched it.

504
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I'm like it is opening I guess.

505
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
You were like the door does open.

506
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
The restaurant might not be open.

507
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Yeah I was scared.

508
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
We walk in there I was like look there are a lot of show elements.

509
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
This was still always the smallest of the three Jekyll and Hyde locations because it was this one the original.

510
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Then they expand Central Park West and then they made a big move at the peak of the financial collapse in 2008.

511
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
They were like let's get while the getting is good and move into Times Square.

512
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And they take over Times Square.

513
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
That's a catastrophe.

514
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
That's the spot that later I believe Guy Fieri took over.

515
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
The same spot wow wow.

516
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
He took over that spot and then that fell into ruin and now I feel like it's cycled through a bunch of different things.

517
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
But that was their spot they had.

518
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And the other ones like the Central Park West one it was like you entered and there was like a coachman.

519
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
He was like right this way.

520
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And then they had this thing it was almost like a haunted mansion type thing where the lights turned on and it felt like the room was filled with spikes.

521
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
And the room would compress and you'd feel like you were going to get crushed alive.

522
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And then the lights would turn off you'd hear screaming and the lights would turn on and they'd be like how many in your party.

523
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Best night of my life.

524
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And the Times Square one I think you entered through like a London phone booth.

525
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
They had like theatricality at every element.

526
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
As opposed to walking in and being unsure if the establishment is open at all.

527
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,000
So then we walk in and the guy who's like greeting us is like wearing a winter coat inside and is like.

528
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
So many times I kept going is this part of it?

529
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Right.

530
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Like that guy's got like a suit on is he in character?

531
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
The guy asked us he was like do you guys want to eat and it almost felt like a judgment.

532
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Yeah.

533
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
You know you're here right?

534
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Here.

535
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
There was one other party inside and I was like I just take in everything that's happening.

536
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I want to warn you guys I feel like they've fallen on hard times it's been nerfed a little.

537
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I don't know how many elements around us are still in play.

538
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
We saw at least 10 different things talk to us.

539
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
You get pummeled with entertainment in this place.

540
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
And this is the bad one this is the failed one.

541
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Yeah every like we'd be having a conversation and they're like lights and like clack clack clack clack and like skeletons telling us the same jokes that the mad scientists just told us basically.

542
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Just puns galore and we're like oh that's great I mean we loved it too but it was like I've never been so entertained.

543
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
So aggressively.

544
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Jason you Jason you would have been upset.

545
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
You would have been upset.

546
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
You would have been like I'm trying to eat my my pot pie here.

547
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Keep it down.

548
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Like Jason they have like framed giant pictures of like Legosi Karloff Chaney but then they also have things as if they're like Joe Roady style artifacts that were discovered and then their plaques underneath animatronic characters that explain their

549
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:39,000
back story and Mike kept on being like what's the loop it repeats every hour and then we got to like hour two and it was like there's still new material.

550
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
For seeing.

551
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Yeah there was a failed Frankenstein thing they tried to bring a Frankenstein life and like Dr. Brain was talking and then we were leaving.

552
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
We were leaving and then we got Dr. Jekyll and he had not even he had not done anything while we were there.

553
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Sphinx, mounted werewolf head, gargoyle, skeleton band.

554
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Skeletons at the piano organ yeah.

555
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
There was the guy behind the bar we couldn't even see and some.

556
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
There were two parties were both all the way in the back.

557
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
No one's at the bar when we walked in someone was clearly finishing up day drinking at the bar.

558
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Okay.

559
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Imagine look around in the in the room here imagine every single thing was an anthropomorphic character every single every single object possible can talk to you and will talk to you and I kept on saying these things used to talk but they probably don't anymore and then every 10 minutes a new thing would talk.

560
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Hey I'm Mr. Projector.

561
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Hey there.

562
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:55,000
But we're sitting all the way in the back and at some point there's some extended comedy routine happening towards the front and like an employee comes out and they're like it's a thing behind the bar none of you can see it.

563
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Did it feel like there was so much going on at a certain point that they were making fun of you.

564
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:18,000
We should also say this is the other this is the reason I'm I'm sorry you couldn't chase it but I feel like very often Scott and Mike pitch things where they're like you should be walk around Austin Powers in Universal Osaka.

565
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Universal Singapore yeah.

566
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Sure.

567
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
You should play Ruben Kincaid or whatever.

568
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
You're like you parts right.

569
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Yeah Ruben Kincaid.

570
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Partridge family character Ruben Kincaid.

571
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
That one does need Cliff Notes.

572
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Yes anyway.

573
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
You know you know a big part of the Jekyll and Hyde and I thought this would have gone by the wayside.

574
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Is that not your servers who are just normal people explaining things on the menu to you explaining that they have not had souvenir glasses since the pandemic.

575
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Despite how much you are willing to pay the up charge.

576
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Please I'm begging you.

577
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Grab something off the wall and fill it up.

578
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Give it to me.

579
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:09,000
They have like walk around characters doing bits and it was one guy just ping ponging between the two parties there for two hours.

580
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
There are six people in the restaurant and God bless him.

581
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
He had to work with all of us.

582
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:25,000
But you would have had a fucking field day with the confines that this performer had to work with where it's like can you be generically spooky.

583
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
But funny.

584
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Yes.

585
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
He had a puppet cat.

586
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
He had a puppet.

587
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
He didn't use the puppet a lot.

588
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Lost that through line.

589
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Little puppet little puppet work I could have done with a little more puppet.

590
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
He had a face mask on which he joked allowed him to be a ventriloquist.

591
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Yes.

592
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Which is a good bit.

593
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Pretty good.

594
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Yeah I like that.

595
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
By the way we love this place.

596
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Everyone get there.

597
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Love it.

598
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I looked this place up when it came up in conversation a couple of weeks ago and the big thing on the website is like and of course you can prepay now fifty dollars for your prefix meal and entertainment.

599
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And I was just like what wait what is it because Griffin you were kind of like oh just pop in get a drink or stuff and I'm like they're making it sound like this is a full day.

600
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Like they're like trying to get your money before you walk in the door probably to pay their utility bills the way things are going.

601
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Right.

602
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Because they asked us they were like did you guys reserve a package and we were like no and they were like okay fine.

603
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Like there was no you've done this wrong.

604
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
There was a like oh we'll get as much money as you give us today.

605
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I don't mean to move on from from Jekyll and Hyde but just in the interest of like what you were saying Jason.

606
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Yeah.

607
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Odd things that are being pitched is what you guys are good the good boys are going to be in New York.

608
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
There's stuff that you got to you got to try and do.

609
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
And one of the big things that you were pitching us was the the American Dream Mall.

610
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Which which we did an epic show in New York.

611
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Which which we did an episode about and people here know it for sure but it's this bizarre it's this massive indoor mall that has a there's a water park and a Nickelodeon park and a Lego thing and angry birds with mini golf.

612
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It's so insane.

613
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
It's way off in Jersey.

614
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:43,000
About that Griffin's pitch to us was that like it's even worse in person and it's really hard to get to.

615
00:49:48,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Which is how which is what we discussed in trying to figure it just like you know of course that would be interesting and funny but logistically it just seems so difficult and insane and how are we get anyway I went I did it.

616
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
American Dream.

617
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
You guys didn't know.

618
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I lived the American Dream.

619
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:32,000
For the audience at home this is me in front of the Statue of Liberty not the one you're thinking of.

620
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:40,000
The one made of jelly beans at the three story it's sugar I went guys I went.

621
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Needed to keep that to Griffin and Jason didn't know.

622
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Mike I had to tell for slide purposes.

623
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
There was so much discussion of Scott was like I have a secret I'm not sure if I should tell you.

624
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I think I have to because you have to put it in your iPad but like I don't want like let's keep it from days like it was a negotiation.

625
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Every 10 minutes you guys would come backstage and go.

626
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Jason Griffin if you want to come out now you can.

627
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
But I would send it while we were doing.

628
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
But now.

629
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Jason go to the back.

630
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
You can't.

631
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
You cannot.

632
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
You cannot see this picture of me in front of a jelly bean statue.

633
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
That'll ruin everything.

634
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
For the next five minutes if you want to rock around but then five minutes after that you cannot see what's happening.

635
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Precious materials.

636
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Well did you sample something at the Oreo Cafe you haven't shut up.

637
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Oh yeah I know I actually I did not though I took a photo under it's a giant Oreo on top of the ceiling which feels like maybe similar to that giant record.

638
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I mean what.

639
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Wait I forget what slides I have.

640
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
What else do you want me to change them.

641
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Well yeah yeah sure.

642
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
What's next.

643
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Oh there's me.

644
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
It's just me chilling with Jelly Belly.

645
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Is that who is that.

646
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Is that like the official Jelly Belly mascot.

647
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
It's amazing we don't know off hand.

648
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Is the character's name Jelly Belly.

649
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Is he the titular role.

650
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Yeah he is.

651
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I feel like you don't know.

652
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I feel like people don't.

653
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I feel like they're guessing that his name is Jelly Belly.

654
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Throw in whatever round.

655
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Is that a jelly bean on his head.

656
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Jelly bean shaped chef's hat.

657
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
What is it.

658
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
It's a taupe.

659
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
It's a jelly bean taupe.

660
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
It's a jelly.

661
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Whatever way it looks excellent in person.

662
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
It's a jelly bean shaped chef's hat.

663
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
It's a jelly bean shaped chef's hat.

664
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
It's a jelly bean shaped chef's hat.

665
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Whatever way it looks excellent in person.

666
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
It smelled great too.

667
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
So let me.

668
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Okay in terms of what.

669
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Let me say.

670
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
So getting there involved.

671
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
All I had to do was walk a mile and a half from the hotel.

672
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
To.

673
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I ignored the bus instructions were so crazy.

674
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
The transit.

675
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I cannot compute it.

676
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
It went so long.

677
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
There's people in the front row who know.

678
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I'm so.

679
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Speaking of the converted here.

680
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

681
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Yes.

682
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
And then I ended up on a fairy which was delightful.

683
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I loved being on the fairy.

684
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
The wind blowing through my hair.

685
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Beautiful views.

686
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
And then I got in and I'm hanging with Mr. Jelly Belly.

687
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I'm having a good time.

688
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And I'm starting to think.

689
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
With this thing.

690
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
With this narrative that's been woven.

691
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
That like oh it's so crazy to get to.

692
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Who would.

693
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I'm starting to think like.

694
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I think.

695
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
That I.

696
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I think that the others are the fools.

697
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And I am the one having a dream of a day.

698
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
At the American Dream Mall.

699
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
What's next?

700
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Oh this is now.

701
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Unfortunately I was one day off.

702
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
From the American Dream Presents.

703
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
DJ Polly D's.

704
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Amusement Park Takeover.

705
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Did anybody hear go?

706
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Is that possible?

707
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I guess not.

708
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Oh my god.

709
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Somebody was there over here.

710
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
That's incredible.

711
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
And I think there's one more.

712
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Okay oh that's me in front of the non-functioning indoor ski slope.

713
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
The massive.

714
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Smell like.

715
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Now Griffey you know this.

716
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
You went.

717
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
So you know a lot of these things.

718
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Yeah.

719
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Just to clarify.

720
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
So I.

721
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I texted you guys.

722
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I guess.

723
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
We booked a New York show.

724
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Do you want to be a guest?

725
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I said yeah what's the theme?

726
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
He said we don't know.

727
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
And then I went to the American Dream.

728
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
And I texted you guys and I went look.

729
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I don't want to force you.

730
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I just want to say.

731
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I went to the American Dream Mall today.

732
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
It is terrible.

733
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
So bad.

734
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
We know.

735
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I said I think you might want the New York Live show to be about that.

736
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
And Jason I believe responded.

737
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
We've already done an episode on the American Dream Mall.

738
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
And I said yes I know.

739
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
But you haven't done a saga.

740
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I sensed the hesitation.

741
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Jason asked how easy is it to get there.

742
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I said incredibly difficult.

743
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
His salesmanship was so on point.

744
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Right.

745
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And the subject was dropped.

746
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I was not really aware of it until your episode.

747
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Despite it.

748
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Despite being here on the East Coast.

749
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I guess I'd heard word it's been fucking three decades.

750
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Yeah.

751
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Passing a shadow.

752
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Getting going forever and then it finally opens and then pandemic hits.

753
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
The place you'd least want to be.

754
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
What bad luck for a place.

755
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
An operation that had otherwise done everything right up until that point.

756
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
To just get foiled at the last possible moment.

757
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:45,000
How could an indoor ski slope not become a vibrant part of the New Jersey atmosphere.

758
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
What was that?

759
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
There's the sports arena that's right next to it that I forget the name of.

760
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Yeah.

761
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
It's over by where the Mets play.

762
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I saw a concert.

763
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
No.

764
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
The Jets.

765
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Shit.

766
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I'm fucking idiot.

767
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
But it's Met Life.

768
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I thought it was Met.

769
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Met City Field.

770
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Get him.

771
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Right?

772
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I don't know.

773
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I don't know sports or any of many other things.

774
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I like that you're getting booed even though I'm the one who said.

775
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Did some sports thing happen?

776
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I took a stab and I fell off a cliff.

777
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
My friend and I went to a concert there over last summer.

778
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I was texting you guys photos and I was like fuck now that I'm on the outside of it I need to go.

779
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:42,000
And I had a friend who is a podcast the ride listener who was like my sister and her girlfriend are coming into the city.

780
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
We're going to go to the Nickelodeon theme park at American Dream.

781
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Do you want to go?

782
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I was like I absolutely have to go.

783
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
That was the explicit purpose of the trip.

784
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
And then we wandered around a little bit.

785
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I feel like we covered 5% of it in total.

786
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
It's so big.

787
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
It's so big.

788
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,000
And it has that weird casino feeling where there's no natural light.

789
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
There's no windows.

790
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
There's no air.

791
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
They're pumping things in there.

792
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
You go down court you have no sense of orientation.

793
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
There are no maps anywhere.

794
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
So easy to get lost.

795
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
It's not a loop.

796
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Where the hell do you come in and out?

797
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,000
But there's no mall style guide maps where it's like you are here here's where anything is.

798
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
They want you to feel like you just have to succumb to this thing.

799
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Well, which.

800
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Here's what happened to me.

801
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
You said we haven't done a saga.

802
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
But I think I did do a saga.

803
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
So at this point in time I'm like wow I saw the ski slope.

804
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
And I saw the fake fireplace right next to it.

805
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I've had a wonderful day.

806
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
This is great.

807
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Now I will just call the Lyft to get out of here.

808
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
You guys might know.

809
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,000
So I call and so I get on Lyft and it says all right go to spot A.

810
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
All right. Sounds good.

811
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Sounds organized.

812
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I go to spot A.

813
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
It is not a place where cars are even near.

814
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,000
The Lyft guy is like circling around and in different parts and now he's like across the river.

815
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
And then eventually just says I can't find you by.

816
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Bails.

817
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I lose 15 minutes.

818
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
So I'm like OK why don't I go to a way opposite pickup spot.

819
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I will go to D.

820
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I ask a guy in D who works there.

821
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Is this a pickup spot?

822
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
He says no.

823
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
You got to go back to A.

824
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Like I don't have time for that.

825
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I've already done.

826
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
It's like a mile away.

827
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
My feet are already they're killing me already and I'm losing battery.

828
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I have to call this guy right now.

829
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I call a guy and he again lots of text back and forth.

830
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Sorry I can't find you bail.

831
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:43,000
So now I'm like OK I need to try some other tactic and I see that there is a bus station.

832
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:49,000
So I go to the bus station which is that somehow another opposite end of the mall that I have not been to yet.

833
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I go to the bus station.

834
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
It's the single saddest place I've been to in months.

835
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Miserable desolate.

836
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
The weather was pretty bad at that moment.

837
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
It's just getting drippy.

838
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
What brought me here.

839
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
This is so crazy.

840
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I bought a nine dollar bus ticket.

841
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Then it looks all right.

842
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
When is it coming.

843
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I saw I pulled up a website that had just a blank white screen.

844
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
There was no bus that day.

845
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I text my wife even though the phone is straight because I feel like I need to let her know that my life is in peril now.

846
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
She says oh no are you going to have to sleep at the mall tonight.

847
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Hang tight on that.

848
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I'm going to try some some other plans and I realize OK what I need to do is find a landmark that is not this mall.

849
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
What's the nearest thing.

850
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:51,000
The nearest thing is a Valero gas station 15 minutes away miles away and there is no sidewalk to get me there.

851
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
So I'm going to get mowed over by a car if I even try.

852
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:03,000
So now all of this has brought me to now I'm in the corner of the parking lot of an arena that they don't use anymore.

853
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I think it was the IZOD Center.

854
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I'm not going to try to guess who played there.

855
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Lesson learned.

856
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
But it is just this like just this empty parking lot.

857
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I am getting so I am losing hope.

858
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Like I left my family to do this.

859
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
What have I done.

860
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
But I'm like well maybe I'll just go to the mall.

861
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:30,000
But I'm like well maybe someone will be nice enough to get me from the corner of the parking lot of the abandoned arena.

862
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And then I get on lift and it says please proceed back to the American Dream Mall.

863
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Like I am being pulled back as if by a giant magnet.

864
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I don't know what to do.

865
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I eventually roll the dice.

866
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Maybe I will try going back to spot a.

867
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I call a guy who fiddles around for 15 minutes and then says sorry I can't find you.

868
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
And I said listen. Listen to me.

869
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I have lost two drivers today.

870
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
And I will be god damned if I am going to lose a third.

871
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
You have to work with me here.

872
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
And sure enough that was enough.

873
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Like my story reached through the phone and he tried a little harder.

874
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
And the guy did find me.

875
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
And I was so.

876
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Thank you sir.

877
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Tried to tip big.

878
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
You saved my life.

879
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Jesus Christ.

880
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Some total.

881
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
From first trying to call a lift to the end of this process.

882
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Two hours.

883
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Not even being home.

884
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Being in the lift.

885
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Two hours.

886
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Thus I am driving away.

887
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
And my sentiment is.

888
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Fuck the American Dream.

889
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Fuck the American Dream.

890
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Thank you.

891
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
That is my one man show about American Dream lift.

892
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Scott I don't want to make you feel bad.

893
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I am a native New Yorker.

894
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I am not a Jersey guy but it is close enough.

895
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I understand how things work here.

896
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I approached getting back home slightly differently than you.

897
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
And just for next time I want to give you some advice on what worked for me.

898
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Next time.

899
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Okay.

900
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I opened up lift.

901
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
It said go to zone A.

902
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I booked a car.

903
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:31,000
And then this was so easy all I had to do was wait two full hours.

904
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
That's worth another two hours.

905
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I had the same amount of time.

906
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
The only difference is I stayed in one fucking place.

907
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
The only thing I did different was stay put.

908
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
It didn't make it longer or shorter.

909
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I swear to God two fucking hours.

910
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Did you guys just become best friends?

911
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Yup.

912
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
After what we survived.

913
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Two hours.

914
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
After what we've been through.

915
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Two hours.

916
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Also every fucking ride.

917
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I texted you guys this at the time.

918
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Every single ride at the Nickelodeon theme park hurt.

919
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Every single one hurt.

920
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I was like this is like on cartoon shows when they make fun of Disney World.

921
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
The joke is the ride has a hammer that hits you.

922
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Every single one of them was miscalibrated and hurt.

923
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Did you do the shell raiser?

924
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I could.

925
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I tapped out at that point.

926
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
It was I'm sorry.

927
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,000
It was the last thing of the day and I truly went if I go on that I'm going to vomit.

928
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
And not even from like nausea but exhaustion.

929
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Well, well, well.

930
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
It seems like the moral of this story is Jason was right once again.

931
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Don't encourage that.

932
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
No more cheering.

933
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
No.

934
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Stop your cheering.

935
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Don't get louder.

936
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Now you're ready.

937
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
There's going to be an Andrew Sisters month soon.

938
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
And it's all your fault for that cheer.

939
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
No, don't cheer that either.

940
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Man.

941
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
The potential episodes are just falling into our lap tonight.

942
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
The Blues Brothers 2000 video game.

943
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Jelly Bean the Jelly Bean.

944
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
The dulcet tones of the Andrew Sisters.

945
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
You're free waters.

946
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Free waters the episode.

947
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Yeah.

948
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
But here.

949
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Okay.

950
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Now after all that, after this craziness, we have covered a lot.

951
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:37,000
We've covered a lot of New York stupidity and yet we have not made it somehow to what was intended to be the primary topic of the evening.

952
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:43,000
And just think on what has not been name checked in terms of immersive in terms of taking you to a place.

953
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:53,000
And in terms of timelines, I was saying there was a rise and fall of themed entertainment restaurants that by the late 90s there were articles saying like this was an experiment and it didn't work.

954
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
They're all falling under.

955
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Planet Hollywood is compressing.

956
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:07,000
And only one 15 million dollar investment had the courage to place their chips down on the table in 1998 and go let's get all the gettings good.

957
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Now's the time to start.

958
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Would you like to do the honors and say the name of this establishment?

959
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
It's less of a name and more of a place and.

960
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
And yeah, and here's the twist.

961
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
A time.

962
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Ladies and gentlemen, Mars.

963
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Weird.

964
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Weird.

965
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Let's see.

966
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Let's see a sight of this place.

967
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Oh, what a thing we have here.

968
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Let's see the beautiful.

969
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Wow.

970
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Oh.

971
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Look at that watermark.

972
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Weird, sunken below whatever cozy is.

973
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
There's a McDonald's.

974
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
You can see the McDonald's.

975
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Oh yeah, cozy is Bagels.

976
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Squiggles, yeah.

977
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Oh yes, yeah.

978
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Squiggles.

979
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Yeah.

980
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
So, um.

981
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:22,000
This is, this establishment was 35,000 square feet.

982
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Massive establishment.

983
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I think it had the record for being the largest themed restaurant in the world.

984
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Wow.

985
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,000
At the time it opened, which is when the bubble had already burst.

986
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Uh huh.

987
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Should we, should we show the video?

988
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Oh yes, let's see how the world.

989
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Oh wait, yes, Jason.

990
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,000
In case you are at this show and don't know what we're talking about, which I find unlikely.

991
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Here we go.

992
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Weird Mars themed restaurant.

993
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Now, pay close attention to the food.

994
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Ah.

995
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Take your family to a whole new world.

996
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
A wormhole just opened up.

997
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Uh, we're trying to enjoy Martian cuisine.

998
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
This is my favorite genre of music as well.

999
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Yo, what?

1000
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
That looks very good.

1001
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Oh.

1002
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,000
A stressed out Martian waitress.

1003
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Or a drink at the Star Bar.

1004
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Start now.

1005
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Oh, this looks good.

1006
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Okay.

1007
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Oh yeah.

1008
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Wait, the drink was like dirty.

1009
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
It was a little silver fish.

1010
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
All the food is dirty.

1011
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Go home with an alien woman.

1012
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Dancing with an alien.

1013
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Hmmmm.

1014
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,080
This is the garage I mean.

1015
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:49,800
Fake shredder is happy with what he's seeing.

1016
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,160
Wow, Mars 2112.

1017
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:57,160
Don't know.

1018
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:02,360
Football, opening of Tomorrow, Friday, Christmas.

1019
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:06,080
You know, if I could just bring up.

1020
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:11,160
Of course Disneyland had a visionary behind it, Walt Disney.

1021
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:14,600
Mars 2112 had a visionary behind it too.

1022
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:19,880
A man by the name of Pascal Phelan.

1023
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:24,400
The Irish Farmers Journal.

1024
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,280
That is something you already subscribed to.

1025
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:27,280
Well.

1026
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:30,360
Oh, you've never read the Irish Farmers Journal before?

1027
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,920
Zero paywall problems there for Jason.

1028
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:33,920
Yeah.

1029
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,680
Where do you think I got this information from?

1030
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:44,200
The Irish Farmers Journal referred to him as a former beef baron.

1031
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:49,560
Something I also refer to you as.

1032
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:57,400
The New York Observer referred to him as an Irish businessman chased by fraud allegations.

1033
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:08,480
If you Google this man now, you find out he works in, let's all say it at once, the solar

1034
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:14,560
energy industry of South Africa.

1035
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,800
So yeah.

1036
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,880
I mean it's just a straight line, right?

1037
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,800
Like all of that adds up, right?

1038
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,880
He was in the meat industry in Ireland.

1039
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:26,280
He got into like dining.

1040
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,520
He got into luxury hotels.

1041
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:30,800
And then you end up in the solar energy industry.

1042
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,680
I mean that's good, right?

1043
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:34,680
Yeah.

1044
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,680
That's an American dream.

1045
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:39,760
I found this quote from him, I think it was in a New York Times article about when this

1046
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:40,760
place was opening.

1047
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:45,440
And there had been a lot of recent closures or a lot of these places that were on sort

1048
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,320
of shaky legs at that point.

1049
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:54,520
And they said, are you worried at all about spending $15 million to build this subterranean

1050
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:55,520
theme restaurant?

1051
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,800
And he said, no, because here's the difference.

1052
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,440
I don't view this as a theme restaurant.

1053
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:03,240
I view this as like a destination.

1054
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,760
It's tourism.

1055
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,720
It's travel.

1056
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:07,720
We don't have a theme.

1057
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:11,160
We have a location that we are transporting people to.

1058
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,160
Wow.

1059
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:13,160
Yep.

1060
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:17,840
He said, it's the fusion of fun, good food and fantasy.

1061
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,400
Normal human talk.

1062
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,200
Just regular speak like we do.

1063
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:27,160
Now we're coming hot off of Celebrary, which I enjoyed greatly.

1064
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,160
Thank you.

1065
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,160
Thank you.

1066
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,160
Thank you.

1067
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,160
Thank you.

1068
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:38,600
I do find in all of those episodes and then reading some of these articles for this restaurant,

1069
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:43,600
it is funny how much these guys, when they're hyping up their restaurants, always say, good

1070
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,600
food.

1071
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,280
Part of our formula.

1072
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,280
Entertainment.

1073
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,280
Memorabilia.

1074
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:49,280
Space.

1075
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,960
And good food.

1076
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:55,080
They always try to sell it like that's where, and the food is going to be good.

1077
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,880
That's not-

1078
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,360
We know what you're thinking.

1079
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,360
Right.

1080
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,080
That the food is going to be dog shit.

1081
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,080
Right.

1082
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,080
No, no.

1083
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,080
Oh, a portrayer.

1084
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,080
Yeah.

1085
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,080
Oh no.

1086
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:11,600
It's like, I do have a girlfriend.

1087
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,360
I know what you're thinking.

1088
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:17,920
Another thing this guy said, he called this place Disneyland with dining.

1089
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:18,920
Which-

1090
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:22,280
Ah, that famous thing Disneyland is missing.

1091
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,280
Oh yeah.

1092
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,880
It's the big bummer about the place.

1093
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:29,120
One iota of food anyway.

1094
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,080
So he was right about one thing though.

1095
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:38,120
It is no mere themed restaurant because you don't just walk in a door and find yourself

1096
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,420
in Mars and the craters of Mars.

1097
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:42,280
There is a pre-step.

1098
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:46,920
Which is, well, first that you are issued Mars Federation visas.

1099
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:53,920
Families love logistical management.

1100
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,600
I mean, that kids just go crazy for-

1101
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:02,000
I mean everyone on this stage would go, like as a little kid, would be like, oh Mars feeds

1102
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
us.

1103
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:08,360
You need your social security cards, you need the vax cards, what else can we show you?

1104
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,440
This was the threshold though where I went.

1105
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:14,120
This is the restaurant I had been waiting for my entire life.

1106
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:17,840
I think I had two successive birthday parties there.

1107
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:18,840
Wow.

1108
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,800
Consecutive birthday parties there.

1109
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:27,760
But the thing I loved was that the outside of the restaurant did not betray.

1110
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,560
Outside of the, there's the model of the ship.

1111
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:35,560
They were just like, we are selling this from the outside as an airport.

1112
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,480
Oh, okay.

1113
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:42,480
And it very much looked like, like Delta check-in desk, but a little more silver, a little more

1114
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,520
futuristic.

1115
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,880
And you go and they say, how big is your party?

1116
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,880
And they hand you the visas and they go like, we think we can get you on a flight in 10

1117
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:50,880
minutes.

1118
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:51,880
There was the question.

1119
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:52,880
Yeah, we think?

1120
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:53,880
That's cool.

1121
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:54,880
I like that actually.

1122
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:55,880
That was the host.

1123
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:01,880
That was the host of the restaurant is at the desk acting like they're an employee of

1124
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:04,080
the airline that's going to take you to Mars.

1125
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,320
And you can't see the restaurant at that point.

1126
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:14,320
So not just visas, but you are technically flying intergalactically on standby.

1127
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,320
Yes.

1128
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:20,320
We'll see if there's some jump seats available.

1129
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:25,600
Normally that's just for other flight crew, but we'll see what we can do.

1130
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:32,720
Once a visa has been secured, you then enter, well, it's a ride.

1131
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:36,760
There is a little ride experience before you, a little simulator ride.

1132
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:44,200
This restaurant essentially asked you to just do a quick star tours before you eat.

1133
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:50,200
And it was the same kind of thing where there's like the pre, the boarding safety video.

1134
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:55,200
Like it was all that sort of theater of it.

1135
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:59,200
You need to, I'm happy you could tell us these things because there's lots of odd videos

1136
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,200
of the place, but the ride is not well documented whatsoever.

1137
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,200
Okay, here's why.

1138
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,200
Here's why.

1139
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,200
There's a very good reason.

1140
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,400
This restaurant opens in 1998.

1141
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,400
It tragically closed.

1142
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,400
Preach.

1143
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:16,400
Finally, someone's admitting it.

1144
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:26,400
It tragically closed in 2012, just 100 years short of its predicted date.

1145
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:31,400
I just want to, I want to clearly say 2008, I'm sorry, 1998 is here, right?

1146
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,400
2012 is here.

1147
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:34,400
Yeah.

1148
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:37,600
There's a thing that happens closer to here than here.

1149
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,600
To point A, yes.

1150
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:39,600
Yes.

1151
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:45,600
And there's a thing that, the restaurant had, I think a robust couple of years and then

1152
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,600
filed for bankruptcy like four times before it finally closed.

1153
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:49,600
Wow.

1154
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,600
And they always said they never recovered from 9-11.

1155
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,520
Like it was like New York tourism, Times Square, they just never recovered.

1156
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:01,640
It was too big of an insurmountable thing for them to work through, right?

1157
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:04,880
But I think the other part of this is, in order to go into the restaurant, you get into

1158
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:08,920
this ride, a thing in 1998 seems like the coolest fucking shit in the world, and the

1159
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:13,640
ride is you're at like the starport and it takes off and you're going through the New

1160
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:17,040
York City skyline and then you go straight to Mars, right?

1161
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:21,040
An important part of this ride was that you almost hit the Twin Towers.

1162
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,040
Oh, Jesus.

1163
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:27,040
Like a story beat.

1164
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:34,240
There's not like a clear Rex-like character, but you have the energy of like, oh no, and

1165
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:37,240
you like swerve and you barely miss them.

1166
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:38,240
Wait, wait.

1167
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:48,240
It stayed open for 11 years after the tragic attacks and you would just have to, in order

1168
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:57,940
to eat a shitty pizza, feel like you were almost knocking down the towers yourself.

1169
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:02,340
I think that is why there is no evidence of this ride.

1170
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:03,540
You cannot watch the video.

1171
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:04,580
They never updated it.

1172
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:05,580
They never changed it.

1173
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:08,840
Well, you know, simulator ride, it's not like you can change it or update it.

1174
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:12,960
You can't just swap something out of a simulator ride.

1175
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:17,440
So it was exactly like Race from New York, but with the Twin Towers.

1176
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,640
Correct.

1177
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:19,640
Correct.

1178
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:20,640
Got it.

1179
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,640
And this is the other problem.

1180
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:26,140
As the restaurants were degraded, money wasn't coming through the door and they had to like

1181
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:27,580
scale things back.

1182
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:30,560
At some point, the ride stopped moving.

1183
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:34,200
And so when ordered again to the restaurant, you just, you went through now probably a

1184
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,740
sped up version of the ritual.

1185
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:36,740
How many?

1186
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:37,740
Okay, just getting the ride.

1187
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:42,140
And then they put you through there and then you just sat in a motionless box.

1188
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:43,140
So they-

1189
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,140
Why'd you still have to sit?

1190
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:47,840
And you still had to watch the fucking thing.

1191
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:48,840
At that point-

1192
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:50,440
They created a perfect juncture.

1193
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,440
The ride died.

1194
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,440
Anything.

1195
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:56,740
Put anything else up on that screen.

1196
01:16:56,740 --> 01:17:00,840
And yet they were so, I don't know, the animation, the pixels.

1197
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,960
Now, I went there enough as a kid that I was always fascinated.

1198
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:10,640
They had like, they were like, there's an express terminal for people with heart conditions

1199
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,720
or like pregnant people.

1200
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:16,520
They'd always say, and at one point I said to my dad, we gotta tell them we have heart

1201
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:17,520
conditions.

1202
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,520
I gotta see what this-

1203
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,020
You gotta see all the versions of the experience.

1204
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:25,820
Right, it was essentially like a single rider line where they're like, you don't go through

1205
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:28,220
the fun part, you go through the quick part.

1206
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:34,340
But I was like, they must be a unique experience for the people who are deprived of this fun

1207
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:35,740
motion simulator ride.

1208
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:39,780
My memory is they opened up a door, there was a hallway about the length of this stage.

1209
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:46,480
It had like, light, sort of like pinpoint through velvet stars.

1210
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:53,580
And then they opened the door on the other side and they went, welcome to Mars.

1211
01:17:53,580 --> 01:18:00,540
And that was the only alternative to watching motionless, sitting captive in a box and watching

1212
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:02,280
the Twin Towers almost get-

1213
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,160
Reliving the day.

1214
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:07,080
That's one way to never forget.

1215
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:14,380
Don't know why our business just tanked the moment.

1216
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:17,380
9-11 happened, we've never recovered.

1217
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:24,380
People don't want to watch themselves feel like they're part of, in some way complicit,

1218
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:25,580
and then eat calamari.

1219
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:27,980
What's the problem here?

1220
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:31,380
It's a happy story, it's an alternate universe where it didn't happen.

1221
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:33,980
You missed it by this much.

1222
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:36,980
You travel to Mars in the no-9-11 dimension.

1223
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:38,780
Like the cooler thing to do.

1224
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:42,580
It's like the end of one of the newer Tarantino movies.

1225
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:46,580
History has changed and instead you go to Mars and it's fun.

1226
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:48,780
And you eat a really gross cheesecake.

1227
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:51,780
Did he ghost-write, did Quentin ghost-write the rest?

1228
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:56,780
What if the 10th and final film is Mars 2112?

1229
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,280
He thought about doing Star Trek.

1230
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:07,280
Yeah, that's true, but he should do his own Mars 2112, which I guess, that restaurant guys actually.

1231
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:10,280
He misspelled Mars, he put two A's in it.

1232
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:13,280
Yeah, it's a creative stroke or whatever he says.

1233
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:16,280
That simulator ride's still going.

1234
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:23,280
Does everyone remember the first Sam Raimi Spider-Man movie had the trailer where the web between the twin towers?

1235
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:34,280
That playing that long, over and over after the events happened, that he's sort of like if they realized this trailer was in theaters and went,

1236
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:38,280
well we gotta keep showing it and we gotta show it more.

1237
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:45,280
Not only that, if they like never even released the movie, they just kept playing only the trailer.

1238
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:49,280
Do you remember when you went in first, like it didn't work?

1239
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,280
No, it worked perfectly when I went in first.

1240
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:55,280
We went really close to the opening.

1241
01:19:55,280 --> 01:20:02,280
But like do you remember the sad, the day disappointment of my friend the simulator has seen better days?

1242
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:12,280
I feel like those first three pre-911 years, or should I say before the Innocence died, was when I was going there the most.

1243
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:17,280
And then I think from 2001 to 2012, I probably only went twice.

1244
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:22,280
I went once with friends from out of town who were like, this thing's funny, and I was like a teenager.

1245
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:26,280
I was like, yeah, I have no sincere investment in this.

1246
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:35,280
And then my sister, so that was maybe like 2005, 2006 maybe I went.

1247
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:41,280
And then my, I have a sister who's much younger, and in 2007 I was going off to college and my mom was like,

1248
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:45,280
you should spend a day with your sister before you move cross country to go to college.

1249
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:50,280
I think you will absolutely last all four years though.

1250
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,280
We assume you will never come back ever again.

1251
01:20:53,280 --> 01:21:01,280
You're not going to be someone who moves back to New York and becomes some sort of stock and trade New York expert on live podcast shows.

1252
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:08,280
But so I took my sister and that was maybe a year or two.

1253
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,280
Well, no, it's 2007, so we're only close a couple years after that.

1254
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:16,280
Huh. I'm wondering if the time I went ironically, ironically with friends was after that.

1255
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:18,280
Those were the two times I went.

1256
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:22,280
There was a gap between 2001 and 2007 where I didn't go.

1257
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:25,280
And from that point on, it was, everything was in shambles.

1258
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,280
And it was like the video was standard deaf.

1259
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:31,280
It was like scratchy. The thing didn't move.

1260
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:39,280
You could like see exposed like drywall in the caves of Mars and the costumes were like a little ramshackle and people were like,

1261
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:44,280
Oh, wow. I was just going to say like, cause those costumes in that video look so good.

1262
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:49,280
That must have been such a bummer to see them look like shit.

1263
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,280
Oh, they look perfect. Oh, so sad.

1264
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:59,280
It did feel like at that point, like to his credit, like the guy who was doing the walk around entertainment at Jekyll and Hyde today,

1265
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,280
like was really going for it.

1266
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,280
Yeah, that's great. Yeah.

1267
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:06,280
He did break character a couple of times to ask us where we were doing our show tonight.

1268
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:09,280
Yeah. See here. Jekyll and Hyde guy.

1269
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,280
So very hip.

1270
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:13,280
Yeah.

1271
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:21,280
But the Mars 2112 people, I felt like by post 9 11, they were not even maintaining the illusion,

1272
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:28,280
whether it was sort of the walk around characters or like even your server still were supposed to act like they were on Mars.

1273
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:31,280
Well, it seems like a component of this thing.

1274
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:40,280
I like the videos of it are not great, but it seemed to me that there was a component of like teaching you Mars language.

1275
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:47,280
And I believe that the let me rifle through the notes because this word did not stick in my head.

1276
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:52,280
OK, I believe that the Martian way to say goodbye is Vabineau.

1277
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:55,280
Vabineau.

1278
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,280
Vabineau.

1279
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,280
Vabineau.

1280
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,280
Vabineau.

1281
01:22:58,280 --> 01:22:59,280
Let's all learn it together.

1282
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,280
Vabineau.

1283
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:02,280
Vabineau.

1284
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:03,280
Vabineau.

1285
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:06,280
Vabineau. Great. New intrusive thought just dropped.

1286
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,280
Very good.

1287
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,280
Very good.

1288
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,280
Vabineau.

1289
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:22,280
And yes, there goes another childhood friend's name and all our happy memories out of the head, replaced by Vabineau.

1290
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:29,280
I feel like you guys talk about this a lot whenever there's like new attractions at Universal or Disney,

1291
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:35,280
and they talk about like, and every cast member is going to do this and every time it's going to be unique and this and that.

1292
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:40,280
And then very quickly, like the standards drop and you're like getting this sort of off the shelf experience.

1293
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:45,280
Patrick Page is going to do a show here for everyone and then it turns into, hey, whatever.

1294
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,280
Same thing. Same exact thing.

1295
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:52,280
Same thing. It did feel like there was a year or two where they were really going for it.

1296
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:57,280
And the problem with this place was it was so fucking big.

1297
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:03,280
And they were so like, committed to this internal logic of you have traveled there.

1298
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,280
This isn't a place with memorabilia.

1299
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:18,280
You are fully going off planet that when anything slipped, it was just like a really kind of sad admission of like wary Martian servers looking at you and going like, how much do you want me to do?

1300
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:20,280
Like, what are we?

1301
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:25,280
And one of the big things was like the place was so big and it was underground.

1302
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,280
You can pull up a picture of the interior.

1303
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:28,280
We haven't. Oh, yeah.

1304
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:29,280
Let's look at the craters.

1305
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:30,280
Look. Oh, my God.

1306
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:31,280
Massive.

1307
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:34,280
So there's the Crystal Crater three stories high.

1308
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,280
This is invisible here.

1309
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:41,280
But right there was like screens there where they would show sort of just like space views.

1310
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:46,280
But another thing was they would have like built into the wall these like plastic bubbles.

1311
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:54,280
And one of the things when it opened, because a weird thing about this place was they also were like, this is such a big investment that adults have to like it.

1312
01:24:55,280 --> 01:25:01,280
And that video sort of shows they wanted people like going there after work for happy hour.

1313
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:02,280
Right. There's a lot of like business.

1314
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:05,280
That dad was dancing with one of the alien ladies.

1315
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:06,280
That's the other thing.

1316
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:09,280
So they were like, everyone seemed so comfortable.

1317
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:12,280
The line they kept on saying and all of the press.

1318
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:18,280
And I remember my dad when he was explaining to his friends like I had to take the boys this fucking thing this weekend.

1319
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,280
He was like, do you know about this place?

1320
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:24,280
They have Martian go go dancers, a term that meant nothing to me as a child.

1321
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:28,280
But they had I don't remember if they were like suspended from the ceiling or they were built into the wall.

1322
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:32,280
They're not visible from here, but there'd be like plastic bubbles and there would be women in full.

1323
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:33,280
Or maybe I don't know.

1324
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:34,280
I don't judge.

1325
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:38,280
There would be people, human beings, presumably not animals.

1326
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:42,280
But it could have been a bear in a costume.

1327
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,280
It could have.

1328
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:49,280
But inside like full sexy Martian costumes and they would just be dancing for hours on end.

1329
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:54,280
It wasn't like Jekyll and Hyde where it was like every 30 minutes, there'll be a little five minute thing.

1330
01:25:54,280 --> 01:26:04,280
There was just constant kinetic dancing in masks with like restricted the full body, fully covered, heavy plush suits.

1331
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:08,280
Like like so they would be like doing like the mashed potato.

1332
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,280
Like what kind of dancing are we talking about?

1333
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:14,280
Yeah, it felt like very like sort of laughing socket to me kind of.

1334
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:16,280
That's the mashed potato, right?

1335
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:20,280
Well, on Mars they call it the Glicklor Klapa.

1336
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:26,280
That was the first thing I remember going away.

1337
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:35,280
Like that was the first thing where it was like you might see a dancer for five minutes today versus they are constantly part of the firmament of this place.

1338
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:45,280
Well, they maybe started leaning knowing that, you know, people would struggle to dance while having their face restricted and inside a tube and underground.

1339
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:50,280
They maybe started realizing, well, maybe some we can lean on some of the some video content.

1340
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:55,280
There's a quick clip here I have of something called Mars News that would play.

1341
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:59,280
Families love news. Kids love news. They love visas.

1342
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:02,280
Finger on the pulse.

1343
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:12,280
Mars TV News.

1344
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,280
This is Mars TV News.

1345
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:25,280
Up to the second stories from around the galaxy and a special above on to viewers visiting from Earth.

1346
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:32,280
Thanks to Mars developed technology, we are now able to offer word perfect simultaneous translation.

1347
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:37,280
You know, everything that's happening on the planet just as it happens.

1348
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:41,280
So this week kind of bizarre.

1349
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,280
You can kill it. That's fine.

1350
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,280
Why? No, no, no, no.

1351
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:50,280
We're looking at like sub lawnmower man.

1352
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:53,280
Just true cyberpunk terror.

1353
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,280
Yeah, it looks like it looks like the show reboot.

1354
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,280
Big popper reboot.

1355
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,280
This is a tragedy on Earth today.

1356
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,280
This fateful day in September.

1357
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:10,280
This is more.

1358
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:16,280
This is like the kind of video that Scientology used to break Will Smith.

1359
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:21,280
This is what you want to know why he did it because he watched this for years.

1360
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:31,280
Also, I mean, I think this is confusing because it's like this is like prosthetic makeup on a human being.

1361
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,280
Yeah. Yeah.

1362
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:35,280
Everyone else is wearing sort of like mascot costumes.

1363
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,280
And she's in front of a big red button.

1364
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:38,280
Right.

1365
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:42,280
Right. She looks like more like a humanoid type character.

1366
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,280
So like maybe dad would have been more interested.

1367
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:45,280
Yeah.

1368
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:48,280
If she was around doing this.

1369
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:56,280
Well, this is what Scientologists ran in and played on their phone to calm Will Smith down last week.

1370
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,280
There there.

1371
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:01,280
There there.

1372
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,280
Do the exercise.

1373
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:04,280
There there.

1374
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:05,280
Do your hands.

1375
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,280
Do the hand movements.

1376
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:08,280
Calm down.

1377
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:15,280
Well, I mean, if you want to talk about Mars 2112 meets Illuminati.

1378
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:16,280
Mike, can you show?

1379
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:21,280
Now this has come up in a show before, but to jump ahead a little bit.

1380
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,280
The famous photo.

1381
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:24,280
I mean, if you know, you know.

1382
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:25,280
Yeah. Yeah.

1383
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:33,280
This is another member of the Clinton crime family revealed Captain O'Ryan.

1384
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:36,280
William Jefferson Clinton with Captain O'Ryan.

1385
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:42,280
Presumably discussing the idea of the possibility of setting up some kind of Lolita planet.

1386
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,280
Did you have to, Griffin, when you went.

1387
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,280
Did you have to put your name on the flight logs?

1388
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:51,280
Presumably discussing the idea of the possibility of setting up some kind of Lolita planet.

1389
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,280
Did you have to, Griffin, when you went.

1390
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,280
Did you have to put your name on the flight logs?

1391
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:14,280
It's all gonna come out in the wash.

1392
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:17,280
That's all getting, don't worry, that's gonna get covered up, don't worry.

1393
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,280
You know, you know.

1394
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:29,280
I think even as a kid, I like, both respected and felt disappointed by that Marseille in 12 had like specific proprietary characters.

1395
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:32,280
That they were like, this is Captain O'Ryan. There's the Queen character.

1396
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:35,280
Oh, what's the name? Empress Gloriana, I believe.

1397
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:41,280
They were like specific suits and they were like, these are Mickey and Minnie, you're only gonna see one of them on the floor at the time.

1398
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:47,280
We have merch in their likeness, but it didn't feel like there was any way to like learn about them.

1399
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,280
Like there was no narrative.

1400
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,280
Yeah, yeah.

1401
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:54,280
If you bought a toy, there was a tag on the toy.

1402
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:55,280
Right, okay.

1403
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:58,280
That explained the backstory.

1404
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:59,280
There's a toy.

1405
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,280
50 figure.

1406
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:03,280
In stock right now, $55.

1407
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:10,280
Yes, kind of across the board on eBay, you can have the whole crew for $55 apiece, buy it now.

1408
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:16,280
It looks, everything looks like it's so dirty.

1409
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:28,280
I mean, I always think it's one of my favorite, quietly one of my favorite moments across the entire run of podcast, The Ride, is the Hershey Park episode you did with Susser.

1410
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:35,280
And you're talking about the walk around candy characters and I think Susser makes some comment about how shitty they are.

1411
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,280
And you, Mike, said, I like them.

1412
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:42,280
And Susser, I believe, said, name one thing you like about them.

1413
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:48,280
And you said, and I just think about this all the time, you said, I like that they exist.

1414
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:52,280
And I feel this way about Captain Orion.

1415
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:55,280
Like I have no emotional attachment to this guy.

1416
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:59,280
As much as I love Mars 2112, there is no there there.

1417
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:03,280
The most characterization he has is being chummy with Clinton.

1418
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:08,280
Well, I like that he has a name and a design and he's a specific character.

1419
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:10,280
It's insane that they took the time to think of this.

1420
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:15,280
There are a couple other photos right before this of Captain Orion.

1421
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:18,280
There he is dabbing.

1422
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:20,280
I had to do it to him.

1423
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:21,280
Something we know about him.

1424
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,280
I had to do it to him.

1425
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,280
He likes to dab.

1426
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:26,280
He's also, here is him hanging out with.

1427
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:28,280
Oh, I think I know this one, right?

1428
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:30,280
Insane.

1429
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:31,280
Or wait, wait, different character.

1430
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:32,280
I'm sorry.

1431
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,280
Sorry, wait, different character.

1432
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:39,280
Well, maybe, but I also saw like a bunch of different Captain Orion costumes.

1433
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:41,280
So I think they were not terribly consistent.

1434
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:48,280
It's like the turtles coming out of our shells where if you watch that video, there's five different costumes between scenes.

1435
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:49,280
So maybe.

1436
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:53,280
Anyway, standing next to Anna Nicole Smith in Fatigue.

1437
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:55,280
And what's before this one?

1438
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:56,280
I think there's one more.

1439
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:57,280
I don't know if it will top that.

1440
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,280
It might just be classic.

1441
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:00,280
Let's just go back to the dab.

1442
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:01,280
Are you talking about this?

1443
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,280
Oh, yes.

1444
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:03,280
Oh, yes.

1445
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:07,280
Here's just a kind of a like very, you know, he looks like a Power Ranger essentially.

1446
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:08,280
He's on the outside.

1447
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:12,280
He was visiting Earth, I suppose.

1448
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:16,280
You know, as normal of a photo of Captain Orion as you're going to find.

1449
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:18,280
But here's the very strange thing about this.

1450
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:28,280
This photograph was taken by Neil deGrasse Tyson.

1451
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:35,280
He made like a slideshow for a planetarium website of different space themed things.

1452
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:43,280
Mars 2112 is ridiculous that we would develop the technology to get all the way to Mars in 100 years.

1453
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:44,280
Highly unrealistic.

1454
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:48,280
Cheese would never melt on the surface of Mars.

1455
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:50,280
Thus making nachos impossible.

1456
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:52,280
It would remain cold and shredded.

1457
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:54,280
Can I ask a quick question?

1458
01:33:54,280 --> 01:34:00,280
Is it am I is there an illusion or does it look like that fanny pack is that covering his genitals?

1459
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:01,280
This is OK.

1460
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:02,280
This is what it looks like.

1461
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:11,280
It looks like this was a costume made for a child that was then put onto legendary actor Doug Jones.

1462
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:15,280
You want to tour a stock company player who is 87 feet tall, right?

1463
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:18,280
Like that looks it's not everything about it looks ill fitting.

1464
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:22,280
Not just that it's run down, but it's like where are his hips?

1465
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:23,280
He's got like a tool.

1466
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,280
It's like a kind of a tool belt look.

1467
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,280
Yeah.

1468
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:27,280
So long down.

1469
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:28,280
Yeah.

1470
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:29,280
Yeah.

1471
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:33,280
Like Richard Karn wearing a tool belt.

1472
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:36,280
You know, there is a tall office tower.

1473
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:41,280
There's skyscraper on on top of the building to put into context.

1474
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:46,280
There's also a a theater, a Broadway theater.

1475
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:53,280
So you could have gone to Mars 2112 and then headed to the Gershwin to see Wicked.

1476
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:56,280
Imagine seeing Wicked and then going, I'm hungry.

1477
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:57,280
I could use a bite to eat.

1478
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:00,280
What's around here?

1479
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:08,280
And then it's like, well, there's a restaurant where the aliens is mass or deteriorating in front of your eyes.

1480
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:10,280
But like, to be fair, I just want to make it clear.

1481
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:12,280
This is what this looks like from street level.

1482
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:13,280
Right.

1483
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,280
Like you have to walk down on the other side of this block.

1484
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:18,280
There's a staircase down that leads to the subway station.

1485
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:32,280
They would have people in costumes walking around outside on like street level holding out flyers because I think they very quickly realized if you don't know nothing about this tells you it's a restaurant.

1486
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:34,280
There is a spaceship.

1487
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:39,280
There is like a very sort of antiseptic looking waiting area.

1488
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:41,280
Like it looks more like a spa.

1489
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:45,280
The whole commitment to the like this is an airport thing did not help.

1490
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,280
There's no menu outside.

1491
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:50,280
The signage just says Mars 2112.

1492
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:51,280
That's it.

1493
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:52,280
It's true.

1494
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:56,280
Like it was a it was immersive way before like Galaxy's Edge or anything.

1495
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:59,280
And yet suffered because of the ambition.

1496
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:00,280
Right.

1497
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:04,280
And much like they would say like Galaxy's Edge is going to be a narrative.

1498
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:05,280
You're going to have a reputation.

1499
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:07,280
They'll be carried here and it never came through.

1500
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,280
Mars 2112.

1501
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:09,280
I can say from personal experience.

1502
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:11,280
I would go there and they would say you again.

1503
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:17,280
They would track.

1504
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:20,280
Wasn't your tenth birthday party here.

1505
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:27,280
So what you're saying is Mars 2112 better than Galaxy's Edge.

1506
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:31,280
Let's hear it.

1507
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:51,280
Griffin you you aren't the only one with fond remembrances of Mars 2112 because I looked up the Yelp page to discover that for years people have been posting fond remembrances of this restaurant.

1508
01:36:51,280 --> 01:37:00,280
And I just have some just some little sentences that kind of stuck out to me like they say you know cellar doors a beautiful fray and stuff.

1509
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:03,280
So these are just some nuggets that caught my eye.

1510
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:07,280
Can't go wrong with Martian soup of the day.

1511
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:14,280
The crouton bowl was out of this world.

1512
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:19,280
The crouton bowl.

1513
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:21,280
Yeah.

1514
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:23,280
Is that a name of something that I'm not like ball.

1515
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:25,280
Is that called a salad.

1516
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,280
But on Mars it is.

1517
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:36,280
This is what a nine year old Griffin would have ordered is can I have a salad minus the vegetables just with those things I like.

1518
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,280
Yes.

1519
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:39,280
Yeah.

1520
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:44,280
And this last one I'm pretty sure is a joke but if it's not it's also great.

1521
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:48,280
My mom was the happiest I've ever seen her.

1522
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:52,280
And my dad loved this place the first time we went here.

1523
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:57,280
Thanks to Mars 2112 my parents are still together.

1524
01:37:58,280 --> 01:37:59,280
What.

1525
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:12,280
If it's a joke if it's not a joke it's really something I am going to stick with me for a while.

1526
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:15,280
I know I didn't write that I should.

1527
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:17,280
You know what.

1528
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:21,280
Tonight if you feel like it boot up your Yelp account.

1529
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:27,280
Head to the Mars 2112 page and you know write write your memories.

1530
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,280
Crazy things happen at this place a lot of bread.

1531
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,280
Brad Pitt went there with his kid.

1532
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:32,280
We know we got a photo of it.

1533
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:33,280
Oh wait photo.

1534
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,280
Why do I think I missed the photo.

1535
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:35,280
Yeah there you go.

1536
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:38,280
Couldn't find any photos inside.

1537
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:39,280
Not inside though.

1538
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,280
This is him taking Maddox on a.

1539
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,280
It could have been photos.

1540
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:44,280
A flight to Mars.

1541
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:49,280
Shaq tried to go but wasn't allowed in because he wasn't dressed nice enough.

1542
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:56,280
The last five years of the restaurant became a lot of like private party rentals.

1543
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:59,280
One of which led to a murder.

1544
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:06,280
There was a shooting there but this was in the last year or two Shaq went to a party that I think was sponsored by a radio station.

1545
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:09,280
They turned him away because he didn't match the dress code.

1546
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:14,280
And this is what he was wearing and TMZ described him as a lumberjack.

1547
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:26,280
He's wearing like a crew for listeners at home he's wearing like a crew neck like varsity pullover sweatshirt that like within less than five years immediately became on trend again.

1548
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:33,280
And they're like no no you can't come in this is a fine establishment you can't come in here dressed like a lumberjack.

1549
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:35,280
Vabineau to you sir.

1550
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:39,280
We really do we have to start winding it down unfortunately.

1551
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:43,280
I mean we should get out some final things about it.

1552
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:44,280
Apologies.

1553
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:49,280
But there's one big piece and I don't know if anybody found this.

1554
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:55,280
I'm curious or if you knew this somehow already but like in terms of things that occurred here that were notable.

1555
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:59,280
This is nuts to me that my mom was like I'm going to go to the gym.

1556
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:02,280
In terms of things that occurred here that were notable.

1557
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:15,280
This this is nuts to me that Mars 2112 was the home of an after party of a movie premiere and that movie premiere was Star Wars Episode 1 the Phantom.

1558
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,280
Yeah I don't have a picture of it.

1559
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:24,280
I was just getting the.

1560
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:25,280
I was getting the.

1561
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:33,280
Well what like you'd have to flip through if there's any little thumbnail you can see they did like they tried to help the people who were in line waiting for the movie.

1562
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:37,280
They were like the Martians went out and entertained them they sent out Captain Orion.

1563
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:38,280
Was it.

1564
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:40,280
Well no that's a bunch of Miss USA.

1565
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:42,280
Who had to go.

1566
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:47,280
So I mentioned because it's in the background here.

1567
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,280
Mars 2112.

1568
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:49,280
Oh here it is.

1569
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:52,280
Oh yeah they went to the line.

1570
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:54,280
The adversaries went to the line.

1571
01:40:54,280 --> 01:41:01,280
This was the thing the Ziegfeld theater which was like the famous New York theater where people would camp out for weeks for Episode 1.

1572
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:05,280
Was like four or five blocks away from Mars 2112.

1573
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,280
So it makes sense for them to capitalize on that.

1574
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:08,280
That they would pop over.

1575
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:11,280
Among people I know were at this.

1576
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:15,280
So we can definitely say these people went to Mars 2012 that night.

1577
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:16,280
Macaulay Culkin.

1578
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,280
Christian Slater.

1579
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:20,280
Montel Williams.

1580
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:25,280
Governor George Pataki.

1581
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:29,280
Mayor Ed Koch.

1582
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:31,280
Ahmed Best.

1583
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:33,280
The great Ahmed Best went there.

1584
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:35,280
He was there.

1585
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:38,280
Compared notes with the Martians.

1586
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:43,280
And finally I believe the entire lineup of the Backstreet Boys.

1587
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:44,280
Wow.

1588
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:46,280
All were in.

1589
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:52,280
Clearly sowing the seeds to try to be the first boy band to appear in a Star Wars.

1590
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:55,280
And yet NSYNC got the job instead.

1591
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:56,280
And even they were cut.

1592
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:58,280
Mike can you go back a slide quickly?

1593
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:00,280
Oh the Miss Universe.

1594
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:01,280
Yeah.

1595
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:04,280
So this was in the arcade.

1596
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:08,280
Which was like Mars 2112 had like an incredibly good arcade.

1597
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:11,280
And I was reading articles about when it closed.

1598
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:15,280
That like the place had been falling apart for years and years and years.

1599
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:19,280
But when it was clear that it was going to go into bankruptcy and they were going to have to sell it for parts.

1600
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:25,280
Like the entire sort of like arcade collector pinball collector community was like.

1601
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:28,280
That place is a fucking treasure trove.

1602
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:30,280
And it's open season now.

1603
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:33,280
And they had like an auction and a showing of all the things.

1604
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:35,280
They had like a lot of very rare.

1605
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:40,280
Because they tried to stay on theme to things that were like sci-fi or monsters or things like that.

1606
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:43,280
Not exclusively but they had like some rare stuff there.

1607
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:47,280
And there was an article about how there were all these like very in demand pinball machines in arcade games.

1608
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:49,280
And they showcased them.

1609
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:52,280
And then the next day the auction happened and none of them were there.

1610
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:57,280
All these people showed up and they were like they owed so much debt.

1611
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,280
Oh man.

1612
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:02,280
That people had to claim the arcade games as collateral.

1613
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:06,280
They couldn't even sell them off to dig themselves out of the hole.

1614
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:11,280
Yeah probably worth mentioning this place declared bankruptcy twice.

1615
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:12,280
Yikes.

1616
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:16,280
Well on the bottom right here you see there's still a dirty air hockey table.

1617
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:18,280
Incredibly dirty.

1618
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:22,280
Love to have this today.

1619
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:23,280
We would cherish it today.

1620
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:26,280
Any closing with anything we haven't gotten to.

1621
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:28,280
There was a Woodfield Mall location.

1622
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:30,280
And I didn't go to it I know.

1623
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:32,280
Oh my.

1624
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:36,280
And I haven't watched Yellowstone.

1625
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:40,280
You know what I'm not even going to.

1626
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:41,280
I don't even care anymore.

1627
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:42,280
I'm not going to watch it.

1628
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:44,280
Oh no boo.

1629
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:46,280
Oh shit.

1630
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:47,280
I'm not going to watch it.

1631
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:54,280
There's a like a Reddit thread where a person who used to work there just talks about working there.

1632
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:59,280
And they said I think we had an original character named Dr. Mars.

1633
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:06,280
And I'm like so much of this stuff feels like as soon as they open the doors they're like we're throwing in the towel.

1634
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:08,280
We're phoning it in.

1635
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:11,280
One last Yelp thing.

1636
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:16,280
Multimal mentions on Yelp of the salads that came with Cheetos on them.

1637
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:18,280
Oh wow.

1638
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:21,280
Did any of you guys print out the menu?

1639
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:24,280
They have a couple of selections from the menu.

1640
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:27,280
That's how we'll close with a high octane finish.

1641
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:29,280
Naming the menu items.

1642
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:35,280
Should we get the Green Goblin music back on?

1643
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:37,280
That's it. That's how we do it.

1644
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:41,280
It's 1998. Yeah we've got wraps.

1645
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:44,280
Alright. Let's go.

1646
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:49,280
This ain't your normal menu. This has some crazy stuff.

1647
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:53,280
You want appetizers? We got first contacts.

1648
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:57,280
You want salads? We got...

1649
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:01,280
Soylent Green.

1650
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:06,280
I bet you like discs that have sausage and cheese on them right?

1651
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:09,280
Well say hello to Flying Saucers.

1652
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:12,280
Pizza. Okay pizza.

1653
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:15,280
You want side dishes? We call them boosters.

1654
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:19,280
Oh how about these boosters?

1655
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:21,280
Oh no I'm pointing here at another thing.

1656
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:22,280
Sandwiches.

1657
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:25,280
You know what we call sandwiches? I don't even get this one.

1658
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:27,280
Cosmic combos.

1659
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:29,280
We gave you the weakest one.

1660
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:32,280
A combo of bread and other things.

1661
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:36,280
You want quesadillas? We got Quasar quesadillas.

1662
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:44,280
Oh how about some Olympus Mons Chicken Caesar?

1663
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:49,280
Sure. How about Martian Mama's chicken breast?

1664
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:55,280
We could start making them up too.

1665
01:45:57,280 --> 01:46:01,280
My son would like the Celestial Codfish.

1666
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:06,280
Pick your favorite Griffin.

1667
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:07,280
We got these two.

1668
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:13,280
Well for me it would have to be the Promethean Pork Chop.

1669
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:20,280
And boy I wish that place was still there because I think we would all love to go,

1670
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:26,280
all of us together and go get some Mars Teenies. Isn't that right everybody?

1671
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:35,280
Well let's all get the closest thing we can because you just survived Podcast the Ride live in New York.

1672
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:47,280
Griffin Newman you survived Podcast the Ride. Griffin Newman everybody.

1673
