1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,660
Welcome to podcast, The Ride, The Second Gate,

3
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,780
where today we will be known as the guys on the rides.

4
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,100
My name is Mike Carlson.

5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,100
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,100
Oh, just reach out and exceed at your grasp.

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,580
Which is the phrase?

8
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,060
I don't know, it's something.

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,100
There's a phrase to describe what I just did.

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,380
I don't know if Scott Gardner knows what it is.

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,780
Clever, hilarious.

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,860
There, thank you, yeah, yeah, that's what it is.

13
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,860
Perfect.

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,740
That's what it is.

15
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,140
We're the guys on the rides,

16
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,660
which makes it harder to say.

17
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,740
I was trying to remember,

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,740
was there some dumb celebrity trend

19
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:05,220
where everybody was posting rhymes for themselves,

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,660
like what we're doing, Minch on a Bench,

21
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,620
which came after Elf on a Shelf.

22
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,540
Was there some Twitter annoying thing?

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,600
I just found something where Harry Connick Jr.,

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,700
who hosted a show once,

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,860
showed himself as the host on a post.

26
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,900
Is this, am I really getting an item for this?

27
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,560
This was a trend, yeah, this was.

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,120
I'm not really remembering any specifics,

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,560
but yeah, it was blank on a blank,

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,600
and there was some sort of rhyme or tangential connection.

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,200
If the show was called Guys, the Guys on the Rides,

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,880
and it was just what I say all the time,

33
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,760
is that we were just positive about every ride,

34
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,440
we would be millionaires.

35
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,440
We would be so rich if we didn't criticize anything.

36
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,800
We never made jokes, if we never goofed around.

37
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,440
And we didn't have a name that has confused people

38
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,320
who had to make signs for us and Tony Baxter.

39
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,880
And Tony Baxter was confused,

40
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,600
which is the one that breaks my heart the most, of course.

41
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,920
Yeah, I know, no.

42
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,280
He's all about clarity and purpose.

43
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,520
I don't know if we did, was that in an email somewhere?

44
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,320
No, what it was was we were down at Knott's.

45
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,880
The first time we went to Scary Farm,

46
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,080
Doug Barnes from Season Pass took us,

47
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,200
and he texted a picture of all of us to Tony Baxter.

48
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,160
Because he's been on their show, and he was on our show.

49
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,400
He's been on their show a lot.

50
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,880
So he texted a photo, because we had just done the interview,

51
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,600
like a month or two prior, and Tony said,

52
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,680
oh, it looks like The Ride Guys.

53
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,520
Or like the guys.

54
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,240
He was trying to give us the name you just gave.

55
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,400
He was way out of it.

56
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,240
Yeah.

57
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,080
We should have listened to him.

58
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,920
Pretty close.

59
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,720
So, the guys on The Rides.

60
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,240
He thought we were from a podcast called The Ride.

61
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,280
I think yes, he thought that podcast

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,120
was just describing what it was.

63
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,120
And we were called The Ride.

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,680
It's too late to junk it.

65
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,680
My favorite is when people cold email us.

66
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,560
I've heard other shows talk about this too,

67
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,400
like cold email.

68
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,480
Like, we'd love to add you to our new podcast app

69
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,400
and directory, The Ride.

70
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,200
Or we'd love to make NFTs out of clips of your show,

71
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,040
The Ride.

72
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,200
Like, oh, you seem like a big, big listener.

73
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,040
I would be interested in doing that.

74
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,680
So forward me that NFT email.

75
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,520
Oh, great.

76
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,360
But.

77
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,200
Sure, yeah.

78
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,040
We'll just start selling Amway and Lilo Roe.

79
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,440
Lilo Roe, whatever we call him.

80
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,120
We should sell candles and Tupperware,

81
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,560
and we should do everything.

82
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,920
So let's ask our guest here

83
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,280
what he thinks about our name change,

84
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,000
potential name change.

85
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,160
You know him from this podcast.

86
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,720
You know him from Doughboys.

87
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,000
That was the request last time is to only be credited.

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,240
He's the commissioner from the Doughboys.

89
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,400
I assume that that would remain.

90
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,240
Hey guys.

91
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,080
Hi, Evan Susser.

92
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,920
Evan Susser, hi.

93
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,760
Hi.

94
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,400
I like the name change.

95
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,520
Okay.

96
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,840
Have you considered,

97
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,240
I know sometimes you maybe would talk about

98
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,920
like a Ninja Turtle action figure or something like that.

99
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,520
So you guys could also be the goys on the toys.

100
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,360
Oh wow, that's good.

101
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,200
Yeah.

102
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,280
Bring it on tonight, today's episode.

103
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,160
That's what we're doing today pretty much.

104
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah.

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,840
We're talking about a toy.

106
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,920
I've considered toy podcasts for a long time now,

107
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,360
but that's maybe that's it.

108
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,200
That's the way to go.

109
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,000
Maybe that's the way to go.

110
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,800
So yeah, spin off podcasts with that.

111
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,160
Yeah, that's perfect.

112
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,000
Wow.

113
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,240
Well, thank you for being here

114
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,680
and coming back so quickly after your last appearance.

115
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,160
I, now here, I think we have to discuss

116
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,720
you being here in general because,

117
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,880
before this topic, because,

118
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,520
well, how do you recall this coming up?

119
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,560
You talking about the

120
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,680
the mention on the bench. The mention on the bench.

121
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,520
Yeah.

122
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,440
Well, I think that

123
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,640
I was once again in the bathroom of Sesame Place

124
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,720
and then, let's get a long bleep in there.

125
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,400
No, I think that I kind of vaguely remember

126
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,280
texting with Mike about Mensch on a Bench last year,

127
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,520
but you asked if I wanted to discuss Mensch on a Bench

128
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,360
and I didn't remember that at the time,

129
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,360
but then I am familiar with Mensch on a Bench.

130
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,720
I have a Mensch on a Bench.

131
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,560
Right.

132
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,400
Oh, great.

133
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,320
And in fact, I brought with me the Mensch on the Bench book.

134
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,680
The book. The story that comes with the toy.

135
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,240
I remember, like all good religious traditions,

136
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,040
first learning of Mensch on a Bench on Shark Tank.

137
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,880
Right.

138
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,640
All our great culture comes from.

139
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,200
For a Jewish tradition, maybe appropriate,

140
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,120
but I was curious about it

141
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,120
and it's not something I grew up with.

142
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,320
It's not anything that any adult has grown up with

143
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
because it's only about five years old.

144
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,560
But I'm basically looking for absolution

145
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,240
that we didn't make up you wanting to do this.

146
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,240
I want to be on every podcast at any time for any reason.

147
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,720
So no, this is not a situation

148
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,880
where you're exploiting my heritage.

149
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,560
Yes, you said what I was worried about.

150
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,680
No, I.

151
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,880
I feel like I remember last year.

152
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,240
If necessary, I would come in a Yarmulke

153
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,600
or whatever you want from me,

154
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,640
I'm happy to do to be here for this

155
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,440
paywall episode of a podcast.

156
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,680
My memory, I think, is that,

157
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,800
because we were playing all pandemic,

158
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,280
we and Anthony Geo and Tim Chang

159
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,760
were playing Grand Theft Auto.

160
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,600
That's right.

161
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,640
And we would play a couple times a week.

162
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,840
And I think maybe the day of we were like,

163
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,680
did you know there were like a whole range of Mensch

164
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,520
on a Bench character?

165
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,080
And you were like, yes, I do know that.

166
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,240
I have one.

167
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,120
And I think that's where we talked about it.

168
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,880
But again, that's that part of the pandemic.

169
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,520
My brain is completely fried.

170
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,360
Right.

171
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,600
And also, you know, that would be, I was playing,

172
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,200
I was on the East Coast for most of the pandemic.

173
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,280
So when we would have these Grand Theft Auto sessions.

174
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,880
Oh, we haven't even told the story.

175
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,800
Well, which one?

176
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,080
Well, they would just usually start for me.

177
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,160
Sometimes, you know, they would,

178
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,560
these guys would want to start playing at like 10 p.m.

179
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,400
Yes, right.

180
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,000
Which would be like 1 a.m. my time.

181
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,840
That's true.

182
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,840
For the child.

183
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,160
And this can't be done.

184
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,640
You know, be playing until like 4 a.m. or something.

185
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,320
The story, you know what I'm talking about?

186
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,560
Yeah.

187
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,480
So Susser and I were playing just the two of us

188
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,720
in one instance.

189
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,120
And I forget exactly how it happened.

190
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,360
But all of a sudden you stopped responding to me.

191
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,040
I was talking to him in the headset and we're playing,

192
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,360
his character stops moving, but he's still in the game.

193
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,680
And he stops responding to me.

194
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,560
And I'm going hello, like over and over again.

195
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,640
And then I like hang up and I call you back

196
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,600
and you're not picking up and you're not picking up.

197
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,520
And I was like, first I was like,

198
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,560
I guess maybe he fell asleep.

199
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,280
But then I have a part of me that goes,

200
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,040
I hope he's not in like some medical distress.

201
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,720
So like for like 20 minutes, 25 minutes,

202
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,320
I'm just trying to get confirmation

203
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,840
because he's still in the game.

204
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,680
He's still, he isn't like.

205
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,400
And this is like 3 a.m. on the East Coast.

206
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,360
Right, of course.

207
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,400
It makes sense.

208
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,600
That's a pretty reasonable conclusion.

209
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,880
Right when Mike is debating

210
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,880
if he's going to call my wife at 3 a.m.

211
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,280
And see if I'm okay playing video games,

212
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,280
I wake up and call him back and say, yeah, sorry, I fell asleep.

213
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,480
And the reason also was we were in the middle of talking.

214
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,320
Yes.

215
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,040
It wasn't like there was a lull for five minutes

216
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,120
and we're just kind of playing whatever.

217
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,080
And then it was, it was like, we were in the middle of talking.

218
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,400
He said something, I said something, nothing, nothing, nothing.

219
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,240
Hmm.

220
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,080
That was like.

221
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,920
Fair.

222
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,760
Yeah.

223
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,720
Yeah.

224
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,120
So, so I was like, hmm, am I going to call?

225
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,920
So Mike's just killing time in the game,

226
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,960
just driving through crowds of civilians for 20 minutes.

227
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,920
Well, I was shooting him over and over and racking up points.

228
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,760
Oh, okay.

229
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,120
Because I might wake him up too with a more gunfire.

230
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,800
Yeah, so, yeah.

231
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,520
So, but at some point in one of those discussions.

232
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,920
We probably had some monumental mess.

233
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,320
Yeah, at 3 a.m.

234
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,920
Because it had come up on an episode we did

235
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,400
at the end of the year, because we were in the episode,

236
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,600
we kind of live discovered,

237
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,480
I think we'd heard that phrase.

238
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,560
Maybe you didn't quite remember the origins of it.

239
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,400
Maybe New Shark Tank had something to do with it.

240
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
New Shark Tank didn't know about the extended universe

241
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,320
of characters. That's really,

242
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,160
that's what we got excited about.

243
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,680
What kind of lit us up.

244
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,800
And so I am happy that you were familiar already

245
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,360
and own the product, own the book.

246
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,840
It was given to me as a joke, the product.

247
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,240
It was not butter and a sliver.

248
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,600
Yes, I do own it.

249
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,400
What I was curious,

250
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,480
mensch is a term and a word that you guys know.

251
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,320
Yes.

252
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,840
Is it one you'd ever use?

253
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,560
For me, I don't think I've used it like,

254
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,960
oh, like what that guy is such a menscher.

255
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
Yeah, I don't think I've ever used it

256
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,040
in casual conversation.

257
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,880
Okay.

258
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,800
Just checking in with where we're at.

259
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,200
But I would say it.

260
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,640
Yeah, it's not a bad thing.

261
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,880
Yeah, yeah, I like the word.

262
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,960
It's not the M word.

263
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,480
It's an okay word to say.

264
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,320
Yeah.

265
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,600
You're bringing us this context

266
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,680
or we'd be really deep in it already.

267
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,480
I think it might be an age that I feel like

268
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,520
a non-Jewish person could say it if they are in show biz

269
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,600
and are 65 years old.

270
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,520
That is kind of the thing that everyone in show business,

271
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,880
if they're 65, regardless of heritage,

272
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,080
is allowed to just become Jewish.

273
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,760
I don't know what that is.

274
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,200
But everyone there is saying like, mensch.

275
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,040
John Mulaney.

276
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,160
John Mulaney has adopted the voice.

277
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,280
Just slowly put on that thing.

278
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,520
Yeah, I'm trying to think of any even just Jewish,

279
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,080
like I guess oi ve is something that was said a lot

280
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,040
in my house.

281
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,320
My mother is half Jewish,

282
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,640
but not the side that makes her Jewish.

283
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,880
So that's really the closest thing that might,

284
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,440
like I might pop into my.

285
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,280
An oi ve might slip out.

286
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,000
I might say oi ve once in a while or just oi.

287
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,840
Yeah.

288
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,760
Yeah, once in a while, but I don't know,

289
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,680
it might not be so common with me.

290
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,840
So the giving of the mensch on a bench,

291
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,400
I mean, yeah, is that just, is it like on a novelty level?

292
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,720
Was it somebody who you already talked about this thing with

293
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,520
or made fun of it and then you got it or just sort of random?

294
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,560
No, it was given to me by a non-Jew as maybe a hate crime.

295
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,960
No, I think it was just like,

296
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,240
oh, you would find this funny.

297
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,840
And they were right, I did.

298
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,320
But yeah, I mean, it very much,

299
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,720
it's much in the tradition of Hanukkah.

300
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,800
It's just a knockoff Christmas kind of thing.

301
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,680
There's Elf on a Shelf,

302
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,960
which also you guys, I don't know a ton about,

303
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,760
but that is also kind of a thing where someone

304
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,400
just created it to sell a toy.

305
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,240
Yeah, I believe so.

306
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,080
Yeah.

307
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't trust that Elf on a Shelf

308
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,280
because he hides and he moves around.

309
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,280
The mansion on the bench is encouraged to move around

310
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,280
so he can rest and see some new parts of your house.

311
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,480
And that's much more reassuring to me

312
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,000
than just this creepy little Elf guy.

313
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,120
Can I just say, I didn't know any of this, the actual,

314
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,280
I knew the phrase, and oh, that's a cute phrase,

315
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,120
but I didn't know the mythology of it where,

316
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,800
what an Elf on a Shelf is, is like Santa's helper

317
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,560
who is the one determining if the kid is naughty or nice.

318
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,040
So parents can say the Elf is watching,

319
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,760
so watch what you do.

320
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,600
Right.

321
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,960
And the moving is to kind of sell the illusion

322
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,560
that they are alive.

323
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,680
No, that's not a toy.

324
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,280
Your other toys don't move every day.

325
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,720
The Elf moves because it's not a toy, it's real.

326
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,840
Manufacturing consent, getting children used

327
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,880
to the surveillance state, you know?

328
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,680
You know?

329
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,200
It's pretty weird.

330
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,720
I think that's why there is the Google auto-fill-in question,

331
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,520
is Elf on a Shelf bad?

332
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,960
And Jason would say yes.

333
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,560
I think not knowing much, I might veer to yes.

334
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,480
Yeah, there's some, much more mild element, I feel like,

335
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,560
on the rules, there are eight rules,

336
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,680
eight rules to dating my mench on a bench.

337
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,000
There is a rule of like, hey, be cooler,

338
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,840
might not get presents at night, you know?

339
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,200
Like be nice, be a good person, you know?

340
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,560
Yeah, but you know,

341
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,480
it very much does mirror Hanukkah,

342
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,280
which I don't know if you guys know how much you know

343
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,520
about Hanukkah, but Hanukkah is not a particularly important

344
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,320
religious holiday, it's a minor religious holiday

345
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,240
that basically only has risen in prominence

346
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,920
because of Christmas.

347
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,800
And I will say, as someone now who has a daughter

348
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,080
who's three and a half, it's a good thing,

349
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,800
because as we're going around the world, you know,

350
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,200
and we're seeing Christmas trees and hearing Christmas music,

351
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,480
she started to ask, hey, why don't we celebrate Christmas?

352
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
And we do have a go-to thing,

353
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,360
oh, because we celebrate Hanukkah.

354
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,200
Yes.

355
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,800
If we didn't have that, I mean, what do we do?

356
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,960
She'd be so mad.

357
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,400
Yeah, she'd be furious.

358
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,280
Now, when she doesn't know, Hanukkah much worse

359
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:15,280
than Christmas, but at least there's something to say.

360
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,000
Yeah.

361
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,440
So, mench on the bench is the same thing where this,

362
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,560
you know, it's a knockoff even of the commercialization

363
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,240
of Christmas, where it's just like, all right,

364
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,440
this other thing exists, we gotta have this mench

365
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,000
on a bench thing, then it's also gonna be not quite as good

366
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,760
and not as thought out.

367
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,000
And like, you know, the elf, it's like, okay,

368
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,560
that's like a part of the Christmas mythology.

369
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,400
Right.

370
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,200
This is just, the mench is just like a Hasidic guy,

371
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,200
like you would see like in the Lower East Side of New York,

372
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
you're like, yeah, that guy's a mascot now.

373
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,120
It's crazy.

374
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,560
And you know, the creator of it, this guy, Neil Hoffman,

375
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,480
I don't know a ton about him, but he looks to be kind of

376
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,120
like a secular Jewish guy.

377
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,640
So he was like, okay, yeah, like he's not,

378
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,360
he doesn't look like the mench.

379
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,200
Right.

380
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,520
Oh, I seriously, no, no, no, yeah,

381
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,560
just very average looking guy.

382
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,880
This product has such a narrow audience for it,

383
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,960
because it's not for people who are like orthodox,

384
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,200
observant Jews.

385
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,040
Right.

386
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,400
And it's not for people who like don't care about

387
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,880
being Jewish and just, you know, like whatever.

388
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,160
It's people who are like committed to,

389
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,360
they're gonna do a Jewish identity thing for like eight days,

390
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,040
but also it doesn't really have to be based

391
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,120
in any sort of religion.

392
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,960
Right.

393
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,160
It's weird.

394
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,560
Yeah, it's, well, the guy, I don't know a ton about him

395
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,640
who made it up, but he apparently worked at Hasbro.

396
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,480
Yes.

397
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,520
The toy guy, which I gotta respect.

398
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,640
Hasbro makes good toys still.

399
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,280
And for the Shark Tank investors,

400
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,200
like someone coming out of like toy marketing,

401
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,000
starting a toy startup, like that's a slam,

402
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,800
that seems like someone you wanna be in business.

403
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,620
Sure.

404
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,160
I think, but if you, I don't know if you rewatch the segment.

405
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,120
Yeah, it's just a little touch and go.

406
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,640
It doesn't seem like one that's gonna,

407
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,360
it seems like one of the ones, you know,

408
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,640
they throw the chum into the tank sometimes

409
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,880
is the ones that are a little thin and not thought out

410
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,240
that they can kind of dunk on and make fun of.

411
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,480
But as it goes, I think the rule of thumb with Shark Tank,

412
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,960
if you're not an avid viewer of it, is like,

413
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,200
some successes are like happening

414
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,760
or done within one act, but,

415
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,520
and some failures go into a second act,

416
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,380
but really, if somebody kinda teases something

417
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,480
and then you see the logo and we go into commercial,

418
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,000
oh, now there's something, now there's a negotiation

419
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,060
or the guy screws himself for,

420
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,620
so when I realized this was a two actor

421
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,340
and I knew they meant business,

422
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,900
and it is a very solid,

423
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,260
just it's a solid Shark Tank episode

424
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,340
regardless of the product.

425
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,800
Well, I think where they land it was reasonably fair,

426
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,640
right?

427
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,460
I think, yeah.

428
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,820
Laurie and Robert did a dual deal.

429
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,640
Laurie and Robert.

430
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,820
150,000 for 15% of the company.

431
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,900
Uh-huh.

432
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,380
He won it, so 150,000 for 10%,

433
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,500
so he compromised a little, but not too much.

434
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,340
That's not bad, yeah, yeah.

435
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,220
I think he went in a little too hot

436
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,640
trying to peg down Mr. Wonderful.

437
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,320
Like he seemed like he was really trying to,

438
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,760
like I don't think he can go in

439
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,760
like angling for certain sharks.

440
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,080
That always backfires.

441
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

442
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,920
People are really pushing.

443
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,400
It's a QVC thing.

444
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,880
Yeah, we know you're going for Laurie when she goes out.

445
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,720
You're gonna start to well up with tears.

446
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,520
I thought it was interesting that he said

447
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,140
that they could have the mentions at Mav's Games,

448
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,160
but Cuban didn't really go for that.

449
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,000
Cuban seemed pretty dismissive off the bat, too.

450
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,920
I thought he came in too hot.

451
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,160
Which is he the only two?

452
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,000
Is he?

453
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Or is Robert?

454
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,840
Barbra?

455
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,120
Or are they all Jewish?

456
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,960
I don't know.

457
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,800
I don't know.

458
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,880
I don't know.

459
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,720
That's a good question.

460
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,560
Yeah, I'm not sure.

461
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,720
I don't wanna start guessing.

462
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,840
No, it's good.

463
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,400
I don't know about this.

464
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,480
Barbara is interested for a little while.

465
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,200
I was like, come on, man.

466
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,440
No, no, no.

467
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,080
You're allowed. Jason, but.

468
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,920
You're allowed.

469
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,600
You're not appropriate.

470
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,440
Hey.

471
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,880
Do you, I think, you know, I kind of,

472
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,760
there's a lot of things to talk about.

473
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,240
Do you think,

474
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,760
cause like Santa Claus has been around a long time now,

475
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,720
and Santa is so, in my mind,

476
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,720
could be just completely disconnected from Christianity,

477
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,680
as far as the lore.

478
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,120
But what you're saying, the Mensch on the Bench

479
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,080
feels like it's like,

480
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,760
one of the characters name is Dreidel Dog.

481
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,440
I mean, it's so one to one.

482
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,840
It's so.

483
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,720
Yes, well.

484
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,240
So, Mensch on the Bench,

485
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,320
what is weird about this Mensch on the Bench thing

486
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,120
is the story of Mensch on the Bench,

487
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,080
they attempt to retcon Mensch

488
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,400
into the story of the first ever Hanukkah.

489
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,240
Oh, oh, okay.

490
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,840
Which is not something that Santa,

491
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,800
I don't really, I guess, know the lore of Santa,

492
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,680
but is Santa like,

493
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,280
connected to Jesus in any way?

494
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,040
Only in like weird, specific,

495
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,480
like people trying to carve out a weird religious,

496
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,040
I don't know, am I wrong?

497
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:17,040
Well, I think it's a European thing, Saint Nicholas,

498
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,040
and like.

499
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,880
Oh, that's right.

500
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,160
Oh, it's biblical in that sense.

501
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,320
Yeah, so it goes back.

502
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,320
But nobody said that Santa Claus

503
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,760
isn't in the Bible or anything.

504
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,600
No.

505
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,160
Maybe like, I guess Saint Nicholas isn't either,

506
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,000
but you know what I mean.

507
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,920
No, I mean, our modern idea of Santa Claus

508
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,720
comes from the Coca-Cola Company, I believe.

509
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,560
Yeah, yeah.

510
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,600
And even the modern version of Christmas,

511
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,600
a lot of that comes from various things over the,

512
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,240
Coca-Cola, various marketing,

513
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,200
oh, the Christmas Carol.

514
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,040
Oh, sure, yeah.

515
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,880
The Dickens book.

516
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,720
But all the songs, I feel,

517
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,960
not all the songs, but a lot of the songs

518
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,320
are from the 50s and 60s.

519
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,160
Yeah.

520
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,800
It's something I kinda like about

521
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,200
Neil Hoffman's opportunism here,

522
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,840
is he's looking at like,

523
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,960
well, we haven't had Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer

524
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,320
for that long.

525
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,160
Right.

526
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,920
And now we don't really remember where it came from

527
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,480
or who thought of it, but somebody had to,

528
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,120
and he's like, down the road,

529
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,160
maybe mention on a bench is just,

530
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,000
what was it?

531
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,840
Maybe that is.

532
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,680
Yes, maybe it does come, but yeah.

533
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,320
So in the story, though,

534
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,480
he tries to take the story of the first Hanukkah,

535
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,280
which, should I tell quickly?

536
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,120
Sure, yeah.

537
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,200
So the religious story is the Jews,

538
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,000
the Maccabees, led by Judah the Maccabee,

539
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,840
defeat the Greeks or something like that,

540
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,360
and then they rescue the temple,

541
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,960
and there's only enough oil for one night,

542
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,200
and then it lasts for eight nights,

543
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,760
and that's why Hanukkah lasts eight nights,

544
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,000
and that's why you like candles for eight nights.

545
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,240
So what they've done with this book is say,

546
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,240
well, while that was all going on,

547
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,280
there was this other guy named Mensch,

548
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,200
who was just hanging out at the temple

549
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,280
and looking at the oil being like, ah, good.

550
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,040
He volunteers to stay up, like, I'll look at it.

551
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,000
He was like, hey, you need someone to look at the lights?

552
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,840
I'll do it, no problem.

553
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,160
I'm a night owl.

554
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,320
You've all fought a war.

555
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,080
I'll just be here looking at it.

556
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,640
Which again, this is not something that's like,

557
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,520
there's no text or anything that supports anything close.

558
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,360
It's just an invented thing,

559
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,600
but it also is so tied to the religious story.

560
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
It could have just been like a made up thing.

561
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,040
It was in New York, and there was this Mensch

562
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,160
who saw all the Jewish kids celebrating Hanukkah,

563
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,240
and he dropped off presents, or it could be anything.

564
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,880
They didn't need to go back to the,

565
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,760
and do this kind of, it really is like a Rogue One version

566
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,640
of here's how they got the plan.

567
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,280
They don't know why that was,

568
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,760
and then with all these other extended characters

569
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,760
who they clearly, it's just not a continuity

570
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,280
that he fought out from the beginning,

571
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,000
because none of these other characters come up

572
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,360
in this origin story.

573
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,040
There's not even room for them,

574
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,560
and I don't know if they have their own,

575
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,240
or if they have their own books, or the mythology.

576
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,800
Well, Mitzvah Moose has a story.

577
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,640
There's a video online.

578
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,480
Mitzvah Moose is insane.

579
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,320
That is just like.

580
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,800
Mitzvah Moose is really wild.

581
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,960
Like I looked away for a minute, and I came back.

582
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,640
What's the Mitzvah Moose story?

583
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,640
Mitzvah Moose has the menorah candles on his antlers,

584
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
and Moshe has to do different mitzvahs in a day, right?

585
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,080
And as he does them, a new candle lights up.

586
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,920
Yeah.

587
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,440
It's a Rudolph ripoff situation where.

588
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,280
It's the same thing.

589
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,920
It's like Christmas, you got one night, we got eight.

590
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,760
Yeah.

591
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,920
Rudolph, he's got one night.

592
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,000
No, this guy, he's got eight light-up things.

593
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Antlers that don't glow.

594
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,080
He wants the antler.

595
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,200
Why aren't his antlers glowing, says Moshe,

596
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,560
and you might say because antlers never glow.

597
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,320
Right, no, to be fair, neither do noses.

598
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,840
Oh yeah, that's true.

599
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,080
Yeah, you know what?

600
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,720
I keep trying to get Neil here,

601
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,000
and yet he keeps out-foxing me.

602
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,680
Yeah, but so the good deeds make him light up.

603
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,840
Yeah.

604
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,200
Which is also consistent with the toy,

605
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,720
which is with me today.

606
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,680
Wow.

607
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,920
Look who's here.

608
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,760
Wow.

609
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,320
It's Mitzvah Moose.

610
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,280
Wow, there he is.

611
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,840
And if I press on his hoof,

612
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,200
then you, is it this one?

613
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,040
Yeah, yeah.

614
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,560
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

615
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,400
That's awesome.

616
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,600
Yes, you can see why I bought this.

617
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,960
I went to Target, which boy, this speaks to how,

618
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,080
this is one of the great Shark Tank success stories,

619
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,880
that it's in so many big boxes

620
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,080
that there's an entire section

621
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,120
in the middle of a Target aisle,

622
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,040
because I went to buy Moshe, I went to buy the Mitch,

623
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,720
and then as I'm looking at him,

624
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,560
I'm like, this is the cool that lights up.

625
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,640
That is some cool function.

626
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,480
We've been kind of snarky,

627
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,160
but that's some fun functionality.

628
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,640
And one at a time, I think is cool.

629
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,400
There's toys where now it all lights up,

630
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,880
but the fact that you can count them up,

631
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,920
so, mid Hanukkah, as we are currently,

632
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,560
where should we be as we're recording this?

633
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,200
You wanna squeeze that bad boy twice.

634
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,920
Twice, but it'll come out sort of soon, right?

635
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,520
Oh, when it comes out.

636
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,160
Well, I guess we shouldn't tie ourselves to that,

637
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,040
but I probably, three or four, anyway,

638
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,040
it could be two right now.

639
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,840
That's where we are in time.

640
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,640
But, pretty cool, right?

641
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,840
And there is the story with it.

642
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,520
It comes with a book, is not hardcover,

643
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,440
like the one that you were holding for Mitch and a Bench.

644
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,520
And this is, so it's more of like a leaflet,

645
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,560
like kind of a set, like remember, in downtown Disney,

646
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,760
like the stuff you get handed at the little table.

647
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,600
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

648
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,920
Like Latter-day Saints kind of pamphlets.

649
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,520
Or that Target used to be,

650
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,640
I don't know if you remember this,

651
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,800
that Target, you used to,

652
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,320
even if you went in the store for five minutes,

653
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,320
you would come out and find pamphlets

654
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,280
for the Tony Alamo Christian Ministries,

655
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,440
wedged under your windshield wiper.

656
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,440
Yeah.

657
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,480
Oh, you just get flanketed.

658
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,320
That's a whole, that's a real bunch of kooks, that lot.

659
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,080
Oh, I don't know about Tony Alamo.

660
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,520
I think he's long dead, but as he was in-

661
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,360
Next year we'll do an episode about Tony Alamo.

662
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,200
And not for something great, if memory serves.

663
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,520
There's two things to say about the book,

664
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,520
which would also be true of your book, Evan, the font.

665
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,440
You have to deduct points,

666
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,600
well, I would deduct points for the font,

667
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,920
which is the dreaded Papyrus.

668
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,760
Yeah.

669
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,960
Mike might add points because it is the font

670
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,440
of your beloved Avatar franchise.

671
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,320
Avatar Pandora, yeah, yeah.

672
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,120
The mighty Papyrus.

673
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,800
Navi love Papyrus.

674
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,640
That's one of the things we actually-

675
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,480
It's their handwriting.

676
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,320
Yeah.

677
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,160
When a Navi takes like a tentacle

678
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,640
and squeezes ink out of it and writes with it,

679
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,440
they form, that's where the font comes from.

680
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,440
Right, it's like-

681
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,880
Every Navi's natural handwriting.

682
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,000
It's like when you're in Navi school,

683
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,960
like that's learning cursive, is Papyrus.

684
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,160
So yeah, so it's beautiful to me.

685
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,160
You have to have little holes on the side constantly.

686
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,000
Yeah.

687
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,840
Little edge marks.

688
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,520
Oh, I finally watched it.

689
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,360
Oh, it was on Thanksgiving.

690
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,200
Really?

691
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,040
Oh, interesting.

692
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,600
Oh, this is, well, this is probably,

693
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,440
this could be an episode.

694
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,280
Yeah, we can't.

695
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,120
Yeah, that could be an episode.

696
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,640
I, any general-

697
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,920
I thought it was great.

698
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,760
Oh, wow, yeah, there you go.

699
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,880
Wow, unbelievable on board.

700
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,280
Yeah.

701
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,120
So-

702
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,040
Can't wait for the seed bearer in the way of water now.

703
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,040
Very excited.

704
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,400
So, also nothing on the back, that's not so strong.

705
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,080
And then like, just look at the text.

706
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,440
This is some of the strangest-

707
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,880
There's a lot of white space.

708
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,720
Yeah.

709
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,800
And then a few sentences.

710
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,640
The bottom third of the page is just white

711
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,960
and then the tiniest font I've ever seen in any book

712
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,640
for just only two lines.

713
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,560
Can you even see it?

714
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,840
I know, oh my God.

715
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,880
There is text there and you aren't that far away, Jason.

716
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,800
I can barely tell what's going on, yeah.

717
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,320
What happened?

718
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,160
Is this a mistake?

719
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,200
Is this a printing error?

720
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,360
Is this gonna be worth something someday?

721
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,200
Because-

722
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,040
Yeah, possibly.

723
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
It's the famous Mids for the Moose

724
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,960
with the tiny papyrus.

725
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,800
Wow.

726
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,880
I mean, I even knew Glass's prescription

727
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,720
to get filled at some point, but it ain't that bad.

728
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,720
No one needs to be able to see this tiny text.

729
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,080
Wow.

730
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,400
Yeah, it's pretty crazy.

731
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,840
Otherwise, it's charming, the drawings are nice,

732
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,920
you get to see Mids for the Moose.

733
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,200
Among the things he does are like recycle.

734
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,520
That's one of his Midsfas.

735
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,400
It is full of like spelling errors and typos,

736
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,280
but then you get to meet, maybe this is a good segue

737
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,000
into some of the other characters

738
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,400
because here is a Midsfa that he does

739
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,840
as he hopes give a bath to another

740
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,080
Extended Universe character, the Dreidel Dalmatian,

741
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,800
who is a dog with spots, but all of the spots

742
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,000
are in the shape of Dreidels.

743
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,840
Right.

744
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,920
And even though we're making fun of it,

745
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,400
it is like, you know, Mench does come from ancient Greece

746
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,680
where both Dalmatians and Mooses were native,

747
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,640
so it makes sense that these characters exist.

748
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,400
Uh-huh, of course.

749
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,320
And most importantly, they're very cute.

750
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,080
So does he, is there any interactions

751
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,200
with other characters besides Dreidel Dalmatian?

752
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,320
Oh, in the book here, I should skim, let's see.

753
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,520
Didn't do the full read.

754
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,000
Well, some kids.

755
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,400
Oh yeah, you know, I think a lot of them,

756
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,880
this might be like a later edition.

757
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,200
Yeah, they try to get everybody in.

758
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,760
Yeah, because you've also got.

759
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,320
You got Papa?

760
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,400
I'm not sure.

761
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,480
Hannah, the Hanukkah hero?

762
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,320
Yeah, I think maybe the pronunciation

763
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,920
is supposed to be Hanna, the Hanukkah hero.

764
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,320
I saw a video where he described it,

765
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,280
even though it's spelled Hannah,

766
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,640
but it's like trying to be the same sentence, Hanukkah.

767
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,960
Right.

768
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,360
Who's also, you got another issue.

769
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,000
Hannah, the Hanukkah hero, you ran into the same thing.

770
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Your issue with tying it to the original Hanukkah story,

771
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:31,040
it's also weird because now the Moshe is just in modern times.

772
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,880
Yes, he's an immortal.

773
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,760
Yeah, I guess like Santa, again.

774
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,600
Yeah, yeah.

775
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,360
There's always analogs to these things,

776
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,440
but like Santa's not really tied to, you know,

777
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,560
here's something that happened in 1692.

778
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,360
It's not so specifically dated.

779
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,040
So yeah, Santa's like James Bond,

780
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,520
can kind of just happen in any time period

781
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,880
and no one really asks questions.

782
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

783
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,480
It resets, we accept that it resets.

784
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,840
But this would be the equivalent if like,

785
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,440
Santa was one of the three wise men,

786
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,680
is basically what they've tried to do.

787
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,880
Oh, that's good, yeah.

788
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,720
Right.

789
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,840
Would you, as a writer, you're a creative person,

790
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,080
have you thought about, well, what would I have done?

791
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,920
Of course.

792
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,760
Okay.

793
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,600
Okay, good.

794
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,440
Open.

795
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,280
Oh, yes.

796
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,240
No, I think that if I'm gonna be honest,

797
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,800
should I give like a serious answer?

798
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,760
Sure.

799
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,080
I think that as Mench on a Bench is so much tied

800
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,560
to America Judaism that Mench should be

801
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,800
an American Jewish creation.

802
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,840
And maybe I think that you would do it

803
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,560
like kind of New York Ellis Island-y kind of times,

804
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,480
and you would like tell a story about like a Jewish family

805
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,880
living in like Brooklyn and the Mench on the Bench

806
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,120
that like took care of them

807
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,320
when they like first came to America to flee.

808
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,880
During like a tough winter or something.

809
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,120
Yeah, a tough winter to flee the Nazis.

810
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,000
Maybe you don't get into Nazis for a children's story.

811
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,760
But on the other hand- But that's the influence, maybe.

812
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,920
Yeah, it's kind of like in the background.

813
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,480
Right.

814
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,960
I think that setting it in America

815
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,920
would be a better origin story for the Mench on the Bench.

816
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,640
That would be my punch up.

817
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,560
I do like the extended characters too,

818
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,320
and I wish if they had had the thought too

819
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,520
that that's where they were going,

820
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,360
that there had been little teases

821
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,480
in the origin story of Mench.

822
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,240
Right, because it feels a little bit like,

823
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,480
oh, this is like a cash cow or something.

824
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,080
Let's cash in.

825
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,600
Shove some more in there.

826
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,440
Right.

827
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,920
Yeah, because now, because it's why we're talking about it now

828
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,040
is that we never thought about doing

829
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,120
a Mench on a Bench episode.

830
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,160
It's the universe that kind of is the appeal now.

831
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,280
I like these animals.

832
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,840
I like a dreidel- The Bench universe, yeah.

833
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,680
Spotted deletion.

834
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,040
Right.

835
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,560
It's good that there's an extended universe.

836
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,640
And it's also funny that one of them is Papa.

837
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,480
Right.

838
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,840
Which is like, that is so not different.

839
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,600
It's like an older Jewish man.

840
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,040
It's like, they have this big extended universe,

841
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,080
and two of the characters are basically the same.

842
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,040
Now, the toy, I understand from the toy purposes,

843
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,880
they wanted to design a toy that you could squeeze,

844
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,240
and I think it says something.

845
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,080
Right.

846
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,200
It's my understanding of what that does,

847
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,400
so that's why they wanted a different one.

848
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,680
Because Mench doesn't do it.

849
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,520
That might be important to note.

850
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,360
Mench doesn't do anything.

851
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,200
He doesn't do anything.

852
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,040
Which is why I didn't buy him.

853
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,680
Right, that's why I went for Mitzvah Moose here.

854
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,360
But, and they went with Bubbe,

855
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,000
but they didn't go with Zadie?

856
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,560
Well, again, if they went with Zadie-

857
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,520
Yeah, I know, they went with Papa for some reason.

858
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,200
Right, they could have, Bubbe and Zadie, they could,

859
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,000
which is, that was probably like, oh, that's a good one,

860
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,920
because then you have the grandparents to buy that.

861
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,760
Oh, right, right.

862
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,440
So that's probably what they were going for.

863
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,920
Mm-hmm.

864
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,160
Bubbe Dances, that's the thing, I think,

865
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,480
from my Target experience earlier,

866
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,160
although the toy didn't seem to work too well in the,

867
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,000
but I think-

868
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,040
And are they related to Mench?

869
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,680
I really, I couldn't find.

870
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,080
Also, this is, the Target,

871
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,560
in the sign that this is going really well,

872
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,800
the Target displays that they have all of them,

873
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,320
which is a great branding thing,

874
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,960
just like, it must be successful,

875
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,400
there's a whole universe of these things.

876
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,640
Right, right.

877
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,840
In the not so successful, no Wikipedia page

878
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,200
for Mench on a Bench.

879
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,040
Oh.

880
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,800
Not true, if anybody actually cared about this mythology,

881
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,240
yeah, somebody would have taken the time.

882
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,960
You would think that it would have a Wikipedia page.

883
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,800
Yeah.

884
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,000
We're beating them, people have written the mythology

885
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,920
of the Sector Keeper, the important,

886
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,840
which was certainly not tossed off.

887
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,000
Is there a Sector Keeper Wikipedia page?

888
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,400
Not, well, on the, well, not, look,

889
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,600
on the podcast, the Ride Wiki,

890
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,040
I am I cheating by saying,

891
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,400
because we have a Wiki,

892
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,480
but there's no Mench Wiki.

893
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,800
No, there's not a Mench Wiki.

894
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:49,320
I know that with Big Dog, Wikipedia is the ultimate game.

895
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,160
Uh-huh.

896
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,360
I don't remember if we have one of those,

897
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,960
but do they not, does Mench not even have that?

898
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,800
They don't have a-

899
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,560
It's gotta have a main one, right?

900
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,840
No, it's not on the main Wikipedia.

901
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
Hmm.

902
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,640
It's a section on Elf on a Shelf.

903
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,480
Are we not either?

904
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,160
I feel like I'm throwing stones.

905
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,240
Yeah, I gotta check this out now.

906
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,480
Mench on a Bench Wiki.

907
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,120
Do you devote it solely to your commissioner duties?

908
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,960
No mention of the films.

909
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,360
Yeah, there's not.

910
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,560
There is not, it just goes right to

911
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,400
just defining what a mench is,

912
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,800
and then define it in an Elf on a Shelf Wikipedia.

913
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,160
So it says in the Elf on a Shelf

914
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,120
that there's a Jewish counterpart to Elf on a Shelf.

915
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:27,960
Yes.

916
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,960
Yeah, it's not its own.

917
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,800
Oh, okay.

918
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,520
Well, I think it, well, I mean, isn't this really

919
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,800
because it has stopped at the toys and the books

920
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,800
that mainly you get with the toys?

921
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,440
There's no product here, and wouldn't we,

922
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,920
not no, those are products, obviously.

923
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,880
I mean a, you know what I'm saying,

924
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,000
a film, a TV show, even like animated shorts.

925
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,840
Right.

926
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,840
There's gonna be a YouTube channel that's all like,

927
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,560
it's all the creator going on local news in Orlando.

928
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,080
Like I was trying to, in frantically coming over here,

929
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,760
trying to prepare, I was like, okay,

930
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,960
they probably have made even at least

931
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,960
a cheap animated thing, or maybe on Spotify

932
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,480
I was gonna be able to find someone reading a Mench

933
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,640
on the Bench book or something,

934
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,640
and you really couldn't find that.

935
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,320
I really think that someone,

936
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,480
and I'm gonna say now as I'm thinking about me,

937
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,000
they've gotta get in touch,

938
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,880
and there's gotta be like an animated thing for this.

939
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,040
Well there's some, I don't know, we'll get to,

940
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,960
I thought there's some YouTube videos,

941
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,560
I don't know if you came across the same ones,

942
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,160
but I think is the official channel.

943
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,120
Did you see any of this?

944
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,880
I saw, I just saw a lot of stuff that was with the creator

945
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,840
and the shark tank and like that story,

946
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,560
but was there stuff about like?

947
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,120
I'll, let me get to this.

948
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,400
I just, I also wanna say this real quick.

949
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,080
There is not an official podcast to write on the Wikipedia,

950
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,320
but there is a Scott Gardner Wikipedia page

951
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,600
that mentions podcasts in the Wikipedia page,

952
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,600
but you don't have a link to our main Wikipedia page.

953
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,160
So I'm the elf on the shelf.

954
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,240
So Scott is the elf on the shelf

955
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,640
and Mench on the bench.

956
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,600
All of us together.

957
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,600
I found that too, but you're the second result.

958
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,840
The first result under podcast,

959
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,080
and it's just searching the words individually,

960
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,320
the first result was, did you mean Red Scare podcast?

961
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,400
No, we didn't mean Red Scare, absolutely not.

962
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,480
I did not mean that, no thank you.

963
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,160
Guiding you to Red Scare what?

964
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,440
I think it just had podcast and ride somewhere in the entry.

965
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,480
Cause then there was like another net,

966
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,840
some network I'd ever had,

967
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:33,280
and it was just seemingly like the terms

968
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,280
were used throughout the entry.

969
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,000
We gotta get the Red Scare podcast guys on.

970
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,840
Yeah.

971
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,040
Oh, I assure you we don't.

972
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,600
What if it's just, do we know what it is?

973
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,440
Yep.

974
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,160
Oh, okay.

975
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,920
All right, nevermind.

976
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,920
It was like a history, historical analysis.

977
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,760
I'll explain, we'll explain later.

978
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,440
Uh oh, okay.

979
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,520
I don't know what it is either.

980
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,960
So I think this is the official Mench on a bench YouTube,

981
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,760
which has 82 subscribers.

982
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,600
Okay.

983
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,600
And there are 82 subscribers.

984
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,840
I thought you were saying 82,000 or like.

985
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,640
82 subscribers.

986
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,440
This video I'm about to play was posted 11 months ago.

987
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,920
It has 191 views.

988
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,920
And it is a song, there is music on the page.

989
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,760
I don't know if you saw this.

990
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,720
And again, it could be a fan page.

991
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,960
I don't know, I guess, but this is Saul the snow mench,

992
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,760
which is a character I don't think we've talked about yet.

993
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,920
Oh no.

994
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,680
And as you know, we're talking about,

995
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,320
it's just the Christmas version.

996
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,160
This is.

997
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,560
A little song we whipped up in honor of the newest member

998
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,000
of the mench family.

999
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,520
Saul is the snow mench.

1000
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,320
He's a very menchy soul.

1001
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,280
With a cool black hat and toilet wrapped

1002
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,040
around him to keep cold.

1003
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:56,040
Saul is the snow mench and he'll sing a song for you.

1004
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,280
Just touch his arm and you'll be charmed

1005
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,800
to listen to his tunes.

1006
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,640
He's painted.

1007
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,800
That's an ad for the toy.

1008
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,120
That's not, that's just an ad for the toy.

1009
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,480
I don't know if the actual character also plays music

1010
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,280
if you touch his arm.

1011
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,080
But then I think they also talk about his origin,

1012
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,280
which is like he was just the mench made a snowman, I think.

1013
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,120
I think it's a lie.

1014
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,200
Or Moshe.

1015
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,960
In his yard he was very, very proud.

1016
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,960
Oh, Saul is the snow mench with a fuzzy beard of felt.

1017
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:33,760
And he cannot hold any candles or he would surely melt.

1018
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,560
So that's, I guess an ad for the new,

1019
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,000
I guess maybe the snow mench was new as of last year.

1020
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,680
The story is that a man made a snowman.

1021
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,680
Yeah, it does have a lot.

1022
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,000
It does seem very influenced by Frosty the Snowman.

1023
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,960
Yeah, I think, you know, I think you might be right.

1024
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,360
That's what I was trying to place it.

1025
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,680
Yeah, I was also.

1026
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,520
I wasn't coming up with it.

1027
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,160
I don't criticize anyone's process,

1028
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,160
but yeah, I can see that, I can see that.

1029
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,480
Yeah, so that's on there.

1030
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,560
And there are, that's not the only music that's on.

1031
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,280
Okay, what else do we have?

1032
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,400
Okay, so imagine, you won't be able to see the video,

1033
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,200
but here is like, imagine, you know, Jib Jab,

1034
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,040
we all know Jib Jab.

1035
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:23,040
Imagine the characters from Jib Jab,

1036
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,680
but with the like felt heads

1037
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,240
of the mench on a bench characters.

1038
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,080
Can you see this?

1039
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:30,920
A little bit.

1040
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,760
Okay.

1041
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,600
That'd be a deal.

1042
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,440
It's some characters and.

1043
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,280
So yeah, they're like dancing,

1044
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,160
but then they're like human bodies.

1045
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,520
They're wearing sort of blue, like velvet.

1046
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,040
Are they gonna say off to do some campaigning?

1047
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,520
Well, here, here we go.

1048
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,800
This is only a minute long.

1049
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,080
A little dreidel, I made it out of clay.

1050
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,040
And when it's crying ready, a dreidel I shall play.

1051
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:56,280
24 karat magic mixed with dreidel.

1052
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,120
And then it's.

1053
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,720
Oh, I don't know, I don't know.

1054
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,400
Night on the note of let's have a party.

1055
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,760
We'll all gather around the table and give out a treat.

1056
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,280
See people that play with it.

1057
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,120
I just turn around.

1058
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,680
Dreidel is so lovely.

1059
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,240
Relax, just trying to say.

1060
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,080
Auto tune on this.

1061
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,480
It's so tired.

1062
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,040
It drops and then I'm here.

1063
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,160
Oh, dreidel, dreidel, dreidel.

1064
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,560
Now probably dubstep.

1065
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,640
Dubstep kind of beat there.

1066
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,720
So yeah, I don't know if you can see

1067
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,240
they're like kind of dancing.

1068
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,720
So I don't know this.

1069
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,600
This is different.

1070
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,960
Like this is weird.

1071
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,400
Cause like they have human bodies

1072
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,480
and they're like break dancing during it.

1073
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,800
Yeah, very strange.

1074
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,320
This isn't like the rest.

1075
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,160
Right.

1076
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,040
This feels like off tone, off game.

1077
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,560
Yeah, they really need some help here.

1078
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,360
Yeah, they need to, you know, streamline.

1079
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,280
So I think that they gotta get this mythology nailed down

1080
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,720
a little bit better and have it be a little more compelling.

1081
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,120
Sure. That's one.

1082
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,640
Two, I think there needs to be some original content

1083
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,720
that is created besides just the books.

1084
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,440
Right, yeah. Whether that's songs

1085
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,080
that are maybe a little better

1086
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,920
or it really feels like some animation thing

1087
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,680
should really be within grasp.

1088
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,840
Yeah, it is. Easy.

1089
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,920
The level of like dog shit, you know,

1090
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,200
like what kids YouTube animation,

1091
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,920
which is made by bots and frightening.

1092
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,040
But if we're really going for it,

1093
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,040
they need like a voice, a celebrity voice.

1094
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,280
Yeah, sure.

1095
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,880
Who are the top picks in this?

1096
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,520
Larry David.

1097
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,880
Larry David's good.

1098
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,600
Do you think Mensch for Larry David?

1099
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,320
Oh, well.

1100
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,800
But if he's sort of...

1101
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,880
He plays the opposite, you might say.

1102
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,920
Yeah, but he's so fun to like, he seems like,

1103
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,160
if he's just not saying something mean,

1104
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,720
I think you would hear his voice

1105
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,280
and maybe not think he was angry.

1106
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,960
Like he would be like such a nice guy.

1107
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,240
I don't think it's that hard.

1108
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,200
I got one.

1109
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,400
Evan Susser.

1110
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,000
I mean, that's a good idea.

1111
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,360
I wasn't gonna say it, but now that I hear it, I like it.

1112
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,600
Yeah. No, I'm serious.

1113
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,400
Larry David's a good one.

1114
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,760
I think old is, I mean Sandler just for moving,

1115
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,160
getting people excited is obvious,

1116
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,160
but he's maybe a little young still.

1117
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,000
Maybe older.

1118
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,560
But doing a silly older voice.

1119
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,240
Yeah, doing a silly older voice could be really good.

1120
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,080
Mm-hmm.

1121
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,800
Yeah, it's a tough...

1122
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,600
It's kind of narrow, I guess.

1123
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,960
Older and loveable.

1124
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,040
William Shatner.

1125
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,040
You know, not as a...

1126
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,400
Even though he is Jewish,

1127
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,000
I feel like doesn't have that same sort of Jewish...

1128
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,840
Yeah, I don't think I know who it is.

1129
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,640
It's in the Hanukkah song, that's how I know.

1130
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,480
That's true.

1131
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,960
Mark Cuban.

1132
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,800
Maybe.

1133
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,320
I know he didn't go in on it, but maybe he'd do a voice.

1134
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,880
And then I think for singing the song,

1135
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,400
they really should reach out to the Maccabeats.

1136
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,320
How familiar...

1137
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,480
No, I don't know what that is.

1138
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,880
I don't know what the Maccabeats are.

1139
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,200
The Maccabeats are an Orthodox Jewish singing sensation,

1140
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,160
acapella group.

1141
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,320
That I believe started...

1142
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,080
I don't wanna say...

1143
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,640
I'm not in college or somewhere,

1144
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,920
but then have gone on to be a bigger thing.

1145
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,400
And every year, for all the Jewish holidays,

1146
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,440
they come out with parodies of existing songs

1147
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,960
and really do have a pretty big following.

1148
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,200
And I'm gonna play a sample of one of their songs

1149
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,360
to give you guys a sense.

1150
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,200
Great.

1151
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:33,880
Oh.

1152
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,680
How does a hazmer need a sun?

1153
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,440
Oh no, no.

1154
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,800
Raised in a village with his four brothers

1155
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,560
in a Judeo-Prophet's river.

1156
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,600
He sets high a kiss of the pressure

1157
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,800
to grow up to be a hero in command.

1158
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,520
When the king came around,

1159
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,880
his son said, I'll be my piece of sing.

1160
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,720
Yeah, that's good.

1161
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,640
You know, my favorite genres of music, I'd say,

1162
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,080
is Hamilton parody.

1163
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,200
Spotify, it's all they give me.

1164
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,040
It's in me.

1165
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,880
Calling you to Maccabeats.

1166
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:02,880
All right.

1167
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,720
Wow.

1168
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,560
That's great.

1169
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,000
So, you know, I think if you get those guys in.

1170
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,040
Yeah.

1171
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,000
So, and that, I think, they really do have a pretty big,

1172
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,360
also, Orthodox Jewish audience.

1173
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,000
So you get them in.

1174
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,840
Right.

1175
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,400
Then you get in the secular Jewish celebrity.

1176
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,240
Right.

1177
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,160
And you put up some, you know,

1178
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,800
good original animated material.

1179
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,680
I think this thing could, again, not really take off

1180
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,080
because there's only so much of an audience for it.

1181
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,000
Now, wait a minute.

1182
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,720
I think, wait, what you were playing was just,

1183
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,720
that was like variants on the dreidel song, correct?

1184
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,560
Yes.

1185
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,400
I think that the snowmench,

1186
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,880
when you press the snowmench,

1187
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,000
I think what he plays is variants on the dreidel song

1188
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,760
done by the Maccabeats.

1189
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,040
They already are in the partnership?

1190
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,920
I think that they have made the connection, yeah.

1191
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,760
Well, you know what?

1192
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,600
I'm pretty sure.

1193
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,960
I took my hat because that was.

1194
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,800
Yeah.

1195
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,400
That's a pretty good connection.

1196
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,240
They're fix up.

1197
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:03,760
They're like, they're slightly on top of it.

1198
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,680
I do remember like in elementary school,

1199
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,880
like music class,

1200
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,840
that we would do a little Christmas concert.

1201
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,880
And at least one, if not two years, we sang Ohanica.

1202
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,880
And looking back, I think maybe the teacher,

1203
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,520
our music teacher was Jewish

1204
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,080
because we sang that song

1205
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,600
and we learned the story of Hanica.

1206
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,960
There were no Jewish kids in my elementary school classes,

1207
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,120
but I did learn the story.

1208
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,760
The story then cemented in my mind

1209
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,000
by an issue of a Marvel holiday special.

1210
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,720
Like what's the annual holiday issues?

1211
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,960
I can't remember who was the thing or Kitty Pride,

1212
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,120
the two most prominent Jewish members

1213
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,680
of the Marvel universe telling the story.

1214
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,760
But yeah, looking back, I'm like,

1215
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,760
it must have been the teacher

1216
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,760
because I don't remember any other.

1217
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,880
I don't think I met a person of the Jewish faith

1218
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,640
until high school, otherwise,

1219
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,800
until like a teacher in high school.

1220
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,360
And she had converted when she got married.

1221
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,680
Interesting.

1222
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,600
You know what, also real quick a thought

1223
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,160
just to do some music,

1224
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,280
who wrote an original Hanica song,

1225
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,920
Mr. Stephen Page of the Bare Naked Ladies.

1226
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,760
Wow.

1227
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,880
From the Bare Naked Ladies Christmas album.

1228
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,280
That would be great.

1229
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,680
Cause they do cover a few traditional songs,

1230
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,720
but then he also wrote an original Hanica song.

1231
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,560
So I think he's got to get out there.

1232
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,680
We streamed a Stephen Page concert

1233
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,800
during the pandemic as well.

1234
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,200
We did, like the second week.

1235
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,480
The second week, and he really had a lot of tech.

1236
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,480
He had a lot of tech problems.

1237
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,280
When he was currently live, do you know?

1238
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,120
Yeah, yeah.

1239
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:40,960
I don't know if you-

1240
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,640
It was, was it maybe just in Zoom?

1241
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,480
I think it was just on a Zoom.

1242
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,800
They were doing, yeah, that was happening a lot

1243
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,920
where you would have to like,

1244
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,120
we paid like $10 or something.

1245
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,880
Kind of made less of an impact

1246
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,600
than everyone's seeing in Imagine two weeks in.

1247
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,200
Yeah, that's true.

1248
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,280
Cohen Brothers World guy.

1249
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,280
Like, you know who's so good on the Monica Lewinsky

1250
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,000
American Crime Story is Fred Melamed.

1251
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,400
Yeah. Oh yeah.

1252
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,880
Get Melamed as a bench on the bench.

1253
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:11,720
Oh yeah.

1254
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,800
You know what?

1255
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,320
That's for the live action version.

1256
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1257
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,000
Oh.

1258
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,960
You know, that's pretty good.

1259
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,240
Or maybe that's just because of his thing.

1260
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,080
Right.

1261
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,480
Like that's, you know.

1262
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,280
Playing a live action in a big-

1263
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,920
Just send this podcast to some executives.

1264
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,760
Yes.

1265
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,280
Yeah, kind of genuinely.

1266
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,520
And then you're telling the story on,

1267
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,440
well, I was actually just,

1268
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,840
I was riffing on a podcast.

1269
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,320
And then now, but I realized I had the take and the actor.

1270
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,160
Yeah.

1271
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,280
And he's here right here with me.

1272
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,360
Ladies and gentlemen.

1273
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,720
And doing the music, Mr. Steven Page.

1274
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,480
Yeah, perfect.

1275
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,320
Here he is.

1276
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,400
Well, thank you guys for helping me fix this.

1277
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,360
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1278
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,200
We also even have,

1279
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,360
we have to talk too about like,

1280
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,440
what you would do with the theme park land.

1281
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,800
The theme park of Mentsch on the bench.

1282
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1283
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,120
Man, that's a tough one.

1284
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,840
Well, you, I think, Mike,

1285
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,960
you were just telling me that there was a Christmas themed

1286
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,760
theme park that you grew up.

1287
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,600
Oh, see, yeah, yeah.

1288
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,400
Growing up, there was something, what place called,

1289
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,640
there's many Santa's villages around the country

1290
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,720
and world probably.

1291
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,560
But yeah, there was one very close

1292
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,360
that also had an ice skating arena or like rink,

1293
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,240
the big one, my sister took lessons.

1294
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,080
And it was closed.

1295
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,200
And you asked, you were surprised that Santa's village

1296
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,640
was closed in the winter.

1297
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,480
Yes.

1298
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,320
Which, yes, it was.

1299
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,880
It was only open, the ice skating was open in the winter.

1300
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,160
So I think, so what are you doing for the theme park?

1301
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,160
That's the real question.

1302
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,400
What's kind of like.

1303
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,640
Well, or is it a land?

1304
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,640
Or is it a land somewhere else?

1305
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,440
Can it just, can it be a Moshe's village?

1306
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,000
Do we just start with that?

1307
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,480
Yeah, well, there's a story,

1308
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,960
there's just a story where the Mentsch on the bench

1309
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,680
goes to Africa.

1310
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,000
Which is a book you can buy.

1311
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,280
Well, it seems, it kind of seems like it's alluding,

1312
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,400
like he's going there to convert people.

1313
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,360
The Mentsch? A little bit.

1314
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,320
You know, it's strange,

1315
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:06,360
cause Judaism is not a prophylatizing religion.

1316
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,200
Right.

1317
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,320
So I'm kind of surprised to hear that.

1318
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,320
I mean, I don't think, I don't know,

1319
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,960
maybe I'm reading too much into it.

1320
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,200
You know, but that's sort of.

1321
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,880
I think that honestly the path

1322
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,240
for Mentsch on the bench getting a theme park

1323
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,720
is connecting with one of these

1324
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:27,120
nut job, far right, fundamentalist Christian theme parks.

1325
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,120
Because a lot of those guys

1326
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,240
really do have a fondness for the Jews.

1327
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,160
Because it's like in the prophecy

1328
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,680
that the Jews will still exist and be in Israel.

1329
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,200
And that's why you get all of these

1330
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,920
fundamentalist extremists who are very pro-Israel.

1331
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,120
Right.

1332
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,720
So maybe you just, you know,

1333
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,520
do a partnership with one of these museums

1334
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,800
that has dinosaurs walking with cavemen or something.

1335
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,640
Yes.

1336
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,320
Strange Red Fellows for startup capital

1337
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,160
is what you're saying.

1338
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,560
And then there's a little,

1339
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:03,760
Moishas village where people just tucked away.

1340
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,600
Tucked away.

1341
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,440
Tucked away.

1342
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,280
Look.

1343
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,120
Behind the ark.

1344
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,320
You don't even see it when you drive up.

1345
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,560
And then, you know, food,

1346
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,480
like there could be a lot of great food.

1347
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,320
Sure.

1348
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,160
Yeah.

1349
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,400
You know, they could have the potato latkes.

1350
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,240
Sure.

1351
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,080
They're around.

1352
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,800
They could have the chocolate gelt.

1353
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,680
They could have a Souf Gonyot.

1354
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,720
I've not had that.

1355
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,560
I haven't had that.

1356
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:30,560
Well, you might know it by its more common English name,

1357
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,920
jelly donuts.

1358
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,760
Wow.

1359
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,800
Which is also a tradition of Hanukkah

1360
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,120
because it also requires oil.

1361
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,240
And as you gentlemen may have noticed with me,

1362
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,680
I brought a pink box.

1363
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,800
You got the famous pink box.

1364
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,640
Wow.

1365
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,320
Of jelly donuts to you guys.

1366
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,920
Geez.

1367
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,280
So, the second night of Hanukkah.

1368
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,080
Well, since you've given us permission,

1369
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:54,360
I would say that this makes you a real mensch.

1370
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,720
Ah, it feels good to try.

1371
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,080
It felt weird when you said it, Scott.

1372
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:58,920
I didn't want to.

1373
00:50:58,920 --> 00:50:59,760
I don't want to do it again.

1374
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,880
The box closed after you said it, Scott.

1375
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,960
No, no, I don't get one now.

1376
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,120
A serious man.

1377
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,760
No, no, that was nice.

1378
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,520
Yeah, so I guess, I think that it really, at this point,

1379
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,800
it's definitely much more of a land

1380
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,640
where there could be the bench.

1381
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,720
He could take pictures on the bench.

1382
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,080
Is that the ride vehicle?

1383
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,360
Oh, you're on, you sit on a bench.

1384
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,840
You sit on the bench and you're going,

1385
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,760
and they each, you know what, in eight nights,

1386
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,800
that works out really well for each stages of a ride.

1387
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,280
So you could have things happening inside of a house.

1388
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,280
I think, again, we want to get away from not the temple

1389
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,800
that was destroyed, you know?

1390
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,920
Come up with more American house or something

1391
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,200
where there's some story going on

1392
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,920
and you're on the bench with Mensch

1393
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,400
and you're seeing scenes kind of happen.

1394
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,240
That's pretty good.

1395
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,880
And you're seeing all these other characters too.

1396
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,840
Yeah. Yeah.

1397
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,640
Because if you hit religious Judaism and cultural Judaism,

1398
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,120
you'll reach a much bigger audience.

1399
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,160
That's what I'm thinking.

1400
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,000
Yeah.

1401
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,160
Oh yeah, you could just have it,

1402
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,160
one is like you're meeting Mitzvah Moose.

1403
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,600
Yes, you're meeting Mitzvah Moose.

1404
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,440
That's like a stage.

1405
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,480
And then you're all together at the end celebrating.

1406
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,320
Like, Mensch on the bench has to collect all of his friends

1407
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,880
for the big Hanukkah, for the eighth night of Hanukkah.

1408
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,720
Right.

1409
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,760
And then it's like, you know, getting to him,

1410
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,640
it's like, oh, Moose, you gotta come.

1411
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,480
Uh-huh.

1412
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,320
And you like, you gotta come.

1413
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,280
Kind of the Hanukkah hero.

1414
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,360
It's like a big party,

1415
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,200
like you have secret lives of pets.

1416
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,040
Yes.

1417
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:27,880
Yeah.

1418
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:28,720
That's pretty good.

1419
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:33,360
Yeah, what Dreidel dog is like biting something.

1420
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,240
So he does whatever they're planning to pull him away.

1421
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,240
So that's a whole, that's like a little development.

1422
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,040
It's like, we gotta make more latkes.

1423
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,080
And it's the first ever ride that has like a latke smell.

1424
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:45,920
Yes.

1425
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,480
Which they've never done on a ride as far as I know.

1426
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,320
I think.

1427
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,280
Is it not space mountain doesn't do that?

1428
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,560
All right, I guess maybe no ride does it.

1429
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:56,720
Yeah.

1430
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,560
Mitzvah Moose has too many Mitzvahs to do.

1431
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,400
Right.

1432
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,000
Trying to do so many kind things all at once.

1433
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,280
Uh-huh.

1434
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,240
Yeah, like reading to orphans over here,

1435
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,080
but then with their foot.

1436
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,760
And then of course you're being chased by the Greeks.

1437
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,120
Who wanna kill you.

1438
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:13,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1439
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,800
For being Jewish.

1440
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,920
That's like a little minimized.

1441
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,800
So it's like the Ursula scene on Little Sons of Sam.

1442
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,640
Right, exactly.

1443
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,480
The mermaid ride.

1444
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,320
There's one scene.

1445
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,160
You kind of like, it's just can't say that.

1446
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,080
Just in the background, there's a bunch of Greek people

1447
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,760
going like, ah.

1448
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,400
We were defeated.

1449
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,080
There's just one scene of a Greek guard inspecting genitals

1450
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,240
to see who's Jewish.

1451
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,720
Just one.

1452
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,560
Just one.

1453
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,280
Just one scene of that.

1454
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,360
We're not talking lots of scenes of that.

1455
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,480
That'd be weird.

1456
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,320
Right.

1457
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,160
I think that's pretty good.

1458
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,000
Wow.

1459
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,840
Yeah.

1460
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,880
And then at the end, they're all hanging out

1461
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:46,840
on a bench together.

1462
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,440
His bench was empty at the beginning,

1463
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,560
but now it's full of friends.

1464
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,400
It's full of friends.

1465
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,240
And at the end, for some reason,

1466
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,400
all the characters have human bodies

1467
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,640
and they're break dancing.

1468
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,480
Yes.

1469
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,640
That's also part of it.

1470
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,400
That's part of it.

1471
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,160
That's part of the party.

1472
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,560
I mean, we're probably winding down,

1473
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:05,280
but I will say there is a place that this could go,

1474
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,720
were it to be a land.

1475
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,240
There is a potential,

1476
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,440
I think they'd happily have it,

1477
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,920
because I was just curious,

1478
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,240
well, is there,

1479
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,240
I just Googled Jewish theme park in general.

1480
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:22,000
Is there anything that's made a point

1481
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,200
of having a consistent ride or land?

1482
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,600
And I came across something called Plame Park.

1483
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,440
Plame?

1484
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,280
Plame.

1485
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,120
You know what I mean?

1486
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,560
I watched a video,

1487
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,400
and I think I'm saying it right.

1488
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,280
I guess it, I don't know,

1489
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,400
it translates to where they also call it

1490
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,360
the Park of Wonders.

1491
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,680
It was planned for the Demona Israel.

1492
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,080
This place never got off the ground.

1493
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,640
And I think I know why.

1494
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,240
So this was to be a park that celebrated

1495
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:56,040
and was rooted in Jewish tradition and heritage.

1496
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,040
And I looked at what,

1497
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,640
this is being proposed like three, four years ago,

1498
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,720
and I looked at what was supposed to be there.

1499
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,440
One of the proposed rides is based on Splash Mountain

1500
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,200
with the theme modified to show six work days,

1501
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,000
then a calm zone after a drop

1502
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,520
that signifies the day of rest.

1503
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,360
Okay.

1504
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,200
All right.

1505
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,040
All right.

1506
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:20,880
A bloom ride,

1507
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,520
but that shows you that's about how the week is hectic.

1508
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,920
But then you get to-

1509
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,840
So the splash is like Shabbos?

1510
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,480
Well, what is, yeah, what is-

1511
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,320
Or the other-

1512
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,280
Or the book of Genesis?

1513
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,120
Thursday.

1514
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,320
The seventh day he rested?

1515
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:38,720
I have a little bit of information and in fact a video.

1516
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,560
So-

1517
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,400
And do they insist on the song

1518
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,960
of the South characters being in it too?

1519
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:46,960
It wouldn't be a bloom ride without our pals, the Brayers.

1520
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:51,160
This is a video that was made five years ago.

1521
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:56,160
So this is, the beginning of it is a wise grandpa

1522
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,840
and then like an iPad stuck kid are having an argument

1523
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:05,280
about whether Jewish heritage is boring or not.

1524
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,600
I will say that this argument is boring.

1525
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,480
So I won't show you that part, maybe 0.1 for a kid.

1526
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,040
But then some magical stuff starts to happen

1527
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,720
and I'll let the video take it from here

1528
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,680
and it'll show you a little bit

1529
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,760
of what's going on at Plame Park.

1530
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,400
History's awakening.

1531
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,240
Wow.

1532
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:31,640
What's that?

1533
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,520
I don't know.

1534
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,560
It looks like something from the future.

1535
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,680
A weird iPhone kind of thing landed.

1536
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,520
Sliding up.

1537
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,280
Grandpa, press on that.

1538
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:49,080
Step inside the Jewish wonderland, Park Plame,

1539
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:52,640
where thousands of years of Jewish values and heritage

1540
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,640
is brought to life right before your eyes.

1541
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,400
At the very center of the park is its heart,

1542
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,240
towering above all the Jacobs Ladder.

1543
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,160
Whoa, Jacobs Ladder is the weenie?

1544
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,560
Yeah, it looks, sorry, I was not really good.

1545
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,920
It looks like a big DNA strand.

1546
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,360
And then there's one of those SeaWorld Magic Mountain

1547
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:16,600
kind of like the tower with the big observation deck

1548
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,440
that goes up in the top.

1549
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,800
Yeah, the weenie is Jacobs Ladder is wrapping around it.

1550
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,200
The weenie is like the castle you know.

1551
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,080
Yeah, this is all CGI, like what it might look like

1552
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,240
that we're looking at.

1553
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,840
Yeah, Jacobs Ladder.

1554
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,640
Then, head in the north and then spurge on to the physical.

1555
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,680
The entire park can be seen from the top of this ride.

1556
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,480
Wow, Grandpa, we have to go there.

1557
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,880
Behold, the people of the roller coaster,

1558
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:43,200
the high-speed twirling ride that traverses pages

1559
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,920
and books of the Jewish people.

1560
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,280
Oh my God, oh my God, okay.

1561
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,240
Yeah, yeah, that's really good.

1562
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,560
That's really good.

1563
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,400
Wow.

1564
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,120
Yeah, yeah, we're looking at a roller coaster

1565
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:57,360
that is pouring out of a big set of like old mahogany books.

1566
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,040
That is so good.

1567
00:57:59,040 --> 00:57:59,880
What do they call it?

1568
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,040
The book of the.

1569
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:06,040
I didn't, I couldn't, yeah, which holy book did they say?

1570
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,720
Yeah, let me see, sorry.

1571
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,120
Well, they ran into an issue

1572
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,840
because they wanted to be the Torah,

1573
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,360
but then that would have to be the scrolls

1574
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,120
and that was probably an architectural nightmare.

1575
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:14,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1576
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,800
So then it's like,

1577
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,240
oh, it's a hard cover for Talmud or something.

1578
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,720
The people of the book roller coaster was the name of it.

1579
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,160
How insane is this video, this proposal,

1580
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,440
these fully rendered rides?

1581
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,280
Yeah.

1582
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,400
I was like more than I expected to find

1583
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,960
in Googling Jewish theme park.

1584
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:31,800
Wow.

1585
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,920
And then, but then here's a little more explanation

1586
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,000
of the flume that I described.

1587
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,840
Wow.

1588
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,680
So much.

1589
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,520
Thanks.

1590
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,520
It's not free really.

1591
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,720
And what's that?

1592
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,920
The Shabbat attraction lets the visitor experience

1593
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,880
the contrast between the craziness of modern life

1594
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,200
and the tranquility of Shabbat.

1595
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,400
Shabbat is the time for loved ones,

1596
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,880
personal reflection and a connection to the almighty.

1597
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,120
Wow.

1598
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,840
So what's going on here?

1599
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:03,480
It's like you're in like a busy subway station.

1600
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,320
Yeah.

1601
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,920
So bustle of modern life.

1602
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,200
It's basically, if people are familiar

1603
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,920
with the Jurassic park ride,

1604
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,240
you're going on a ride and instead of,

1605
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,000
well, what's the name now?

1606
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,320
It's not the T-Rex anymore.

1607
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,160
The Indominus.

1608
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,000
The Indominus.

1609
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,920
Instead of that popping up, it's just the word Friday.

1610
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,440
And it looks like a freeway sign.

1611
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,280
Freeway sign.

1612
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,080
Because you're always, you're on the subway

1613
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:28,040
or the freeway. and then you just go down.

1614
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,440
Yeah, it kind of looks like a subway tunnel.

1615
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,440
And then it's a Shabbos.

1616
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:36,760
In like glowing gold, kind of like reminiscent of,

1617
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:40,000
you know, like the first Superman movie font,

1618
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,440
like is light rays shooting out of.

1619
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,400
And then you're surrounded by video screens

1620
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,520
of like a Jewish mom bringing food to a table.

1621
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,360
Right.

1622
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,520
A bunch of children patiently listening

1623
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:55,720
to their father give a speech before they're allowed to sit.

1624
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,880
It's just a video of that.

1625
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,560
Yeah. It's like, it's a, look, it is part screen ride.

1626
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,120
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Unfortunately.

1627
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,880
But what's on the screen is inspiring and important.

1628
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:05,720
Yeah, that's true.

1629
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,440
A little girl lighting a candle full of wonder.

1630
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,840
So, I mean, I love it.

1631
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,800
Yeah. It would be better with robots, but.

1632
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:12,760
Yeah, sure.

1633
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:16,000
But he used to say they aren't somewhere in that attraction.

1634
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,840
Right.

1635
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:20,000
A guy saying, I want those papers on my desk

1636
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,880
by the end of Friday night.

1637
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:23,800
Hi, wow.

1638
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,640
Man.

1639
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,480
That is crazy.

1640
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,080
I'm wondering, are there proposals

1641
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,720
for like all world religion kind of theme?

1642
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,640
Like float by the Bodhi tree

1643
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,040
as the Buddha sits under it contemplating.

1644
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,440
Yeah, good pitch.

1645
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,280
Pretty good.

1646
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,120
Yeah, Buddha.

1647
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:38,960
Rub his belly.

1648
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:39,800
Wow.

1649
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:40,640
It's soft.

1650
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,280
Does it say it's coming like soon at the end of it?

1651
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,160
I believe so. Yes.

1652
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,920
This is, yeah, this was from 2016

1653
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:54,160
and there are almost no Google results for this

1654
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,120
besides the initial story about it,

1655
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,640
despite them saying that this idea represents a cultural

1656
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:04,360
and educational game changer relating to millennials

1657
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,120
in a language relevant to them.

1658
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,720
Millennials were like, I'm not so sold on this religion

1659
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,840
until I rode a roller coaster through some books.

1660
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,720
And then I'm on board.

1661
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:19,000
This park will unite Jews everywhere around the world

1662
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,240
with a common vision and values.

1663
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,960
It'll like, this is gonna have like an incredible effect

1664
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:28,520
on harmony within the religion, within all people, I guess.

1665
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,920
No, it says only Jews.

1666
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,360
All people are welcome at this park.

1667
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:38,000
I would love to go through the books for sure.

1668
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,080
They ask to see your, you have to do a 23 and me

1669
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,640
before you go in.

1670
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,240
Wow.

1671
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,840
Anyway, and so this is proposed by a rabbi

1672
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,560
as opposed to Mensh on a bench.

1673
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,480
Okay.

1674
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,760
Right, that is interesting.

1675
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:58,680
It seems like it's much even more religiously rooted

1676
01:01:58,680 --> 01:01:59,840
than Mensh on the bench.

1677
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:03,560
So maybe Mensh on the bench is not like orthodox enough

1678
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,960
for this park?

1679
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,480
No, I think this guy seems willing to make a deal.

1680
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,600
Is it like sacrilegious to like be like,

1681
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,320
yeah, and the roller coaster goes through the books?

1682
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:15,640
I don't know.

1683
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,920
I would be curious to get some opinions

1684
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,240
from some rabbis on this.

1685
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:23,440
Any more or less sacrilegious than Mitzvah Moose?

1686
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,800
The moose with a menorah for handlers?

1687
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:27,640
Well, that's what I meant.

1688
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:28,840
I just want to know what the level is here.

1689
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,840
Yeah, I mean, you know, you want to engage people.

1690
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,080
I don't think there's anything

1691
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,600
specifically forbidden about this.

1692
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,560
Right.

1693
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,480
I don't know.

1694
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,320
It's a good question.

1695
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,560
You put a hole in the holy books?

1696
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,400
Right, yeah.

1697
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,240
Are you kidding?

1698
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,160
Well, they're not real though.

1699
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,880
Yeah, cause they're like generic books.

1700
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,400
They're not, yeah.

1701
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,680
So as long as you can prove to a rabbi

1702
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,920
that there is no sacred text in the fake book,

1703
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,120
you can run as many coaster cars through it as you want.

1704
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,400
Yeah, but it's the thrill.

1705
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,640
It's trying to make you like associate like thrills

1706
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,080
with the religion.

1707
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,320
The thrill of learning.

1708
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,480
The thrill of learning, yeah.

1709
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,320
Yeah.

1710
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,120
Okay, all right.

1711
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:09,840
So if this gets off the ground in Israel,

1712
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:13,240
then maybe there is a place for the mention of the bench.

1713
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,600
Israel has kind of adopted a mention on the bench.

1714
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,440
The baseball team in Israel,

1715
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,200
like uses mention on the bench as a mascot, one of them.

1716
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,600
Oh, whoa.

1717
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,600
That's something that they've.

1718
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,440
Right.

1719
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,280
Huh.

1720
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,440
Oh, that's priming it.

1721
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,360
Then the characters around for photo ops and hugs.

1722
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,600
Well, yeah, there's a walk around mentions

1723
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,480
cause there was one at a Red Sox game

1724
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,840
for Jewish heritage night.

1725
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:40,840
There was a walk around motion wearing a Red Sox cap.

1726
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,800
Yeah, there's a guy we know who played baseball,

1727
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,800
my only baseball.

1728
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,040
And there's a picture of him on the website of mention

1729
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,920
on a bench next to at a press conference

1730
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,080
with a big mensch character.

1731
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,520
Oh yeah.

1732
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,080
Cody Decker, you know, you remember him.

1733
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,520
Oh yeah, he's on the Israeli team.

1734
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,800
Oh, oh, there you go.

1735
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:01,760
He was the one who was behind this whole adopting it thing.

1736
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:02,600
Wow, really?

1737
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,420
I didn't know that.

1738
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:04,260
That's correct.

1739
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:05,840
So that's why he's on the website.

1740
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,600
Which is the thing I do want to talk about real quick too.

1741
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,880
But politics in the state of Israel.

1742
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:11,720
Yeah.

1743
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1744
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,560
All right, gentlemen, let's hunker down.

1745
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:19,400
The website, there's like a hall of fame

1746
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,440
for the mensch on a bench.

1747
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,280
Did you see this?

1748
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,360
No, I didn't see this.

1749
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:25,200
So it's basically like, at first I was thinking like,

1750
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,240
you know, it's like all Jewish celebrities,

1751
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,160
but like, I don't think it is like David Krumholz is on,

1752
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,440
on there's a picture of him holding,

1753
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,960
but then like Whoopi Goldberg,

1754
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,160
Jason Alexander is holding a mensch

1755
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,240
and then Cody's on there too.

1756
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,400
And I was like, can we get us on

1757
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,880
or just at least you on there?

1758
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,360
Yeah, I mean.

1759
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:48,680
I feel like it's the mensch wall of fame.

1760
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:50,600
And like, I don't know.

1761
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,560
We're talking about wikis and caring about wikis.

1762
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,680
This is what you're after.

1763
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:00,120
The website says Neil reads all tweets and emails himself.

1764
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:00,960
So.

1765
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:01,920
You know what?

1766
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:02,760
I believe it.

1767
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,200
I mean, he can't listen to the episode probably.

1768
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,680
He's probably gonna listen to this episode.

1769
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,080
We've been a little too negative.

1770
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:11,920
Oh, yeah.

1771
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:12,760
Isn't it?

1772
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,800
Oh, man.

1773
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,880
It's paywall though.

1774
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:15,720
All right.

1775
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,720
I like the zebra from Zaraon.

1776
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:18,560
Okay.

1777
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:19,400
Okay.

1778
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,360
Why we do it?

1779
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:24,960
If we say, because we're worried Jimmy Fallon might hear it

1780
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,040
or that Neil Hoffman might hear it.

1781
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:27,880
Right.

1782
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,320
No, I really, now that I'm thinking

1783
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,200
that he's listening to it,

1784
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:33,440
I commend him for trying to get this off the ground.

1785
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:34,800
It's, I mean, certainly look,

1786
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,520
when I was a kid and the Hanukkah song

1787
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,720
by Adam Simmler came out,

1788
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,200
it was the greatest thing that ever happened in my life.

1789
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,040
Sure.

1790
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,400
When you are, you were so starved.

1791
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,080
There's so much Christmas stuff

1792
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,800
and there is so little Hanukkah stuff.

1793
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:47,640
Right.

1794
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,880
And so the idea, even if it could use some improvement,

1795
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,520
the fact that there is anything to get

1796
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,040
that's like a Hanukkah thing,

1797
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,080
it's a good thing.

1798
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,440
Now, is there room for improvement?

1799
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,280
Yeah.

1800
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,120
But.

1801
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:01,000
But that's what, it's productive and forward thinking

1802
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,320
that you're saying any of this.

1803
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,760
This is not a doom thing.

1804
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,640
We're not even remotely.

1805
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,240
We've been punching up Mention on the Bench.

1806
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,560
We haven't said, just throw the whole thing out.

1807
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,040
You just create a whole new thing.

1808
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:10,880
Absolutely not.

1809
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:11,720
So he's got something.

1810
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:12,560
He's got something.

1811
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,320
The Christmas could evolve and grow.

1812
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,880
And when there's the theme park land

1813
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:19,280
and the animated shorts and you on the website,

1814
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,160
then they'll really be cooking with gas.

1815
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,160
Yeah.

1816
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,640
I do, the last thing I'd like to say

1817
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,600
is that there's an article from last year

1818
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,680
that the headline is,

1819
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:29,160
Hanukkah's Mention on a Bench is safe from COVID.

1820
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,200
That's good.

1821
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,880
Says creator, Boston native, Neil Hoffman.

1822
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:34,720
And it's been.

1823
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,560
And he said, we're very thankful that like his friends

1824
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:39,600
of the magical variety,

1825
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:43,040
we have found that elves and Santa and Menches are immune

1826
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,400
because Dr. Fauci said that Santa was immune.

1827
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,760
Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease

1828
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,480
expert confirmed that Santa is immune to COVID last week.

1829
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:52,640
That happened.

1830
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,560
I guess it did.

1831
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:55,560
NORAD also said it will continue its tradition

1832
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:58,880
of tracking Santa this year as he travels across the globe.

1833
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,360
Despite being immune, Mention on a Bench

1834
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,240
is being an example to non-magical children

1835
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,400
by practicing safe guidelines.

1836
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,200
So I just want to make everyone aware that in canon,

1837
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,000
Mention cannot contract COVID.

1838
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,120
That's canon according to the creator.

1839
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:15,160
Incredibly powerful.

1840
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,040
So he has some power.

1841
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:21,680
That does make me want to see a line of people with COVID

1842
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,800
all cough in his face and him just sit there with a smile.

1843
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:26,640
That's, yeah.

1844
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,480
Doesn't affect me.

1845
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,320
I'm fine.

1846
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,520
I'm a little skeptical of this claim

1847
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:34,520
because in some of the ultra orthodox communities,

1848
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,920
they've been resistant to vaccines.

1849
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,480
You weren't the most co-operative

1850
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:42,280
with the social distancing and many of the guidelines.

1851
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,640
So I'm a little worried that he's just going around

1852
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,480
till I'll never find him.

1853
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,120
He's immune.

1854
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:50,120
Maybe this hasn't been 100%.

1855
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:55,960
It's a what's his name?

1856
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,440
Not a wild about-

1857
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,280
Situation.

1858
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,120
Aaron Rodgers.

1859
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,680
Aaron Rodgers, yeah.

1860
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:04,800
Yeah, yeah, I'm immunized to it.

1861
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,600
Don't worry about it.

1862
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:10,280
We said non-magical children, but I am a magical child.

1863
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:12,760
I always have been, so I'm fine.

1864
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,480
Right, right.

1865
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,800
Wow.

1866
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:20,160
All right, well, thank you so much for doing this deep dive.

1867
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,120
May you remain magically immune yourself.

1868
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:25,960
Thank you.

1869
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:27,360
And thanks for the donuts.

1870
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,120
You survived podcast the ride, Evan Susser.

1871
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,880
Thank you so much.

1872
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:32,920
Exit to the gift shop.

1873
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,000
Anything you'd like to plug?

1874
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,320
When does this come out?

1875
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,160
Soon.

1876
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,760
Still within the, there's only a few more lights to go

1877
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:42,040
on the antlers.

1878
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:47,040
For any listeners who also get the Doughboyz Patreon

1879
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:53,800
on December 7th, my investigation of a hot dog transgression

1880
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,200
between two friends, it's called Man Bites Dog,

1881
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,200
where one friend ate another friend's hot dog,

1882
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,360
it was brought to the attention to the Doughboyz,

1883
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,600
and I've done a deep dive investigation,

1884
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,720
and it comes out December 7th on the Doughboyz Patreon,

1885
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:13,520
and then I will be available later for everyone.

1886
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,080
Yeah, you described this to me a couple of weeks ago,

1887
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,600
and it sounds like you did a ton of work.

1888
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,920
It's quite the ordeal.

1889
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:20,920
It is quite the ordeal.

1890
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,120
You said the phrase hot dog transgression,

1891
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,720
and Mike looked right at me.

1892
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,200
I don't know anything about, I am not involved in this.

1893
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,680
No, I know, I just wanted to see what you're like,

1894
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,440
if your face lit up, or you like fell out of your chair.

1895
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,000
I'm intrigued, certainly.

1896
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:35,240
Yeah.

1897
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,200
Well, hey, that's great, yeah,

1898
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:41,480
go subscribe to the Doughboyz Patreon,

1899
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:43,800
and maybe they need your help more than ever

1900
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:44,960
in this holiday season.

1901
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,440
Maybe stick around there through the month of December,

1902
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,120
you might hear some other familiar voices.

1903
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,080
That's right, that's right.

1904
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:51,960
Something to plug in.

1905
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,000
Oh!

1906
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,080
What's that?

1907
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:54,920
Oh, you guys.

1908
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:55,760
Yeah.

1909
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:58,520
No, I don't know, I just did it a few weeks ago.

1910
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:01,720
It's Scott and I, is that a rune, can we rune it?

1911
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:02,560
I think that's fine, yeah.

1912
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,400
Yeah, I think it's okay.

1913
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,640
Did we tell you that, Jason?

1914
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,480
Are we telling you this now?

1915
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,800
We did it together, because you had just done it,

1916
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,080
apparently, like that was, I guess.

1917
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,920
They were very explicit.

1918
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,960
This sectioning off is only because Jason has just done it.

1919
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:17,080
I have, I had just done it, yes,

1920
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:20,360
but I didn't realize you guys, I mean, that's good.

1921
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,360
We're catching up with your Doughboyz numbers.

1922
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,440
Yeah, sure.

1923
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,480
But maybe everybody's on together.

1924
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:27,080
Well, look, this is great,

1925
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:31,240
everybody's crisscrossing Patreons all month long,

1926
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:34,200
and keep it tuned to this one that you're already on,

1927
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,040
Podcast the Ride the Second Gate

1928
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,860
for three bonus episodes every month.

1929
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,800
Hey, happy Hanukkah, everybody.

1930
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:42,640
Happy Hanukkah.

1931
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,600
Happy Hanukkah.

1932
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,600
Merry Christmas.

1933
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:46,560
Most important.

1934
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,560
All right, thanks guys, yay.
