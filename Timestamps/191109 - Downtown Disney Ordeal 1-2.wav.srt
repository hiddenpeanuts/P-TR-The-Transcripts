1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
...Dark!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Darkness falls out on the street, Evil is its head.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Get your crazy shake to go, And your fried doughnut bread.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Beignets.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The villains threaten this sacred place, This downtown shopping mall.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We must defend the Lego store, And the Splitsville bowling balls.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, We must protect our AP discount meals.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, With secrets does the Earl of Sandwich conceal.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Boys, boys, my cousin has been taken by evil forces that have inhabited Downtown Disney.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In order to find them, he will need to thoroughly discuss every aspect of them all.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Stores, restaurants, both of the Starbucks.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We have 15 daily very necessary episodes and much to do so. I will be there to guide you and keep your conversations from getting too off topic for...

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
...boring.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Downtown Disney ordeal. Why do we do this to ourselves?

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Downtown Disney ordeal, Level 1 Stage 2.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This is our second day of our newest daily event. I'm Jason Sheridan here with Mike Carlson.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Our newest daily event. It's new. It's still very new. Day 2.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What you said is right. It does suggest that maybe we will just really expand the daily events soon, I guess.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Scott seems to be making noise. That's Scott's character suggestion.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Mortful Scott character.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The daily events.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
A daily event. I try not to be a grouch, but a daily event is a lot.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Every once in a while is a little treat. It's been a treat so far, but it's only day 2, so it's hard to say.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hopefully it will be a daily treat for everyone listening and not a daily chore.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
A chore of deleting it from your podcast menu without listening.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That's a good point. Make sure to make room for this.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If you have albums like Apple Music or Spotify, delete those albums. You can stream them.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Also, here's the thing. You can go into your podcast app and if you want to make sure you have an episode marked as un-listened to because you want to listen to it,

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:36,000
but you want to delete the file, click on the little dots or click on the expand options, and you can delete the file but still code it as a new episode.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's what I've had to do when stuff has gotten backed up.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Delete other shit so you can hear things like that.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Tips about dots.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But you also listen to this daily series and you get the presence of everyone's favorite ghost spirit who guides us through dining and retail locations.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Give it up for the Sector Keeper.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Boys, boys, you give me strength.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Hi Sector Keeper. Hello. Good to see you again.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Good to see you. Day two of the newest daily adventure.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
One of many daily sagas. Good to see you. You're doing well.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Hey, you're hitting that PB&J vape that we went out and picked up together.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
See, Uncle Scott hooks you up.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Uncle Scott maybe isn't the Uncle Danny.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Danny. Oh yeah. Yeah, all right.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Oh, I'm gunning for Jesse.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I think maybe that's kind of the subtle thing we can be doing throughout is like...

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Character development?

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah. What I mean is that we have a rare chance to calibrate how cool we are.

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We have a cool youth in our presence.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And I think right now I'm up points because I went and bought a jewel for him.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
By the end of this, maybe you can make a determination which one of the three of us is kind of your coolest uncle.

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Wow. That's interesting because for a while Jason was our barometer for the youth culture and terminology.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Sure, but he never put it into practice. He's never been a young kid here.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But now we got a real young kid, somebody really connected to youth culture.

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah, sure. No layers of irony with him. He's all in on it.

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
No layers of irony is what he said.

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh no, yes, yes, of course. No layers of irony. Everything earnest for me.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah. That's what people love about you.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So when you say throw up a dab, you're serious.

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Always. Yeah. Yes.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Dabs are not to be joked about.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Right. Of course. Yeah, that makes sense.

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Well, I think, you know...

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And when I say bae...

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Right, earnest.

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Earnest.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, because I think we say it with a twin.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah, and if you say you stan something...

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Then I really stan it.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Right, earnest.

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Earnest.

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah. And you caught up really fast because you were locked in an eternity cage for a long time.

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah, Toby, my boss at Cricket Wireless, he would tell me some stuff.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
He tossed off, so he caught you up on the coolest trends.

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Some stuff, yeah.

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Was he younger than you or was he an older guy teaching you youth stuff?

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Much older.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
We're always going to be failing in comparison to Uncle Toby.

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah.

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Like you, but older.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Interesting.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Huh.

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He really took you under his wing, huh?

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Mm-hmm.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And gave you jewels constantly.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Introduced me to jewels, yes.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But now I get my jewels on my own.

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah.

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Give me some credit.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He helped you get the peanut butter.

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Hey, don't forget about what old Uncle Scott's...

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And maybe if these guys bail on it, just you and me will go see Good Boys together.

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Whoa, Good Boys, yeah.

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm lobbying hard to be the coolest older man here.

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Hell yeah.

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah, the podcast's coolest older man award.

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And you know what's great about what you got me?

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's peanut butter going in...

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And jelly coming out.

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Oh, he did a ring.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He did a ring plume.

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Wow.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh my God, a jelly ring.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
A jelly ring?

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh, that is so...

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That is so funny.

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
A jelly ring.

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
A jelly ring.

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's a youth thing, I think.

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's so...

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah, youths yell out jelly rings, and I let him do it.

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Man, you and me, SK, thanks for making the room so fragrant with your jelly rings.

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Of course, of course.

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But boys, boys, it is after all stage...

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Other way.

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Other way.

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Level two, stage...

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He's jeweling.

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Give him some weight.

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Other way.

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
No, it's level one, stage two.

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Level one, stage two, yeah.

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There we go.

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes, yes, boys.

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Where are we heading?

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That jelly jewel gets in your eyes, you know?

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's all foggy in here.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's all foggy.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Level one, stage two, boys, are you up for it?

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Do you have strength?

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah, yes, yes, we do.

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah.

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Okay, boys, your mission today to discuss and review, to help find my cousin, the level

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
keeper.

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The level keeper.

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Level one, stage two is Starbucks, Sunglass Icon by Sunglass Hut, and of course, Curlsurf.

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Curlsurf, yes.

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
All right.

140
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,520
These are all real places.

141
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:48,520
We need to get all as much, a high amount of interesting info about all of these places

142
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,520
out so we could save your cousin.

143
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
Yes.

144
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,520
And boy, do we have a fascinating one today.

145
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,520
Starbucks, a Seattle-based coffee chain.

146
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,520
You may have one in your neighborhood.

147
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
Take a peek, see if you do.

148
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Lots of them everywhere.

149
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,520
This is a, this is one with a very tall ceiling.

150
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
Yeah.

151
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,520
High ceilings, yeah, man.

152
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,520
Maybe the, I mean, for sure, I think the highest...

153
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
Really high.

154
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
Yeah, man.

155
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
Highest ceiling one I've ever seen.

156
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,520
I don't know if it exists, but is there, are there two-story Starbucks?

157
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,520
Do we know?

158
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,520
No.

159
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,520
We don't know.

160
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,520
No.

161
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
We don't know the answer.

162
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,520
We should have looked into it, but this is very high ceilings.

163
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,520
I like that.

164
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,520
It's very wooded in there.

165
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,520
Beautiful.

166
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
Wooded, beautiful.

167
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
It's a well art-directed Starbucks.

168
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,520
Yes.

169
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,520
Yep.

170
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
I'll say that.

171
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,520
There's some nice foliage, good tree and plant situation.

172
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,520
The courtyard's built around an old ficus tree.

173
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
Oh, yes.

174
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
I know that.

175
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
We're going to get that cousin free real soon.

176
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,520
What with interesting facts about old ficus trees.

177
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,520
Ficus tree, beautiful tree.

178
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,520
Good place to get some work done, I'll be honest with everyone.

179
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,520
I roam around the resort sometimes with my laptop doing some work.

180
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,520
I feel like you name checks like 10 plates.

181
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,520
You just plant and then move and then plant and then move.

182
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,520
Well, here's what I do.

183
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,520
Okay, I'm going to let the listener in on a little bit of a secret here.

184
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,520
So sometimes when you're a childless man in his 30s and you're trying to get some writing

185
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,520
done and maybe you're depressed being in the apartment, you go somewhere where you're not

186
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,520
depressed.

187
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,520
The Disneyland Resort, I drive down when it's not that crowded on the freeway and I will

188
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,520
do this.

189
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,520
I will try to get about an hour, hour and a half of actual work done.

190
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,520
Then when I hit a roadblock, I pack it up, put it in my backpack and go on a ride.

191
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:35,520
I will then after that leave the ride and go at a different place in the resort and

192
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,520
do try to do some more work and I will repeat as long as I have time.

193
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,520
Do you want to tell the listener, where do you think the strongest Wi-Fi spots are?

194
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,520
That's a real crap shoot.

195
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,520
Is that a secret?

196
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
No, I'm not going to hide that from the listener.

197
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
Starbucks is pretty good.

198
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,520
The hotels have a lot better.

199
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:56,520
Yes, the hotels, I like the formerly whitewater snacks, whatever it's called now, I forget.

200
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,520
It doesn't matter.

201
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,520
It's not part of the district.

202
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,520
No, I know.

203
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,520
I'm just saying that's good Wi-Fi in the hotel.

204
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
Yeah.

205
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,520
We're not supposed to be talking about this.

206
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,520
It's a little out of bounds.

207
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,520
All right, all right.

208
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,520
But the Wi-Fi at the Starbucks is pretty good and I will sometimes go over to that Starbucks,

209
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,520
you know, get a green tea or something.

210
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,520
What you're saying is there's a Starbucks with Wi-Fi where you can get work done.

211
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,520
Yes, but it's in the best place on Earth.

212
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,520
You can pay a buck more for everything.

213
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,520
Downtown Disney.

214
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,520
For beverages out of a little carton.

215
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,520
Yes.

216
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,520
Remade ice cream.

217
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,520
And like they're not day old baked goods, but they may as well be.

218
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,520
That's sort of the feeling.

219
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,520
I mean, I like a Starbucks cheese danish, you know.

220
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,520
I don't not like it, but it all isn't fresh.

221
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
No, no.

222
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,520
It's not fresh.

223
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,520
I'd rather just go to a local.

224
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,520
I like the coffee, but I'd rather just have a local donut shop.

225
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,520
Do you go?

226
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,520
It's not an option.

227
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,520
Mom and Pop say.

228
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,520
Not when you're here.

229
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,520
No, for sure.

230
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,520
Is that number one or do you like Danish?

231
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:08,520
That kind of depends on the establishment and a Starbucks Danish for sure.

232
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
Sophie's choice.

233
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Yeah.

234
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,520
Yeah, I would say that a lot of like mom and pop places in L.A.

235
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,520
if you don't get there early enough, the date, the like croissants are gone like that.

236
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,520
OK, so so OK, you had a really doughnut.

237
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,520
You add a donut shop.

238
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
Donuts, of course.

239
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,520
But like a bakery, I like to see what their specialty is.

240
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,520
But sharing cheese danish is usually my go to if that's available.

241
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,520
It was an establishment where they made everything pretty much of the same quality.

242
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,520
We're talking then donuts, cheese danish, croissants.

243
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,520
What is the number one?

244
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
Oh, gosh.

245
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,520
Do you think you would go to if they're all of the same quality, if they're all the highest caliber?

246
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:55,520
No, I mean, it kind of depends on how hungry because I could eat a donut if I'm not that hungry.

247
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,520
But a danish could be kind of big.

248
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,520
A danish or a croissant could be kind of big.

249
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,520
OK, so it sounds like donut is sort of the winner.

250
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,520
Yeah, it can be big.

251
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,520
Some places make it kind of big.

252
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,520
Yeah, but it's fluffy, though.

253
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520
What do you put?

254
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,520
You put something on it, but it's buttery.

255
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,520
No, you just eat it plain.

256
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:18,520
Well, no, I usually gravitate towards either an almond croissant or a chocolate croissant.

257
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:25,520
I noticed that you I think I pointed out years ago that you call them croissants.

258
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,520
And then I realized a couple episodes ago you said it and I was like, oh, he's not saying it like that.

259
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
But I think you fell back into croissant.

260
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,520
Or a cream cheese croissant.

261
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,520
Well, my mom used to because she took French in high school.

262
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,520
She trained me to say croissant.

263
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,520
But then I feel like I sound like an asshole when I say that.

264
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
Yeah, very much so.

265
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,520
Yeah. So I guess I've tried not to do that.

266
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
Yeah, sorry.

267
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,520
What do you guys lean towards for your breakfast treats?

268
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
Doughnut.

269
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Doughnut?

270
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,520
Yeah.

271
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
I don't eat the treats ever.

272
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,520
You never have a doughnut?

273
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,520
Almost very rarely.

274
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Really?

275
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Sectorkeeper?

276
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
Doughnut, yeah.

277
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,520
Yeah, doughnut.

278
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:06,520
I'm working in an office right now with this free doughnuts every Wednesday and I don't ever do it.

279
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,520
Whoa, what?

280
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
Yeah.

281
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,520
The free thing.

282
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,520
I'm breaking young hearts here.

283
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,520
Doughnuts every Wednesday?

284
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,520
Yeah, yeah.

285
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
I haven't.

286
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
Interesting.

287
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
I don't know.

288
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,520
I have like a quarter of one if I am.

289
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:29,520
If you get the right ratio of like a sweet doughnut and coffee, you're almost high because you can really slow down.

290
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,520
Like when I was younger.

291
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
Whoa.

292
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,520
Riqui and montage of grabbing doughnut.

293
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:43,520
I would eat a doughnut like in the morning for breakfast and be like so sluggish because I would have it with like orange juice.

294
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,520
And it's just like so much sugar at once.

295
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:52,520
But if you have caffeine, if you have a decent coffee and sugar, you balance out to the perfect equilibrium.

296
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,520
You can ride that high or not, baby.

297
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,520
I mean, you just start the day off feeling great.

298
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:02,520
You are I think are the most affected by sugar of any of my friends, I think.

299
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,520
Because like I don't I would always know the kids would say like, oh, you get a sugar high.

300
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,520
And I even when I would eat candy, I never felt a difference like caffeine.

301
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
For sure.

302
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
There's a difference.

303
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,520
I don't know if I noticed the high.

304
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
I noticed the crash.

305
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Hmm.

306
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,520
I mean, if I if you drink a sugary drink, sometimes my stomach will feel a little weird.

307
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,520
But in general, I don't feel like hyper from or I don't feel like even a big crash.

308
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
I got the hyper part.

309
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,520
I love it.

310
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,520
Well, you love course.

311
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,520
Every time I have it, I want more of it.

312
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
Sure.

313
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,520
They say it's a day.

314
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,520
It's very addictive.

315
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,520
Yeah.

316
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:40,520
I'm worried that you're going to start that that sugar is going to be a gateway drug and you'll start getting different kinds of high.

317
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
No way, man.

318
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
Well, that's good.

319
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,520
You seem like you seem like a good kid.

320
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,520
Just just my jewel.

321
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,520
Does that make it to you?

322
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,520
It's OK for now.

323
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,520
I mean, I'm worried we're going to find out some bad things about what jewel does to you.

324
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,520
But for now, I guess you're OK.

325
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,520
Oh, Scott, we still scientists still have not found out the long term ramifications of diet coke.

326
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
So it's going to be a lot longer for a jewel.

327
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,520
We don't know what type of like artificial sweet.

328
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,520
He's saying if we don't know about diet coke, there hasn't been enough decades of research.

329
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,520
Like, oh, it takes like a long time.

330
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
It takes a long time.

331
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
OK.

332
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
Hmm.

333
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
What about a bagel, Scott?

334
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,520
I've become a little more bagelish.

335
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,520
Yeah, maybe it's bagel.

336
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,520
Is it an aversion to it or is it just sort of that part of your routine?

337
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
They're not out for breakfast.

338
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,520
You know, I'm way more likely to be out for lunch or dinner.

339
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
Sure.

340
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,520
That's what I mean.

341
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
I don't have going along.

342
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
I'm not going to bakeries.

343
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,520
Yeah, I don't have donuts a lot.

344
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,520
But if I if I if I'm out or something, you are.

345
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,520
I feel like you're popping into the weekends.

346
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
Yeah.

347
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,520
You go to Dunkin or you go to you have a couple of donuts a week.

348
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,520
A couple of donut spots.

349
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
Not a week.

350
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,520
Maybe once a week on the weekends.

351
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
OK.

352
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,520
You live the life I dream.

353
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,520
Yeah.

354
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,520
Ice cream, ice cream, tummy aches whenever he wants.

355
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:02,520
Yeah, I actually I recently I haven't Danish in years.

356
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,520
I had a day a cheese Danish from Starbucks while I was waiting for my laundry to dry.

357
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
They're nice, warmed up.

358
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,520
Does he live the life that you dream?

359
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,520
I relate to this one.

360
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,520
I mean, two points adjacent.

361
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,520
Yeah.

362
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,520
So so so.

363
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Oh, we talk about the screen.

364
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,520
Yeah, there was a fun digital chalkboard.

365
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,520
We had so much fun together.

366
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,520
We do. We were with the sector keeper in this particular Starbucks.

367
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,520
And I want to just let everyone know this is the Starbucks closest to World of Disney.

368
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,520
It's not the other Starbucks.

369
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,520
We need to make that clear.

370
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,520
Regular Starbucks on the eastern side.

371
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,520
And you know what?

372
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:51,520
I don't think I said in the last episode that I I watched this video like the what you watch in the hotel from 2003 that tells you what you know all of all of the night spots and everything to do and then Disney.

373
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:58,520
And they used some term that they don't think apparently this whole area that we're in right now is the Eastern Garden District.

374
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:03,520
They don't really do it anymore, but it might help us since we have so many areas to worry about.

375
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:09,520
So we this is so it's that we're in the Eastern Garden District Starbucks.

376
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,520
OK, got it.

377
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
Yeah. Cool.

378
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,520
Jason's writing it down.

379
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,520
Writing it down.

380
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,520
Eastern Garden.

381
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,520
Yeah. So not the and this is the larger of the two.

382
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:29,520
It came in there right around when Disney was beginning its its Starbucks partnership because you got Starbucks in the parks as of like 2013 2014.

383
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:44,520
The Market House on Main Street in Disneyland, the Fiddler, Pfeiffer and Practical Cafe in California Adventure, which if you want your Starbucks to take if your complaint is it's not slow enough, then go to Fiddler, Pfeiffer.

384
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:50,520
If you want your Starbucks to take six times longer than any Starbucks on the face of the earth and to pay a dollar fifty more.

385
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
This is the Starbucks for you.

386
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,520
That one used to have a full hot sandwich menu, too.

387
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,520
That was very good. And it took forever because essentially they're serving two restaurants.

388
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,520
They were serving a full service Starbucks and a full service sandwich restaurant.

389
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
And it was kind of a mess.

390
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,520
You know, it's a nice thing that really helps with efficiency.

391
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:22,520
So especially if you land from a drive where you need some caffeine, do the mobile ordering of the Starbucks while you're on that, you get on the parking tram.

392
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
Oh.

393
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,520
Make sure you pick the right one because you might get delivered near a totally different Starbucks.

394
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,520
It will automatically sense your location if you don't select otherwise.

395
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,520
Yes.

396
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,520
Yeah. So be careful there. Pick the right one.

397
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:40,520
But getting off that tram and there being a Starbucks beverage waiting for you is a real treat.

398
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,520
That's great. I love that tip.

399
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,520
Obviously, I'm a big mobile order guy. You cannot mobile order Starbucks in the parks yet.

400
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,520
No.

401
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
Which, yeah, that's a big problem.

402
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
You can use your app and get your stars and points.

403
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
Yes. Can I? I'm going to complain real quick about the app.

404
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
And this is not just Starbucks. Don't get donuts.

405
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,520
This is too. They won't let you just add the amount you need.

406
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,520
You have to buy a ten dollar gift card to reload.

407
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,520
If you're making a mobile order, am I wrong about this?

408
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,520
No, you can add it in the app. You can select the amount.

409
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,520
I just think I think they Starbucks, I think, said it.

410
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,520
So the lowest amount you can do is 15 Duncan.

411
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,520
You can add 10, but you can add value within the app.

412
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,520
But you can write specifically the value or am I just getting tricked by some generic default?

413
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,520
I think it's just a couple options, but I think you can write that.

414
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,520
Well, here's what I'm going to do. I've loaded them both recently.

415
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,520
I'm going to investigate this.

416
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,520
Now, I try to drink coffee at home primarily, but when you're out and about in the big city...

417
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,520
You're raising your voice.

418
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Now, let's now, don't tell me I worked coffee out.

419
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:46,520
I think we should investigate this. I will bring it up on the next Starbucks episode, which is only a matter of days away.

420
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,520
I don't want to say that, but I want to settle the Duncan.

421
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,520
Because I just have a few. I feel like they try to make you.

422
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,520
It's just sort of a trick to make sure that you come back.

423
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:00,520
They'll make you put like $10 in or something as opposed to just reloading the exact amount you need for your purchase.

424
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,520
I'm so confused. You said so many words just now. My brain just floated.

425
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,520
My current balance.

426
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,520
Only Jason and I are on the same page right now.

427
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,520
My current balance is $7.35.

428
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:16,520
It does seem to be interested in both of you checking apps to save different money amounts.

429
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,520
Right, boys?

430
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,520
Okay, so Duncan specifically says $10 minimum, $100 maximum.

431
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,520
$10 minimum. That's what I'm saying.

432
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,520
You can only put $10 at a time.

433
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,520
Meaning instead of just driving up and saying you want like one donut and that's $1.50.

434
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
Basically, you have to put $10.

435
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,520
You want to add $1.50 and spend it and then add another?

436
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,520
What it's doing is perpetually making you come back over and over again.

437
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,520
But I'm going to perpetually come back anyway.

438
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,520
You both are. You think you're going to just stop after the $1.50?

439
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,520
No, I don't, but I don't quite like the idea that they're doing a little trick.

440
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,520
They're trying to trick me into.

441
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,520
How are you having this many thoughts while you order a fucking coffee?

442
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,520
I'm a thoughtful man who thinks about angles.

443
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,520
I think about angles on things.

444
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,520
You know what? I'll say this. I'm going to meet you in the middle. I think.

445
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,520
Hey, welcome to the middle.

446
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:13,520
I think I think when you are like a buck or two short, when you have a balance,

447
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,520
like let's say it's $5, but you only have like three bucks on there.

448
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
I think it should prompt you.

449
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
Like, do you want to add the $2 to even it out?

450
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,520
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

451
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,520
That I think is reasonable.

452
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,520
You have to load 10.

453
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,520
So say I'm $2 short on my balances in the app.

454
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,520
It makes me reload another $10 and I don't like it.

455
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
I don't like the feeling of it.

456
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,520
If you go to the cashier and I think you will be spending, by the way,

457
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,520
you're definitely spending the new coffee place or a new donut place pops up.

458
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
I never go to Duncan again.

459
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
Has that happened?

460
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,520
Not yet, but there's a chance though that maybe I don't want to ever want to use it.

461
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Maybe I have a bad experience at Duncan.

462
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,520
I think the host of this show never go to Duncan again.

463
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,520
I don't know. I'm saying I don't like the idea of it.

464
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
And I think I'm not alone.

465
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
That's my feeling about it.

466
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,520
I don't know if I'm wrong.

467
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
But do you carry the cards?

468
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,520
Do you still carry cards?

469
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520
You just have it in the app.

470
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,520
It's just in the app.

471
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Okay.

472
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,520
So I have cards just in case it's down.

473
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
Gift cards?

474
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,520
Yeah.

475
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,520
You always have multiple gift cards?

476
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,520
No, hold on.

477
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,520
I have a Duncan card and I have a gold Starbucks card in my wallet.

478
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
Really?

479
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
Wait a minute.

480
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,520
What?

481
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,520
Yeah.

482
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
You carry hard cards.

483
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,520
Wait a minute.

484
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
Wait.

485
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,520
The Duncan card is not a gift card.

486
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,520
It's just a physical representation of your app.

487
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:33,520
Well, when I first put credit, they weren't pushing the app at the time.

488
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,520
Right.

489
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,520
So I just got a card.

490
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
I put $10 on it.

491
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,520
And that's how I racked up points originally.

492
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,520
You got your Duncan platinum.

493
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,520
So I just put that in my wallet and it's just still in my wallet.

494
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,520
So you have backup cards in case your apps fail.

495
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,520
Sometimes the apps are down.

496
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,520
Okay.

497
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,520
Interesting.

498
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,520
How many cards do you have in your wallet in general?

499
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,520
A lot.

500
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,520
Like this ballpark?

501
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Like at least a dozen.

502
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,520
Okay.

503
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
That's not as many as...

504
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,520
Credit and debit cards, health insurance, dental insurance, prescription card.

505
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,520
Donuts.

506
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,520
Donut card.

507
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,520
Donut card.

508
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,520
Coffee card.

509
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
Those are the basics.

510
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:19,520
One or two like a Barnes and Noble gift card with like some credit left on it in case I'm

511
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,520
out and about.

512
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:27,520
What's it called when you're a spirit and it feels like your spirit left your body?

513
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,520
A double ghost.

514
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,520
Like a spirit we've checked out.

515
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,520
And you and me, we've checked out.

516
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,520
SK is number one right now.

517
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,520
I can tell.

518
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,520
Why don't we say to be continued at Starbucks West?

519
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
Of course.

520
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,520
We'll talk a lot more about this in Starbucks.

521
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,520
And obviously the listeners will chime in and say, do you like the psychological effect

522
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,520
of having to load more money on your card than you're actually about to spend?

523
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,520
We'll see.

524
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,520
The time that's wasted in caring about it.

525
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,520
Yeah, that's true.

526
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,520
But this show is all about wasting time.

527
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,520
I mean, that's very true.

528
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,520
This is certainly true.

529
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,520
You know, I don't know much about software design, but I do notice user interface, user

530
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
experience changes.

531
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,520
But there's something...

532
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,520
And I like to toggle.

533
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,520
Here's what I'll say.

534
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
This is my final thought on the matter.

535
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,520
There is something psychological when you're thinking about getting a coffee that if you

536
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,520
know you already have $8 on a gift card, you might psychologically want to use that more

537
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,520
because you've already spent it.

538
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,520
So you will go to that place over a different place.

539
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,520
And I don't care for it.

540
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,520
Do you hold...

541
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,520
When you get the rewards, do you hold on to it until you're like, I'm going to get a real

542
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,520
big one?

543
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,520
No, I like to just sort of do add-ons.

544
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,520
Oh, you do the...

545
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,520
I say I don't really do add-ons.

546
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,520
I like add-ons.

547
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
I'm like...

548
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,520
We'll talk about that in the next one.

549
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,520
Talk about it next time.

550
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,520
Because we're going to have my order.

551
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,520
I know that.

552
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
Hooray.

553
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,520
Yeah.

554
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
We're going to have our order.

555
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,520
That's...

556
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,520
Amen, brother.

557
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
All right.

558
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,520
Not complicated enough.

559
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
Let's talk about the screen.

560
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
Wait, wait.

561
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,520
We stopped talking about the screen.

562
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,520
Yeah, the screen is really cool.

563
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
It's a home screen.

564
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
The screen is cool.

565
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
It's like a living chalkboard.

566
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,640
You can write things on it.

567
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,680
You could take a picture where it looks like you're a chalk drawing.

568
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,860
Yes.

569
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:08,280
And it seems like there was a function that was broken maybe that we could see what was

570
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,900
happening in Florida.

571
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,900
Is that what...

572
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,900
Yeah.

573
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,900
It seemed like they were trying to flash to Florida.

574
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,700
A postcard to Florida.

575
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,400
Or we were sending our postcard to Florida, but we didn't receive any from Florida.

576
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
Yeah.

577
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,720
We didn't have to receive a Florida postcard.

578
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,540
What time were we there?

579
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,880
Could that Starbucks have been closed?

580
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,880
Because three hours ahead.

581
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
I think you're right.

582
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,360
We might have been there at nine or 10.

583
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,360
Yeah.

584
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,360
So perhaps...

585
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,360
No, not earlier than that.

586
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,360
Eight maybe.

587
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
Yeah.

588
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,880
Who knows exactly whether the function was broken.

589
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
But it was cool.

590
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,160
I didn't even really realize it was in there until we were there.

591
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:42,200
I mean, the funniest thing, there was a little fly crawling along it.

592
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
So right.

593
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
He was adding little dots.

594
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,640
It was on interactive video screen and you could draw things and write things on it.

595
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,640
And we saw the cutest thing in the world.

596
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,920
It was a little fly and it was drawing on the screen.

597
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,720
And at first we thought there was a problem and why are these little dots showing up?

598
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720
No.

599
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,600
But then I see what's making it.

600
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,360
It was a cute little fly.

601
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,360
In an eatery.

602
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,360
The place you want them.

603
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:15,000
He had just taken dips in each one of the coffee with his little fly feet.

604
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,960
And then he decided to fly over to the screen and draw.

605
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,320
And he drew for a while.

606
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,320
Yeah.

607
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,320
He made a big design.

608
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,160
We were watching a fly make art.

609
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,160
Yes.

610
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,280
Or as Jason frames it, maybe that's Bugmane making putty sauce.

611
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,280
Could have been.

612
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,720
That's what he said.

613
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,560
Yeah.

614
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
So we were delighted.

615
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
That was wonderful.

616
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,560
That was a highlight.

617
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,520
And then we did a lot of, hey, the Sector Keeper, we made some fun art with you were

618
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,920
writing our name and posing in the photos.

619
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,560
So people look closely at the photos we post on Twitter.

620
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,200
You might be able to see what the Sector Keeper looks like.

621
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
Yeah.

622
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,200
Yeah.

623
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,360
For me, it made Starbucks fun.

624
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,880
Because do you like any of this?

625
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,000
Because coffee, are you getting into coffee?

626
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,640
You're getting older.

627
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,480
But coffee still, I mean, I guess teenagers, that's when you start getting older.

628
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,040
Getting into it, and especially the really like, you know, the froufy drinks.

629
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:21,160
Sometimes if I have too much vape, I'll soothe my throat with coffee.

630
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,160
Just pure black coffee.

631
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,880
I don't know.

632
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,520
I think any health problems you encounter in your coughing and what have you might be

633
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,520
self applied.

634
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,760
Hey, Sector Keeper, this is the first appearance of a business that's present at both downtown

635
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,280
Disney and CityWalk.

636
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,280
Yeah.

637
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,920
We have Starbucks at CityWalk as well.

638
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,880
I would spend time there every once in a while.

639
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,880
Sure.

640
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,880
Both get really busy.

641
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,880
Very busy.

642
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,320
I can't imagine why you'd go to either of them.

643
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,960
Maybe the Disney one because of the screen.

644
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,080
But other than that.

645
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,080
Or the tall ceilings.

646
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,080
Or the nice smells.

647
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,400
The possibility of seeing a fly.

648
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
Riveting.

649
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,320
I would say maybe bring your own fly in and unleash it on the screen to see what we're

650
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,320
talking about because there's no guarantee you're going to get to see an adorable fly.

651
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,800
Trap a fly, go to Disneyland.

652
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,000
Let it loose in Starbucks.

653
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,240
If you get it in a plastic container, you can bring it to security.

654
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,280
I don't think there's any metal in a fly.

655
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:29,160
The interior of this Starbucks is apparently partially made with reclaimed wood from old

656
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,120
railroad boxcars.

657
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,280
Wow.

658
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:36,840
Which made me wonder, Jason, does it make you flash to some past life when you were

659
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,880
a hobo boy riding the rails?

660
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,640
Just hiding from the yard cops.

661
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,280
Hiding from the Bickerton's and their Shillelies.

662
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,760
That's a stressful memory.

663
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,760
Yeah.

664
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,760
That's not fun.

665
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,000
We were imagining a Little Rascals type situation.

666
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,360
I mean, once it's moving, it's fun.

667
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,680
But once you get to those yards.

668
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,280
They start scraping the sides with their batons.

669
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,280
Yeah.

670
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,280
Yeah.

671
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,840
You could end up on the wrong side of it.

672
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,840
Come on out.

673
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,840
Come on out, you lot.

674
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
You lot of you.

675
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,840
You lot.

676
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
Come on out.

677
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,840
That's right.

678
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,400
You and your officer O'Brien.

679
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:19,280
It's officer O'Brien and O'Malley's here too.

680
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,720
One of my ancestors is in the boxcar.

681
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:28,520
The other ancestor is outside about to beat the hell out of them.

682
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,960
There's one more thing about this particular Starbucks.

683
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,160
We sent out a tweet and said, hey, if you have any memories or facts that we might not

684
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,760
know about downtown Disney as we head into the ordeal, please let us know.

685
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,800
I did that partially due to a dearth of interesting information I was finding.

686
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:55,760
And Sam on Twitter wrote back, that Starbucks is one of the only ones where everyone is

687
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,020
allowed to wear black aprons.

688
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,920
Especially it's only certified coffee masters who don't wear green.

689
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,920
Wow.

690
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,840
And we got a number of responses to that tweet.

691
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,680
I think that is the most interesting one.

692
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,240
And I noticed a lot of people had memories of downtown Disney Orlando.

693
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,320
Way more.

694
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,240
This was a and some of the stories were just like, I think somebody was like, I went on

695
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,800
a Tinder date there and it didn't go well and I left.

696
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,840
Like that's what that these are the cherished memories of the place where we have to live

697
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,040
for 15 days.

698
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,040
Apron colors.

699
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,040
Yeah.

700
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,040
Yes.

701
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
A little dry.

702
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,360
I really like searched.

703
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,080
I didn't even find the wood that would thing.

704
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,080
I was like, whoa.

705
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,960
When you just said that would think I was like, holy shit.

706
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,960
I'm pulling it out.

707
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
So that was impressive.

708
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,720
I think that would ficus tree.

709
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,720
Yeah.

710
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,280
You got a an outdoor wall designed with a thousand native plants in the shape of a coffee cup.

711
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,280
What are you doing?

712
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,280
Y'all.

713
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,280
We stand.

714
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,280
Yes.

715
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,280
We stand big up.

716
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:04,640
You truly when I was thinking like, oh, city like City Walk really seems like we were talking

717
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,920
about some of the greatest moments in American history compared to this at this point in Episode

718
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,920
two.

719
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
It's also recent.

720
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
A lot of it's recent.

721
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
That's the problem.

722
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,720
And it's all it's all since 2001.

723
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,440
So you don't have any like particularly awkward genre throwbacks.

724
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,080
So everything's stuck in time, but in this exceedingly dull time.

725
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,080
Yes.

726
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,760
Disney still has a relationship, though, with that Joffrey's coffee, which I think is supposedly

727
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,800
all right at like a Joffrey's location.

728
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,560
But when it's brewed within the parks, like at restaurants, people are like, this is dire.

729
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,400
This is very bad.

730
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,040
I don't have any opinion on Joffrey.

731
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,160
Do we know who Joffrey is?

732
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
It's a coffee.

733
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,160
I think it's Florida based.

734
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
I mean, who he is.

735
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,080
It's not the Toz R.S. Giraffe, I'll tell you that much.

736
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,080
No, Joffrey.

737
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,440
Much less likeable Joffrey.

738
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,040
No, Jeffrey is the name.

739
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,040
Oh, yeah.

740
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,040
Yeah.

741
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
Oh, yeah.

742
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,040
That's all right.

743
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,040
It's all the same way.

744
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,640
I think I say more like Joffrey because of the GEO.

745
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,880
This is J-O-F-F-R-E-Y, right?

746
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
Yeah.

747
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,200
Well, let's get to another topic that's much more interesting and has so much more information

748
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,360
that we could talk about.

749
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,920
Here we go.

750
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,080
The next one, of course, is icon.

751
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:23,320
Son glass, son glass icon by sunglass, by sunglass hut.

752
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,620
I have a lot for this.

753
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,620
You do?

754
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,620
Yeah, I do.

755
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,620
Really?

756
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,620
Yeah.

757
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,620
Well, lead the way.

758
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,620
Okay.

759
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,200
So I mean, well, our experience with it.

760
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,740
I'm just gonna say how.

761
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,960
We all went there together.

762
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,200
We were gone in two and a half minutes.

763
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:48,800
Well, we stood our experience directly is we stood outside and it was there were two

764
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,800
salespeople inside.

765
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,440
Oh, that was I'm thinking of Pearl Surf.

766
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,440
Okay.

767
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,440
We didn't go in, did we?

768
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,200
And no, we were too intimidated to go in.

769
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,760
It was not enough people.

770
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
They would have talked to us.

771
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
Yeah.

772
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,760
Yeah.

773
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,760
Bad times.

774
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,160
This is a fun moment where we get to, as I'm sure will happen a lot on this series, examine

775
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,660
the parent company.

776
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,040
So sunglass icon.

777
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,280
Here we go.

778
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:17,480
Here's where we learned about how the glasses industry is one big con.

779
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:23,760
So Jason ruins glasses, sunglasses, sunglasses icon by sunglass hut is clearly owned by sunglass

780
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,760
hut.

781
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:30,240
Sunglass hut is owned by just grew a couple inches.

782
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,320
Sunglass hut is owned by a company called Luxottica Group.

783
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:39,800
Luxottica Group owns lens crafters, sunglass hut, apex by sunglass hut, Pearl Vision Sears

784
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:50,920
optical optical, I med vision care plan, glasses.com Ray Ban, Purcell and Oakley.

785
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:57,520
They make frames for the brands that for designer brands to Chanel Prada, Giorgio Armani, Burberry,

786
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,600
Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Mew Mew or mid Mew.

787
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
I can't.

788
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
I just got to fuck up.

789
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,880
And then Turt and Turi Birch.

790
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:16,240
So in 2017, 2018, they merged with a company called Esselur, becoming Esselur Luxottica.

791
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,320
Esselur Luxottica is responsible for creating the very first progressive lens and combined

792
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,520
this company controls one quarter of global eyeglass sales.

793
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,600
One quarter of global eyeglass.

794
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,640
What's the next biggest eyeglass company?

795
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,640
I don't know.

796
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,040
I think it gets smaller after that.

797
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,040
Are you saying that?

798
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,040
This is a monopoly.

799
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,240
I was going to say they have a monopoly because they own different parts, different stores

800
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,120
and they supposedly compete against themselves.

801
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,440
I remember growing up doing this dance at the mall.

802
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,480
My mom would be like, we can look into lens crafters, but we'll get a better deal at Sears

803
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,480
optical.

804
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,760
But it was all the same.

805
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,440
Usually the price points were a little lower at Sears and that's probably why she wanted

806
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
to go to Sears.

807
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:06,640
But yeah, I mean a lot of these like Ray Ban was just a solo company and then just got

808
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,480
bought up at some point.

809
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,800
So you're kind of blowing the whistle on an eyeglass monopoly that's happening.

810
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,800
We don't like whistle blowers.

811
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,800
No, that was a month ago.

812
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,800
You used to call them spies.

813
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,800
That was a month ago.

814
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,800
He's obviously out of office right now.

815
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,800
I'm sorry.

816
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,800
I gotta forget we're pre-tabbing.

817
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Everything's fine.

818
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:29,720
Yeah, so and also this isn't cheapy eyewear anyway.

819
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,720
This is like designer.

820
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,720
No, the cheapest.

821
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,720
I looked.

822
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,720
Did you look?

823
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:39,840
The cheapest eyewear is $50 here and I'm going to complain because sometimes you step on

824
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:45,600
your sunglasses and you break them and you need new ones and go in and get a $10 pair.

825
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,600
It's vacation.

826
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,600
I don't know why.

827
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,400
Again, they're catering to high end customers exclusively.

828
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,440
I guess in the parks there's spots where you can get like a cheaper pair of glasses.

829
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,800
Maybe the hotel gift shops.

830
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
Maybe there's a rack.

831
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Yeah.

832
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,040
I just think there needs to be like a clearance rack in here.

833
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,040
Yeah, for sure.

834
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,560
Put a clearance rack and dress it up.

835
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,360
It doesn't have to look shabby.

836
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,320
What's your guys' eyeglass, let's say sunglasses.

837
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,320
Oakleys.

838
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,320
Set up.

839
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,320
You're an Oakley boy.

840
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,320
Okay.

841
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,840
I love one day I want to own Oakleys.

842
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
You want to own Oakleys.

843
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,840
I hear dream.

844
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
Yeah.

845
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
But you just got laid off.

846
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,840
Yeah, I know.

847
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:26,200
But one day I'm going to be wearing Oakleys and playing in the big leagues like Robin

848
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
Ventura.

849
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,200
I hope so.

850
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,200
Yeah, I hope so too.

851
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
Yeah.

852
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,200
Not without sunglasses.

853
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,200
You need sunglasses first.

854
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,800
They'll never accept you.

855
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,160
What about you guys?

856
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,040
Well, when you lose your sunglasses all the time, there's only one brand for you and that's

857
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,040
Panama Jack.

858
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,040
Oh, sure.

859
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:51,600
They're going to be cheap ass CVS sunglasses because they will be gone in six weeks.

860
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
Panama Jack.

861
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,600
Mike.

862
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
How much are they?

863
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
20 bucks.

864
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,240
I've never worn sunglasses more than $20.

865
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,320
I don't even, I'm trying to, I'm looking actually at what the name of it is.

866
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:09,920
I will generally go on Amazon and buy like a lot of like $10 different color wayfarer

867
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,920
type.

868
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,920
Yeah, cheapy wayfarer.

869
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,280
Very cheap depending on, and they're usually under $10.

870
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,360
I think one time like five years ago, I just bought a box of 12 for like $25.

871
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,040
Yeah, I used to do that.

872
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,440
So and I break them all the time.

873
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,760
I'm still, I have these multicolor glasses I got for a freebie at Comic-Con two years

874
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,760
ago.

875
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,760
There's like 18, it says AT&T on the side, but they're like multicolor.

876
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,760
I like those.

877
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,040
This is a thing where I am the one who is splurged the most because I have real Ray-Ban

878
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:45,680
wayfarers and they are one of the most single most expensive items I own because they are

879
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,680
prescription.

880
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,680
Right.

881
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,680
I was going to say you have your glasses.

882
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,680
So you have, that's a concern.

883
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,680
Yeah.

884
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,800
I mean the frames alone were like a hundred bucks or 120 and then the lenses and all the

885
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,000
coatings and like my insane least strong prescription.

886
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,840
And I had good eye insurance when I got these and it was still like 250, 300 out of pocket

887
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
or something.

888
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,840
Whoa.

889
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,840
Yeah.

890
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Dollars?

891
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,840
Dollars.

892
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,040
I mean, I have more money than anything.

893
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:18,960
Did you make like, were they paying you like sub minimum wage at a cricket?

894
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,680
Were you in like the, is it like four, four bucks an hour?

895
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,640
They were paying me an experience.

896
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,640
Oh my God.

897
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,800
You were a cricket intern and they laid you off?

898
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,800
Yeah.

899
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,800
Jesus.

900
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,240
It's like a comedy theater or something.

901
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,960
You're gonna have to do audition to get in the cricket?

902
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,960
Yes.

903
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,520
You just had to do like sample wireless.

904
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:53,880
I took cricket classes and then once I got through level seven, I got into the advanced

905
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,520
cricket intern program.

906
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,960
You got onto a Palm pilot team.

907
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,960
Yes.

908
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,960
Geez.

909
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
I don't.

910
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:07,120
I had to pay my boss.

911
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,120
You had to pay to work there like essentially?

912
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,120
Yeah.

913
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,120
Doesn't make any sense.

914
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,120
It's a community, right?

915
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:18,200
If anyone tweets about, in anger about what happened to you, I feel like it's just going

916
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,640
to be a big old mess that never gets solved.

917
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,640
Yes.

918
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:28,840
I, I, that's why I hopefully you all use the hashtag, hashtag sector keep, sector keeper

919
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,400
cricket wireless severance.

920
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Yeah.

921
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
Yeah.

922
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Right.

923
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
We will.

924
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,400
We will.

925
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,400
Not at the show at cricket wireless.

926
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
I'm not going to crack the Twitter account, cricket wireless.

927
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,960
I don't know how you feel about this insane training program.

928
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,960
Yeah.

929
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,480
I found this, I can get eight of the sunglasses I buy for $13.

930
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:51,160
That's what I used to that or just buy them on the boardwalk like down the beach.

931
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,560
So that's basically what I do.

932
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:58,320
You and I, our sunglasses money in two years combined doesn't equal what Jason had.

933
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,320
Yeah.

934
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,320
Well that makes sense.

935
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,720
My constant anxiety that I have forgotten them or left them somewhere.

936
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,160
I leave mine everywhere.

937
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,280
I break them constantly.

938
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,040
So it just, I've never ever invested in any sort of.

939
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,040
I can't have nice things.

940
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,040
Expensive.

941
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,040
Yeah.

942
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,040
I know what will happen.

943
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,700
When I, when I had like smaller, thinner glasses, I would buy, you had to put cheapie wayfarers

944
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,700
over top.

945
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:25,080
Uh, but these are, when I got big thick glasses, I had to get the, get the prescription and

946
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,140
it is nicer.

947
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,140
It is good.

948
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,140
I like it.

949
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,140
Yeah.

950
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,920
So, uh, what else we got on the sunglasses?

951
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,920
Yeah, that's it.

952
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,800
It's all just one big, it's all just one big shell game.

953
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,480
It's all just one big con.

954
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,480
I have question.

955
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,480
Yes.

956
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,320
Why is it called sunglass icon?

957
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,320
Oh, yeah.

958
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,920
We haven't really covered that.

959
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,400
So it is a sunglass hut.

960
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:54,400
So it's the only, there's only two sunglass icons around and they're in Disney on both

961
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,400
coasts.

962
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,400
Right?

963
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,400
Am I wrong?

964
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,400
Another double coaster.

965
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,080
Another double coaster.

966
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,600
And I honestly, now that I don't know if I came upon why they call it sunglass icon

967
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,600
is it Mickey?

968
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,600
Are we talking about Mickey?

969
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,680
I think it's like they're trying to like, like it's a special, it's special like Disney

970
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,920
world and Disneylanders, but this is a special sunglass hut.

971
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,280
Who would you say is a sunglass icon?

972
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,120
I'm sure there's a very, dreams Dean slide deck.

973
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,560
Elwood blues.

974
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,560
Elwood blues.

975
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,560
Sure.

976
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,240
Uh, that's something for later.

977
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,800
Ferris Bueller.

978
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
Yeah.

979
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,800
California raisins.

980
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,800
Yeah.

981
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,640
Man, dad who left them on, on the credit coaster.

982
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,240
They have Mickey, they have a brand of a Mickey specific sunglass thing that they're pushing

983
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:50,240
in the store and online, um, of sunglass icon, but I don't know who does it, does anyone

984
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,680
ever use that phrase?

985
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,800
Boy, what a sunglass icon.

986
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,680
Like what is it even with the right sunglass?

987
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,920
You just haven't, nobody's wearing their perfect pair yet.

988
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,960
I guess so.

989
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,960
Yeah.

990
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,200
The idea is like a exclusive destination downtown.

991
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:16,080
The classy word icon mixed with the word hut and the double also a brand name with a one,

992
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,880
a word in it twice.

993
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,880
Yes.

994
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,200
McDonald's cafe by McDonald's restaurant.

995
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,880
Well, that's McCafe and it's really an experience more than, yeah, well they named it, look,

996
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,200
they named it correctly.

997
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,880
If they'd called it McDonald's cafe by McDonald's restaurant, that's stupid.

998
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,840
So I, yeah, it seems they're just trying to be classy.

999
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,240
They're trying to make it seem like it's a classy thing, I guess.

1000
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:46,120
Cause that is what the whole idea of, I think downtown Disney is like a sub scale, you know?

1001
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,680
It's interesting.

1002
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,640
Similarly, uh, we didn't get, I had info and we didn't get to it when we were talking about

1003
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:59,040
Carthay circle, but the, what Carthay circle replaced was, uh, the, the, you know, the icon

1004
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,360
of the original California adventure, the big gold sun, which were the actual name for

1005
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,360
it was the sun icon.

1006
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,360
Really?

1007
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,360
I never knew that.

1008
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:15,320
The sun glass icon was really near sun icon, which is by the way, the flattest.

1009
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,320
Yeah.

1010
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,000
Cinderella castle, the spaceship or spaceship.

1011
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Sun icon.

1012
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,160
The thing that haunts and plagues us here in Southern California.

1013
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,160
Oh yes.

1014
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,160
Yeah.

1015
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,160
Yeah.

1016
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,160
That's getting worse and worse.

1017
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,680
It wreaks havoc on our life.

1018
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:33,840
And in California venture also, there was a dinosaur with the sunglasses that sold sunglasses.

1019
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Am I wrong?

1020
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,840
I believe so.

1021
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,840
Now though, yeah, those were a little cheaper.

1022
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,640
So those were cheaper, but that's gone now.

1023
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,960
And I still remember forgetting sunglasses once and spending like 20 bucks for a shitty

1024
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,960
pair there.

1025
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,960
Yeah, sure.

1026
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,480
It can be done, but not at sunglass icon.

1027
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,480
No.

1028
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,480
By sunglass hut.

1029
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,120
Which I think we've determined.

1030
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,120
High rollers.

1031
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,880
Is a monopoly, a waste of money and time.

1032
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,320
So there's two things I want a future president to do.

1033
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:03,720
Number one, pass a law that says you can't make people load up a gift card for more than

1034
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,720
they're going to spend.

1035
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,720
That should be outlawed.

1036
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,780
And number two, break up big eyeglass.

1037
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,780
That's what I want.

1038
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,040
Elizabeth Warren's talking a lot about breaking up tech companies.

1039
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,000
Talk about big eyeglass, Ms. Warren.

1040
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,600
Does she have a plan for these things?

1041
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,600
We don't know.

1042
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:24,320
Shouldn't we be talking to definite candidate Joe Biden instead?

1043
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,360
Yes.

1044
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,360
Who is for sure still in the race.

1045
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,360
Listen here.

1046
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,360
By the time this comes out.

1047
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,360
I grew up with Mr. Sunglass and what I really liked was how much he said I was great.

1048
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,760
Thank you so much, dear.

1049
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,040
He's taking money from the sunglass hut.

1050
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,960
He's in Ray Bans pocket.

1051
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,720
Joe Biden bad.

1052
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,840
Oh, you don't like Joe Biden.

1053
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,840
I met him.

1054
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,840
Really?

1055
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,840
Really?

1056
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,840
Where?

1057
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,840
In the 90s or recently?

1058
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,840
Purgatory.

1059
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,840
What?

1060
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,640
Did he die once already and come back?

1061
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,640
Every once in a while, he'll die.

1062
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,640
God.

1063
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,280
And he gets resuscitated?

1064
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,280
Multiple times.

1065
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,280
Then he comes back.

1066
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,280
Whoa.

1067
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,280
That's how it seems.

1068
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,280
Watch closely.

1069
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,280
Does it happen like mid debate?

1070
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,280
Yes.

1071
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,240
Like if the camera's not on him, he'll nap and then that turns into death?

1072
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,160
If the camera is on him.

1073
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,520
Oh, that explains it.

1074
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,080
His teeth start to fall out.

1075
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,080
So he came and popped in, said hey to you.

1076
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,080
Yes.

1077
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,080
Yeah.

1078
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,040
He'd be in and out in the holding area.

1079
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:31,520
Did he ever like pull you close and put an arm around you in a way that you didn't approve

1080
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,520
of?

1081
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,520
Always.

1082
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,520
Oh, man.

1083
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,080
I knew it.

1084
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:40,720
Did he ever briefly dying to inappropriately put his arm around?

1085
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,720
Did he have a nickname for you?

1086
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,720
Yeah.

1087
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,720
Corn pop.

1088
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,720
Yeah, yeah.

1089
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,720
Yeah, he did.

1090
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,720
He did.

1091
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,720
He called me corn pop.

1092
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,720
He just re-recycled the name.

1093
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:57,640
When he talks about corn pop, that could be any number of many people he's known on earth

1094
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,640
or in purgatory.

1095
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,640
He calls everyone.

1096
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,640
Yeah.

1097
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,640
He just tosses it around.

1098
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,160
It's like saying like you or hey, what's up, slick?

1099
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,120
Like anyone you can't remember the name of.

1100
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,920
You didn't even take the time to learn your name.

1101
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:11,920
What a son of a bitch.

1102
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,520
He doesn't get along like you and me do, SK.

1103
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,520
No.

1104
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,520
He's like, yeah.

1105
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,520
Yeah.

1106
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,520
If he takes money from mom.

1107
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,520
Oh, yeah.

1108
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,520
Jelly rings, jelly rings.

1109
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,520
Oh, yeah.

1110
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,520
Yeah.

1111
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:27,040
I think you gained like an inch in diameter there.

1112
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,040
Nice.

1113
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,040
Noise.

1114
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,040
Am I even cooler because I said noise?

1115
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,040
Yeah, feels good.

1116
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,040
Yeah.

1117
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,840
Feels good to get my fix.

1118
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,720
Are we ready to move to Curlsurf?

1119
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,720
I think so, yeah.

1120
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,720
Yeah.

1121
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,720
Well.

1122
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,720
All right.

1123
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,720
Curlsurf dinner, nanana.

1124
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,720
Curlsurf rules.

1125
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,720
Let's show it the proper respect.

1126
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,720
Yes.

1127
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,040
As you know, the full name.

1128
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,040
You have it.

1129
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,040
I don't.

1130
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,040
Do you say it?

1131
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,040
I'm not sure.

1132
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,040
Yeah.

1133
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,560
The full name of this establishment is Curlsurf by Sammy Duvall.

1134
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,560
Oh, yeah.

1135
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,560
Yeah, yeah.

1136
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,560
Yeah, yeah.

1137
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,560
I do have that.

1138
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,560
You, man.

1139
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,560
There's only.

1140
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,560
Just be a name.

1141
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,560
Only two of these exist.

1142
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,560
Two of these exist.

1143
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,560
Two of these exist.

1144
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,560
Where's the other one?

1145
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,560
Disney Springs.

1146
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,560
We don't need to go to Disney Springs.

1147
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,840
It's all the same shit.

1148
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,880
But there's probably differences in the way that the stores are laid out that we really

1149
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,080
should we should talk about.

1150
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,360
So say OK, you go.

1151
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,360
You go first.

1152
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,360
No, no, you go now.

1153
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,360
I just want to get that name out there.

1154
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,160
So Scott, did you look into Sammy Duvall at all?

1155
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,160
Oh, I miss this.

1156
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,160
Educate me.

1157
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,160
Oh, man.

1158
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,520
OK, here's what I find interesting.

1159
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,920
And there's not really a lot of answers.

1160
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,920
Is that Sammy Duvall?

1161
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,920
Sammy Duvall.

1162
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:41,280
You summoned a photo of like a painting of Sammy Duvall with jet skiers under him.

1163
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:48,920
Sammy Duvall is a jet water skier, an Olympic athlete, a child prodigy, a child prodigy.

1164
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:57,940
And he is he has been connected to Disney for 25 years in some capacity.

1165
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,040
And I this is shocking to me.

1166
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,280
Yeah, I didn't know any of this.

1167
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,400
So I was looking at Curlsurf and it's like it's a brand that basically like you go in

1168
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,040
there and you can buy like Billabong and you can buy different skating.

1169
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,040
O'Neill, Oakley.

1170
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,040
And like good stuff.

1171
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,600
Well, yeah, Oakley, sector keeper Oakley.

1172
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,600
Yeah.

1173
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,080
And I want to play in the big league.

1174
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,800
So I was looking around and I was like, you know, I like clothing, whatever.

1175
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,160
But I didn't know anything about Mr. Sammy Duvall.

1176
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,160
No.

1177
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,200
So Sammy Duvall has two stores.

1178
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,640
I'm like, how did he get involved?

1179
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,280
Because like these are the only two stores.

1180
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:36,800
Sammy Duvall had something at the Walt Disney World Resort called Sammy Duvall's Water Sports

1181
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,800
Center.

1182
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,800
I just got to it.

1183
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,960
Sammy Duvall was there for 20 years, I believe.

1184
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:47,280
And this is the place where you would water ski or parasail over Bay Lake.

1185
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,280
Oh, yeah.

1186
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:53,160
He took over my beloved Pablo Cruz water sports zone.

1187
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,160
Yes.

1188
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,560
OK, from the Contemporary.

1189
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:00,240
This closed or it closed like a year or two ago.

1190
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,320
OK.

1191
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,480
And it was there for 20 years.

1192
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:08,680
So anytime you were doing any of those water sports at Disney World, it was Sammy Duvall's

1193
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,400
branded water sports, essentially.

1194
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,680
Yeah, I did it.

1195
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:13,680
You did.

1196
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,680
Yeah.

1197
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,840
So you water skied or you parasailed or?

1198
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,680
Uh, water skied.

1199
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,680
Sure.

1200
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,960
And it was expensive.

1201
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,440
I looked it up, it's like 150 bucks to do that.

1202
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,440
And you could.

1203
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,440
Did you make it?

1204
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,360
Did you get a lot of water in your mouth and your face?

1205
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,360
Was it pleasant?

1206
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,400
No, it was fun.

1207
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,400
Yeah.

1208
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:43,240
I always wonder if you if you go to Disney World, why do that?

1209
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,920
Because you do whatever your heart did.

1210
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,960
A dream is a wish your heart makes when it's fast asleep.

1211
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,240
So you do whatever you want.

1212
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,760
I think it's very held over from the 70s, like it's a vacation destination.

1213
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,480
That's why there's got to be golf.

1214
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,280
There's got to be an equestrian thing.

1215
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,880
It's for dad, I think.

1216
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,440
That's I think a big selling point, especially the 70s and 80s.

1217
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,480
Dad would go there and he'd be like, I don't want to go on this stupid ride.

1218
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,720
And you go, well, do you want to get in some water skis?

1219
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,440
And he goes, oh, no, you're talking golf.

1220
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,040
Yeah, no, I'm not going to sound like this.

1221
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:18,080
Early marketing for Walt Disney World was like, this is a vacation destination resort.

1222
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,160
You know, put on a suit for dinner.

1223
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,440
Go parasailing, go water skiing.

1224
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,440
Put on a suit and go parasailing.

1225
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,440
Yeah, put on a suit and do that.

1226
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,080
There's a great, I think it's called the history of Disney World in documents.

1227
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:36,280
And it like catalogs like a lot of old tourism brochures and documents.

1228
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,280
It's great.

1229
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,280
It's great.

1230
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,480
Like I would love to fully like go through like the early days of Disney when they were

1231
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,120
like, well, you'll go to the park.

1232
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,120
Sure.

1233
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:49,720
But then you also want to have a buffet meal and see some Broadway singers and then take

1234
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,080
a putt-putt boat out.

1235
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,280
And the plans for like the Persian resorts.

1236
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:58,120
Yes, the Persian resorts, which looked very beautiful.

1237
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,520
And then the Islamic revolution happened.

1238
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,280
So the funding disappeared.

1239
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,280
Yes.

1240
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,920
They should bring that back.

1241
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,920
Yeah, they should.

1242
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,520
I mean, it would be a great olive branch.

1243
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,520
Boys, boys.

1244
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,520
All right.

1245
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,520
All right.

1246
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,520
Just to Sammy Duvall.

1247
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,720
I just got a text from the level keeper, my cousin.

1248
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,720
He said back to Sammy Duvall.

1249
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,720
Okay, back to Sammy Duvall.

1250
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:23,560
So on the Curl Surf website, this is direct copy from it.

1251
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,840
And this is very succinct about Sammy Duvall.

1252
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,040
Who is Sammy Duvall, you might ask?

1253
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,320
He one of the most accomplished water skiers in the world.

1254
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,880
So there's a typo.

1255
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,560
He one of the most accomplished water skiers in the world.

1256
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,120
So it's he and then one.

1257
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,120
And both words are capitalized.

1258
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,600
And this is like.

1259
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,600
We here for you.

1260
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,600
We're.

1261
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:50,360
He one of the most accomplished water skiers in the world.

1262
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,400
I just could not stop laughing.

1263
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,400
And I copied it.

1264
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,200
I copied it because it's kind of in like a.

1265
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,200
It's like a same copy.

1266
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,760
I have the same and I put it in the notes just to make sure I wasn't seeing anything.

1267
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,800
I have it in here and it just says he one of the most accomplished.

1268
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,800
He one of the.

1269
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,800
He one of the most accomplished.

1270
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,160
He one of the most accomplished water skiers in the world.

1271
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,040
It's just a little too long to put on a t-shirt, but it makes you.

1272
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,840
Or to fit into a meme because that's what I'm picturing.

1273
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:20,760
He was a child prodigy and won more than 80 professional championships throughout his

1274
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,760
career.

1275
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,440
He was sponsored by brands such as O'Neill, Oakley and others.

1276
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,440
Oakley.

1277
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,440
Yeah.

1278
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,200
So kind of brand agnostic.

1279
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,120
This has a lot of different brands.

1280
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:36,600
They got those Herschel backpacks that are like seventy five dollars and kind of chintzy

1281
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,520
when you start to open them up.

1282
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,160
Those little backpacks with the dragon on the back that I don't know how to pronounce

1283
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,320
in the name, but they're all the rage.

1284
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,320
Mm hmm.

1285
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:51,600
And it it says that he's built on those relationships to develop the ultimate retail experience.

1286
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,820
Yeah.

1287
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:55,560
So I'm just like, when did he get involved?

1288
00:52:55,560 --> 00:53:01,160
Did he talk to like people at Disney about opening up only stores that are at Disney?

1289
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,640
Like he's in the family.

1290
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,040
I think it's going to keep happening.

1291
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,640
Well I'm just like, who else is affiliated with Disney?

1292
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,920
And then like they're just in the family.

1293
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,520
They're like, you know, we got to find something new for Sammy to do.

1294
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,520
Did Sammy come in with schemes?

1295
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,520
Like you know, you got to.

1296
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,600
What if I sold a bunch of skate shoes?

1297
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,600
You know, I don't know.

1298
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:24,400
I'm just interested in this guy who only can get a store open at Disney World.

1299
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,480
That's a hard retail space to have.

1300
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,920
Very specific.

1301
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,840
And it's like, I'm just, I couldn't really find, I was like, I looked up Michael Eisner,

1302
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:37,800
Sammy Duvall expecting like them to be water skiing together in a photo, but I didn't find

1303
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,800
it.

1304
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,320
And maybe I just need to do more digging.

1305
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,320
But I couldn't.

1306
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,320
He's like a young man.

1307
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,320
He's not old.

1308
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,320
Yeah.

1309
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,480
Sammy, Sammy Duvall's water sports center.

1310
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:52,040
That sounds to me like one time I played golf at a Lawrence Welk golf resort.

1311
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,000
Like I would have, I would have expected that Sammy Duvall like died in 1979.

1312
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Water sports center.

1313
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,080
I like, you know, I like old timey crap, but when I would stay at my grandparents sometimes

1314
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,920
if they were watching us and they would watch the Lawrence Welk show every night and I was

1315
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,840
like, oh man, even I have my limits.

1316
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:15,080
That's exactly the line I think is like that.

1317
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:19,360
That's the exact example of like things that don't cross generationally at all.

1318
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,360
Yeah.

1319
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,360
I liked Matlock.

1320
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,360
Okay.

1321
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:26,200
I liked Matlock and diagnosis murder because they're mystery, they're mysteries and like

1322
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,120
crime, but they were never too stressful.

1323
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,120
Never too exciting.

1324
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,360
And those are younger guys you can relate to.

1325
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,360
Yeah.

1326
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,880
I got life in them.

1327
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:41,880
I did have a very good Pizza Hut personal pan pizza at the Welk resort and took a photo

1328
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,760
next to a Lawrence Welk statue.

1329
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,760
It was a good time.

1330
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,760
I don't know what that is.

1331
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,760
It's in San Diego County.

1332
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,040
So they would check out Welk resort.

1333
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,520
They would sell Pizza Hut at the Welk resort.

1334
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,520
Wow.

1335
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,560
Cause they, they sell Pizza Hut in one of the, I forget which like a Hilton hotel near Disney

1336
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,740
that I've stayed at with my family.

1337
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:00,260
So they do have like a Pizza Hut express.

1338
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:02,400
So it's interesting to know that the Lawrence Welk family.

1339
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,480
Interesting to know.

1340
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,480
It is.

1341
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,480
Your boy said everything reboot.

1342
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,480
Yes.

1343
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,480
Oh yeah.

1344
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,480
Oh yeah.

1345
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,480
Will they reboot Lawrence Welk?

1346
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,240
Sarah Lawrence Welk Jr.

1347
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,460
That seems, I don't know.

1348
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:18,200
Maybe, but maybe there's a way to, what would that look like?

1349
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:25,040
I get, would you like polka music and bubbles if it were played by 17 year olds?

1350
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,040
What would you?

1351
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,040
Yeah.

1352
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,040
You're exactly.

1353
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,040
You're the young audience.

1354
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,040
We can focus group on.

1355
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,040
Yeah.

1356
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,680
So you'd get into polka.

1357
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:36,200
So you like bubbles flying around like you're back in the bowl bath as a kid.

1358
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,480
There's bubbles flying around and music.

1359
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,480
Yeah.

1360
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,960
That sounds fun.

1361
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:41,960
Wow.

1362
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,960
All right.

1363
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,960
So new Lawrence Welk.

1364
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,200
There's a new Lawrence Welk out there.

1365
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,360
There's, there's a new service called Quibi.

1366
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,360
You could pay me pitch that to Quibi.

1367
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,360
Yeah.

1368
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,760
I, as long as Quibi is still around by the time this episode comes out.

1369
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,560
Well, no, it hasn't launched yet.

1370
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,560
I guess you're right.

1371
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:03,480
So, but it's, but if you're listening to this, if you're listening to this in May, 2020,

1372
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,080
then you're listening to it on Quibi podcast because they bought us out because they are

1373
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,720
all entertainment now after a month.

1374
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,720
Yeah.

1375
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,720
That's a good point.

1376
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:16,920
They're all Quibi employees and they also, which actually was purchased by that big eyeglass

1377
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:17,920
company.

1378
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,920
Oh, Luxottica.

1379
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:19,920
Luxottica owns Quibi.

1380
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,920
Esselord Luxottica.

1381
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,920
And we have to plug their eyeglasses.

1382
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,920
Yeah.

1383
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,480
While we were talking, while we were talking just now, I went back to my photos from when

1384
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:34,120
I went to the Welk Resort in 2014 and I found a sign in the window of a beverage they serve,

1385
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,920
almond champagne, the Oh My Gosh champagne.

1386
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:38,920
What?

1387
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,920
I don't know.

1388
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:40,920
Oh my gosh.

1389
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:41,920
I want to try it.

1390
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,400
I do not remember I had this photo.

1391
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:48,800
The Oh My Gosh champagne from Wilson Creek at www.gotalmond.com.

1392
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,800
Whoa.

1393
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:53,800
Gotalmond, which just combines into Gotalmond.

1394
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,800
Got a lot of questions.

1395
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,440
I mean, they've got to reboot this.

1396
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,240
Reboot almond champagne.

1397
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,360
Get the kids drinking.

1398
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:05,080
You get off the jewel in a second if you had almond champagne.

1399
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,880
Is the Welk, is that place still there?

1400
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,880
The Welk?

1401
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:08,880
I think so.

1402
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,160
The Welk Resort in San Diego.

1403
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,160
Yeah.

1404
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,160
Let's all have it down there.

1405
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,320
Maybe after we go to that rock place that invited us.

1406
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,800
We got invited to a fake rock factory and we haven't taken them up because it's far

1407
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,800
away.

1408
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,000
Is it by San Diego or is it more by?

1409
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
It's weird San Diego County.

1410
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Oh it is.

1411
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Like you're in like Temecula.

1412
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Okay.

1413
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Yeah.

1414
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,480
So we can go down some almond champagne and then go see some fake rocks.

1415
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,480
God, that sounds great.

1416
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,480
You're invited.

1417
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,480
You're coming along.

1418
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,480
Yeah, I'm in.

1419
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,480
Yeah, yeah.

1420
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,760
Bring some almond jewel too.

1421
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:42,920
So Sammy Duvall has got some relationship with Disney and I'm just, I want to know what

1422
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,920
does he have on them?

1423
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:44,920
What dirt does he have?

1424
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:45,920
What does he have on them?

1425
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,920
And it's like, yeah, I mean.

1426
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,600
Is it Wide World of Sports?

1427
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,880
That's different, I think, right?

1428
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:51,880
The Wide World of Sports was a different.

1429
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,880
Yeah, that was a different part of property.

1430
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:54,880
Yeah.

1431
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,880
Did he participate?

1432
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,880
It's a good question.

1433
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,320
I don't know the answer to that.

1434
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,880
I feel like this was his own thing.

1435
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:03,880
I think he stayed in his lane, his water lane.

1436
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:10,560
But I think, but he got a cut, I'm sure every time any dad went up in a parasail, you know.

1437
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,040
Grumpy dad.

1438
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,040
Yeah.

1439
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:18,880
Whenever one of your boat drove her dad around in the air.

1440
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,360
Sammy Duvall got a taste.

1441
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:26,440
The custom stores that are only in Disney Springs and downtown, is it like a couture?

1442
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,760
Like they're like, well, you can't get these anywhere else.

1443
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,360
Is that what the idea?

1444
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,360
I don't know.

1445
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,360
I'm so fascinated.

1446
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:37,560
This is a, City Walk has its own version of the surf clothing store.

1447
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,720
That must just be a thing that sells well.

1448
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,720
Billabong.

1449
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:41,720
Right, Billabong.

1450
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,360
Billabong still going strong.

1451
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,360
Element closed.

1452
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,360
So I don't know if they saw like.

1453
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,360
Sorry, sir.

1454
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,360
Whoa.

1455
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,360
Remember what a great time we had at Element?

1456
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,360
Never again.

1457
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,840
I feel like it's been only months.

1458
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,360
All of these places closed.

1459
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,880
I know, and post our show.

1460
00:58:58,880 --> 00:58:59,880
Yeah.

1461
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,600
It's like we didn't get the tourism up there.

1462
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,000
Or we did and they bungled it.

1463
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,360
It's like I left and it started to crumble.

1464
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,360
You were holding on to all the calories.

1465
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,360
Kind of, yeah.

1466
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,360
That is what happened.

1467
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,360
Maybe we have to go back.

1468
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,360
Oh no.

1469
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,360
We're only in episode two.

1470
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,040
There's only like one new place.

1471
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,600
The rest are just empty storefronts.

1472
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,600
You're going to send us a fucking 11 more missions by the end of this?

1473
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,000
Yeah, it's really going to be our newest daily series.

1474
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,200
One a month now.

1475
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,200
No.

1476
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,320
Malls, reviewing malls.

1477
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:36,280
So yeah, Sammy Duvall, he's a man of mystery as far as I'm concerned.

1478
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,360
Maybe they just saw an opportunity where like we need a surf shop with surf type clothing

1479
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:43,200
and they go, you know, Sammy would be perfect for this.

1480
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,200
Let's get Sammy involved.

1481
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,200
Sammy's got any ideas?

1482
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,640
And he's like, yeah, get all the brands in one spot.

1483
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:53,000
I've developed a relationship with all these brands from my time as being a world champion

1484
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
water skier.

1485
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,720
And they're like, this guy's perfect.

1486
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,720
And they got him in.

1487
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,120
They brought him into the tent and it makes a lot of sense.

1488
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,120
So let's see.

1489
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,120
Very nice scene.

1490
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,720
This is a very polite business transaction.

1491
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,720
Sammy seems like a great guy.

1492
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,240
We like the stuff in the store.

1493
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,240
I think we all like it.

1494
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,400
Sammy Duvall has great taste.

1495
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:18,920
So I am interested to see if Sammy Duvall's Curl Surf can expand past the downtown Disney

1496
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,400
and Disney Springs areas.

1497
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,400
Can we see?

1498
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,400
I don't know.

1499
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,400
There's not a lot of language.

1500
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,400
Get him on Shark Tank.

1501
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,400
Get him on Shark Tank.

1502
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,040
It's like a water thing too.

1503
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,040
Hey, that's great.

1504
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,040
Yeah.

1505
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,400
So here's a little tease.

1506
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,600
A Shark Tank cast member will factor into a future stage.

1507
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,600
Great.

1508
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,160
Get your hopes way up for how interesting this is going to be.

1509
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,880
Edwin literally popped up.

1510
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:41,880
He first said that.

1511
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:42,880
Yeah.

1512
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,880
Who's it going to be?

1513
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:44,880
Cuban?

1514
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:45,880
You don't know.

1515
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:46,880
Damon?

1516
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:47,880
Time will tell Edwin.

1517
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:48,880
I don't know.

1518
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,080
So anyway, I'm out of interesting things to talk about.

1519
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,080
Me too.

1520
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,080
I've come to my end.

1521
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,080
Yes.

1522
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,520
Out of uninteresting things to talk about.

1523
01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:01,800
Exactly, that's not totally true because I went to gotalmond.com and it redirected me

1524
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:08,040
to almondchampaign.com which informed me that it is no longer known as almond champagne.

1525
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:12,160
It is now almond sparkling wine despite the web address being almond champagne.

1526
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:16,520
Well, did it redirect or it's still our almond champagne?

1527
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,520
It's still almond champagne.

1528
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,520
Is it fermented?

1529
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,520
It redirected from Got Almond.

1530
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,520
Oh, okay.

1531
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,680
Is it just a brand of champagne or is it champagne made from fermented almonds?

1532
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,680
I can't.

1533
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,680
There's a whole story.

1534
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,680
I don't know.

1535
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:27,680
Who knows?

1536
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,600
But they keep reiterating that it is the, oh my gosh, champagne.

1537
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,160
Oh my gosh.

1538
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,520
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

1539
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,080
We'll deal with the walkers later.

1540
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,080
Boys, boys.

1541
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,080
Yeah?

1542
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,080
You've done so well.

1543
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,480
You give me strength.

1544
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,080
And we did still because I feel like we meandered a lot.

1545
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,960
But if you consider that strength, then I'm happy.

1546
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,280
There was a little bit where I think I dozed off.

1547
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,280
That's fine.

1548
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,200
But you didn't meet Biden in purgatory.

1549
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,800
Yeah, I did meet Joe Biden in purgatory.

1550
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,400
Not long enough for the nap.

1551
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,400
But you did so well.

1552
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,400
Yeah.

1553
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:07,360
And I've just learned that by giving me strength, my cousin, the level keeper, he's texted me

1554
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:10,360
and you've given him or her strength as well.

1555
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,360
Great.

1556
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:14,880
And I have something to add to your inventory, an item for completing.

1557
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,880
Next boss.

1558
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,120
What was the name of it again?

1559
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,680
It was level one, stage two.

1560
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:23,160
Level one, stage two.

1561
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:28,080
I reward you three black aprons.

1562
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:31,920
The aprons from Starbucks.

1563
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,560
And we get to wear them even though we're not master brewers.

1564
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,560
Yeah.

1565
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:37,560
You've earned them.

1566
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,560
Whoa.

1567
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:43,680
We did something else more valiant than cooking a good cup of coffee.

1568
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:51,960
For those who didn't know, you one of the greatest of all time.

1569
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,320
We one of the greatest.

1570

01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,320
Wow.

Wow.

1574
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:03,400
I'm pretty honored by this and I'm excited to store up these aprons and hopefully they

1575
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:08,800
can protect us from a boss, which that is what's around the corner tomorrow.

1576
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:09,800
Yeah.

1577
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:17,940
Because we will encounter our first boss and I'm nervous about it, but I'm invested enough

1578
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:24,840
thanks to the kindness of your cousin and we'll try to help him or her out.

1579
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:25,840
