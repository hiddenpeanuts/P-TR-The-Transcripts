1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Applause.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Applause.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Applause.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hello!

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Applause.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah, get it.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah, get it.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, get it.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Ahem.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Ahem.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Ahem.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Warning.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The following live podcast is occurring in a hotel ballroom

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
where we can't reveal ourselves dramatically while the music is playing.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So we had to do it out of order. Thanks for bearing with us.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Due to the presence of a hotel bar just a few feet away,

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
it's distinctly possible that I, Scott, have been Chardonnay drunk for the last four hours.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yeah.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Uh, well, unlike D23, we may...

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Unlike D23, we may not have the presence tonight of The Rock,

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Emily Blunt, Tom Holland, Tina Fey, Jamie Foxx, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Angelina Jolie,

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and everyone from Rise of Skywalker.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But we do have Jenny Nicholson joining us tonight.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Applause.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Live near but not affiliated with the D23 Expo.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's Podcast the Ride!

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Applause.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Music.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What do we do during the theme?

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We've never faced this before.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You're not worried about it.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
No, it's fine. It's almost over. I'm just trying to...

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I feel like I've got to fill the space.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hi, hi.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Welcome to the Vanaheim Hotel.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Wow, everyone's here.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Welcome to Podcast the Ride!

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Live from a very bright hotel ballroom.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Where we're here to tell you that divorce is not the end of your life.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's just the beginning.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
First things first.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I want to talk to you all about converting U.S. dollars to Iraqi dinar.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Laughter.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
A little bit of theme park bullshit before that.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's coming.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Hey, thanks so much for coming out, everybody.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh, my God.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Wow.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That's Scott Gerdner.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hey, hello.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's Jason Sheridan.

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm Mike. Hi.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Would anyone mind if I refill my AP sipper over...

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Would anyone be upset if I did that?

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Because what happens is...

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hold on, Aaron, one second.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The AP sipper...

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Who has an AP sipper in the room?

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
There's a few. Okay.

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This one? This specific one?

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So what the deal is, is that you buy this, and then it's like $15,

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and then you can get a refill for a dollar at certain places in Disneyland.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But what I think is, like, they're trying to keep it, like, cool or warm.

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's deceptively small.

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The sipper doesn't carry that much liquid.

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
There's sort of a second cup within the cup.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah, take a look. You know what I'm saying?

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So, like, I filled it up, and I said, I'm going to be good to go.

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I drank all of it outside.

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So I got a refill now. Thank you, Aaron. Thank you so much.

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh, wow. Hey, thanks, Aaron.

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That was very good.

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Applause.

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
She's not going to refill all of your sippers.

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I mean, let's lay that rule down right now.

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But thanks for doing mics.

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh, my God. So who was at D23?

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Round of applause, show of hands.

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
All right. Well, that makes 50 of us, and not the three of us up here.

86
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No.

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We didn't do it.

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Well, they wouldn't allow us to do it.

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Well, it wasn't that we...

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay, I mean, we could have bought passes.

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But we were technically denied press passes.

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Twice. We went back.

93
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We went with, like, hey, yes, boo, boo.

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This weird third-party company they give credentialing services to.

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That's real. That's real. Right?

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I guess you would call it a credentialing service.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah, I guess.

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So, like, yeah, there's a whole form you have to fill out,

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and you have to explain who you are, and it feels really sad.

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And then they rejected Jason.

101
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Jason and I applied, and they rejected us.

102
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And then a couple weeks later, I was like, I'm going to try again.

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm really upset.

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So I went in, and I just emailed, and I said,

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
hey, you know, I found the form a bit limiting.

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So...

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Uh...

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And I believe that is exactly what I wrote.

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And then I really did a desperate, like, you know, last month on our Twitter,

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Michael Eisner retweeted us.

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And...

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes. Yes.

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So...

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hell yeah.

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And...

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That may have been worse, that you mentioned Eisner.

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That is true.

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
No, absolutely not.

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We had Al Lutz take care of that fucker.

120
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We had Al Lutz fucking double-tap that guy.

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Wow.

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's what we're really here about.

123
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
We're here to get to the bottom of the Al Lutz conspiracy.

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Is everyone in a follow?

125
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah.

126
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Everyone stand up, present your theories.

127
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We'll give you all ten minutes at the mic.

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
After about three medium posts and 30 pages of message board posts,

129
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I was no closer to the truth than when I began.

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't even want to start explaining to a layperson what it all is,

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
because where you wouldn't get there,

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
it would take the entire amount of time we're going to be in here to explain it all.

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So never mind.

134
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Either you're in the Al Lutz conspiracy club or you're not.

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's what a cool club.

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I was just out of curiosity.

137
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Of the people who know what we're talking about,

138
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
who believes the medium post?

139
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
No one?

140
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Follow-up question.

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Who cares?

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Who cares?

143
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
A couple people care.

144
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Two, three, okay.

145
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Five cares.

146
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Five cares.

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Should we bring up somebody who did go to D23,

148
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
who did make it behind the Golden Gates?

149
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes, and got a media badge.

150
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh.

151
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I don't think I'm telling a tale out of school, am I?

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Well, we'll see.

153
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Maybe she's mad.

154
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yeah, so let's bring her up.

155
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes, one of our favorite guests from our amazing YouTube channel, Jenny Nicholson.

156
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, boy.

157
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You are now the second new Epcot Mickey hat wearer in the room.

158
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
There's another one of those around.

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That's great.

160
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yeah, well, you come bearing brand new merch, wearing brand new merch.

161
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Information and merch.

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
All the good stuff.

163
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
We can write on the mic.

164
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You can adjust that.

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah, you can get right on that.

166
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Sure, we didn't set it to your height.

167
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I could also move it up.

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'll move it up.

169
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Okay.

170
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I did it.

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I did it myself.

172
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Alex got it.

173
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Thanks for helping us, Alex.

174
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Our editor.

175
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Alex edits the shows, and he's here tonight.

176
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah, he's on it.

177
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He's so salty.

178
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yeah.

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He'll edit that part out of the live.

180
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hey, there we go.

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We just do the, give you our notes live.

182
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Great.

183
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh, my God.

184
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Thank you so much for joining us, Jenny.

185
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Thank you for having me come to this.

186
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We've done a live podcast.

187
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Oh, really?

188
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Huh.

189
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah.

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Well, as a, we're experts with what with our three, but.

191
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Is that unusual to have not done a live podcast?

192
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't think so.

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
No, I think most normal humans, that is the case.

194
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah.

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah.

196
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's a pretty specific sub genre, isn't it?

197
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yeah.

198
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So, all right.

199
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So you made it.

200
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You made it to the floor.

201
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I did.

202
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah.

203
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I looked at everything.

204
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Uh-huh.

205
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah.

206
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's great.

207
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And you, but you were, you were telling us before we started, uh, light on the panels,

208
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
light on entry to the panels.

209
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Well, the thing is like, you can either sleep outside, um, or you can not get into any panel.

210
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Or unless it's Disney on Broadway, which they were begging people to go to.

211
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah.

212
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
They literally did a PA announcement and they were like, if anyone else wants to come, there's,

213
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
there's a lot of room.

214
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It was very plaintive.

215
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah.

216
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Oh, no.

217
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
A little sad.

218
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Did you go?

219
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
No.

220
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Aw.

221
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I would have gone.

222
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And I like Broadway.

223
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I probably would have marked it down.

224
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I was like, all right, parks panel.

225
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Oh, Broadway panel.

226
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I bet there'll be some, before it's there.

227
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I was actively afraid they were going to like mention Tarzan on Broadway or something.

228
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Just have to sit in that.

229
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah.

230
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah.

231
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah.

232
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Have to be a rumor.

233
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Come on, give me a Jane Solo number.

234
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Jason, Jason, you know that they're going to like show up on the show, like, you know,

235
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you

236
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:31,440
know, like, show like Hercules musical, not like an old showboat musical time.

237
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,200
I could see Disney whitewashing showboat like cleaning up showboat for Disney Plus.

238
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Right?

239
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
I could see.

240
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
I guess.

241
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Yeah.

242
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Maybe.

243
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,200
I don't know what happens in showboat.

244
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Yeah.

245
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,040
They made three.

246
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,600
They made the movie three times.

247
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,560
But then again, you thought it was crazy when I started to describe what a star is born

248
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,440
was about.

249
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,560
Which they made four times.

250
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,360
Can I do that trick of did anyone not know the ending of A Star is Born even though?

251
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,840
Okay, it's not a majority.

252
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
All right.

253
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
All right.

254
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,080
I'm going to play this trick against you of people knowing what you're talking about.

255
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,680
We're not here to talk about showboat.

256
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
Yeah.

257
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,840
So Jenny, you've been how many what year?

258
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,880
How many times have you been to a D23?

259
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,560
This is my fourth D23.

260
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,560
I know.

261
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,560
And when the first year I went, it was very uncrowded and you could get into things.

262
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,160
You would just go like an hour before, like the way the world usually works.

263
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,120
And you could just line up and get in.

264
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,880
But now it's like if you get the Fastpass, I heard you still can't get in unless you

265
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
go overnight.

266
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,280
So they have.

267
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,080
OK, we said I don't know any of this.

268
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,880
They have still the Fastpass system is still in play.

269
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,960
Line and apparently they still run out of space.

270
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
I don't know.

271
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
Someone warned me today.

272
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,080
I got in to the panel pass for the parks panel tomorrow.

273
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,120
So you're going to it.

274
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,440
Yeah, some other people got in.

275
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
Yeah, we should.

276
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,800
I should say we're doing we're recording this before the panel that says all of the

277
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,240
new stuff that's happening at the theme parks.

278
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:18,200
So the one most applicable to us, we're we're just going to guess about a little bit.

279
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,120
We'll put out some catty tweets about it, I'm sure.

280
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Covered.

281
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,720
Watch out the journey of water.

282
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,360
Right.

283
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,360
That's what it's called.

284
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
Right.

285
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
I think so.

286
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,440
The way of water.

287
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
Excuse me.

288
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
Yeah.

289
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,440
And the seed bearer.

290
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,440
That's going to be great.

291
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,560
And one number four, I think.

292
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,760
That's the the Avatar.

293
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
Avatar four is the.

294
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
Yeah, I think so.

295
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:53,280
Avatar five, the invention of lying.

296
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
That's right.

297
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Right.

298
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,880
Yeah, that's whatever Jake solely invents lying on Pandora.

299
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Honestly, that's good.

300
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,960
Because they the Navi weren't lying before.

301
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
Oh, yeah.

302
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,560
They're such a pure species.

303
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
Absolutely.

304
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,400
With the 20th century Fox purchase, does Disney now own the invention?

305
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
It's very possible.

306
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,840
That's actually why they bought Fox.

307
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Yeah.

308
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,760
They've been trying to get their hands on that for a long time.

309
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Yeah.

310
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,880
The problem with this film is it was human characters, but another species, we think

311
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,880
it's really got a shot.

312
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
Sure.

313
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Yeah.

314
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,440
Well, now I can try to Pandora and remakes of anything.

315
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Really?

316
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,720
Maybe that's what they open up.

317
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
Yes.

318
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,880
At this point is all stories happen within Pandora world.

319
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
Star Wars.

320
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,720
You can't just do a Star Wars remake of anything because like it's a little similar to our

321
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
world.

322
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,720
But if the actors are blue aliens, that's instant novelty.

323
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Even if it's still on Earth.

324
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,720
You know, like while you were sleeping would be good.

325
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
Oh, that'd be great.

326
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,560
I'm glad there's so many fans of it in the audience.

327
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Yeah.

328
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,120
Well, and then they can like concurrently make a move.

329
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,920
You know, what's what's going to film soon?

330
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,400
The new Indiana Jones.

331
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,440
They film it just with dots all over the faces.

332
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,440
And then you're filming the avatar version concurrently with the one that you're.

333
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,920
And then you have a different team that removes the dots for the non-avatar version.

334
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

335
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,440
Like who's the way which guy to remove his mustache?

336
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Henry Cavill.

337
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,440
Yeah, yeah.

338
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
Uh huh.

339
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
Uh huh.

340
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
Everyone knew that fact.

341
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
Yeah, no, that one I know.

342
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,160
Yeah, that's a very famous person and story.

343
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,360
Quick quick question for the audience.

344
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,680
How often are we trying to figure an answer out to something we've asked and you're yelling

345
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
at us?

346
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
Wow.

347
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,680
Okay.

348
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,680
Oh no.

349
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
All right.

350
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,680
Well, now we're scared.

351
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,080
This stage is not that high up.

352
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,680
And we can really see the whites of your eyes.

353
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,960
You wanted a, you asked for a moat.

354
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
Yeah.

355
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,960
But they couldn't do it.

356
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,040
I mean, we weren't quite sure what we were going to have.

357
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,320
I mean, we've clearly jerry-rigged something here.

358
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Oh yeah.

359
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
Everything is working.

360
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,320
I mean, everything's working.

361
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
There's a projector on the floor.

362
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,720
There's a projector on the floor.

363
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,600
My projector from home is on the floor.

364
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,800
You're just all in my apartment right now.

365
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,240
To save some money, we brought our own microphones.

366
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
That too.

367
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,560
So we're very cheap.

368
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,560
So yeah.

369
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,320
So we have a whole setup here and it's not the most glamorous, but it's nice.

370
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
Yes.

371
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Everyone nod.

372
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
Yes.

373
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
They nod and make us scream.

374
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
We can see all of your nods.

375
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,040
The people at the Anaheim Hotel have been great.

376
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,640
The pizza press dinner there was great.

377
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,080
The beautiful bar in the lobby.

378
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,320
There's a nice pool out.

379
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,720
No one's in the pool out back.

380
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,640
We're all going in after it.

381
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,080
I don't have permission or authority to say this.

382
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,600
Like that Area 51 thing.

383
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,400
They can't stop all of us.

384
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:08,480
So Jenny, highlights from your last two days of D23.

385
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,400
There's a Skyway bucket inside.

386
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Nice.

387
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,680
And you can go close to it.

388
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
But not inside?

389
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,520
I feel like I could have touched it.

390
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
I didn't ask.

391
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Okay.

392
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,600
But it wasn't like there wasn't a line for a photo up inside.

393
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,600
No, I don't think they wanted anyone climbing in it.

394
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,600
This was like an auction.

395
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,040
Actually the best stuff I've seen was like the people who just auction old Disney things.

396
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,040
I didn't even see if the archives are there this year.

397
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,200
I saw you can go look at costumes from Maleficent.

398
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,240
So I didn't go in there.

399
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
It's a mystery to me.

400
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,600
Yeah, I wasn't drawn in by that for whatever reason.

401
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,800
Number one highlight, Skyway bucket.

402
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
Yeah.

403
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,800
There was a scary little animatronic Mickey that used to be in a Main Street window.

404
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,800
That was also at the auction place.

405
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,040
But it was already scary looking.

406
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,600
And I asked if it could still move.

407
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,320
And when they did, I had the most visceral physical fear response.

408
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,560
Like when you find a bug crawling on you and just all your hair stands on end and your

409
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,560
stomach clenches.

410
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,360
I don't know what I was expecting.

411
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,720
They told me it was an animatronic.

412
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,720
But when they confirmed it could move, it was extremely scary.

413
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,720
I think you posted that.

414
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,720
And they said, oh no, it's not plugged in.

415
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,720
But that was another highlight.

416
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
You posted that on Twitter, right?

417
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,720
I think I saw that.

418
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Yeah, I posted a photo of him.

419
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
He's very scary.

420
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,720
Oh, this is good cross promotion.

421
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,720
If you guys all look at my personal Twitter account, you can see the Mickey.

422
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Oh yeah, everyone look at the Twitter right now and make a noise.

423
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
It's on television.

424
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,720
No, is that too much?

425
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,720
Yeah.

426
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,720
If we all go on the hotel Wi-Fi, will it crash it?

427
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
All right, don't look at it later.

428
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,720
So imagine a scary Mickey.

429
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,720
Yeah, scary Mickey.

430
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
What else?

431
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,720
Well, you also tweeted something I liked, which is that in the assortment of costumes

432
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,720
that were on display that there was the holes cosplay.

433
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
Oh, wait, I missed that.

434
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
Holes, the film holes.

435
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,720
I literally chased them because I saw them when they were already far away, but they were

436
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
going to their car.

437
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
So I had to catch them.

438
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,720
It's not like I'd see them later, but they were Stanley Yelnats and Zero.

439
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,720
So they had like the best part about it.

440
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
They had the prison jumpsuits.

441
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
They had their respective hats.

442
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
But the thing that made it clear it was holes.

443
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
I thought there was someone blowing their nose really loudly.

444
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,720
The thing that made it clear it was holes as they were carrying the empty gallon jugs of water.

445
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,720
So like that really brought it home.

446
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,720
Like that's burdening yourself.

447
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
It made it amazing.

448
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
A lot of holes fans here today.

449
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
Yeah, I know.

450
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
Big showing for holes.

451
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
Yeah.

452
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,720
Jimmy Buffett produced and appears in the movie, I believe.

453
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,720
Really?

454
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
In holes?

455
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
In holes.

456
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Is he like the racist sheriff?

457
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
No, he's something.

458
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,720
I feel like Mike would be aware if Jimmy Buffett played a racist sheriff in something.

459
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,720
I wouldn't hear of it.

460
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,720
But if he showed up and did it, you couldn't have stopped him.

461
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,720
Wait, we have confirmation.

462
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
What's that?

463
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
John Voight.

464
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,720
John Voight.

465
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,720
John Voight.

466
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,720
Okay.

467
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
Okay.

468
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,720
And John Voight doesn't have a lot of songs about hamburgers and such.

469
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,720
Just to keep my wires straight.

470
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,720
He doesn't have publicly released songs.

471
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
Oh yeah, yeah.

472
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,720
Who knows what he's doing at home.

473
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
They don't know what he's jamming on.

474
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
He likely does.

475
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Yeah.

476
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,720
Yeah, so.

477
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,720
Oh wait, you know where I was heading was that you had a photo with the,

478
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,720
an Elizabeth Moss costume from The Handmaid's Tale.

479
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,720
Right.

480
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,720
At Detroit, at the Disney thing where all the princess stuff is.

481
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,720
We also had Pooka from that one show that's like Black Mirror, but not Black Mirror.

482
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
Oh.

483
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,720
It's like a big mascot suit that possesses the man that portrays it on a children's show.

484
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,720
So that was there.

485
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,720
Yeah, and I guess he's active on Twitter, the mascot suit is.

486
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,720
He's been tweeting at me ever since he appeared in that photo.

487
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
Oh no.

488
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Wait, you're getting harassed now by a fictional puppet man.

489
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
And he's verified.

490
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,720
Pooka the verified mascot suit wants a follow back from me.

491
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,720
I don't know how I feel about that.

492
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
Hmm.

493
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Hmm.

494
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,720
Yeah, that seemed, that sort of borders on harassment I would have to think.

495
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
Yeah, get out people's Menchies, Pooka.

496
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
Well, he's a mascot suit.

497
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,720
It's different etiquette.

498
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,720
Okay.

499
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,720
Yeah.

500
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,720
You're not, he's not welcome here.

501
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,720
Pooka's not.

502
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,720
If he walks in that door, nobody let him in.

503
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,720
He's not on the list.

504
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
Wait, so.

505
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
That's pretty exciting.

506
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,720
I, clarification.

507
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,720
So is it an official costume from Handmaid's Tale or someone was cosplaying us?

508
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,720
Yeah, it was on a mannequin and like it was a little exhibit celebrating Handmaid's Tale.

509
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
Yeah.

510
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,720
Oh boy, they really do own everything.

511
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,720
Jesus.

512
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,720
But what, like where in the crosshair, like in all of the merging and everything that's

513
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
happened since when?

514
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,720
Since when is Handmaid's Tale.

515
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,720
Disney has full control of Hulu now.

516
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,720
Oh, even though they didn't make the show, they own.

517
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Okay.

518
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,720
They own, really?

519
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,720
Huh.

520
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,720
All right.

521
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,720
So are they going to be walking around the park then too?

522
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,720
Which land would we put them in?

523
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
Tomorrowland?

524
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,720
Yeah, Tomorrowland.

525
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,720
Yeah, Tomorrowland.

526
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,720
Maybe some water slide or something that looks like the helmet that's like, you know, you

527
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
can sort of splash up the sides of it.

528
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,720
The helmet.

529
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,720
The Handmaid's Helmet?

530
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,720
Yeah.

531
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,720
That's an acceptable term for what they wear, isn't it?

532
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720
Ladies, put on your helmets.

533
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,720
What if it was like a Jedi training academy but with handmaids?

534
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,720
That would be my hit.

535
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,720
All right, kids, and remember, under his eye.

536
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:04,720
This is the future Margaret Ackwood didn't want but predicted.

537
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:12,720
I'm afraid of dystopia, but I did always want to be in the Disney parks, so finally.

538
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,720
Something magical about that place.

539
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:26,720
So let's talk what our expectations and predictions are for tomorrow's parks panel.

540
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,720
Like, do we think Tomorrowland redo is happening?

541
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,720
No, I heard no.

542
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,720
Do we think...

543
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,720
Does the applause mean yes or is it applause for no?

544
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,720
I'm having trouble reading it.

545
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,720
What are the rumors around the table?

546
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,720
I heard an interesting thing today at the Imagineering Pavilion.

547
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,720
I heard an Imagineer tersely telling another Imagineer that a third Imagineer was telling

548
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,720
everyone they were opening a Brazil Pavilion.

549
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,720
And the fact that they were angry made me think, oh, it's true.

550
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,720
So they kind of made the problem worse.

551
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,720
But anyway, so I don't think anyone's surprised by that, though.

552
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,720
But everyone's been speculating we're getting a Brazil Pavilion at Epcot.

553
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,720
And it seems like it's happening.

554
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,720
A lot of chatter online about the Brazil Pavilion.

555
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:31,720
What's the best week possible to be affiliated with the government of Brazil?

556
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:38,720
Will Bolsonaro and his weird smiles come to Epcot to cut the ribbon?

557
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,720
And will he light a fire of neighboring pavilions?

558
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:50,720
Sorry, Germany, we need room.

559
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,720
Well, those are the exact words that will come out of Bob Chapek's mouth tomorrow.

560
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,720
Before his ass is canned on Monday, you mean?

561
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,720
Yeah, yeah.

562
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,720
We should have gotten Chapek here.

563
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,720
Yeah.

564
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,720
I should have tried.

565
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,720
That's why you should have shot on Sunday.

566
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
Yeah, we should have.

567
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,720
We were dating that, but then like Comic-Con, people always like get out of town as soon as you can on Sunday.

568
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,720
So I don't know that.

569
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Is that the case for D23?

570
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,720
Are people hanging as any who has traveled to be in Anaheim today?

571
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
Yeah.

572
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,720
All right.

573
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,720
Wow.

574
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:32,720
Well, thank you for sacrificing some of your precious hours next to the happiest place on Earth.

575
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,720
To watch some guys and a girl talk about the happiest place on Earth.

576
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Talk about it.

577
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,720
But there is complimentary ice water.

578
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,720
So don't say we never gave you enough.

579
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,720
It can be hard to find in the parks a little bit.

580
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
It's there.

581
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
It's there.

582
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:57,720
I will say, and I'll say this is a sincere feeling, I hope we get some sort of Avengers coaster announcement.

583
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,720
The Marvel, yes.

584
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Single clap.

585
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,720
One clap.

586
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
Yeah.

587
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,720
Because I will be honest, I'm a little bit underwhelmed with the Avengers Academy.

588
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Campus.

589
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
Campus.

590
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
Avengers campus.

591
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,720
That's even less cool than what I said.

592
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Yeah, the Academy.

593
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,720
Yeah, you're right.

594
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
That sounds cool as shit.

595
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:28,720
We need you on the team as opposed to we need you like around near where our team is, but you can't come in.

596
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,720
You can buy sweaters related to the team.

597
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:41,720
Avengers assemble at the quad.

598
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,720
We've still got room in the improv group.

599
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
Lots of fun.

600
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,720
Great way to get to know people.

601
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,720
They have an atmosphere entertainment where they say the ice cream freezer is broken and they're giving out free ice cream bars.

602
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,720
And all the superheroes come out.

603
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
Oh.

604
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,720
Yeah, because they, you know, on a student budget.

605
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
Sure.

606
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
Free ice cream.

607
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
Yeah.

608
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
Yeah, yeah.

609
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,720
You try to say hi to them, they run away.

610
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
Of course.

611
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,720
Yeah, that's a weird one, isn't it?

612
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:19,720
And there's been the, there's the fear with the Marvel stuff that it's not going to be mind blowing, crazy great.

613
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Right.

614
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
I mean, like, I don't know.

615
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,720
Like nothing.

616
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
It doesn't.

617
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,720
I don't feel the sense of anticipation like there was for for Galaxy's Edge and and the campus thing sort of waters it down.

618
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
Isn't it one of the things is a micro brewery.

619
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,720
Isn't that right?

620
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,720
Yeah.

621
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,720
Like Ant Man, like Ant Man, like it's big can.

622
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
Wait, is that true?

623
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
Yeah, this is real.

624
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
This is real.

625
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
Yeah, it is.

626
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
That is really.

627
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,720
Yeah.

628
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
It sounds real.

629
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
It's awful.

630
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,720
I've learned this for the first time and that's my my reaction.

631
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,720
This is a reaction video.

632
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,720
I mean, you get you get a Spider-Man game ride and you get some cold brews.

633
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:11,720
I heard there was like a leak that said their initial goal in building it was to be able to re-theme it every eight years as necessary, which suggests that they aren't going to build anything very nice because you're going to tear it down.

634
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,720
They're always good at that.

635
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,720
That's really strict about the deposit.

636
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
Yeah.

637
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
Pierce the walls.

638
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,720
It's like, yeah, you can't hang anything.

639
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Yeah, they want the deposit back.

640
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,720
Any any ride where they're like, this is modular.

641
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
We're going to change it.

642
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
So never, never.

643
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,720
Very rarely.

644
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,720
Very rarely change it, but it'll look bad forever.

645
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
Yeah.

646
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
Yeah.

647
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,720
Just build it to be changed and then never actually do it.

648
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
What is that?

649
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,720
I mean, the Disney Play Pavilion.

650
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,720
They haven't really gone into more detail.

651
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,720
Oh, that's like an emoji and meet and greet pavilion.

652
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
Sure.

653
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,720
Which is very, you know, human now, unfortunately.

654
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,720
It makes sense as a pavilion.

655
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,720
Do they own the emoji movie now?

656
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
Who put that out?

657
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,720
No, they own Disney emojis.

658
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,720
I don't know about this.

659
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,720
Who's using Disney emojis?

660
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,720
Is that a made up thing?

661
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
I don't think so.

662
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,720
Okay.

663
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
Huh.

664
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,720
I don't think so.

665
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,720
I don't know what it's called, but I know that they try to do emojis of their characters.

666
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,720
I think you download an app and then message people within that app.

667
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
I don't know.

668
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,720
Yes, I'm saying nods.

669
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,720
I'm seeing nods.

670
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,720
Wait, so you don't use them as emojis?

671
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,720
You just look at art in the style of emojis.

672
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,720
What do you get from that?

673
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,720
Okay, it's both.

674
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,720
Do you love it?

675
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,720
How do you feel about it?

676
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,720
I'm going to.

677
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,720
All right.

678
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,720
Well, we'll do a full review.

679
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,720
We'll do a three hour episode on it eventually.

680
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
It counts.

681
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
It counts.

682
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,720
It came up here, so it counts.

683
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,720
Epcot split into neighborhoods, right?

684
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
That was getting around.

685
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,720
Epcot split into neighborhoods.

686
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
That changes everything.

687
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,720
Like what?

688
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,720
What does that mean?

689
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,720
It's because they wanted a Moana Pavilion, which would have to be based around water,

690
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,720
but they didn't want to completely demolish the living seas.

691
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,720
So if it's a water neighborhood, I'm guessing.

692
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,720
But doesn't that make sense?

693
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
That's a good guess.

694
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,720
Then they're like, that's why we have two redundant pavilions.

695
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
It's not because we didn't plan it ahead.

696
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,720
It's because it's a neighborhood of water.

697
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:30,720
They're going to do that with Disneyland now and say we have two Star Wars neighborhoods.

698
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:39,720
And they're both failures, according to what I've read.

699
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,720
These will be burnt to the ground as soon as they can.

700
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,720
Transformed into Pocahontas lands.

701
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,720
Like one of these rumors lately.

702
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,720
Why is everybody so like there?

703
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Do you guys feel how this there's just been this this turn of a corner where suddenly like it was like in Galaxy's Edge.

704
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:05,720
We're having fun to like the most miserable failure that has ever surprised Trump has tweeted about it.

705
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,720
Sloppy Doc Ondar is not selling anything.

706
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,720
Sloppy Doc Ondar.

707
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,720
Sloppy Graydon Carter is spotted at Galaxy's Edge.

708
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,720
It's coming, honestly.

709
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
It's going to happen.

710
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
Well, here, let me just let's go down the line.

711
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,720
What is everyone's dream for announcement tomorrow for blue sky, which we do often on this show?

712
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
What do you want?

713
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:43,720
I mean, I'll go for I said Marvel eat ticket coaster redo of Tomorrowland, cutting edge, futuristic, fifth gate Disney World Villains Park.

714
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,720
That's that's my dream.

715
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
That's what I want.

716
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,720
I'm not going to get too greedy.

717
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,720
I'll just pick three things.

718
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,720
And then I'll go over to Scott.

719
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Scott, what would you want the most?

720
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,720
Just make Tomorrowland exactly as it was in 1987.

721
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,720
Yeah.

722
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:08,720
Why do we change it if we're just going to like clutter it up with trash and unused ride tracks?

723
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,720
And I like, oh, boy, just you close the whole thing.

724
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,720
You want to be able to touch the wall on the people mover?

725
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

726
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
Yes, it should be dangerous.

727
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,720
We haven't covered it yet, but isn't that that is the ride with the most deaths, I think.

728
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,720
Yeah, I think it's like three lives or something.

729
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
Geez.

730
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,720
Yeah, that's not phrase it that way.

731
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,720
Does that sound too deliberate?

732
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,720
It's taken live.

733
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,720
Oh, yeah, like it was premeditated.

734
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,720
Yeah.

735
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,720
Walt envisioned a new form of public transit.

736
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:50,720
Some called it the most dangerous form of public transit.

737
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
One that takes out people too dumb to know how to use it.

738
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,720
That's the price we pay.

739
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,720
Yeah.

740
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Yeah.

741
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,720
It must be done.

742
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
Jason, thoughts?

743
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,720
You know, I really want some X-Men stuff, but I think we got to wait for like Jacob Tremblay

744
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,720
and like two of the Stranger Things kids to get older.

745
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,720
I guess I guess that's what I have to wait on now.

746
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,720
X-Men comics been doing pretty good the last couple of months.

747
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
But yeah, all right.

748
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,720
Yeah, House of Becks.

749
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,720
Yeah, we got to get those movies in shape, I guess, before we get an Xavier's Mansion ride.

750
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
Yeah.

751
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,720
All right.

752
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:31,720
Do we now with the Spider-Man kerfuffle of recent, is it now, does Tom Holland not get

753
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,720
to appear in this potentially disappointing ride now?

754
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,720
I assume he's shot something for it already.

755
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,720
I could be wrong about that.

756
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,720
But now they got to digitally track a mustache so you can't tell it's him.

757
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,720
They want to put, they're going to put Henry Cavill's mustache on Tom Holland to obscure

758
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,720
his face.

759
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Yes.

760
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
I mean, they built it to be modular so they don't even need him.

761
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,720
They actually were really smart and right for doing that, it turns out.

762
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
Yeah, I guess so.

763
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,720
They can just make it not Spider-Man and everyone will be like, you can re-theme the queue that

764
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,720
fast and they'll go, theme the queue?

765
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,720
No, we've got barrels.

766
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,720
And that's what the queue's for.

767
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
We've got barrels and pipes.

768
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,720
We've got gray walls.

769
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,720
You know what they have in superhero headquarters?

770
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,720
Gray walls.

771
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
Sure.

772
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,720
I have a pitch.

773
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,720
Retheme it to Happy Hogan.

774
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
Oh, yeah.

775
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,720
The Jon Favreau character.

776
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
Oh.

777
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,720
And let's just go on one of his adventures.

778
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
Sure.

779
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,720
Mr. Mandalorian.

780
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,720
It's Johnny Favs.

781
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,720
In Marvel continuity, did Happy Hogan direct the Mandalorian?

782
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,720
Well, he had to do something, right?

783
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,720
Does the Mandalorian exist like...

784
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,720
Yes, because Star Wars exists in the Marvel, the MCU because Spider-Man references it.

785
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
So, yes, for sure.

786
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
So, Happy could have gotten that directing gig.

787
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,720
That's true.

788
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,720
And Marvel exists in the Muppet Babies universe because they like dance around with Spider-Man

789
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
and stuff.

790
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,720
And Star Wars also exists in the Muppet Babies universe as well.

791
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,720
Oh, yeah, a lot of Star Wars.

792
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,720
They open the doors.

793
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,720
You've seen it.

794
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,720
Yeah.

795
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
Yeah.

796
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,720
So, does that mean that Werner Herzog exists in the MCU?

797
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,720
So, that means Grizzly Bear happened and...

798
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,720
Grizzly Man.

799
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
Grizzly Man.

800
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,720
Yeah.

801
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,720
The band Grizzly Bear also happened in the...

802
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Grizzly Bear happened.

803
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
Yeah.

804
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,720
Half of them blipped, but the other half didn't.

805
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
They had that...

806
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,720
Yes, yes.

807
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,720
Right?

808
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,720
Yeah, yeah.

809
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,720
Jenny.

810
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Okay, I have three.

811
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
All right, go for it.

812
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,720
The first one is I want them to restore Journey into Imagination to being good.

813
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,720
Yeah.

814
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,720
But, okay, I have specific dreams about how they'll announce it.

815
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,720
So, I know they have this upbeat energy when they come out onto the stage at D23, but I

816
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,720
want them to come out and still be really peppy, but also be like, we've made a huge

817
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,720
mistake.

818
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,720
But it's like, matter of fact, they bring someone out like, hey, you're the guy that

819
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,720
made the decision.

820
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,720
Do you want to talk about what a mistake you made when you took it out the first time?

821
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,720
And he's like, yeah, man, I made a mistake.

822
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,720
And everyone's cheering.

823
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,720
And we get t-shirts at the end that's a picture of Figment and the quote, like, we made a

824
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,720
mistake.

825
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,720
And Figment's going...

826
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,720
Yeah, all is forgiven now.

827
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,720
But it takes imagination to make mistakes, too.

828
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,720
Yeah, exactly.

829
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,720
Imagination doesn't always give you good ideas.

830
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,720
It's really hard.

831
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,720
Yeah.

832
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,720
So, it has the ideas to become a skunk unpleasantly for 20 years.

833
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,720
Become like a Bart Simpson-esque bad boy.

834
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,720
Yeah.

835
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,720
We love that.

836
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,720
Yeah.

837
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,720
He's such a rascal, that new Figment.

838
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,720
Let's make Figment nice again.

839
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,720
Make Figment nice again.

840
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,720
Exactly.

841
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,720
Absolutely.

842
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,720
And like, there are no hard feelings in imagination.

843
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,720
So, they can buy out Dr. Nigel Channing.

844
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,720
We can give him a Severance package, you know.

845
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,720
This is actually dialogue from the ride.

846
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720
Yeah.

847
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,720
Yeah.

848
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,720
The pre-show is just him sighing separation.

849
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,720
Yeah.

850
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,720
The ride is actually about explaining how the last one wasn't very good.

851
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,720
Yeah.

852
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:10,720
And then you go through a door and it's like, oh, hello, I'm the new head of the Imagination

853
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,720
Institute.

854
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,720
It's the Dream Finder.

855
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,720
He's back.

856
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,720
Wait.

857
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,720
Yay.

858
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,720
Who are we going to cast as him?

859
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,720
You know it's going to be a screen again.

860
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,720
Yeah, probably.

861
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,720
Possibly.

862
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,720
Yeah, I don't know if we're getting new bots.

863
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,720
Maybe we'll just get Patrick Harris again.

864
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,720
They always do that.

865
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,720
Yeah.

866
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,720
I'm in doubt.

867
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,720
Do you have a casting choice for who would appear as Dream Finder on the ride, if you

868
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,720
could pick anyone in the world?

869
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,720
Gosh.

870
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,720
Who's that guy that's the sheriff on Stranger Things?

871
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,720
David.

872
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,720
David Harbour.

873
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,720
David Harbour.

874
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,720
Yeah.

875
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
David Harbour.

876
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,720
Stranger Things, very hot right now.

877
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,720
Yeah.

878
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,720
But like, it's ending, so also he'll take the job.

879
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,720
Yeah.

880
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,720
Yeah.

881
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,720
Is it ending?

882
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,720
It feels like it would.

883
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
I think there's three more seasons.

884
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,720
Okay, good.

885
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,720
Good.

886
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,720
Hey, anything's better than Gad.

887
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,720
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

888
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,720
Poor Gad.

889
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,720
He is at Pizza Pr- I'm sorry, he's probably in the district right now.

890
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,720
Wait, what about Bobby Moynihan?

891
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Sure.

892
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,720
Oh yeah, Bobby.

893
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,720
Sure.

894
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,720
Bobby Moynihan.

895
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,720
Yeah.

896
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,720
That's not a bad- yeah, yeah.

897
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,720
Is he a Perks fan?

898
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,720
He is.

899
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,720
He's in DuckTales too, so they have him like, you know, in their speed dial.

900
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,720
He's in the Cavalcades.

901
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,720
Yeah.

902
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,720
And they go up and down Main Street.

903
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,720
He's in the rainy day Cavalcades.

904
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,720
Oh yes.

905
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,720
In a poncho.

906
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,720
Every time.

907
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,720
Wait, did somebody saw him?

908
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
Somebody saw him?

909
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,720
Yeah.

910
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,720
Wow.

911
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,720
Oh jeez.

912
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,720
Was he in the Cavalcade?

913
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Is there weight- nice.

914
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,720
Yeah, cool.

915
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:39,120
Wow, so now we know he's a Disney fan and he's cool.

916
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,960
Unless he left without buying sunglasses.

917
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,960
And we'll never know.

918
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,960
Other dreams, Jenny.

919
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,960
Yeah, Jenny.

920
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,880
My next dream is, it's a little controversial.

921
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,800
Obviously I would like them to do something with the People Mover track, but I've heard

922
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,760
that they literally can't because it's falling apart.

923
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:06,720
So in that case, I'd like them to just take it out and rebuild an identical track.

924
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,000
And the third is like that fuzzy elephant creature that's like, I guess not a Bantha,

925
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,960
but the thing they told me I could ride on the back of in Star Wars Land.

926
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,960
Yeah.

927
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
Oh yeah.

928
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,760
And then all the like press about how it's a failure made them so insecure that they'll

929
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,760
build a giant hairy elephant animatronic to walk around.

930
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,760
I wonder.

931
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,760
I really wonder.

932
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,760
Yeah.

933
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,760
Did everybody see the leaked concept art of what that Bantha ride was going to be?

934
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,760
It was beautiful.

935
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,760
Wasn't it supposed to be a Bantha?

936
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,760
Because it was very large.

937
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,760
Or it was Bantha-like.

938
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,400
It was derivative of a Bantha.

939
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,160
Just like Batuu is derivative of every- Tatooine.

940
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,160
All the other places.

941
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,160
Yeah.

942
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,160
Yeah.

943
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,160
Yeah.

944
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,820
There was like, it was just, they have made a technology, in case you haven't seen it,

945
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,900
the technology was basically like, you would move around like a people mover, but then

946
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,580
the bench would move up and down like you were like on the back of an animal.

947
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,700
Wait, you weren't sitting on the- Oh.

948
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,980
You weren't riding it like Pete riding the dragon.

949
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,340
You're like, you're on a weird- Is there a kind-

950
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,340
Is it like flight of passage?

951
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,340
No, like- No, it's sideways.

952
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,340
But a slow Bantha.

953
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:14,260
Like Prince Ali, doesn't he sit in like a basket thing in the Prince Ali sequence?

954
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,260
There you go.

955
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,900
I want an animatronic elephant with a capacity of like four people at a time.

956
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,900
Yes.

957
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,620
I want it to wait 14 hours in line.

958
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,860
And then take 10 minutes to load.

959
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,860
And then get on this elephant.

960
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:30,980
And then it takes you in a very slow circle.

961
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:36,420
And if it like e-stops, they have to wheel out a tall ladder.

962
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,740
And like rocket rods, it cannot deal with corners or curves at all.

963
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,740
Yeah.

964
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,940
And anytime there's like anything over a 4.0 earthquake, they're like, even though there's

965
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,220
nothing wrong with the ride, we do have to stop it.

966
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,220
It's regulation.

967
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,140
You're like, can I just slide down?

968
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,780
No, the ladder is on its way.

969
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,580
Some bolts were shaken loose by the quake.

970
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,580
But it's coming.

971
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:04,540
Well, I'm afraid that none of the things we just said will come true tomorrow.

972
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,540
No.

973
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,540
Yeah.

974
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,540
Yeah.

975
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,060
Which is, you know, why it's important.

976
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,560
We can't control any of that.

977
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,140
We can't control what they're doing down the street.

978
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,420
The big fancy Anaheim Convention Center.

979
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,020
But we have our own party going on right here.

980
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:25,740
And you know, and if we think they might be disappointing us with some of that news tomorrow,

981
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:31,260
then we need to make sure that you all leave with some of the opposite of disappointing

982
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,260
news.

983
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:38,660
We got to make this more than just a live version of the kind of show we do normally.

984
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:42,340
It's time to tell you now that it is more than that.

985
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,700
This isn't just our live show.

986
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:56,660
This is PTR 23, the ultimate.

987
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,020
The ultimate podcast, the ride fan event.

988
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,020
That was some applause.

989
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,980
I bet they could hear that down at the convention center.

990
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,980
Yeah.

991
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:07,980
Let's show them.

992
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,060
That's right.

993
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,580
Right here, right now.

994
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:15,500
This is the only place that you can hear exclusive announcements about the future of podcast

995
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,780
the ride until this episode is public in six days.

996
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:26,140
But until then, we have we've gathered all of the magic of Mike, Jason and Scott under

997
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,620
one roof.

998
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:32,180
Thank you all are the beneficiaries of it.

999
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,660
So so so officially welcome to PTR 23.

1000
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:38,660
So so that you could make it.

1001
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,260
We've got everything D23 has.

1002
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,340
There's cosplayers.

1003
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,700
Keep an eye out for the man dressed as the khaki colored cargo shorts.

1004
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:57,340
Every imagineer is required to own at least five pairs of or or the woman in a mashup

1005
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:01,260
costume that's half Mary Poppins and half Zinia Moocha.

1006
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,380
Bob Iger's fixer.

1007
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,860
Longtime Disney heavy.

1008
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:15,740
We should say also the listener at home can't see this, but clearly the memo got out about

1009
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:21,460
it being PTR 23 because we're looking at an absolute sea of Mike, Scott and Jason cosplay.

1010
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,460
Like, can you believe it?

1011
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,940
We haven't addressed this yet.

1012
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,940
Yeah.

1013
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,820
Like 95 percent of people.

1014
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,420
I wish the list to see this.

1015
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,420
Look at this.

1016
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,420
Look at gray shorts.

1017
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,420
Yeah.

1018
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,420
Yeah.

1019
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,420
That's yeah.

1020
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,420
Yeah.

1021
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,220
That's a Mike for sure.

1022
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:42,220
It covers the entire range of what we all wear from casual to business casual.

1023
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:50,740
But we we we now here, you know, we can't and we don't get to announce, you know, new

1024
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,060
Marvels or new Star Wars that are coming out.

1025
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,940
But we can we can officially say that, you know, all the rumors and all the speculation

1026
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:01,660
topics that you guys have been waiting for, pleading for, it's all coming.

1027
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:06,820
We got a big 2019 left, a big 2020 left.

1028
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,540
The M&M store movie in Las Vegas is coming.

1029
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,540
That episode is coming.

1030
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,540
Yeah.

1031
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,540
Yeah.

1032
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,540
Hell yeah.

1033
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,540
We just Lindsey and I just did it.

1034
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,540
Yeah.

1035
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,540
Yeah.

1036
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,540
So now we can cover it.

1037
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:26,540
I will give it a little bit of a hint about what I'll be saying on the episode, actually.

1038
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,540
The place smells like shit.

1039
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:34,540
Horrible, putrid.

1040
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,540
It's supposed to smell like chocolate.

1041
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,540
It smells.

1042
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,260
Oh, I wanted to.

1043
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,260
You wanted to throw up the whole time.

1044
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,700
Anyway, that's just a preview.

1045
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:47,700
You were begging for some candy piss to take your mind off it.

1046
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,620
I was just up the strip.

1047
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,980
You're a mere blocks away.

1048
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,180
The Schomburg Mall is coming.

1049
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,180
Schomburg Mall.

1050
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:01,460
Yes, we'll be done.

1051
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:06,260
We will learn about that specific Warner Brothers studio store as opposed to the others and

1052
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:10,620
then still separately do a Warner Brothers studio store episode.

1053
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,620
I can't believe people listen to this podcast sometimes.

1054
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,620
Yeah.

1055
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:21,620
Thunder in Paradise is coming.

1056
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:29,460
In case you don't know what that is, the Hulk Hogan syndicated TV show that was shot at

1057
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,460
the Grand Floridian in Florida.

1058
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:36,180
I think it was sort of a tax scam kind of a thing.

1059
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,100
Yeah.

1060
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,100
There was a talking boat too, I think.

1061
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,100
It transformed.

1062
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,100
It transformed at least.

1063
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,100
I don't know if it talked.

1064
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,100
There was just like a lot of room in the boat.

1065
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,540
It was a very deep boat.

1066
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,780
It was like Nightboat though from The Simpsons.

1067
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1068
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,780
Fairly close to that.

1069
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:51,780
Anyway, yeah.

1070
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,780
You're going to learn all about it.

1071
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:57,740
Hey, this year, you know, down at D283 there was a Simpsons panel because Disney bought

1072
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,580
The Simpsons this year.

1073
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:05,860
Well, not to be outdone, we bought a DVD of Father of the Pride.

1074
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,540
Yeah.

1075
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:14,380
One season animated show about Siegfried and Roy's lions or whatever.

1076
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:19,260
We will endure all of the episodes of this so you don't have to.

1077
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,820
Feel free to do it too.

1078
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,820
But it's your funeral.

1079
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:29,140
Jason, were you heading to something?

1080
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,140
You don't have to.

1081
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,140
Well, no, I think we're all.

1082
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,140
I can say something.

1083
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,140
Mike had something.

1084
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,140
Oh, yeah, sure.

1085
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,940
We're at PTR 23.

1086
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:41,940
We don't have like a ton of exclusive merch, but I do have one very highly sought after

1087
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:42,940
item.

1088
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:48,860
Now, I am going to give this item out to someone, but they must have an annual pass and are

1089
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:51,660
planning to go right back to the park after this.

1090
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,660
Who is that?

1091
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:54,940
Raise your hand if you're planning on doing this.

1092
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,440
Uh oh.

1093
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,740
Do we also need to give the caveat that it can only be for one person?

1094
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:03,100
Well, they don't know what it is yet, but it is for one person.

1095
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,900
So in a couple scenario, there may need to be a sacrifice.

1096
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,860
OK, so somebody asked, should I pick or should we make Jason, you pick?

1097
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:11,860
Oh, I don't want to.

1098
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,860
You should ask them a trivia question about your own show.

1099
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:20,740
Well, I was going to ask who came the farthest and has a pass.

1100
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:21,740
What's that?

1101
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:22,740
You're from Brazil?

1102
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,740
You're from Brazil?

1103
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,740
I mean, I'm from Brazil.

1104
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:27,740
He moved here.

1105
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:30,740
He moved here from Brazil.

1106
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:31,740
Well played.

1107
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,380
Well played.

1108
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:34,380
I do admire.

1109
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,380
Who else?

1110
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,220
Someone's being pointed to.

1111
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:41,060
You came here for this or for all the stuff in general?

1112
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,780
Huh, North, oh my god.

1113
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,780
Well, thanks for coming.

1114
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,780
Wow.

1115
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:45,780
Wait.

1116
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,780
Oh, Atlanta's pretty good.

1117
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,780
Who can beat Atlanta?

1118
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,620
Oh, Jersey?

1119
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,420
Is that farther than Atlanta?

1120
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,420
It's north.

1121
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,540
Oh no, we got to get a map out.

1122
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,420
We have to do calculations.

1123
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,500
I think New Jersey is farther.

1124
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,500
Florida.

1125
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,500
Oh my god.

1126
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,500
This is crazy, by the way.

1127
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,500
So, you're all going back to the park.

1128
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,500
All right.

1129
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:16,980
We're going to, I wish this was not such an exclusive item, but I have to, we have, who

1130
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,980
was Jersey?

1131
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,740
Maybe it's Jersey.

1132
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,220
You're going back to the park.

1133
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,220
Okay, that's important.

1134
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,220
Tonight.

1135
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,220
It has to be tonight.

1136
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,220
He's going back tonight.

1137
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,220
Sorry, tonight.

1138
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,220
Atlanta's going back, I think it might have to be you, sir.

1139
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,020
I think it has to be us.

1140
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,020
I'm making an executive decision.

1141
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,020
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1142
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,020
Because we could do this all night.

1143
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,020
Yes, I know.

1144
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:36,020
Yes, just for your time.

1145
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,420
You are, you swear you're going back into the park right after this.

1146
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,420
Okay.

1147
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,420
Okay.

1148
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:47,940
The exclusive item is that I have been checking and getting Fast Passes.

1149
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,540
And I will be checking, it's only going to be a few.

1150
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:56,660
I'm going to check right now and I will email you pictures of the Fast Passes.

1151
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:01,940
If you email podcasttheride at Gmail right now, I will send you those Fast Passes.

1152
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:07,500
We will check right now as long as my phone loads, which it might not.

1153
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:13,420
But I will find another Fast Pass and you have the most exclusive item from PTR 23.

1154
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:16,740
The benefit of my checking.

1155
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,500
A hand checked.

1156
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,100
Hand checked by Mike Carlson.

1157
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,140
And of course it's not loading.

1158
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,140
So I'm going to try to get in the Wi-Fi.

1159
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,140
Anyway, that will come.

1160
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,140
Just email us.

1161
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,140
Anyway.

1162
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:33,540
But that all has to happen between, now we have to keep doing the show that has to be

1163
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,980
passed to him and then you're going to get into the park before 11 and it has to be a

1164
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,860
Fast 4 Disneyland proper.

1165
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:39,860
Corral of that?

1166
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,860
Yes, all of that.

1167
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:41,860
I can do that.

1168
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,860
Oh yeah.

1169
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,860
Yeah, yeah.

1170
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,860
I'm a professional checker.

1171
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:45,860
I'm just saying the stakes.

1172
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,860
The stakes are high.

1173
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,860
Jason hotspot me real quick.

1174
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:50,860
Okay.

1175
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:55,540
Why don't you take my phone and I'll segue us into the next segment.

1176
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,540
Great.

1177
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,540
Okay.

1178
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:04,220
Like D23, we want to celebrate our own legends, our own PTR legends.

1179
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:05,220
Yes.

1180
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,220
Here is my hotspot.

1181
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,220
They do.

1182
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,220
Absolutely.

1183
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:11,220
Oh, I should have helped with that.

1184
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,220
I'm sorry.

1185
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,220
That's all right.

1186
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,220
That was very rude of me.

1187
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,220
Yes.

1188
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:18,860
You know, one big thing they do at D23 every year, they induct Disney legends.

1189
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:23,900
This year among the honorees, Christina Aguilera, John Favreau, Robert Downey Jr., Bette Miller,

1190
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,340
Hans Zimmer, a great lineup.

1191
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:34,740
But we feel pretty proud of our lineup, the first ever inductees into the PTR Legends

1192
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,740
Hall of Fame.

1193
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,340
And Mike, do you want to kick us off?

1194
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:39,340
Oh, wait, wait.

1195
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,340
Oh, you know what?

1196
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:41,340
Here.

1197
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:47,460
Because it's the first slide before all of that stuff, you'll see it.

1198
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,540
Let me, you know what?

1199
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,660
I'll declare, he's a PTR legend.

1200
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,220
He's the first one.

1201
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,980
The person you're going to see right now.

1202
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:57,620
This is an exclusive announcement you won't see anywhere else.

1203
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:04,300
There's a series, a crucial series within our show, within podcast The Ride, that is

1204
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,140
about to embark upon its next installment.

1205
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,500
I'm here to tell you about it.

1206
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,500
Well, it might not be what you think, but there's more stuff coming.

1207
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,500
Hang on.

1208
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:18,300
But, ladies and gentlemen, pre-taped via satellite, Griffin Newman.

1209
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:22,700
Yo, what's up PTR 23?

1210
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,900
This is your boy, Griffin Newman.

1211
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,260
So sad to be missing a PTR 23.

1212
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,340
I never, ever miss one.

1213
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:34,620
Especially not those sweet PTR 23 parties.

1214
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:37,900
Anyway, I am here to give you an exclusive announcement.

1215
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:38,980
Here's my scoop.

1216
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:45,940
I will officially be reprising my role as Griffin Newman in the podcast The Ride 3D

1217
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,740
theme park movie trilogy.

1218
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:48,740
So amped.

1219
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:54,780
A deal got caught up and so are negotiations for a little bit, but I really think we're

1220
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:59,180
going to give the fans what they want, give this series back to the fans, take this franchise

1221
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,500
to new heights.

1222
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:06,860
And I'm amped, so look for that dropping sometime around quarter three 219.

1223
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:09,860
Please and don't have too much fun without me.

1224
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:16,740
We want Griffin.

1225
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:17,740
Yeah, it's been tough.

1226
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:20,540
It's been tough negotiations.

1227
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:26,260
He's been after a second glass of water while we record because our episodes tend to go

1228
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,260
long.

1229
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:31,060
But yes, Griffin Newman will be joining us doing another 3D movie in the near future.

1230
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:34,780
Which one of the two that are left will he do?

1231
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,860
It's up to you to guess.

1232
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:40,740
OK, so Griffin Newman, the first PTR legend.

1233
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:41,740
I'm declaring it.

1234
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:44,580
To thank you, Griffin.

1235
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:50,100
Due to slideshow order, you by default are a PTR legend.

1236
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:56,380
And coming up next is somebody who we're very fond of and we care about very much.

1237
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:58,300
Michael, ladies and gentlemen.

1238
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:01,700
The audience has seen him.

1239
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:06,100
Mike, would you like to say a few words?

1240
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,340
Yes, Papa Steve will not be here tonight.

1241
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:13,460
Although, we really didn't even try to get him.

1242
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,900
Isn't he?

1243
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,300
Is he deceased?

1244
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,420
I don't know.

1245
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,420
I think he may be.

1246
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,500
Does anyone know that?

1247
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,500
We're not sure.

1248
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,500
I don't know.

1249
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:26,620
Well, at the very least, we do know they kept a little piece of him as the starter for the

1250
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:27,620
next Papa Steve.

1251
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:36,940
The Papa dough?

1252
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:37,940
Not the mother?

1253
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:38,940
Not the mother dough.

1254
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:39,940
The Papa dough.

1255
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,940
That's how you make a Papa Steve.

1256
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:46,380
I'll quickly accept on Steve's behalf.

1257
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:52,580
I have been enjoying this kindly old man's photo for over many years here and primarily

1258
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:58,220
because every time I have been going to California Adventure with Jason, I take a photo of Jason.

1259
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:00,980
Jason with Papa Steve.

1260
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:06,260
I'm realizing now it would have been great to put it in the slideshow.

1261
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:09,460
That would have been great, but it's been a busy week for me.

1262
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:14,140
I just want to say thank you on behalf of Papa Steve.

1263
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:18,540
Let's hope that even if they tear down that bread tour, they leave that up as a tribute

1264
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:25,620
no matter what they build.

1265
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:34,980
If Marvel takes over and it's the Raft, the Marvel jail, and as long as they have a picture

1266
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:41,340
of Papa Steve up in there, I think I'm going to be happy and we'll all be happy.

1267
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:48,900
Now not all of the PTR legends are from just one poster in California Adventure, but a

1268
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,740
lot of them are.

1269
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:56,820
For example, there's this one poster when you leave this one bathroom in the Hollywood

1270
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:57,820
area.

1271
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:02,500
I don't know if people know this offhand, but please keep an eye out for it the next

1272
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,500
time you're in the park.

1273
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,220
Wait, hang on one second.

1274
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:14,460
I just want to say all of us up here, we're all multi-hyphenates.

1275
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:18,060
We want to be podcasters, but we also want to be writers, directors, actors, everything

1276
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,340
we can be.

1277
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:23,700
It's nice that there's one guy who lets you know that America's favorite leading man can

1278
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,100
be Hollywood's biggest star.

1279
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:37,060
And so Mike, please let's officially give the trophy to this unnamed guy.

1280
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:46,580
Unnamed gable-ish man on the cover of movie news magazine outside a bathroom not too far

1281
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,580
from here.

1282
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,340
Jenny, have you noticed this before?

1283
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,020
Do you know what we're talking about?

1284
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,020
Has anyone noticed this before?

1285
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,020
He looks very familiar to me.

1286
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,540
Is he next to off the page?

1287
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:55,540
It's very near off the page.

1288
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:56,540
Yes.

1289
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:57,540
Yeah, yeah.

1290
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,540
It's that little bathroom plaza.

1291
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,540
I know it well.

1292
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,540
Okay, very good.

1293
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:05,220
Yeah, well, then I'm so glad we could honor him here tonight.

1294
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,220
Our next inductee.

1295
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,220
Sure.

1296
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:10,700
This is my pick, and I think it will become immediately clear why.

1297
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:16,220
It's a real Cinderella story, new on the scene, but with its peppermint ice cream,

1298
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:20,580
Cajeta filled churros, chocolate brownie crumbles, chocolate sauce and whipped cream.

1299
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:25,280
It proved that not less is more, but more is more.

1300
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:34,060
It's the holiday churro sundae that I ran off a nighttime Mark Twain voyage to get.

1301
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:37,980
Just as the golden horseshoe was closing for the night.

1302
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:38,980
Perfect.

1303
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:39,980
There it is.

1304
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:40,980
There it is.

1305
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:41,980
Wow.

1306
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,980
Wonderful.

1307
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:47,300
I was waiting for the name of it.

1308
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,260
Holiday churro sundae is as good as you're going to get.

1309
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,260
All right.

1310
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,260
Fair enough.

1311
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,980
All right.

1312
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:56,860
Not all inductees require a big old speech.

1313
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,580
Some explain themselves.

1314
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,700
That's true of our next honoree.

1315
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,780
Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Duck's thick ass.

1316
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:04,780
Yeah.

1317
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:05,780
Wait a minute.

1318
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,780
Hold on.

1319
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:07,780
Hold on.

1320
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:08,780
Wait, what was that?

1321
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:09,780
What?

1322
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,780
Where did that come from?

1323
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:20,660
In the audience listening at home, I was just trying to bring up a slide of Donald Duck's

1324
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:27,820
thick ass and then there was almost like a subliminal cut to something else.

1325
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:28,820
To a different slide.

1326
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,300
This was supposed to be the last slide.

1327
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,300
I know.

1328
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,860
We agreed more than four would be crazy.

1329
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:36,700
Guys, care to explain?

1330
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,700
I didn't.

1331
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,300
No, I did my fucking ice cream bullshit.

1332
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,300
I'm done.

1333
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:41,940
I just was going to do Papa Steve.

1334
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:42,940
I don't know.

1335
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:47,700
It's like maybe my, I don't want to say it, but maybe my computer is possessed?

1336
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:48,700
Hit it again.

1337
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:49,700
What's happening?

1338
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,300
Hit it because we should go to the next segment slide.

1339
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,300
Whoa!

1340
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,300
No!

1341
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,300
No!

1342
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,300
Chuck-O!

1343
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,300
Oh my God, it's Chuck-O the Clown.

1344
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,420
It's Chuck-O the Clown.

1345
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:02,100
Who came up in one episode.

1346
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,100
Why?

1347
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,100
Did he work at Disneyland?

1348
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,100
No.

1349
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,100
What was this again?

1350
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,100
He had a restaurant.

1351
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:12,820
He had a menu that, this is a menu you could get at the Disneyland Hotel like 50 years

1352
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:18,460
ago and he was a local Los Angeles clown and he had a song that was like, I'm Chuck-O,

1353
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:21,260
I'm Chuck-O, I'm Chuck-O the Birthday Clown.

1354
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,260
Stop this song.

1355
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,260
Stop this song.

1356
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:27,140
He had a ring and I guess for whatever reason his spirit has infiltrated my computer and

1357
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,380
now he's insisting that he's a podcast to write legends.

1358
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,860
No, he is not.

1359
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:32,820
No legend, are you Chuck-O?

1360
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:40,060
I guess since he's here, we should induct Chuck-O into the Hall of Fame of the Legends.

1361
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:44,260
I feel Chuck-O here with us, honestly.

1362
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:50,180
I feel Chuck-O as well, accepting on behalf of Chuck-O our very own Scott Gierdner.

1363
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:51,180
What the fuck?

1364
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,180
No, of course.

1365
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,180
No, absolutely not.

1366
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:57,820
As we all know, clown law dictates.

1367
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:00,740
Huh?

1368
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:05,500
Clown law dictates that in order to accept for a clown, one must become a clown.

1369
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:15,700
No, no, no, no, no, stop it, I'm going to the pool, no, no, there's a wig on me, it's

1370
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,700
over my eyes.

1371
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:20,140
And now this, I'm going to need some help on, that goes on your nosey.

1372
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:23,100
I'm not going to help you, that's for damn sure.

1373
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,100
Forget that.

1374
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,100
No.

1375
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,460
Alright, accepting.

1376
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:33,140
I can't forcibly glue it onto my nose than perhaps, but until then, no Chuck-O am I.

1377
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:34,980
Alright, Scott, you're freaking out.

1378
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:38,660
Here, take this glass, take this glass, calm down, calm down.

1379
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:45,420
Let's have a glass of wine, let's have a glass of your beloved wine, yeah, push the wig back.

1380
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,420
Oh, thank you so much.

1381
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,420
Push the wig back.

1382
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:49,220
Wait a minute, can I trust this?

1383
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:51,420
Oh yes, just some real wine, oh no!

1384
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,420
What?

1385
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:53,420
Oh no, it's bib juice!

1386
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:56,900
It's Chuck-O's favorite drink, bib juice!

1387
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:57,900
The wine!

1388
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:58,900
Oh no, you're going to have to drink it.

1389
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:02,700
Oh no, bib juice!

1390
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:03,700
Which we...

1391
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,940
I don't approve of the chant that's forming.

1392
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,540
Not one bit.

1393
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:12,140
I am the host of the show and I decide what gets chanted and what doesn't.

1394
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:18,460
Let me make one thing very clear, if no other hosts have said that, we control the chants.

1395
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:21,900
I don't want this anywhere near, there's hairs in it.

1396
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:22,900
That's actually true.

1397
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,180
Why are there hairs in it?

1398
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,900
That I couldn't tell you.

1399
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:27,900
Hmm.

1400
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:30,020
Okay, okay.

1401
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,940
You have to induct him.

1402
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,740
So you're saying this all ends.

1403
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:36,580
Scotto inducts Chuck-O.

1404
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,460
Scotto induct Chuck-O.

1405
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:42,940
Is this over and this thing will un-graft itself from my head?

1406
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:45,620
I believe that is the prophecy.

1407
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:47,740
That's how the prophecy works.

1408
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,980
If I take one sip of bib juice.

1409
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:50,980
Okay.

1410
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:51,980
Oh, oh.

1411
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:52,980
All right.

1412
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,780
I'm Chuck-O!

1413
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:55,780
Yeah!

1414
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:56,780
Hey, folks!

1415
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:00,980
I'm proud to be a member of the BT...

1416
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:03,500
No, no, no, no, you get out of here.

1417
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,860
No, I will stay in here.

1418
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,860
No, no, no, you get out.

1419
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:08,860
Okay, okay.

1420
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:10,620
I'm regaining control.

1421
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:11,620
All right.

1422
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:12,620
Okay.

1423
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:16,820
We got a brief second of Chuck-O and that was enough to get officially inducted as a

1424
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:17,820
BTR legend.

1425
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:18,820
Thanks, everybody!

1426
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:19,820
Oh my gosh.

1427
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:23,660
Oh my gosh.

1428
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:24,660
Jesus.

1429
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:27,660
Get it off.

1430
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:29,620
Get it off.

1431
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,140
That was...

1432
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:33,460
I'm so relieved to be Scot again.

1433
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:36,380
$18 at a Burbank costume shop.

1434
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,740
It was all worth it.

1435
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:40,340
Okay.

1436
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:48,740
The next time I am by of a warm colored liquid, I hope that it is wine and not the terrible

1437
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:49,980
sweat of a clown.

1438
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,940
That's what I assume bib juice is.

1439
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,340
I don't want to break the fourth wall.

1440
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,540
Jason, was that actually bib juice or is that just like Tropicana?

1441
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:58,020
That was exactly Tropicana.

1442
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:59,020
Wow.

1443
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:02,340
It would have been better if it was Donald Duck orange juice.

1444
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:05,980
Oh, that's so hard to find nowadays.

1445
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:06,980
No!

1446
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:07,980
Very, yeah, it's everywhere.

1447
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:10,980
All right, all right.

1448
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:18,420
It's not, I guess it's not available at the old corner store that you shop at.

1449
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:24,540
You know I exclusively buy groceries at a Cracker Barrel General's.

1450
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:28,780
You should ask old Mr. Peterson to carry some Donald Duck juice for you.

1451
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:30,780
All right, anyway.

1452
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,860
We've had a lot of fun here.

1453
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:36,060
Hopefully no more possessions occur.

1454
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:40,140
Anyway, you know, there's one thing.

1455
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:43,060
Boy, we jammed a lot in here and you know what?

1456
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,660
I can't believe we're not telling you until now.

1457
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:47,860
There actually is a topic tonight.

1458
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:51,540
Typical podcast the right fashion.

1459
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:52,540
That wasn't it.

1460
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:58,980
There were possessions and a bunch of slides and a guy called in from New York and we still

1461
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:00,400
have stuff to do.

1462
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,660
And because we're so close to Disneyland, we're the closest to Disneyland that we've

1463
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:09,620
ever done an episode, we want to honor the great Antion Park.

1464
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:11,100
We got to bring out the big guns.

1465
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:14,300
We got to do one of the big ones that we haven't covered.

1466
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,300
Let's announce what that is.

1467
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,740
All aboard!

1468
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,740
Let's go!

1469
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:22,740
Yeah.

1470
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,740
You bet your ass.

1471
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:30,140
You're damn right.

1472
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:31,500
Still Casey Jr.

1473
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:38,380
Now you know how we feel when we're deep in an episode and like, oh my God, stuff still.

1474
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:43,740
We're talking about Casey Jr. Circus Train, ladies and gentlemen.

1475
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:50,940
Now Jason, a noted fan of this attraction.

1476
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:54,020
I love it.

1477
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:58,380
And I think there was even the concern from you that fitting it into a live episode would

1478
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:04,100
be a challenge, would be a waste, would somehow defile your beloved train.

1479
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,100
Not a waste.

1480
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,740
No, well just like, would we have time?

1481
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:08,740
Would we get to it all?

1482
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:10,340
Well that's in question right now.

1483
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:12,100
That's in question right now.

1484
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:15,100
That possibility is certainly on the table.

1485
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:18,060
But you know what, let's give it our best shot.

1486
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:20,100
We can eliminate a little.

1487
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:26,300
We are not talking about Disneyland Paris' Casey Jr. Le Petit Train du Cirque.

1488
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:29,820
No, we're not talking about that at all.

1489
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,500
That is a roller coaster type attraction.

1490
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,940
Oh yeah, it's totally different.

1491
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:33,940
What?

1492
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:38,860
Yes, there was a children's roller coaster themed to Casey Jr. in Disneyland Paris.

1493
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:39,860
It looks like ours.

1494
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:40,860
And it still plays the song.

1495
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:41,860
It's all the stuff.

1496
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:44,620
Does it play it faster?

1497
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:48,620
That's a good question.

1498
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:49,620
And louder.

1499
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,620
It's a metal version I believe.

1500
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:54,620
We got nightcore Casey Jr.

1501
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:57,620
Okay, so that's off the table.

1502
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:58,620
Great.

1503
01:02:58,620 --> 01:02:59,620
Yes.

1504
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:00,620
We were talking about it.

1505
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:01,620
We were breaking the rules.

1506
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:02,620
Oh wait, yeah, yeah.

1507
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:03,620
We're not going 2D.

1508
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,620
Oh we're wasting valuable time.

1509
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:09,620
Jenny, we asked if you'd be okay with doing Casey Jr. as a topic and you were like, yeah

1510
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:10,620
sure, why not?

1511
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:12,380
I think I just didn't reply to your message.

1512
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:13,380
I think that's it.

1513
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:17,220
I think I said, Jenny, I think we were thinking of Casey Jr. and then no reply.

1514
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:18,780
And I said, I hope she's still doing the show.

1515
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:19,780
Yeah, that was it.

1516
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:20,780
I assumed she was.

1517
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:22,100
And look at you now.

1518
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,100
Now we get to talk about.

1519
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,100
And here I am.

1520
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:28,340
Yes, yeah, Casey Jr. has been said and you're here.

1521
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:30,020
Any thoughts or feelings about Casey Jr.?

1522
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,020
Oh so many.

1523
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:32,020
So many.

1524
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:33,020
I love Casey Jr.

1525
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:37,820
I love it because it's an attraction where the attraction aspect is kind of just the

1526
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:38,820
vehicle.

1527
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:41,020
Like it doesn't matter what it passes.

1528
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:44,500
I mean it does pass things but like no one cares.

1529
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:49,540
It's like you care if you're riding in the monkey cage or the caboose or the boring bench.

1530
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:50,540
Oh yes, yeah, yeah.

1531
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:55,420
I think it mainly, mainly it is about picking that vehicle on the way in.

1532
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:59,820
And you'd have to think that the cages are the most in demand.

1533
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:03,020
And like once the ride starts, the funnest part is over.

1534
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:08,060
Because like once you're in the monkey cage, like being in the monkey cage is not that

1535
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:09,060
fun.

1536
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:13,820
But like anticipating getting the monkey cage and then the moment when you get it is really

1537
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:14,860
fun.

1538
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:16,980
And then you're in it and you're like, yeah, okay.

1539
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:21,620
Well, I can't see the buildings as well now.

1540
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:23,500
Your view is restricted, yes.

1541
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:27,660
It's more restricted than if you just like stood and looked at the ride.

1542
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,220
But like good crash protection probably?

1543
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:31,220
Yeah, that's true.

1544
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:34,220
Or do you think it crumples like a smart car?

1545
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:37,220
I don't know.

1546
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:41,180
I'm partial to the caboose.

1547
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:45,700
I definitely know I've made Mike squeeze into the caboose and the cage.

1548
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:49,900
Yes, I have been in the cage with Jason a few times.

1549
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:54,180
He, I won't, here's the thing.

1550
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:58,060
I've only been on the ride with him when it's his birthday.

1551
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,060
Wow.

1552
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:05,860
Because like, and the only other time I've honestly been on is when Scott and our friend

1553
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:10,460
Andrew who's here who I believe checked you in tonight.

1554
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:15,780
We went on it and we were like, it's weird to go on it because it is for children.

1555
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:17,980
It's a child's train.

1556
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,620
And like we were like jockeying for position and then like families were coming by and

1557
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:24,660
we're like, oh, you go ahead, you go ahead.

1558
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:25,660
You go ahead.

1559
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:27,420
We didn't want the cops called on us.

1560
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:32,140
Like three adults like trying to get kids out of the way so we can get in the monkey

1561
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:33,500
cage.

1562
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:36,340
And then we like, they were like trying to seat us somewhere else and we're like, we'll

1563
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,340
do the next one.

1564
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:38,860
We'll go to the next Casey Jr.

1565
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:42,260
So like I always, I get stressed out on it because I feel like I'm taking something out

1566
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:44,220
of, taking food out of a child's mouth.

1567
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:47,580
I believe the term you meant to use is narrow gauge railway.

1568
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:48,580
What?

1569
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:49,580
What do you, what?

1570
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:50,860
It's not a children's ride.

1571
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:52,460
It's a narrow gauge railway.

1572
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:57,220
That means the track is more narrow than a standard gauge railway.

1573
01:05:57,220 --> 01:06:02,580
That's a lot of fancy words to say small.

1574
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:09,020
So yeah, narrow every time that Jason and I go on the narrow gauge railway, I get a

1575
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:12,260
little weird like, ah, do we have to do this?

1576
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:17,820
But that being said, I like this song and it's a nice little trip at night.

1577
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:18,820
Nice trip.

1578
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:21,820
You get to see a storybook land from different angles.

1579
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:25,780
All the nice miniatures, those boats take a long time to load.

1580
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:28,380
I don't ride those boats that much.

1581
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:29,460
I do like them.

1582
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:35,820
I like both of the boats and the Casey Jr. train because they're exclusive to Disneyland.

1583
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:37,140
They're not in Disney World.

1584
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:42,260
So like there's still like some charm, some uniqueness to me growing up, having grown

1585
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:43,500
up on the East Coast.

1586
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,900
Yeah, absolutely.

1587
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:48,780
Preferences between storybook land canal boats and Casey Jr.

1588
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,340
Casey Jr. no contest.

1589
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,580
Strongly Casey Jr.

1590
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:53,140
Jenny, do you agree?

1591
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:54,140
Yeah, Casey Jr.

1592
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:55,140
It's a train.

1593
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:56,740
I mean, it's, yeah, that's it.

1594
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:57,740
Disneyland is for trains.

1595
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:01,020
It's for trains mostly.

1596
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:05,220
It's also one of our favorite theme park archetypes.

1597
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:06,900
Little guy trying his best.

1598
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:12,540
Oh, now I see.

1599
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:13,540
Now I get it.

1600
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:14,540
Oh, absolutely.

1601
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:19,260
Yeah, I mean, it does have a little story in that regard.

1602
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:23,580
It's sort of a, you know, a Star Tours, Jurassic Park ride.

1603
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,960
Things go haywire in the middle.

1604
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:30,080
But in the calmest possible way and not even fully haywire.

1605
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,720
He just like, you know, breathing problems.

1606
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:39,600
It's really he he's like really huffing and puffing because he's having some problem with

1607
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,160
his respiratory system.

1608
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,160
Yeah.

1609
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,720
And like the tension isn't that you might be in danger.

1610
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:50,840
The tension is that you might not be able to go fast if you can't crest the lift hill.

1611
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:53,440
You might just be a disappointing ride.

1612
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,920
That's the stakes.

1613
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:55,920
Sure.

1614
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,440
Well, it's maybe it's possible that if you don't make it all the way up the hill that

1615
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,000
it careens all the way down backwards.

1616
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
That's why I picked the monkey cage though.

1617
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
So no stakes.

1618
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,360
Wait, wait, wait.

1619
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,600
Let me throw this at you though.

1620
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:15,400
If you're in that cage and the train falls into the storybook canal, then you might get

1621
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,920
trapped in there as it sinks all the way to the bottom.

1622
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,520
But the sharks will not get you.

1623
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,520
Ah, yes.

1624
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,680
The famous sharks in the storybook.

1625
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,440
Good point.

1626
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:30,720
I just might want to be open air for easy escape.

1627
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,720
I'm so afraid that there's going to be an accident on KC Junior.

1628
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:37,240
Oh no, before you can edit this and post it.

1629
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:40,000
Oh yeah, what if nobody go on it for the next like three days?

1630
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,440
Oh my God.

1631
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:45,520
Imagine if that broke and then there was in fact like maybe just edit it out or would you

1632
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:50,160
just go, oh no, and like post it anyway.

1633
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:56,800
I think that my cautionary tale would serve as evidence that they should have kept that

1634
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,800
thing safer.

1635
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,600
But what if like all of our hypotheticals happened?

1636
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,800
They were like, yeah, the people that were on the benches were crushed on impact, but

1637
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,720
the people in the cage, they drowned.

1638
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,720
And it's just like everything.

1639
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:14,600
Well, now, the guy in the caboose got the little steering wheel like jammed into its

1640
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:15,600
mouth.

1641
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,720
No, don't give them more material.

1642
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,720
Don't give death more material.

1643
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:20,760
Yeah, you're right.

1644
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,760
Geez, everything I'm writing is coming true.

1645
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:25,760
Yeah, the crew members at the pool.

1646
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:32,480
Hollywood has told me that if I go into the water in some sort of cage or secured thing,

1647
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:37,280
Benji and Luther will cut me out and put me in a boat with a bag over my head.

1648
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:38,920
Like in Mission Impossible Fallout.

1649
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:39,920
Oh, I see.

1650
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:43,960
So you didn't know the names Benji and Luther off the top of your head?

1651
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,960
Didn't have Benji in there, no.

1652
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,960
I knew, yeah.

1653
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:53,200
I mean, you make a good point that this ride hopefully is inspiring to asthmatics.

1654
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:57,200
Yes, yes.

1655
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,200
If you think you can.

1656
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:01,200
He really is struggling.

1657
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,200
Like you heard him in this before.

1658
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:08,200
It's really like we went on it and we were like disturbed a little bit by it because

1659
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,200
what are we on top of him?

1660
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,200
What are we doing to him?

1661
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,200
Why are we making him carry us?

1662
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,200
We're adding to his weight.

1663
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,200
That's a good point.

1664
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:21,440
There's 40 of us in this train and this guy is like struggling so hard we should get out.

1665
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,440
He's filled with the circus.

1666
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:27,440
He's carrying the whole circus.

1667
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,440
But we're just people.

1668
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,440
We're not in the circus.

1669
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,440
You don't imagine you're in the circus?

1670
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,440
Circus train.

1671
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:43,440
So he's like the people that didn't understand why Snow White wasn't in her ride.

1672
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,680
He's like I just don't get why we're in a circus train.

1673
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:51,680
We could not parse the complex story of the KC Junior Circus Train.

1674
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,680
You're the monkey.

1675
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,680
I guess.

1676
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:58,680
So next time I go on it I have to imagine I'm like the lion tamer.

1677
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:01,680
But you're a heavy monkey.

1678
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,680
I'm a 185 pound monkey?

1679
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:08,680
And then when they unlock the cage they're like come out you heavy monkeys.

1680
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,680
Alright get a move on.

1681
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:11,920
Big boy.

1682
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:12,920
Yeah.

1683
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:13,920
Come on.

1684
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,920
Would you say the monkeys are thick?

1685
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:16,920
Yeah.

1686
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,920
And then they sell your mom.

1687
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:20,920
Oh god.

1688
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:21,920
Oh no.

1689
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:26,920
That's accurate but you put it that way.

1690
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,920
It's definitely chilling.

1691
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,920
You know why did they recreate the train?

1692
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,920
The circus wasn't the good guy in Dumbo.

1693
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:36,920
True.

1694
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,160
True.

1695
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:43,160
They don't have like a strong bullies cage ride where you're swinging around in these

1696
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,160
little bird cages.

1697
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,160
They could.

1698
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:47,160
It would be pretty good.

1699
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,160
But they don't.

1700
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:51,160
It's alright you never get to leave.

1701
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:54,160
At the villains thrill park maybe.

1702
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:57,160
Well as long as you're not entertaining they eventually let you go.

1703
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:00,160
So we'd all be fine.

1704
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,400
Yeah.

1705
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:07,400
Well I don't think Casey necessarily knows what he's delivering and why.

1706
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,400
He knows it's heavy.

1707
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,400
He's just following orders.

1708
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:12,400
Yes.

1709
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,400
Okay.

1710
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,400
I'm letting him off the hook I guess.

1711
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,400
Yeah that makes it okay.

1712
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,400
That's fine.

1713
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,400
He doesn't know what's inside him.

1714
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,400
It's behind him.

1715
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,400
He faces forward.

1716
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,400
He can't tell what's being put.

1717
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:28,400
Oh I thought you meant like he doesn't know what's inside him.

1718
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:33,640
Like in the way none of us do until we're in like a difficult situation.

1719
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,640
So yeah.

1720
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,640
Like it could happen to...

1721
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,640
We could all be Casey juniors.

1722
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,640
Yeah.

1723
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,640
That's a good point.

1724
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:44,640
Yeah.

1725
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,640
That's what the Milgram experiment was about.

1726
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:53,640
And then in the other sense I hope there's not an animal inside me right now.

1727
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:57,640
I was already inhabited by a clown for a little bit.

1728
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:05,640
Okay so Casey junior is some kind of war criminal is what we've determined.

1729
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,640
Yeah I think that's official.

1730
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,640
We can make that ruling.

1731
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:10,640
So yeah like how often...

1732
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:11,640
Let me ask this of everyone.

1733
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:15,640
How many times do you think you've been on the ride in your lifetime?

1734
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:18,640
Because I think my answer is like four.

1735
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:19,640
Five.

1736
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:20,640
Oh what?

1737
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,640
Wow.

1738
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:22,640
Is that high?

1739
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:23,640
You think that's high or low?

1740
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,640
I was going to say like two dozen and I'm not even from here.

1741
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,880
I like Casey junior.

1742
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:29,880
Two dozen.

1743
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:30,880
Jason what do you think?

1744
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,880
Yeah I'd say about maybe a dozen.

1745
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:33,880
Yeah.

1746
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,880
A dozen Scott?

1747
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:35,880
I'm less.

1748
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,880
I think I'm in like I'm in five six range.

1749
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:38,880
Yeah.

1750
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:39,880
Five six.

1751
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:43,000
Do we have a new contest with the audience to see who's ridden it the most and then that

1752
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
invalidates the previous contest?

1753
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
No we want to do that.

1754
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
You're fine.

1755
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
You'll get your...

1756
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Guys Casey junior is the only train in Disneyland with a face.

1757
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Huh?

1758
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Right?

1759
01:13:55,360 --> 01:14:00,360
Actually I think a lot of the trains at Disneyland their faces are underneath.

1760
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:03,360
Like you're trying to anthropomorphize it like a human and just presuming the face would

1761
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,360
be on the front.

1762
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:09,360
But I think it's if you turn it over it's like like a scary little hermit crab and

1763
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:15,360
then you like see a little mouth with a beak and like beady little eyes and it goes like

1764
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,360
and so you put it back.

1765
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,360
Yeah that's perfect.

1766
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:21,360
We've had a great body horror run on the show lately.

1767
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,360
Yeah.

1768
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,360
And that's perfect for this.

1769
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:26,720
You're so large and if you looked under the train you'd see all the little tiny legs.

1770
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:27,720
Oh yeah.

1771
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:28,720
Yeah.

1772
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:29,720
Does?

1773
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:30,720
Yeah.

1774
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:33,720
Audible ooks from the audience.

1775
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:40,440
So like the train cars and the wheels and stuff you're saying that's like it's shell

1776
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,440
or clothing exoskeleton sort of thing?

1777
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:45,360
You know when like a predator can like disguise themselves as part of the environment.

1778
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,360
I'm familiar.

1779
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:47,360
So it's that.

1780
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,360
Okay.

1781
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:52,440
That's just to like lure you in where you go like that's just a train a thing humans

1782
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,520
are accustomed to.

1783
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:58,560
That's like when they researched us to see what we're vulnerable to they're like from

1784
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:03,320
what I can tell humans love trains especially Walt Disney.

1785
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:04,320
Yeah one guy.

1786
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,320
Yeah.

1787
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:06,320
I know one guy who really loved trains.

1788
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,320
Yeah.

1789
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:13,320
Does does what does Disney own who owns Thomas the Tank now?

1790
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:14,320
Hmm.

1791
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,880
Is that Viacom?

1792
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:16,880
Is it Viacom?

1793
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:17,880
No I don't know.

1794
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:18,880
What do we think?

1795
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:19,880
PBS owns it?

1796
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:20,880
Oh.

1797
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:21,880
Hmm.

1798
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,320
All right.

1799
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:24,320
No.

1800
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,320
Okay.

1801
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,320
I can say things too.

1802
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,320
I own it.

1803
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:28,320
Not true.

1804
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:31,320
I wish I owned it.

1805
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:35,720
Bring up some British company that's irrelevant to us.

1806
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,520
Oh that sounds right.

1807
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:38,520
They like trains there.

1808
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:40,520
Soon Thomas will be following orders.

1809
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:41,520
Jesus.

1810
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:42,520
I know.

1811
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:45,520
He's on the board of directors of the company.

1812
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,520
You approve the merger.

1813
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:50,520
There's all the euro rail like you go backpacking you can get the euro rail pass.

1814
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,160
Mattel.

1815
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:53,160
Mattel owns Thomas.

1816
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:56,440
Do they own the toy rights or do they own him?

1817
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:59,840
I think they own him.

1818
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,560
They put him in his shed at night.

1819
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,560
It's Mattel.

1820
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:03,560
People are saying it's official.

1821
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:04,560
Three people said it.

1822
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,560
It's fact.

1823
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,560
Yeah.

1824
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:11,160
Mattel does like Hasbro owns like Mr. Potato Head and they own so like there are like the

1825
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:15,880
toy companies and eventually like Disney will buy all of those toy companies and then they

1826
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:20,160
will have Thomas and then we will re-theme the Disneyland Railroad to Thomas and Friends.

1827
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,920
It's only just now dawning to me I think a section of the audience thought I was making

1828
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:30,080
a very dark train joke that just occurred to me now.

1829
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,080
I was not intentionally.

1830
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,080
Oh no.

1831
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,080
No.

1832
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,080
You were referring to Walt and it just felt weird.

1833
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,080
No.

1834
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,080
I know what happened.

1835
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:41,080
I'm not going to say it.

1836
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,080
That was not my intention.

1837
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:48,080
I was thinking more about backpackers after college taking the euro pass.

1838
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,080
Got it.

1839
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Yeah.

1840
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Please do not cancel me for train based humor.

1841
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:09,840
Oh well I'd like to talk about the song a little bit and really just a little bit of

1842
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:14,360
the song because I like the song very much and I think it's a lot of the texture of what

1843
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:21,320
makes this ride so fun but really the money of that song is time for lemonade and cracker

1844
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:22,320
jacks.

1845
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,320
Cracker Jack singular.

1846
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,320
What?

1847
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,320
One cracker jack.

1848
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:33,320
Cracker Jack is plural without an S on the end.

1849
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,320
Really?

1850
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:35,320
Multiple cracker jacks.

1851
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:40,040
In the Take Me Out to the Ball game it's buy me some peanut and cracker jacks.

1852
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,040
Then that's plural as well.

1853
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,040
It's not a single.

1854
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:44,040
Sounds like some popcorns.

1855
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:47,720
See more than three people said it so it's right.

1856
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,720
Huh.

1857
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:49,720
Huh.

1858
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:54,720
I can't imagine any like 80% of the ballpark must pluralize it.

1859
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:55,720
Yeah.

1860
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:58,720
I've heard it but it's incorrect.

1861
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:03,720
And you take the time to try to correct everyone in the ballpark.

1862
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:10,960
I'm waving a dictionary in the air running around a baseball park pointing.

1863
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:15,960
And another game ruined by a crazed dictionary holder on the field.

1864
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:18,960
It's a public service.

1865
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,960
Anyway that line.

1866
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,520
What a delight.

1867
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:23,800
Time for lemonade and cracker jacks.

1868
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:27,920
Which I imagine is what cracker jacks singular.

1869
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:28,920
I won't do it again.

1870
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,000
Time for lemonade and cracker jacks.

1871
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,960
Which is what I imagine you sing to yourself when the Patreon money comes in.

1872
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:50,960
Before he opens the email he's going chucka chucka chucka chucka chucka chucka chucka.

1873
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,960
You had that one in the chamber for a while now?

1874
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:58,960
Maybe.

1875
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,960
Did it seem pre-written or something?

1876
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:02,960
No that's fine.

1877
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,960
I like it because of the bleakness it projects.

1878
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:09,960
Well in the...

1879
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:12,960
They had so little to live for back then.

1880
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:13,960
Yes!

1881
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:14,960
This is the depression.

1882
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:15,960
Back then!

1883
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:19,960
The only time you tasted sugar is when the circus arrived.

1884
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,960
And you're like well this is when sugar is around.

1885
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,960
Perhaps next year I'll taste it again.

1886
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:29,960
Very good point.

1887
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,960
It's sad.

1888
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,960
Yeah it wasn't...

1889
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,960
Why get one singular treat Ian it's like a thimble.

1890
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:39,960
It's just a tiny little amount.

1891
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:42,960
And you share it with your little brothers and sisters.

1892
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,960
It's easier for you to count out the kernels because you couldn't afford gloves.

1893
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,960
It's winter in my dream.

1894
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:57,960
Yes and you're taking care of like six siblings and something happened to your parents.

1895
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:03,960
Yeah Paul worked the mines and the black lung got him.

1896
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:10,960
Not a dissimilar summary from Ray Bradbury's something wicked this way comes.

1897
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:14,960
My father and the circus both rode off on trains.

1898
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,960
And I never saw either of them again.

1899
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,960
Real bleak.

1900
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:26,960
This is the world that this train ride throws you into.

1901
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:31,960
Well it's like a projection of that moment of fleeting happiness.

1902
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:34,960
So it's actually a really happy ride.

1903
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:40,960
Yeah because you would think that that happiness would be so much more amplified because you never had it on any other time of the year.

1904
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,960
Exactly because your life is so sad.

1905
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,960
You love the train.

1906
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:48,960
Right because like I go to Disneyland all the time it barely registers on my happiness meter anymore.

1907
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,960
Because I'm just so desensitized.

1908
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:53,960
I'm kidding I'm using it for a comedic effect.

1909
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:55,960
But yeah depression kids love trains.

1910
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,960
Do we have any in the audience?

1911
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,960
Kids who love trains in the audience?

1912
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:01,960
Kids from the depression.

1913
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,960
Oh yeah.

1914
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:07,960
Jason nice pull for you in the front row.

1915
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,960
Pointed right to Jason.

1916
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,960
Easy.

1917
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,960
I already get enough from them.

1918
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,960
Glad you got them out.

1919
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:28,960
Well that's why yeah this but what you're saying is we get to be all of us in this room get to be happy all the time with trips to theme parks and

1920
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,960
hotel bars and live podcasts.

1921
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,960
You all probably take lemonade for granted.

1922
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:40,960
Yeah there was a time when people were only happy for four minutes a year.

1923
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:42,960
And it's portrayed in Casey Jr.

1924
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:50,960
Yeah it's something to think about as we go home and take our lemonade out of the fridge and our nightly bowl of Cracker Jack.

1925
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:56,960
And really like imagine like what it would be like and really be thankful for your Cracker Jack and lemonade.

1926
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,960
My annual lemonade and Cracker Jack.

1927
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:02,960
Jenny did you see the Tim Burton Dumbo?

1928
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,960
I sure did I loved it.

1929
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,960
Oh yeah.

1930
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,960
Oh a lot of fans.

1931
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,960
It slapped if you will.

1932
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,960
Alright.

1933
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:13,960
Wow.

1934
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:15,960
Dumbo and holes getting big pops tonight.

1935
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:16,960
They love it.

1936
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,960
No yeah it was great.

1937
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:22,960
There was a lot of like just men who hated elephants.

1938
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,960
That's an endorsement?

1939
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:29,960
Well I mean like it was an interesting like I just trust that that must have been what that was like back then.

1940
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:30,960
Oh sure.

1941
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:33,960
So you know they loved trains and they hated elephants.

1942
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:37,960
Unfortunately the two usually arrive at the same time.

1943
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,960
That's conflict.

1944
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,960
That's dramatic conflict you need for a film.

1945
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,960
How was Casey Jr. in that movie?

1946
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,960
He was there and they played the song in the instrumental.

1947
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:51,960
So that was all I wanted from the movie and it happened immediately.

1948
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:57,960
So kind of like the ride the best part was like the very beginning and then it was okay to leave but you're already there.

1949
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:01,960
So yeah.

1950
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,960
Oh very nice.

1951
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,960
But you stay you sit you don't.

1952
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:06,960
You don't climb out.

1953
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:07,960
Yeah.

1954
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:08,960
Yeah.

1955
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,960
Well that's why I get in the cage.

1956
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,960
In case you're tempted.

1957
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:13,960
Yes.

1958
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:15,960
This will force me to finish the ride.

1959
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:17,960
Yeah.

1960
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,960
Well we all love it.

1961
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:23,960
What we should have us riding cages for is like it's tough to be a bug.

1962
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,960
Yeah.

1963
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:27,960
Too soon.

1964
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:28,960
Rest in peace.

1965
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:31,960
Hopper.

1966
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:34,960
It's an awful thing.

1967
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,960
It's still in Florida right.

1968
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:37,960
You can still.

1969
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:39,960
Yeah it's in like the most beautiful thing in animal kingdom.

1970
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:40,960
Oh that's right.

1971
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:43,960
They decided to put their worst attraction in there.

1972
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,960
The park icon.

1973
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,960
Oh yeah it's inside the tree of life right.

1974
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:48,960
Yeah.

1975
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:59,960
It's got a majestic kind of timeless feature that looks very like tribal and then inside it's just like the bugs from a bugs lab life make like fart jokes at you.

1976
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,960
And other bugs you never met.

1977
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,960
Who are all the other men they throw things at you.

1978
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:07,960
It's just like assault the ride.

1979
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,960
Things they spit at you.

1980
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:10,960
You get poked in the back right.

1981
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,960
Yeah you get like slapped.

1982
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:13,960
Yeah.

1983
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:15,960
They like crawl under you get slapped.

1984
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,960
Do we think it was a slap or like a punch.

1985
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:18,960
Oh like slapped in the back.

1986
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:23,960
So we were saying like no one just walks over and just hits you right in the face.

1987
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:26,960
It depends on the cast member that's working.

1988
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:44,960
That was something I saw in the tweet about the 23 Julia we drive us is doing a voice in an upcoming Disney movie and someone was live posting from that panel and they said Julia Louise Dreyfus who we all know from a bugs life.

1989
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:49,960
That that not Seinfeld or V.

1990
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,960
I mean I guess D 23.

1991
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:53,960
OK.

1992
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,960
If you only watch G rated films.

1993
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,960
Yeah.

1994
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,960
And try and make yourself only hear about G rated films.

1995
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:01,960
I don't know how to do that.

1996
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:04,960
But yeah that'd be the way.

1997
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,960
Any closing thoughts about Casey Jr.

1998
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,960
Circus Train.

1999
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:16,960
They put a for the Disneyland 50th anniversary or something they painted the front.

2000
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,960
They painted Casey gold.

2001
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:19,960
He's gold.

2002
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:20,960
Wait which part of him.

2003
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,960
I don't remember him his face.

2004
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:23,960
Oh I don't like.

2005
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:24,960
No.

2006
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:25,960
Yeah.

2007
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:26,960
No.

2008
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:30,960
They bored potentially unhealthy paint all over him.

2009
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,960
Oh my god.

2010
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:33,960
I didn't.

2011
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:34,960
Really.

2012
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:35,960
Yeah.

2013
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:39,960
They did that I think to a lot of a trade they did like a golden version of a lot of the

2014
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:43,960
ride car from each but it's weird when it's the face of the train.

2015
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:44,960
Isn't that.

2016
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,960
Isn't that how Goldfinger killed his enemy.

2017
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:47,960
Yeah.

2018
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:50,960
That's where my mind went as well.

2019
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:56,960
Like he would murder he murdered that woman with gold and paint like he killed her.

2020
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,960
That's really that's fiendish.

2021
01:25:58,960 --> 01:25:59,960
Casey Jr.

2022
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:00,960
Has enough trouble breathing as it is.

2023
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,960
Yeah.

2024
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:02,960
He's huffing gold.

2025
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:03,960
He's needlessly cruel.

2026
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:04,960
Yeah.

2027
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,960
They didn't paint like Lincoln gold.

2028
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:08,960
Just his face.

2029
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:09,960
Gold.

2030
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:10,960
Just as.

2031
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,960
Although I would have packed the room.

2032
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:13,960
You know what they should have done.

2033
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,960
They should have painted him bronze.

2034
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:17,960
Oh.

2035
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:18,960
Oh.

2036
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:19,960
Copper copper.

2037
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,960
Kind of bronze.

2038
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:22,960
Shit.

2039
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:26,960
I was so happy with myself for a second.

2040
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,960
And then I'm going to be really getting that all night.

2041
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:29,960
You're not going to be able to sleep.

2042
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:32,960
I looked the fool that bronze error.

2043
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,960
Just once tonight I looked foolish.

2044
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:40,960
Every time every other thing I look cool and like a hero.

2045
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,960
And anything else.

2046
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,960
Plus ups we kind of forget to do.

2047
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:50,960
I want a car that says adults only.

2048
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,960
So I know where to go so I'm not taking it.

2049
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,960
It should not look fun or cool at all.

2050
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,960
It should be just utilitarian.

2051
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:59,960
And like I just know I can go there.

2052
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:02,960
I'm not taking a cool car away from a kid.

2053
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:03,960
I'm trying to think.

2054
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:05,960
They played Steely Dan in there.

2055
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:06,960
It's still a page.

2056
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,960
This is my plus up Scott.

2057
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,960
Not yours.

2058
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:15,960
They play they just play the bare naked ladies album Maroon in there.

2059
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:19,960
Their best album produced by Don Was.

2060
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:20,960
Anyway.

2061
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:21,960
It's entirely.

2062
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:24,960
They ask who Don Do you know who Don Was is.

2063
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:27,960
And that's how they decide to let you into the adult's car.

2064
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:28,960
Very well right.

2065
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:29,960
This way.

2066
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:31,960
You can describe the hats that he wears.

2067
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:32,960
Yes.

2068
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:33,960
Walk the dinosaur.

2069
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:34,960
Yes.

2070
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:35,960
Right this way.

2071
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:39,960
I don't know about a cage that says adults only.

2072
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:43,960
I've got a more wholesome train based one.

2073
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:48,960
A quiet car where I could get some work done.

2074
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:54,960
And expanding on that make make the ride like five times longer.

2075
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,960
So I could really get some work done.

2076
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:00,960
I mean it's a nice like ride longer or the train is longer.

2077
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:01,960
No expand the track.

2078
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:05,960
I want I want to I would love it if you could go through like a forced

2079
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:10,960
perspective versions of like the Dust Bowl or like just flat flat Midwest

2080
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,960
Plains or something.

2081
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:15,960
We ride the train to escape all that.

2082
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:16,960
Yeah.

2083
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:17,960
Yeah.

2084
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:18,960
Ride the train to escape it.

2085
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:19,960
I mean it's a nice length ride.

2086
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:20,960
Waving.

2087
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:21,960
Yeah.

2088
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:22,960
Little animatronic.

2089
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:23,960
Yeah.

2090
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:24,960
Stop.

2091
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:28,960
I mean our town doesn't have enough money for us to stop here.

2092
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,960
We're looking for coins.

2093
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:34,960
I assume that's what they just called money in the olden days.

2094
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,960
Yeah up until 1920 everyone just used coins.

2095
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,960
Pay me in coins young man.

2096
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:46,960
Satchel full of coins which is actually still how Jason pays with everything.

2097
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:47,960
What could they take Casey Jr.

2098
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:50,960
off and put it on the tracks for the Disneyland Railroad.

2099
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:56,960
I believe it is a small it's both I believe more narrow gauge railway.

2100
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,960
So it sounded like a yes.

2101
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,960
No but I'm saying I think Casey might be smaller tracks.

2102
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,960
Is there a way though to modify it.

2103
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:08,960
Switch switch trains and on the different tracks.

2104
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,960
Disneyland Railroad on the Casey Jr.

2105
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,960
track Casey on the Disneyland Railroad track.

2106
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,960
We could put it on the Space Mountain track.

2107
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:16,960
Yeah.

2108
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,960
Oh yeah.

2109
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:21,960
There should be more track switching don't you think at the parks.

2110
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,960
Mix them up.

2111
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:27,960
We're all tired of the way we like all the rides but we know it the way it is.

2112
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,960
Time to time to mix it up.

2113
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:35,960
Put that Skyway bucket that you saw on the D23 floor on the Incredicoaster.

2114
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:37,960
Float it down pirates.

2115
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:39,960
Yeah I would love that.

2116
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:40,960
Yeah.

2117
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:41,960
That is a good idea.

2118
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:49,960
Another plus up could one of the cars be the old time like hobo thing.

2119
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:51,960
Where you would like two people.

2120
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:55,960
Two people stand and they pump the thing to make it move.

2121
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:59,960
Maybe that's even separate from it and you actually are powering it with you.

2122
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:02,960
Yeah I would go on that every time I was at the park.

2123
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,960
There's one of those parked at the Main Street station for the Disneyland Railroad.

2124
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:09,960
And it's just taunting me.

2125
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:11,960
It's just I can't get on it.

2126
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:15,960
Well they have a ride like that at Knott's at Snoopy.

2127
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:18,960
Oh can you do it? Can you operate it?

2128
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:22,960
But you have to be shorter than 20 inches or something.

2129
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,960
It's to be an infant.

2130
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,960
To be a tiny baby.

2131
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,960
They're putting infants to work at Knott's.

2132
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:29,960
Generating their power.

2133
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:32,960
That was my favorite ride at Knott's when I was still short.

2134
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,960
Well.

2135
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,960
It was good.

2136
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,960
So steal it from Knott's, add a baby pumping machine.

2137
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,960
What do you call that?

2138
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:49,960
And then don't say adults only but say for people over.

2139
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:50,960
Big boys.

2140
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,960
Big boys.

2141
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:56,960
That sounds like you could call a child a big boy though.

2142
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,960
They're allowed too.

2143
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,960
That's fair. That's okay.

2144
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:02,960
Well no that defeats the whole point of it.

2145
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:05,960
I don't know what you want.

2146
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,960
I just want a cast member to tell me where to go.

2147
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:09,960
That's what I want.

2148
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:12,960
You want to be able to fit your legs into the thing is what you want.

2149
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,960
Yes. I'm 6'3".

2150
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:15,960
He fits.

2151
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:18,960
You just got to bend him up a little.

2152
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,960
Alright. I'll go on.

2153
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,960
Alright.

2154
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:25,960
Alright. Well I think that covers us on Casey Jr.'s Circus Train.

2155
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:27,960
Wait my suggestion for plusing it.

2156
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:29,960
Oh wait. Sorry.

2157
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,960
It's intense. Hear me out.

2158
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:32,960
Yes. Yeah. Absolutely.

2159
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:38,960
Okay. So J.K. Rowling really wanted a Hogwarts Express when they were talking about putting Harry Potter land in.

2160
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:44,960
So the way they could get her back is if they just paint the Casey Jr. in the color scheme of the Hogwarts Express.

2161
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:47,960
And just assert that that's what it is.

2162
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:54,960
And then they have the trolley witch go by with chocolate frogs which delays the load time by 15 minutes.

2163
01:31:54,960 --> 01:32:00,960
And then they have costume performers like, blimey Harry.

2164
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,960
There's monkeys on the train.

2165
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,960
And that's kind of it. It's the same ride.

2166
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:10,960
But it just looks different. You can still see the molding of what's obviously a circus train.

2167
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,960
There's still a cage but it's weirder now.

2168
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:15,960
So.

2169
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:20,960
The car that says wild animals they just cross out and put Harry Potter.

2170
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,960
Yeah. Harry Potter.

2171
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:24,960
Harry and his friends.

2172
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:30,960
So that you could sum up that plus by saying just fool J.K. Rowling.

2173
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:31,960
And trick her.

2174
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,960
Yeah. She would fall for it.

2175
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:34,960
Sure.

2176
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,960
You would put one car that just says Johnny Depp on it.

2177
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,960
She'd be like, yes, please.

2178
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,960
As soon as she sees the caboose says Johnny Depp.

2179
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:41,960
She's all on board.

2180
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:42,960
She loves Johnny Depp.

2181
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:43,960
I don't know why.

2182
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,960
Yeah.

2183
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:46,960
Just loves Johnny Depp.

2184
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,960
Hates Jeremy Corbyn.

2185
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:52,960
That's not how you're supposed to be aligned in 2019.

2186
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:55,960
So no it'll say no Jeremy Corbyn's on the train.

2187
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:59,960
Oh my gosh. They could add an extra Jack Sparrow animatronic.

2188
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:01,960
To be Grindelwald.

2189
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:02,960
Oh yeah.

2190
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:07,960
They just put like a gross wig on him.

2191
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:12,960
If the Imagineers are listening on the other side of the wall, which I know they are.

2192
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,960
Feel free to take any of these ideas.

2193
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:18,960
Tony, Joe Roady, they're all there we know.

2194
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,960
Listening to our brilliant.

2195
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:29,960
Let's go load up on a bunch of wine and go like find them at all the bars where they are tonight and shout all of these ideas in their face.

2196
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:31,960
That's the rest of our evening.

2197
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:32,960
But you know what?

2198
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:37,960
We have one more quick thing before we wrap up and we let you get to your ride sir.

2199
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:40,960
Your mic check ride.

2200
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:43,960
One more PTR 23 announcement.

2201
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:47,960
It's a sneak peek at an upcoming podcast, the Ride event.

2202
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:49,960
An event that's bigger than our podcast.

2203
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:51,960
Bigger than all of us really.

2204
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:55,960
Bigger than anything they're showing down at the convention center.

2205
01:33:55,960 --> 01:34:00,960
And hey if you have a pillar blocking your view of the screen, feel free to move.

2206
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,960
The people listening at home, we'll post this.

2207
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:09,960
You're going to be a little in the dark, but there's a haunting audio track that you can listen along to.

2208
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:16,960
And hopefully they collected all your cell phones at the door.

2209
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,960
Put them in those bags.

2210
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:20,960
Did Andrew Grissom do that?

2211
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:21,960
We've got those bags.

2212
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:25,960
I see he's got a big sack of phones back there.

2213
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:29,960
Okay so, oh wait, I'll go turn the lights off.

2214
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:30,960
Oh yeah we should turn the lights off.

2215
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:32,960
We'll cut this part out.

2216
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:35,960
Let me ask Jason. Jason what did you have for breakfast?

2217
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:40,960
I had the special K protein with golden raisins in it.

2218
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:43,960
And I had iced coffee with almond milk.

2219
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:44,960
Thank you.

2220
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,960
Lunch?

2221
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:49,960
A couple slices of leftover pizza.

2222
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:51,960
Did you eat dinner?

2223
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:54,960
Also pizza.

2224
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:56,960
I was hoping.

2225
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:01,960
Alright I did and I arbitrarily turned off some of the lights but maybe turned on other different ones.

2226
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:02,960
Yeah that's true.

2227
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:03,960
Mission accomplished.

2228
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:04,960
Alright.

2229
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,960
We all can see this relatively well.

2230
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,960
Here we go. To the screen.

2231
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:11,960
Oh not that. Edit that too. Edit that Alec.

2232
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:13,960
One more.

2233
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:15,960
We'll edit this out.

2234
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:45,960
The side wall.

2235
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:50,960
Where the neon signs are pretty.

2236
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:54,960
How can you lose?

2237
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:59,960
Boys, boys, how can you lose?

2238
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:20,960
You and I, somebody kind to help us understand you.

2239
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:30,960
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to guide them along.

2240
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:35,960
So maybe I'll see you there.

2241
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:39,960
We can forget all our troubles.

2242
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,960
Forget all our cares.

2243
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:45,960
So come down, down.

2244
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:50,960
Everything's waiting for you.

2245
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:54,960
Down, down.

2246
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:58,960
Down, down.

2247
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:05,960
Alright.

2248
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:06,960
Alright.

2249
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,960
Okay.

2250
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:09,960
Wow.

2251
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:11,960
Wow.

2252
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:13,960
Boy that was thrilling.

2253
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:15,960
Hope you're all excited.

2254
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:20,960
I know there's been a ton of rumors about this thing.

2255
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,960
A lot of speculation.

2256
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:30,960
There's so much buzz online about how are they going to cover Sugar Boo?

2257
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:34,960
Are they going to have a guest handle a little mismatched?

2258
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:35,960
We've seen it.

2259
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:38,960
There's so many rumors, so much speculation.

2260
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,960
But there's one thing that I don't think has been rumored about

2261
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:44,960
and we're going to leave you with that.

2262
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:48,960
One more quick little announcement.

2263
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:52,960
Earl of Sandwich.

2264
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:56,960
Ladies and gentlemen, Mike Mitchell will be covering...

2265
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:00,960
Our very first guest returns.

2266
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:05,960
Mike Mitchell, Earl of Sandwich.

2267
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:10,960
Every bit akin to Mahershala Blade.

2268
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,960
Alright, well we can't wait.

2269
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:13,960
We've got to get to work.

2270
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:15,960
We've recorded none of it and it comes out really soon.

2271
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:16,960
So we've got to get to it.

2272
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,960
Maybe we'll go start tonight.

2273
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:18,960
I don't know.

2274
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:23,960
But for now, you all survived Podcast The Ride live at D23.

2275
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:25,960
Thank you.

2276
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:27,960
Thank you so much.

2277
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:29,960
Jenny Nicholson, thanks for being here.

2278
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:32,960
Thank you.

2279
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:34,960
Exit through the gift shop.

2280
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:35,960
What's that?

2281
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:36,960
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2282
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:38,960
Is there anything you'd like to plug, Jenny?

2283
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:39,960
Nope.

2284
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:41,960
Alright.

2285
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:44,960
Star Wars video someday, correct?

2286
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:46,960
Yes, Star Wars land and trains.

2287
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:48,960
Great, that's part of it now.

2288
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,960
Alright, and Mike, you've got to get to work.

2289
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:53,960
You've got to get this gentleman on a ride.

2290
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:57,960
Anybody who's going back to the park, have fun at D23 tomorrow.

2291
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:00,960
But don't have as much fun as you had here at PTR 23.

2292
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,960
Thanks so much for coming, everybody.

2293
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:03,960
That was a blast.

2294
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:04,960
Really appreciate it.

2295
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:06,960
Thanks so much.

2296
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:09,960
Thank you.

2297
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:22,960
Forever.

2298
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:25,960
