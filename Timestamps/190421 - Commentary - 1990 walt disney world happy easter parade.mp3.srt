1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Happy Easter, everyone.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The most joyous day has arrived.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm Scott Gardner, for this magical Easter celebration,

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Mike Carlson and Jason Sheridan joining me as well.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes, ho ho.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
He has risen.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The Easter bunny, that is.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Easter bunny. Does Easter bunny have like a catchphrase?

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hippity hop.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hippity hop.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hippity hoppity. Easter's on its way.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It is. For God so loved the world, he gave his only son.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The bunny says that.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hippity hop hop. Is that how the song goes?

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hippity hoppity. Easter's on its way.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hippity hoppity.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We were talking about that, how there's only like two Easters.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
There's that and there's Easter Parade.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Which I think we'll hear both in what we're about to watch.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's the Easter bonnet song.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, put on your Easter bonnet with all its frills upon it.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That kind of thing is why I don't like Easter.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's all about pinafores and frills.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And as a Catholic child, Easter was exceedingly irritating to me.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Did you wear like Little Lord Fauntleroy outfits?

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I kind of did. I sort of had to wear like little vests and stuff.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Like what Jason's wearing now?

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Lacy sleeves and a tiny timepiece and all.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
No, I feel like my parents made a huge deal out of Easter wear.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Which probably is why I don't think I liked dressing up for my whole life.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Until my wedding did I not have a nice suit and they turned me off.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's all Easter's fault.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Well, on the East Coast, I mean, Easter fluctuates depending on the calendar.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But sometimes on the East Coast, that meant it was either cold and rainy

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
or it was like the start of humidity.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And in the 90s, children's, what I remember is like children's formal wear

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
was largely polyester.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So not super breathable.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Or potentially an Easter corduroy.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh yeah.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh right.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Corduroy vests.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I think I had a blue sport jacket one year.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Maybe two years.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And that was maybe the craziest it got.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
My sister would always have an Easter dress and a bonnet.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But I don't think I did it.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
In the 90s, madness what girls had to wear.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes, like American Girl dolls.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Like little dolls.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Little horror movie dolls.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And they had like full tablecloths on there as a collar.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Like a giant doily.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We're going to see some of that fashion in this because this parade is from 1990.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So it's probably going to get pretty hideous.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I've only like skimmed this thing and I don't have it.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We want to be fresh.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah, yeah.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Don't want it to be overly rehearsed.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We don't have like the Mystery Science Theater Rift Track binders.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I saw them live once and they all had like stage reading style binders with jokes.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This won't be nearly as funny as one of those because we haven't prepared.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We promise.

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I have, I don't know if it's this one.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I should have like looked through them more.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And it also might be like childhood memories mushing together.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But I have a very specific memory of like a flood of frilly Easter dresses and white suits and that Easter parade song walking down Main Street.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Filling up the entirety of Main Street.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes.

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
A grid of like seven frillies wide and 19 frillies long.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Graff, you multiply that.

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So many frillies.

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
160.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And I was into that because I loved old timey shit.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But I have childhood memories of Easter being an exhausting holiday because you got to get up.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You got to find the baskets.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Then you got to go to church.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Then you got to go to a relatives for Easter Ham.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And then you come home and what's on Monday?

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
School.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
School.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We didn't get like Easter Monday off until I was like a senior in high school.

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You got Easter Monday.

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Monday.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Sometimes.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Sometimes.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Depending on snow days.

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Depending on how many snow days we had to account for.

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No, but saying if we didn't have like if we hadn't burned through snow days, they would give Easter Monday off sometime.

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Easter Monday.

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I never even heard the term Easter Monday.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Easter Monday.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's the day after Easter.

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I get what it is.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Jesus.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I guess I'm saying I've never heard it as a thing.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's not a thing is what I'm saying.

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The day everyone rested from the excitement of Christ being born.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
All the apostles had to chill out a little.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That was an exhausting day.

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You think it was an exhausting day having to go to relatives and eat ham.

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Imagine if your buddy, the savior of mankind, was alive again.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
After you watched him take the most deadly walk in human history.

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah, he has to.

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Bro, I needed Easter Monday off, bro.

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But it's like Christmas.

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You don't go back to school the day after Christmas.

110
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
No, probably not.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm just saying all I'm saying is I've never heard Easter Monday as a term.

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I haven't really either.

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
All right.

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I get what you mean.

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm just saying that that's interesting to me because I've never heard that you get the Easter after or Monday after Easter.

116
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But you've heard.

117
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Have you heard of Maude Thursday?

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Well, that's the day before Good Friday.

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Maude Thursday.

120
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And you're like, at least in Protestantism.

121
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah, if I had to be, I don't know what it means exactly.

122
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
How do you spell Maude?

123
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Hold on.

124
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm going to look at Noddy Thursdays.

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Nod teams are on Mondays.

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah, it's on.

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Are they?

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Wednesdays, obviously.

129
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Sorry, it's Maude Thursday.

130
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's a holy day.

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Maude Thursday.

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Maude Thursday.

133
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's not Wednesday.

134
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay.

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's what I, the week leading up to Easter, of course, is Holy Week, begins on Palm Sunday.

136
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
In the Bible, this is when the Last Supper took place, is Maude Thursday.

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay.

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And then Friday is the crucifixion.

139
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Would you have Maude Thursday off as well?

140
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Well, our spring break was usually Holy Week.

141
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Covered Maude Thursday.

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Covered Maude Thursday.

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So that was the other thing.

144
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Like Easter, like the end of spring break was Easter.

145
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So you're back to school after a while.

146
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So you're back to school after a week.

147
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Would Maude Thursday still be a thirsty Thursday?

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Well, for just one drink though, the blood of Christ.

149
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
All right, fair enough.

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You know, we're recording this on Good Friday.

151
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And actually, and it's three o'clock, it just passed three o'clock, so that makes this okay.

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But when I was a, in my Catholic youth, I was made to be sad from 12 to three, which is supposedly when Christ was doing the walk.

153
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
When it went down.

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So I had to like, we had to go to church for some of that, not necessarily the full three hours, though sometimes the full three hours in a darkened room.

155
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And sometimes church at least has a guitar or something.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
This was sad, dark church for three straight hours.

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And I started protesting by just like hurling myself around the pews, like trying to like self-immolate essentially.

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Like maybe if I bruise my own face really hard, I don't have to be here.

159
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So I think my protests worked.

160
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But with this, what we did settle on is that from 12 to three, I have to be sad.

161
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And 12 to three on a Friday was when my Entertainment Weekly subscription would show up.

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So I was always really upset.

163
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I could not, I did not have access to hear like seeing a preview of The Matrix or whatever.

164
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We were all such beautiful little weirdos in different ways.

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I had that.

166
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I haven't said a lot about mine, but that's for sure the worst part is about my, me having to behave and thinking, well, if I just like go outside and climb the fence and snatch the mail ahead of time.

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But then go put the Entertainment Weekly back so I could get a half hour of reading time before my mom goes and gets the mail.

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Madness is how I was raised.

169
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
How would it be enforced?

170
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
How would you have to be sad?

171
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The garage door, well, the Entertainment Weekly thing, the garage door is very loud.

172
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So if they heard it opening, they'd know I was going to get that Entertainment Weekly and learn all about Spy Who Shagged Me instead of sitting in my room and reflecting on the crucifixion.

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So you just had to sit in your room and you couldn't watch TV for three hours essentially?

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
At that time I didn't have a TV in my room.

175
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Right. So I'm just saying, so it was just no fun.

176
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You had to sit and contemplate.

177
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
If there was music, I had to have it.

178
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It had to be headphones and I had to be ready to hurl those off in case they came and did a prayer check.

179
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And they did?

180
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I can, I have to imagine.

181
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Did you not eat meat on Good Friday?

182
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
No, all of lent.

183
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
All of lent.

184
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But you could eat fish.

185
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So we had fish sticks.

186
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Fish and cheese pizza.

187
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's a weird cheat.

188
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:35,000
My family only didn't do meat on Good Friday, which I still don't do because now I'm not so much religious as superstitious now.

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Like one year when I skipped going to church on Easter, I lost like a $60 camera battery at college and I'm like, well, can't do that again.

190
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So you're still going?

191
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I go on Easter Sunday and Christmas Eve.

192
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah.

193
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't think I knew that.

194
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh yeah.

195
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Interesting.

196
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah.

197
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It makes my mother happy.

198
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Even though you don't go with her.

199
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
On Christmas Eve.

200
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah.

201
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Usually I go with my family.

202
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm down to just Christmas.

203
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It was there was Easter in there and now it's just Christmas.

204
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah.

205
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So Easter I will, you know, in lack of church, I will get to spend watching every Disney Easter parade in a row for, I don't know when they started doing it, probably like 86, 87, up to this day.

206
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah.

207
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So as with every year, I will watch a full entire day's worth at least 12 in a row.

208
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Do they still do it?

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Do they still broadcast it?

210
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm not entirely sure.

211
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yeah.

212
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The people listening might know you might have already seen this year's and you can compare contrast to the year that we chose, which is the 1990 Disney World Happy Easter Parade.

213
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So if you're, if you want to sync up with us.

214
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
There's a link in the description.

215
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay.

216
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And to make sure that you have the right one.

217
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It is the 1990 Walt Disney World Happy Easter Parade.

218
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The user is Sam's Disney Diary.

219
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If you were to pull it up on YouTube, it would have a bright pink thumbnail, pinker and brighter than the pinafores that you will be seeing.

220
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And what's a pinafore?

221
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Is that the umbrella?

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Or is that that's a parasol?

223
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Good question.

224
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Jason pinafore.

225
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You're wearing one I assume.

226
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I think it's the frills.

227
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I think I'm going to look it up.

228
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I just know HMS Pinafore from Studio 60 and The Simpsons.

229
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah.

230
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah.

231
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The Gilbert and Sullivan play.

232
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Who is wearing the Mondiest Pinafore at this year's Easter Parade?

233
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Well, like I can tell you, I'll give you these previews about it, though you're soon to see an opening sequence.

234
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But if you need encouragement to sync it up with us.

235
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
This year's the 1990 Easter Parade is the All-Star lineup.

236
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Joan London, Regis Philbin and the begotten son Alan Thicke.

237
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You stopped being asked to be around, perhaps due to general unpleasantness, perhaps drunkenness that you will see in this very parade.

238
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I mean, not in this one so much.

239
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Once I did watch a pageant that he was hosting where he for sure was tipsy.

240
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But that just might be the way he spoke a little bit.

241
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This year also features special guests Buster Poindexter and Howie Mandel among many of your many of your favorite members of the Disney gang.

242
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So if you're ready.

243
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I have a quick Easter question.

244
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
One last question.

245
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Did you guys ever were you ever in like a crucifixion like little play at church or anything?

246
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't think I had to be, but I had to do some like exhaustive altar boy because you had a lot more work to do.

247
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You're like going around the stations and swing in a big thing of oil and that kind of.

248
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
OK, no plays, though.

249
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't think I feel like I know the answer for you, Jason.

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yes, I absolutely was.

251
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I was the thief who did not repent.

252
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I was the because there were three people crucified and there's the one that asked Jesus for forgiveness and the other who's like an asshole about it.

253
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And I was the one who said asshole about it, which just mean I had to go lower at the audience.

254
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Sorry, the guy, I guess the congregation is what you say with church.

255
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Glower at them and glower at Christ.

256
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And they like had like homemade, not like like crosses made out of branches and stuff.

257
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It wasn't my finest performance.

258
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But at the time, is there a video of it?

259
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't think we monetize it.

260
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
My family would have been like, yeah, that seems gauche to have, like because we would have a giant VHS camera.

261
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But when you have a podcast years later, I know they weren't forward thinking that way.

262
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I also can't talk about Easter services and little ceremonies without saying my favorite thing.

263
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The only thing that gave me joy during three hour marathon churches on Good Friday, which is there's it kind of is a little Easter play and the priest plays Jesus.

264
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He does Jesus's lines.

265
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Obviously, he is the most holy and then other like cantors or whatever do the other parts like punches pilot.

266
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But you get to participate, the congregation, and you participate by being the crowd that chooses to crucify Christ instead of the vill, the criminal that they're going to release instead.

267
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So you get to make the choice and it is still I bring this up to Aaron all the time.

268
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The funniest memory hearing three hundred dower people in a church all together like who do you wish to release Christ or Barabbas?

269
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Are you sure? Christ, this man, Jesus, has done nothing where Barabbas has murdered and thiefed and such.

270
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Are you really sure? Let me ask you once again, Christ or Barabbas?

271
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Here a wave of barely enunciated we're acting in a play, but we're supposed to be sad.

272
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It is the strangest thing and I can't find video of three hundred people all saying Barabbas.

273
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Maybe this was unique to my church.

274
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But boy, the only joy I should have gone to one today.

275
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Well, they're tired.

276
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I know the Protestant church is pretty chill that I went to growing up in and out 40 minutes an hour.

277
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Like, wow, really? The hits may be a little longer on Easter if there was more music or stuff.

278
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I do laugh because every now and then they would do communion on Easter to but not a guarantee.

279
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And my mom would always be like, oh, jeez, they're doing communion because that's another like 15, 20 minutes just doing the traffic flow.

280
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Just doing the trees and we didn't do the going up to the front.

281
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The trees came to you, but that takes a while.

282
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Oh, the bringing the baskets around.

283
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah, that's a big slow one.

284
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Just to Pinafore, a sleeveless, usually low necked garment fastened in the back and worn as an apron or a dress.

285
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So the HMS Pinafore back in the day was a very funny joke.

286
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh, interesting.

287
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Because it's it's a ship.

288
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
That's like, isn't it funny to call that ship a dress instead of something that dress?

289
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm just not like it wasn't like Pinafore and that's a different thing.

290
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I don't think so.

291
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
All right. Well, as funny then as it was on Studio 60 many years later, the modern model of a modern network TV show.

292
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
OK, well, I think with all that, we are now ready to begin.

293
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'll read it once again.

294
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The 1990 Walt Disney World Happy Easter Parade posted by Sam's Disney Diary.

295
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Thank you, Sam.

296
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It runs about an hour and seven minutes and we're excited to watch it.

297
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
OK, and all right.

298
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So you're ready?

299
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
We got your three to one.

300
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah, three to one.

301
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And then on go, you will hit play.

302
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Play, but make sure to watch any ads or any thing.

303
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
We're not counting.

304
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
We get your ads done now.

305
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah, it's zero zero zero time code.

306
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So one more time.

307
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Three, two, one, go is when I will say it.

308
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I will play it.

309
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And I think we filled at least 15 seconds past any.

310
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So on your own, we hit play.

311
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Go three, two, one, go.

312
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Sam's Disney actually worked on.

313
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
All right.

314
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I like the little head movements.

315
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Regis Philbin at this point, still a street reporter, not invited up to sit with the gang.

316
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Right. Regis and Joe and a lot of Disney afternoon, DuckTales and Rescue Rangers and the rabbit.

317
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And the rabbit and the duck sits there.

318
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Time to shine.

319
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Mike, can you crank it?

320
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Just a little says Easter.

321
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Join Buster Poindexter.

322
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That's that great Mickey balloon on all those ads.

323
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Yeah, the big inflatable.

324
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Well, there's like a beach party dance off.

325
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
They're sure.

326
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
This is 90s Mickey Mouse Club.

327
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Pretty new.

328
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Buckle up for the performance.

329
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The Fred Astaire.

330
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Oh my gosh.

331
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That dancing guy.

332
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Dapper Dan's.

333
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's a big time for them.

334
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Thumper.

335
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
All these characters who just rot in the back most of the year.

336
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
They're front and center this year.

337
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Cats don't count.

338
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Figaro.

339
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Sit in the back.

340
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
This is a marching band.

341
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Which I've said before.

342
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I did not get to do this, but I was in the marching band.

343
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
We marched in Disney World when I was 18.

344
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh yeah.

345
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So you know the holding area that these very people were in.

346
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You were 18 years old when you were sneaking Sprite.

347
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Hell yeah, my man.

348
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You were a legal adult who could vote.

349
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And you're like, this is mischief.

350
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You were like getting all the Sprite you could.

351
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
God, I thought you were like 15.

352
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I was under lock and key until I was 20 years old or so.

353
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I did not.

354
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
There was not a lot of rebellion going on.

355
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Not like me, man.

356
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I thought of all the potential routes to go get that entertainment weekly during Christ's death.

357
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Did I do it?

358
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
No, but I schemed.

359
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I had unholy scheming thoughts.

360
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I had scheming thoughts too, but very rarely did I actually scheme.

361
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
But I was, this was me.

362
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I was in the front row.

363
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Walt Disney World honor band.

364
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The scheme still isn't the bad thing.

365
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The scheme is.

366
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I would make kids in band do stuff that was a little bit mischievous.

367
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Like I said before, to this day, which is still.

368
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yeah.

369
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Well, I don't control bug though.

370
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
There's other people.

371
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So, yeah, I was in the front row like this band walking down Main Street at night at like dusk.

372
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And I always be honest, I felt real cool.

373
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That is cool.

374
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Walking down Main Street.

375
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What were you wearing?

376
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Front.

377
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
One of these.

378
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Feather in your cap?

379
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
But it was this, you know, this marching band outfit.

380
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Did you have a business casual band outfit?

381
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
No, but I.

382
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Because my school always had black t-shirts and khakis.

383
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Alan is like walking funny like a marching band.

384
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The hijinks begin now.

385
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And we're happy.

386
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Paving the way for his son Robin to unveil Masked Singers week after.

387
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Oh, yeah.

388
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The biggest.

389
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
That Alan Thicke slur, which the kid has a little.

390
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You know, I've watched clips of him on the mass and going, you know, I remember what a pioneer Ricky Lake was week after week on television.

391
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Really one of the great pioneers of women on TV.

392
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And without it, without her, you know, you wouldn't have Amy Schumer's today.

393
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So thank you.

394
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's got to be Ricky Lake.

395
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The Penguin is Ricky Lake.

396
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Cassimi St. Cloud.

397
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Cassimi St. Cloud.

398
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What a logo.

399
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And premier cruise lines, pre-Disney cruise lines.

400
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
The version we're watching has no commercials, you should be aware.

401
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
So if you're watching one with commercials, spin it around and watch something else.

402
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Watch. Watch this correct copy.

403
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
So why did Alan have to wear a suit?

404
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's Easter.

405
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's a pastoral time.

406
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yeah.

407
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Who doesn't love wearing a thick sweater in May in Orlando?

408
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
His hair is kind of like my dad's hair was your.

409
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Do you guys have like permy dad?

410
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
No, not not so much.

411
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Not so much perm.

412
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Mine is a little slick.

413
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
He kind of he reminded me of Patrick Duffy a little bit.

414
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yeah, he used to wear it.

415
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,000
As established, my father looks like John Hammond from Jurassic Park and went white pretty early.

416
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm hoping.

417
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Oh, yes.

418
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Well, I'm saying I'm hoping.

419
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Unfortunately, I think the hair you get the mother's hair,

420
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
which my mother's father and siblings all went bald in the worst possible way,

421
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
whereas my father has like aged much more gracefully with hair.

422
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So best of luck to you.

423
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I think it all depends.

424
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Do you have a can you compare your dad to any?

425
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That's a good question.

426
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I mean, he was dead.

427
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Man, that's a good question.

428
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I can't think of any sitcom stars of stage or screen immediately that he looks.

429
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I wouldn't know.

430
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
He looks like Robbins for a long time.

431
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
He was a Tim Robbins.

432
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
But I feel like older Tim Robbins, not what Tim Robbins looked like when he was younger.

433
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
OK, that's so what?

434
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Two thousands like the cradle will rock.

435
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Yeah.

436
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yeah.

437
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Then like, yeah, yeah, that's the closest I can think.

438
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Look at this.

439
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Reed is pretty outer blue, pretty tame by Reedus levels, a little more juiced at Christmas.

440
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Well, wouldn't you be Easter is not as exciting.

441
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Well, he's relaxed.

442
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
He's been saved.

443
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I was said.

444
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
OK, the hippos, they count as Easter animals.

445
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Yeah, they are pink.

446
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Oh, this is the third song.

447
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Hippity hoppy Easter.

448
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You were counting.

449
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Was I OK?

450
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It was that an Easter bonnet.

451
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Peter Cunton.

452
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I realized I was thinking about the Santa Claus.

453
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Thump, thump, thump, thumpity thump.

454
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
That was what I was thinking of.

455
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You're thinking of look at Frosty Go over the hills of snow.

456
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yep.

457
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Hmm.

458
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Eighty five degrees.

459
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Eighty five.

460
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
OK, so there's Robin Hood characters with Jiminy Cricket, which is, of course, inconsistent

461
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
universe wise.

462
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Nokia.

463
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Also a second ago.

464
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And a lot of villains holding out their hands.

465
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Who is that?

466
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh, that's a that's from Pinocchio.

467
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
That's the evil man.

468
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What's his name?

469
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I can't think of his child kidnapper.

470
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Yeah, the child's a good number.

471
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You're probably obvious.

472
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's the right.

473
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Why can't I think of his strong bully?

474
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Right.

475
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Yeah, I think so.

476
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Wait, but then there's also that other guy.

477
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Who's the guy without the beard?

478
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Yeah, he puts him in the show.

479
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
But who's the guy without the beard?

480
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Yeah, I think so.

481
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I think so.

482
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah, he puts him in the show.

483
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But who's the guy?

484
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I don't know.

485
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
The more the gambling guy.

486
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
We don't know the movies.

487
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
We know the part where the parks fans, the movies.

488
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yeah, my father in law looks a lot like Geppetto.

489
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
All right.

490
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
If the audience needs to know.

491
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Here's the right now.

492
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Look like Robin Hood.

493
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm wearing a green long green shirt with no pants.

494
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Little boots.

495
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And you're a big balloon and doing some like real like.

496
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Yeah.

497
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
unrehearsed choreography.

498
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You're watching along corny alert.

499
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
The Fox Robin Hood is on screen.

500
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Oh, they got the boom.

501
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I mean, so that's so like girls have crushes on that Robin Hood is what I'm told.

502
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Everyone apparently does.

503
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Everyone did.

504
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And all the boys liked Roxanne or Lola Bunny.

505
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Roxanne from the Goofy movie.

506
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Yeah.

507
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
As I said in our last commentary, Gadget.

508
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Gadget too.

509
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Seems to I think will feature in this.

510
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
My mother had a crush on one of the Aristocats when she was.

511
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Not the Aristocats.

512
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
No, no, no, no.

513
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
The Top Cats guys.

514
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
One of the Top Cats friends.

515
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Buddies.

516
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Yeah.

517
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm trying to remember if I actually had a crush on anthropomorphic animal as a youngster.

518
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Here's let's go to the hop from that era.

519
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Pre-Beatles era when rock and roll was bad.

520
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
What?

521
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Yeah.

522
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
What's the first song you like?

523
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
What's the earliest song?

524
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You know, I was in that era.

525
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I think I like Yakety Yak.

526
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
That's the first song.

527
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I mean, I like like Rocker on the clock or some of the Brill buildings.

528
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I was in Leader of the Pack, the Ellie Greenwich musical.

529
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And some of that stuff's good.

530
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Do you have a video of that?

531
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
No, because they were weird.

532
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
In high school, we did like the Broadway musicals and they're a lot weirder about videotaping that.

533
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Now you can find a million high school productions of musicals on YouTube because no one gives a shit and you can just shoot it on your phone.

534
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Were people worried about getting sued?

535
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Yeah.

536
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Well, I think when you the middle school ones, I think you came with a license agreement that you could videotape one night professionally.

537
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Just one.

538
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Just one.

539
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Yeah.

540
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
That's what I did in high school was I taped the play.

541
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I led a crew that filmed all of the plays.

542
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So we filmed them all very professionally.

543
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Sure.

544
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I don't know where the tapes ever went.

545
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So if you are listening to this and you went to Shamanah and you were in a play and I can think of one person listening who made that may be the case.

546
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm sorry.

547
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I can't speak for the distribution end of things.

548
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Your play is lost forever.

549
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Jimmy.

550
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Alan Thicke is touching her and she does not like it, I think.

551
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Now this is Scott's favorite song.

552
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Minnie she has a crush on you.

553
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I would buy dolls with Mickey and Minnie with the neon green like that.

554
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Got a crush on you.

555
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
What you gonna do?

556
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
That's the outfit I wore in high school band.

557
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Now she's Teddy Bear right here.

558
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Oh yeah.

559
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
She's swinging.

560
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Look at that.

561
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
In the middle of the park.

562
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Adorning a picture of.

563
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Oh my god.

564
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
But imagining wearing different clothes.

565
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I want Mickey with that outfit too.

566
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Sometimes I'll just show Lindsey pictures of Mickey in different outfits on Instagram and I'll be like hey look at this.

567
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And just gesture like hmmm see.

568
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And she'll be like oh that's yeah that's cute.

569
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
God it's been decades.

570
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
We're in the middle of an accounting meeting but okay.

571
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It's been decades of these two and it's still like Minnie's got a crush on you Mickey.

572
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Yeah they are married.

573
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Yeah the depression happened.

574
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
No they're married.

575
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
No they're by canon they're not married.

576
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Yeah.

577
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
They have to keep the spark alive.

578
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It can't be you know you can't.

579
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Oh my god he's a mountain.

580
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Oh mountain Mickey.

581
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
But she's not Canadian she's regular.

582
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Oh my gosh there's Mickey with a jumpsuit.

583
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
This is archive footage I think.

584
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I think they didn't film enough.

585
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You're right.

586
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
What is this?

587
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
This is.

588
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I'll make a call like you stuck in.

589
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
This is definitely the den voice.

590
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Yeah.

591
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
In the specials did not use the agreed upon Mickey voice.

592
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Sure.

593
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I've heard before that like they have like a list of ten people.

594
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Have you heard this where it's like they go down the list of who will work for cheapest.

595
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
A good enough list.

596
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yeah.

597
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Succession.

598
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Right so like if the number one Mickey doesn't want to do it for the rate they go to number two or something.

599
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
It's a real shitty sounding thing.

600
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
We read about Muppets that the to make Muppet Vision 3D.

601
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Oh yeah.

602
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah.

603
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It was like I want my guys and Disney said wait you just have the same person do Gonzo.

604
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
We just go down the list.

605
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
If they say no we go down the list.

606
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Maybe that is where we knew that for the first time.

607
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:33,000
That song Mickey she's got a crush on you on the splash dance album one of my favorite Disney pieces of Disney music.

608
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Also featuring the spark song Minnie Mouse that I love very much and they oddly moving song about gyro gear loose.

609
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
It's like I do.

610
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Oh yeah.

611
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm second gate.

612
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
It's like I kind of well up at this gyro gear loose song.

613
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I couldn't even do a drawing of gyro gear loose.

614
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I don't even know what he looks like but it's really moving little song.

615
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Sunday strollers.

616
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
That way Mrs.

617
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Mrs.

618
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Strollers.

619
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
On the old time bikes.

620
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Were the old time bikes part of the regular parade because don't you have to.

621
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Those are special.

622
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
That's a skill to be able to ride on the old time bike.

623
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Well that's true.

624
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
They probably need special permits or training.

625
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Because you can't end up kicking a kid in the head.

626
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You're right.

627
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
So Donald and Daisy also not married in canon.

628
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
No.

629
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I like Donald's outfit here.

630
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I think I would wear that legit.

631
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Here we go.

632
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Oh my God.

633
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Jason there he is.

634
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm having Vietnam style.

635
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Jason and Scott.

636
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Both dressed like that.

637
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Little hats.

638
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Did you guys have little hats like that.

639
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
No thank God.

640
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I'm sure that would have been my mother's dream though if I voluntarily put one on.

641
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Oh mother I found this on the sidewalk.

642
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Don't you think it makes me look dashing.

643
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I look like the happiest millionaire.

644
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I did as a kid wear a little bowler hat like the character the happiest millionaire.

645
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And I sang the song Fortuosity and my mom loved it so.

646
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Wow.

647
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
This is put on your Sunday clothes from the Hello Dolly.

648
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It plays a big part in Wally.

649
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Yeah.

650
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
And now you hear it in the parks.

651
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Which I like.

652
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It feels like I'm going to go Wally nod.

653
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I like how you called it Wally.

654
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Wally.

655
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Isn't that what you're supposed to call it?

656
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I don't think so.

657
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Wally.

658
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Wally.

659
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Wally.

660
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
That's Wally.

661
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It's written out.

662
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Isn't it.

663
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Wally.

664
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Wally.

665
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
That's what I said.

666
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Wally.

667
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
You said Wally.

668
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You like you kind of like edit a little thing.

669
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
God.

670
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
How much of this fucking podcast is how I pronounce this.

671
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It does happen in almost every episode.

672
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
There's one in episode.

673
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Here's Goofy as Sweetie Todd the demon barber of Fleet Street.

674
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
He looks real boring.

675
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Were you in that?

676
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
No I wasn't.

677
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
He looks real like bored.

678
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Goofy usually looks a lot more energetic.

679
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
This guy's not synced up left to right.

680
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Oh my God.

681
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
All of these old men barbers.

682
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Oh my God.

683
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I would kill for a barber parade.

684
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Oh.

685
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Revealing false hair.

686
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Yep.

687
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
That's a toupee.

688
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I the oldest man I've ever had cut my hair, cut my hair two weeks ago.

689
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
He had to have been 80.

690
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Wow.

691
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Oh right.

692
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You were saying.

693
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Is that a new barber?

694
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I don't know.

695
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I don't know.

696
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I don't know.

697
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I don't know.

698
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I don't know.

699
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I don't know.

700
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I don't know.

701
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I don't know.

702
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Oh right.

703
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You were saying.

704
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Is that a new barber?

705
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,200
I went to a new place and the woman.

706
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,200
Oh my God.

707
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,200
Pluto has a mustache.

708
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,200
Whoa.

709
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,200
That doesn't seem happy with it.

710
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,200
That's what I want a doll of.

711
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,880
Pluto with a mustache.

712
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,600
And an old man giving him a trim.

713
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,080
Oh he hit his head on the pole.

714
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,080
He's stuck.

715
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,080
Oh no.

716
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,840
This is that unpolished parade.

717
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,840
Yeah.

718
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,000
That the Meghan Trainor era does not give you.

719
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,800
Also Disney would never allow old people on camera nowadays.

720
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,800
Yeah.

721
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
These are all old people.

722
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
Julie Andrews or Dick Van Dyke.

723
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
That's it.

724
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,000
It has to be a nostalgia old person.

725
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Yeah.

726
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
A franchise old person.

727
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,400
Oh here we go.

728
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
Alan Thicken is propped.

729
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,120
I was thinking this was going to close the whole show but we're getting it now so it

730
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,600
must be like dynamite by the end.

731
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,640
There must be a big number to close.

732
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,280
They're like let's get it over with.

733
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,280
This is the.

734
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,280
I haven't.

735
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,280
Oh look at this.

736
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,280
This is why he was not asked back.

737
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,280
He definitely.

738
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,280
He drinks like this hand nodding.

739
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,280
He might be a little loaded.

740
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,760
He also though.

741
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,760
The white is special guests on these.

742
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,760
Well it was the 80s.

743
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,480
He also.

744
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,200
By the time Samuel Wright the voice of Sebastian started showing up finally there was one black

745
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,080
person in the business fold.

746
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,080
Yeah.

747
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,160
There might have been a Nell Carter or two in the 70s.

748
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:41,800
Alan Thicke definitely is like I remember like dads who really thought they were funny.

749
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
Yeah.

750
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,160
Oh man they do a whole thing.

751
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,280
And.

752
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,720
And a title card.

753
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,720
Wow.

754
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,200
And this is actually good.

755
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
Never mind.

756
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
I like the only part.

757
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,760
I watched the Brown Derby.

758
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
It's frustrating.

759
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,760
I'll tell you that.

760
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,760
No way.

761
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,760
I don't believe it.

762
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,760
I'm.

763
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,760
Yeah.

764
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:10,520
I'll host if you give me a number.

765
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,920
He appears to be said to every production.

766
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,120
Yes.

767
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,000
He's wearing evening wear at like 6 a.m.

768
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,880
Clearly shut for the park open.

769
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,880
We're losing daylight.

770
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,040
Hurry get the car out of there.

771
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,520
Is wave wave harder.

772
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,800
Did he ever do this.

773
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,640
Like was he on Broadway ever or is this just sort of like a whim.

774
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,080
He had music was always part of the Alan Thicke lore.

775
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,160
He of course wrote facts of life.

776
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,160
Right.

777
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,360
Their songs he wrote his own theme song for his show.

778
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:47,360
I'm a big fan of the Alan Thicke.

779
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,320
This is my least favorite Alan Thicke musical number far behind the immortal sweaty and

780
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,360
hot from the 1987 aerobics championships.

781
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:01,120
Sweaty and hot like the McGruff songs we've covered before it.

782
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,480
A jam.

783
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,120
Look up sweaty and hot and get.

784
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,360
Don't ever watch this again.

785
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,280
Watch sweaty and hot two times instead.

786
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:17,040
I. Baby I got some muscle for you.

787
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,080
There's another Alan Thicke musical number that I mean he like sang and played guitar

788
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,440
on the show all the time.

789
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,160
Yeah yeah.

790
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,160
Constantly.

791
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:39,080
Why am I freezing.

792
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,080
I won't dance.

793
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,080
Don't ask me.

794
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,080
OK.

795
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,080
Wow.

796
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,080
Kristen Wiig.

797
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,080
Don't make me sing.

798
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,000
It's like a 20 tap dancing Maryland's.

799
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,840
This is this is to use in a comedy turn.

800
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:56,280
This bumps for me a little because it was it was people in Easter where but now it's

801
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,200
Maryland but then all the guys are in white.

802
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,280
You would have been into this as a kid I think right.

803
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,280
Yeah.

804
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,280
Maybe not because of the.

805
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,440
Well it was in factually incorrect.

806
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,440
Oh.

807
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,160
They're crossing eras mother.

808
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,280
Because I like all this old time crap now but as a kid this would have just I would

809
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,800
have zoned right out of this time.

810
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
Now this.

811
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,800
Well I think it's I think fun weird stuff is fun and I appreciate the kitchiness of

812
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,760
it and obviously I know this is not like a great Busby Berkeley musical number.

813
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,760
I like.

814
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,400
Well this I like putting on the red.

815
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,400
I love it.

816
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,400
I love it.

817
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,760
Putting on the thick.

818
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,880
I like this shit more than like let's go to the sock hop with a milkshake.

819
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,120
There's more like in terms of standards.

820
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:52,360
I think I think going to John Brian made me start to enjoy your you know your group porters

821
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,240
and your Gershwin's and your stuff.

822
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,240
Scott Joplin.

823
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,240
Yeah.

824
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,240
Rags.

825
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,240
I like rags.

826
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,600
I take a rag over this or over a bebop any day.

827
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
Yeah.

828
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
But like I want to do a rag.

829
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,720
I like I can breeze through a little Richard greatest hits.

830
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,200
That's pretty fun and that's all pretty simple.

831
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,400
I would rather it's.

832
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,680
Yeah.

833
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,400
This is so expensive.

834
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,160
I will never work on a production as expensive as what we just watched.

835
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,160
Yeah right.

836
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
Doesn't exist anymore.

837
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,360
Also what did that have to do with Easter.

838
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:31,400
Well I think was because it was an older song but then it had a resurgence in the 80s with

839
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,400
that.

840
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,200
Frankenstein.

841
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,200
No.

842
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,200
Taco.

843
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Yeah.

844
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,200
Oh.

845
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,040
So that was a crossover.

846
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,640
That was something for everyone.

847
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,240
I talk about is I think that I like that taco putting on the ritz from the 80s until it

848
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,040
gets to God a dance.

849
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,880
God dance.

850
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,120
Well that's like a during Broadway melody from singing singing in the rain.

851
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,120
Oh so that's like.

852
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,120
Oh yeah.

853
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:09,800
That's the big musical number that they used to show in the queue for great movie ride

854
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:15,160
when you see Gene Kelly singing God a dance God a dance and everyone running around him.

855
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,600
That's a sequence from singing in the rain that day within podcasts the right you do

856
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:23,880
a personal podcast of explaining thing anything before 1950 to both of us.

857
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,880
Sure.

858
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,880
Yeah.

859
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,880
Because it's all a mush.

860
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,920
I mean and streaming doesn't really help whether you got to go to criteria channel or can't

861
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,440
appear something to find the any old stuff.

862
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,040
Well view boo's got some some 50s.

863
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,840
Well view boo's got some great stuff.

864
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,840
They are the libraries.

865
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:45,880
We are here detective from 1949 only on magic drum.

866
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,840
What do you do for realistic bunny.

867
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,160
I had a not cute bunny in the graphic.

868
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,840
I had a roommate in college who was in I forget the name of the it was a drum in bugle corps

869
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:59,400
and it's like what you have to audition into and there's only like I don't know 12 or 20

870
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
somebody will correct me.

871
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,200
A small amount in the country and it's insane.

872
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,200
They're insane.

873
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:12,840
They're like insane like I don't think they get paid a little bit but it's also like musical

874
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:18,760
theater nerds extreme like ride or die drum and bugle corps.

875
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:23,080
Once you're in you're always in forever and you go back and do after college.

876
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,080
What do you do.

877
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,760
You get a job teaching band in high school.

878
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,760
OK.

879
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,600
Even as a high school I was like what's what about there's like three sports you can play

880
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:37,360
professionally or like you then you teach your coach and Jim I guess so high school

881
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,760
or junior high.

882
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:45,360
I would like to see the don't think twice type movie about the drum and bugle corps

883
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,960
in their 30s wondering like what are we doing.

884
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,600
I mean what even is after this right.

885
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:57,480
You know I hadn't thought of don't think twice and at least one fiscal quarter and now I

886
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,480
am mad.

887
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,080
I'm sorry.

888
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:08,040
But now you're flashing back to all your favorite memories touching the rock for good luck before

889
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,400
going out and doing the show.

890
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,840
What is it called.

891
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,840
Weekend Live.

892
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,840
Yeah.

893
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,840
Weekend Live.

894
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,160
Which was we can tell from the photos on the wall was hosted by Daniel Radcliffe.

895
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,040
I think Paul Rudd hosted Weekend Live.

896
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,040
Sure.

897
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,760
We're in the movie we're watching Lena Dunham hosting Weekend Live.

898
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,800
She's pretty big.

899
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,360
Fuck mythology.

900
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,600
OK. So that was a good.

901
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,680
That was a perfect moment to do that because literally on screen was just women waving

902
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,680
slowly on screen.

903
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,560
It looked like a still photograph.

904
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,920
They were moving so slowly.

905
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,240
She would rather watch women waving slowly than don't think twice.

906
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,240
Yeah absolutely.

907
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,240
I would.

908
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,440
Just that is what movies were like in the 30s.

909
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,000
Right. Just one shot of a woman waving for.

910
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Yeah.

911
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,640
Or if it was an exciting one people were coming in and out of rooms and mixing drinks.

912
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,720
If they could handle the frame rate of it.

913
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,720
Yeah.

914
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,160
It might blow out the camera to open a door.

915
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,160
Sure.

916
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,720
That woman almost tripped I think the pink flower.

917
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,200
Accidents would happen.

918
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,200
These things are great.

919
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:20,080
That Mickey special which we ended up liking a lot even though we thought we might hate

920
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,080
it.

921
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,080
Yeah.

922
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,640
It's still edited to the point of it feels gross.

923
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,040
It's not gross but it feels weird because they've cut around any little hiccup in the

924
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,360
production and they hate it.

925
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,840
And they like sweeten everything with fake applause and fake cheering.

926
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,840
Yeah.

927
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,760
That's that polish I was talking about where it's like this isn't the stuff we like.

928
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,400
We like it but it's a little messy.

929
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,720
You want Mickey to trip a little bit.

930
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,520
Speaking of messy I have watched this performance by the Mickey Mouse Club.

931
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,480
This is the 90s Mickey Mouse Club.

932
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,480
This is a level of precision that wouldn't be accepted by the the Lou Pearlman.

933
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,480
Oh my god.

934
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,480
Lou is later.

935
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,080
Like look how not synced up they are.

936
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:07,840
They're all wearing like five layers of unbreathable fabric and 85 degree weather.

937
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,840
And they're like lip lip syncing.

938
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:19,040
Wade Robson would not be pleased with this level of non-synchronicity.

939
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,040
Kenny Ortega.

940
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,040
Oh yeah.

941
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,040
He would be upset.

942
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,040
They're all fired.

943
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,840
Like truly it's not good.

944
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,040
Yeah it's like.

945
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,840
This is the first segment for anyone who is a child in 1990.

946
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,200
This is the first segment that would.

947
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,520
Well for you you liked putting on the ritz but.

948
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,560
Yes I was a weirdo.

949
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,360
I liked 90s Mickey Mouse Club.

950
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,240
I wouldn't see this is also with me as well.

951
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,880
I wouldn't have been into this.

952
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,920
Because I know if I was that when I was like what six years old when this era.

953
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,840
Disney because it wasn't a Disney song I think I wouldn't have been because my mom

954
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,600
wouldn't let me listen to like new music.

955
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:03,640
So I knew if I kind of had that too.

956
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,520
But what have how did it how did it break that play out.

957
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,200
Well it just that at a certain at a certain point my sister started listening to the radio

958
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,560
in like 95 or 96 and 97.

959
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:21,200
So then we started my mom started to get into like Matchbox 20 and Love Fool by the Cardigans.

960
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,240
It's a good gateway.

961
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:27,280
So yeah so then she would sort of back and so she knows like she has now a five year

962
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,600
period in the later 90s that she does know also.

963
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:37,080
So she goes from the 60s and 70s right to the late 90s and a little into the 2000s and

964
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,120
then she's done she's got no context.

965
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:45,000
You know how my dad and Nick Mundy's dad both like Maroon 5.

966
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,160
I know the only band post 2000 acceptable to.

967
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,480
I think I did that but I think I was combining those in my head.

968
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,280
That's what it's it's the early Maroon 5 it's not like moves like Jagger.

969
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:03,560
Well yeah my dad like last year said you know that band does that you know this love is

970
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,760
taken and I'm like yeah that's an old song.

971
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,720
Yeah it's like 2003 I think at this point.

972
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,560
Enough time is like dad the beginning of the Beatles to the end of the Beatles could have

973
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,840
fit in that run twice.

974
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,800
That's how old this love is.

975
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,120
Mike Schaumburg is the town that they based Footloose on right.

976
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,120
Yeah.

977
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,480
They wouldn't want you dancing.

978
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,200
Well if you look at the Facebook group the Schaumburg Facebook group it's mostly alt

979
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,200
right so.

980
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,200
Not everyone.

981
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:36,480
The Concerned Citizens Council of Schaumburg.

982
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,600
I'm glad you don't defend your town like Mitch and Quincy.

983
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,600
Oh yeah like Mitch he's always up against the ropes.

984
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,600
Yeah.

985
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,160
Fighting in vain.

986
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,440
You know look when you grow up in a safe suburb you got to invent your own.

987
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,800
A town of bold terror the whole Bolger clan.

988
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,920
That being said I should probably edit this out because I need to get those little Caesars

989
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,800
playland pictures from these people.

990
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,920
That's why I joined the Facebook group so I'm going to.

991
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,360
How much could that crossover be.

992
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,240
Yeah that's true.

993
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,880
I just want to get some good pics before we do that episode about Little Caesars.

994
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,000
You could just bleep the original the what your original source is.

995
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
This is Patreon it's fine.

996
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,960
Look at that the Mickey.

997
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:16,960
Hell yeah.

998
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,800
I always liked pointing this out to anyone within earshot that there is a giant hit the

999
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,440
biggest hidden Mickey of all at Disney MGM studios.

1000
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:31,120
One is one ear is a lake and one is painted arbitrarily in a circle.

1001
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,120
I like that.

1002
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:38,520
I know we've talked about how we're not like so into these hidden Mickey's but that's fun.

1003
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,280
When I realized it on the map.

1004
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,360
Scott you would point that out and then the Monsignor would be like no it's not three

1005
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,360
o'clock yet.

1006
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,520
We're still solid.

1007
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,320
Still quiet time.

1008
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:56,720
I notice you are not weeping my son.

1009
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:01,520
He's not all the way up the hill yet.

1010
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:06,160
I think if I remember correctly he was by two o'clock and then the last hour was it

1011
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,400
was just dying with modern technology.

1012
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,040
You know how like hours the saddest of all where they have like Santa tracker now sort

1013
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,560
of like online or like Jesus.

1014
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,560
All right.

1015
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,560
I'll stop talking.

1016
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,400
Oh the Spears coming up the spirit in the ribs.

1017
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:28,280
This is like niche enough behind the paywall enough that people are OK with our sacrilegiousness

1018
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,680
and are just goofing around.

1019
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,560
Are sat talking about the racism profile of Schomburg.

1020
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:43,800
I mean a lot about this is making me happy too because I'm flashing down six music.

1021
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,280
I should just I really need to make the best of thick playlist because they're sweaty and

1022
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,320
hot. I will begrudgingly put putting on the ritz on it.

1023
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:56,200
But he also sings his own theme song of thick of the night which is neck and neck with

1024
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,720
Oh yeah yeah.

1025
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,920
Oddly good corporate 80s theme song.

1026
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,920
Better better.

1027
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:10,120
OK better lead singing theme song thick of Alan Thicke singing thick of the night or

1028
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:15,720
Kelsey Grammer singing tossing salad and scrambled eggs for my taste thick of the night.

1029
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,640
OK I think Alan thinks of more.

1030
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:23,720
It's like a joke that Kelsey Grammer saying Alan Thicke is a passable 80s more palatable.

1031
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,720
Yeah yeah yeah I think so.

1032
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,000
Why is that mama don't turn the light on.

1033
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,120
I'm out of control tonight.

1034
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,720
Why is he's looking up.

1035
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,920
Why is the bunny behind them so dirty.

1036
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,600
No I think that's the color it's supposed to be and said he looks like truffles.

1037
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,680
He does look like he's great.

1038
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,880
You're probably right. But to me he looks dirty.

1039
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,240
He looks like a dirty bunny.

1040
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,560
OK so we're going to Disneyland.

1041
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,720
Oh my gosh.

1042
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,400
I like this actually.

1043
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:10,280
Jason before we started recording you asked one of us to explain Buster Point Dexter and

1044
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,720
I was like I bet I could do that.

1045
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,360
I know he was in the New York Dolls.

1046
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,200
You said that and then I was like I'm out of facts.

1047
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,040
I'd have no more one or two hits.

1048
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,600
He had one or two solo hits but I don't think I get him.

1049
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,280
This poor girl by the way who had to be in front of him on the single log.

1050
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:38,680
It's so funny how like Tuxedo at a certain point became like that means you're an entertainer.

1051
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:45,240
Like that's like it's a rat pack hold over it because like it is like evening wear or formal

1052
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,320
occasion wedding wear.

1053
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:54,640
You know what would be scary is going down Splash Mountain in like a big character suit.

1054
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,280
Yeah and a lot of them had to do it.

1055
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:56,520
Yeah.

1056
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,480
To promote.

1057
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,680
Like every week they were sending characters down.

1058
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,840
But I would just be like so disoriented in there.

1059
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,480
Oh my gosh.

1060
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,920
It's Easter time.

1061
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:16,480
Another thing I know about Buster Point Dexter is that for when the Dana Carvey Phil Hartman

1062
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,040
era of SNL began he was in the band every week.

1063
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,080
He was.

1064
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:26,480
They said the G.G. Smith and the Saturday Night Live band with Buster Point Dexter.

1065
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,120
Wow.

1066
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,880
He was in it like for like a whole half a season.

1067
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,400
You had to like and you probably to sit through a Buster Point Dexter song.

1068
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:43,400
I think maybe he and Sigourney Weaver sing like baby it's cold outside in the beginning

1069
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,440
of that era in the first episode.

1070
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,880
I don't know anything about that.

1071
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,720
It's a really I only know from Comedy Central reruns.

1072
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,200
So he was so like inflatable.

1073
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,120
It was cool in some throwback way I guess.

1074
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:02,480
He was the Sean Arnav his time like Brian Setzer like yeah.

1075
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,600
Big pompadour but it's from like the 50s but it's the 80s.

1076
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,360
But then why.

1077
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:11,760
Walk Ogins biopic walk Ogins in Buster Point Dexter biopic going because I feel like he

1078
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,840
would do that.

1079
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,000
Justice.

1080
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,320
Yeah this is Marty grab floats party.

1081
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,640
Yeah these wonderful.

1082
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,880
Are these balloons just gone or do they exist somewhere.

1083
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,080
Do balloons like this last.

1084
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:30,920
They just dissolve at a certain point or are they just like they're in like a lake somewhere.

1085
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,640
That feels like Mickey shirt.

1086
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,840
Not a thing you see in parades anymore at the parks is inflatable floats.

1087
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,120
Yeah.

1088
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,800
Like I loved how tall they were.

1089
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,480
Yeah I like that.

1090
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:45,640
There was that the patent for drones that could carry like big puppets down Main Street.

1091
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:50,200
Remember a year or two ago there were like drones could like essentially puppet a giant

1092
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,200
puppet down Main Street.

1093
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,360
They're having a lot of issues trying to figure out how to use drones without putting them

1094
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,920
directly over people's heads.

1095
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,440
Yeah it's illegal to do that I think.

1096
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:04,560
And they just debuted those drones at Universal.

1097
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,280
Yeah those looked great.

1098
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,240
Point Dexter truly is one of the great filmographies.

1099
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,080
I mean legitimately with Scrooge.

1100
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:13,600
Right.

1101
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:13,800
Right.

1102
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,880
It's Scrooge.

1103
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,680
Then you got Mr. Nanny.

1104
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,520
Car 54 Where Are You.

1105
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,520
The movie.

1106
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,200
And Free Jack.

1107
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,080
Wow.

1108
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:26,400
I feel like I know more about Free Jack than a lot of people and I don't remember him at

1109
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,800
all.

1110
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:33,680
And of course when he was David Johansson Johansson's legs appeared in John Lennon and

1111
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,080
Yoko Ono's 1971 film Up Your Legs Forever.

1112
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:38,960
Have you heard of that.

1113
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,240
Never.

1114
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:39,520
No.

1115
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,000
The fuck.

1116
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,800
I don't know what that is.

1117
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,840
Forever.

1118
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:46,320
Oh they're singing hot hot hot and he's got a frilly carnival kind of outfit on.

1119
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:46,800
Isn't.

1120
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,280
Now this.

1121
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:47,920
Hot hot hot.

1122
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,240
What does this have to do with Easter.

1123
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,880
I think this was just a popular song at the time.

1124
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,000
Yeah how many was this.

1125
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,120
Goofy sang hot hot hot on one of when we were looking through the Blizzard Beach.

1126
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,680
Me soul on fire.

1127
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,200
Who sang that originally.

1128
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,000
Does Disney own the publishing to hot hot hot.

1129
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,480
Maybe they bought it in a merger somewhere and like we got to use the hell out of this.

1130
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,280
I do remember it being around party grow a lot.

1131
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,320
1982.

1132
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,000
Recorded by Arrow.

1133
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,480
Is that the right.

1134
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:22,880
I don't know.

1135
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,120
Song an instant dance floor hit.

1136
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:29,520
A leader covered in 87 by Buster Poindexter.

1137
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,560
So this was one of his.

1138
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,000
He had a hit with this.

1139
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:32,480
Yeah.

1140
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:32,800
Yeah.

1141
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,600
That's what I know.

1142
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,440
I didn't know that.

1143
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,920
But why I didn't realize this was Buster.

1144
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,760
Sound is like a late 80s early 90s reference that's funny to like Yahoo serious.

1145
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,760
Like I really don't know much about Yahoo serious besides that Simpsons joke.

1146
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,000
Yeah.

1147
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:54,080
And unlike some things have become too kitschy and obvious to make a joke about.

1148
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:58,080
But no hipster has resurrected Buster Poindexter for any.

1149
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:58,560
Yeah.

1150
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:03,440
But it's not true Jim Carrey and the way he currently lives his life seems a lot

1151
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,840
like this insane.

1152
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,720
Have you seen these paintings.

1153
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,800
He's demolishing Trump with his water.

1154
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:22,800
I feel like Buster Poindexter is acting like mid 90s Jim Carrey or something like a character.

1155
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,560
Your mouth is too big sir.

1156
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,000
Close that mouth a few notches.

1157
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,800
He has a bigger mouth than those balloons.

1158
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:41,360
If I remember correctly this goes they do another hot hot hot after.

1159
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,600
There's another hot hot hot on this.

1160
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,720
Or maybe I'm thinking that they did the party grass song twice.

1161
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,400
Did you see party grow listen.

1162
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,840
More like an instrumental version.

1163
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,440
No it's no.

1164
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:01,840
Back to what just play the party ground or wait is this in the party girl party.

1165
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,280
They were saying I'm sure because they were singing party grow at the start.

1166
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,640
Scott did you see in Japan the party grow show that's party grow show.

1167
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,120
No.

1168
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:13,520
Okay because I think they do I think they do hot hot hot in that as well.

1169
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:18,480
I'm glad they kept the party name alive in that's where Donald and Jose were

1170
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,400
fluffing each other's butts before they went out.

1171
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,280
Oh right.

1172
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,320
And I have pictures of it.

1173
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,960
Like like in all that jazz when he says each showtime folks before every day.

1174
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,400
Mm hmm.

1175
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,920
They were just touching each other's butts.

1176
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:39,520
This is this song is like I'm a really big fan of Todd Rundgren but he did the song

1177
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:46,000
bang the drum all day that just sucks but to me and I don't like I don't I can't imagine

1178
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:54,720
listening to bang the drum all day or hot hot hot willingly and like love shack lives to me as a

1179
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,920
more that's a song you might listen to more of a song there but these are just pure novelties.

1180
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:06,160
Sound like a it's coming from a guy who wants to work I would rather bang on the drum all day.

1181
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,200
I just can't relate to the song.

1182
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:11,700
Right.

1183
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,840
You just love working.

1184
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:20,560
I do I don't want to play I want to bang on a typewriter all day.

1185
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:28,240
You do exhaustingly write your scripts with a typewriter and it's incredibly inconvenient.

1186
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,320
One mistake I gotta throw it all out.

1187
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,680
Like Quentin Tarantino does that.

1188
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,800
He refuses to use white alda.

1189
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,080
I think he does do that.

1190
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:36,960
That's probably right.

1191
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,200
An assistant then type it into a final draft.

1192
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,800
It tells a lot of VHS right.

1193
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,080
There's that dirty rabbit again.

1194
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,680
I can't have a blotch okay.

1195
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,320
If there's a blotch then it might be a blotch when I'm making the film okay.

1196
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,600
I'll be a blotch my brain.

1197
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,280
I'll be a brain around.

1198
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,840
Try fade in if you don't like final draft.

1199
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,840
Like try there's lots of options.

1200
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,640
Writer duet.

1201
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,480
They got a lot more on brand with these aerials later.

1202
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,080
Yeah this doesn't the hair might not be the right color.

1203
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,200
No I feel like today they have got it.

1204
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:09,600
Yeah.

1205
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,520
On there's style guidelines.

1206
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,240
That also just looks like a bra they spray paint in.

1207
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,400
Not real shell like.

1208
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:18,960
Here we go.

1209
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:25,680
Why focus why have so much hot hot hot when you've made up your own better hot hot hot

1210
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,920
with under the sea that you own.

1211
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:34,640
Right between the two no question there's similar songs calypso light.

1212
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:38,560
For sure I mean I assume they were pushing Buster Poindexter hard.

1213
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,600
He probably was in the family whatever label they owned.

1214
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,080
So maybe that was something.

1215
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,640
Don't forget they owned Queen at the time.

1216
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,440
Yeah right right.

1217
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,760
I would it would be interesting to know what was slowly walking.

1218
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,000
Yeah.

1219
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,520
Flounder has legs.

1220
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,400
Oh my god.

1221
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,400
Flounder should not have.

1222
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:01,520
Later in Sebastian definitely seen like feeling the effects of 85 degree weather.

1223
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:06,000
Flounder has evolved to the point of having legs so he can be on land.

1224
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,160
Oh my god Ursula here.

1225
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,440
Why is she even like this thing.

1226
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,680
She's in the she behind.

1227
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,880
She's the best in like she's like keeping an eye on.

1228
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,560
Learning their weaknesses.

1229
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:24,240
It is always interesting like sometimes I feel like they're do they're using the

1230
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,800
characters after the movie like yeah and sometimes obviously these have to be before

1231
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:33,680
this is before all this stuff went down in Little Mermaid but then other characters it

1232
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,080
feels like well they're in their like final form.

1233
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:41,280
Well remember the Little Mermaid TV series where like she's back a mermaid again she's

1234
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,320
got a dipshit friend or brother no Prince Eric right but that's like a prequel.

1235
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,440
Wasn't it sucks.

1236
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,400
Is it a prequel.

1237
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:48,960
I don't know.

1238
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,240
It's like Lion King one and a half where it exists between.

1239
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:52,880
Oh yeah.

1240
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,760
Of events of.

1241
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,560
Nice you want to.

1242
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,240
Is blue.

1243
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,640
He's just a real shirtless boy.

1244
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,320
Is he barefoot.

1245
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,160
Did he do a flip concrete.

1246
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,520
He just he might have done like a cool.

1247
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,400
Oh he's got shoes.

1248
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:14,480
Disney rescued this kid from the Manudo factory.

1249
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,480
They they adopted him.

1250
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,240
Yeah he's fake shirtless never mind.

1251
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,640
Oh yeah yeah yeah sure he's also 50.

1252
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,720
He's a stunt performer come here.

1253
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,360
Oh oh.

1254
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:30,560
The big.

1255
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:31,200
Oh King.

1256
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:31,760
Whoa.

1257
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,320
Whoa.

1258
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,600
Holy crap.

1259
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,320
Killing it.

1260
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:34,640
Damn.

1261
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:35,600
Wow.

1262
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,520
Oh my gosh look he's getting down.

1263
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:42,800
Off the float had to somersault while staying ahead of it.

1264
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,920
On hot concrete.

1265
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,120
Snow White is her favorite.

1266
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,840
Yeah I was I was obsessed with the dwarves.

1267
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,800
I'm sure I've said this before.

1268
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:56,720
Obsessed with them.

1269
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,640
How did that manifest.

1270
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,840
Well I wanted their figure I've told this story I think before where my dad I asked.

1271
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,320
For him when I was sick wants to get.

1272
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:06,960
Oh.

1273
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,120
So that's funny he's high as crap.

1274
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,320
I asked him to go and get me figure seven dwarves figures when I was sick once and my mom was like

1275
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,120
they don't make those.

1276
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:23,200
We've looked and my dad found seven little ninjas and he goes these are the ninja dwarves here you go.

1277
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:24,960
That's an upgrade.

1278
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,720
And I bought it too I was like cool.

1279
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,040
Good idea.

1280
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,680
And then eventually they were making like high quality figures and by the time my sister

1281
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:39,520
was born and she got these awesome plastic seven dwarves I was obsessed with the colors.

1282
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,160
Where your sister's younger.

1283
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,760
She was listening to rock music before you.

1284
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,280
Yeah a little bit earlier yeah.

1285
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,960
She got she was younger.

1286
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:49,460
Yeah.

1287
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,120
That's true.

1288
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,040
I was just picturing an older sibling.

1289
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:53,360
Oh yeah.

1290
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,360
And you on to rock music the way it works.

1291
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,400
Would make a lot of sense.

1292
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,360
But it's your little sister telling you about TLC.

1293
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,960
Yeah basically I mean it's a little after TLC.

1294
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:09,600
It's like it's right around the time of like Lilith Sonny Came Home Lilith Fair.

1295
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:14,400
It's kind of when I started poking my head out into like do I like popular music and I'm like

1296
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,720
trying to find an end to Paula Cole.

1297
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,920
Yeah where have all the cowboys gone.

1298
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:26,560
My dad got Ace of Base the sign when you were as a stocking stuffer and I do we duplicated that

1299
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,160
because I really like that album.

1300
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,360
After that it was like a one two punch of musicals and they might be giants.

1301
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,600
So the my life path was just kind of laid out in front of me.

1302
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,120
Like all right you're a nerd and you're gonna be an actor.

1303
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,320
You like a band that's popular but only with weirdos.

1304
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,760
Good luck finding them.

1305
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,560
Godspeed to you.

1306
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:50,080
You know them from the Tiny Tunes music video.

1307
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,160
What is on Howie's belt.

1308
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,200
Malcolm in the Middle.

1309
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,240
Malcolm in the Middle theme.

1310
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,720
What is that hanging off of his belt.

1311
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,840
It's a fanny pack.

1312
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:58,800
Is it.

1313
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,360
I think so.

1314
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:12,800
Once Aaron was on an elevator at the MGM Grand and Howie Mandel was playing there and she was

1315
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,960
making fun of Howie Mandel out loud the idea of him and then the elevator stopped and he got on

1316
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,440
the elevator right at that second.

1317
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,320
But he didn't hear.

1318
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,040
I don't believe so.

1319
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:23,680
Well that's good.

1320
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,440
Or he's held a grudge.

1321
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:33,040
My lack of progress in the entertainment industry is due to arm of the silent angry arm of Mandel.

1322
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:33,600
Oh man.

1323
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,160
Blocking me.

1324
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,280
There was soundstage with Steven Weber.

1325
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,560
Oh yeah.

1326
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,840
Did you say cut real quick.

1327
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,720
He's running a muck in this place.

1328
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,280
Yeah.

1329
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,480
They don't know what hit him.

1330
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,000
This is honestly this makes the most sense.

1331
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,800
Like this is just showing off of.

1332
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,240
The new part.

1333
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:02,880
Yeah right.

1334
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,160
Like I get this.

1335
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,520
I get why this is happening.

1336
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,160
I don't understand why hot hot hot went out for 12 minutes.

1337
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:15,440
All right I guess if Easter is just Easter equals fancy clothes I guess that's the justification

1338
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,440
of that dancing guy.

1339
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,240
What did he say.

1340
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,000
Oh bungalows.

1341
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:28,160
That actually was my reaction to seeing production facilities on this tour in the early 90s.

1342
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,680
Yeah I was lit up.

1343
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,920
I did this tram so many times.

1344
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:34,720
Yeah sure.

1345
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:38,400
Saw the van from honey I blew up the kid.

1346
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,360
I was very into this.

1347
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:39,920
Yeah.

1348
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:40,880
Interior of the.

1349
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:41,360
What.

1350
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,000
I was like.

1351
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,560
I was like.

1352
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:43,280
I was like.

1353
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:44,000
I was like.

1354
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:44,640
I was like.

1355
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,280
I was like.

1356
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:45,840
I was like.

1357
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,200
Interior of the.

1358
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,080
What.

1359
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:48,720
That's not.

1360
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,640
That's a good guy.

1361
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,640
He's on the tram and then he's on the tree.

1362
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,280
That's a great.

1363
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,160
That will be the funniest moment of this special.

1364
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,720
Was this do you think this was written at all or it was just like how let how we go.

1365
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,520
Let's just see what.

1366
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,640
That guy had to be planned unless they went back and did it.

1367
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:04,960
Yeah.

1368
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:06,400
Whether the.

1369
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:07,840
Unhonored.

1370
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,640
Unhonored.

1371
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,640
Fake rocks of catastrophe canyon.

1372
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:12,640
They're just look.

1373
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,280
If cars is.

1374
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,600
There's the same type of rocks as cars and cars are better.

1375
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:18,640
Yeah.

1376
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:19,840
I just have like.

1377
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:20,240
Nostalgia.

1378
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,000
It was also one of the ones we were talking about it's like oh most of these are still around.

1379
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,800
This is gone.

1380
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,600
Gone fake rocks could be an.

1381
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,480
Still there.

1382
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:33,280
Oh no I guess they're done with the backstage tour in Paris but there was a catastrophe canyon in Paris.

1383
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:34,720
I didn't do it.

1384
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,560
Because apparently the tram tour there you go see the sets of the movie rain of fire.

1385
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,240
A Christian Bale.

1386
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,200
Oh right.

1387
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:43,920
They.

1388
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,040
Is this unfamiliar to me.

1389
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:49,600
John Lennon leg movie Jim and Len talked about that movie the whole studios park is

1390
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,960
catastrophe canyon right.

1391
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,320
It's just a big catastrophe.

1392
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:57,040
Just like that movie I think that movie they were banking on being a big hit and it.

1393
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,080
Only made millions of dollars.

1394
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:07,280
So this is how we at what is is he off the show what show was he on again the hospital show.

1395
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:08,240
St.

1396
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,440
Elsewhere.

1397
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,560
Is that over at this point.

1398
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,720
Maybe.

1399
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,880
He was probably doing the tonight show a lot.

1400
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:15,920
Yeah.

1401
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,960
On his way to Bobby's world.

1402
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:21,280
Yeah.

1403
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,080
He also has obsessive compulsive disorder like Mark Summers.

1404
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:26,320
Yeah.

1405
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,560
That always bugged me out as a kid when I learned that I was like where did these guys go.

1406
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,680
I don't know if that's why they I don't know if that's why how he was missing for a while.

1407
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,200
Mark Summers.

1408
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,600
Mark Summers it kind of hurt his career because people assumed he was difficult.

1409
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:42,960
Yeah.

1410
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:47,600
Like people talk like oh I hear that guy's something's like he feels like he got a bad

1411
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:51,040
reputation because of what is ultimately a pretty minor thing.

1412
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:51,200
I.

1413
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,160
Got a couple there and I've seen that.

1414
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:54,400
Yeah.

1415
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,440
We have to get him on the show.

1416
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,160
I would love to.

1417
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:57,920
That's a dream.

1418
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,480
Okay more ads for the title is so pretty.

1419
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,840
Oh is there a hot hot hot here too.

1420
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:09,680
God willing.

1421
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:14,720
But you consider you think like the Mickey Mouse Club doing escapade was too like grown up

1422
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,520
for you.

1423
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,960
Well I'm not I'm just saying for I know what I was like as a little kid.

1424
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:24,320
But you wouldn't have I did like all of I liked MMC a lot by nine and there were I

1425
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,640
I think I thought all their songs were original.

1426
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:30,560
So when I realized wait another band does runaway train.

1427
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:30,880
Right.

1428
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:36,800
Yeah I wasn't like I didn't think it was like I'm trying to think if there's any

1429
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,280
contradiction to this is that Mickey's birthday land.

1430
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,080
Oh boy.

1431
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,360
Oh we were big for sure.

1432
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,320
Birthday land fans.

1433
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,560
I yeah I have very strong memories.

1434
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,240
One step away from the den.

1435
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,400
You're a star you're a fucking star.

1436
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,200
And he stands up.

1437
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:55,600
Yeah.

1438
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,800
Zips in his big mouth hog.

1439
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,120
The gummy bears.

1440
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:05,920
Whoa.

1441
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,360
Why these guys.

1442
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:07,600
Shit.

1443
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,760
The scary way guys.

1444
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,360
I will say there's a great theme song.

1445
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,520
All those all those shows have such great theme songs.

1446
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,880
Ducktales is obviously the best.

1447
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,560
Ducktales and Westview Rangers would stress me out sometimes because I was like they're

1448
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:29,120
going into these adventures without weapons because I was such an action figure kid that

1449
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:32,560
came in action figures came with so many weapons and I was like well they're prepared.

1450
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,880
So this is just yeah this is just promoting the Disney afternoon block.

1451
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,120
Launchpad dancing.

1452
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,960
I don't know why it's like Easter.

1453
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,880
Yeah they tried to meld a couple ideas here.

1454
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,840
Let's like have launchpad and then one of the.

1455
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,760
These are kind of like cheeky versions of Easter dresses.

1456
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:54,160
These are.

1457
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:55,920
Yes.

1458
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,680
A little sexier for daddy.

1459
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,180
Right.

1460
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,360
For screw for uncle screwed.

1461
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:04,160
The men look like newsies the men look like.

1462
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:04,660
Yeah.

1463
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,400
This feels a little more rehearsed than most of the other stuff.

1464
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:09,120
Yeah.

1465
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,880
This feels like the higher quality dancers.

1466
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,080
These are the triple threats.

1467
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:13,540
Right.

1468
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,920
Are you reading the lyrics to the Ducktales theme.

1469
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,240
Now I'm looking I'm trying to remember this the guy who wrote the.

1470
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:21,920
Ducktales theme.

1471
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:23,600
Mark Mark.

1472
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,760
Muller actually.

1473
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,120
I'm reading my own Muller report right now.

1474
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:35,600
None of these are that famous of songs though I'm realizing he wrote for all these big artists

1475
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:39,200
like a heart and Amy Grant and in sync and to barge and.

1476
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,680
But the biggest hit of his was the song called crush by Jennifer page.

1477
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:46,560
Do you remember that song.

1478
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:47,200
I don't think so.

1479
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,720
When you were poking your head into music.

1480
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,280
Just a little crash.

1481
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,000
Oh yes yes.

1482
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,840
That's the Ducktales guy.

1483
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:54,560
Yeah apparently.

1484
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:54,960
Interesting.

1485
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:59,680
This is the poo where it looks like he kind of has a five o'clock shadow on his nose.

1486
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,760
There's a Christopher Robin face.

1487
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,040
Oh yeah you're right.

1488
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:03,920
Walking around.

1489
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,440
Holy crap it's just a boy.

1490
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,480
It's just a boy in a yellow shirt.

1491
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,360
Where is it.

1492
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:09,600
Wait.

1493
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:15,200
But you know I'm saying that poo that coloring on poo snoot is weird.

1494
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,400
They were just talking about snoot.

1495
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,160
So disturbed by snoot.

1496
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:25,120
Yeah it's all I say about Edwin about the dog is I call him is now to snoot.

1497
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,360
It's it's look it up it's right.

1498
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,000
What's Edwin doing right let's do an Edwin check in.

1499
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,760
He's over somewhere else somewhere else.

1500
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,280
I was trying to get him up on the couch but he's.

1501
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,760
Aghunt to aghunt today.

1502
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:36,400
What is that joke.

1503
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,000
Does he misspell things.

1504
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,400
But he's like a professor he's like wearing his cap.

1505
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,640
It doesn't really look like that owl.

1506
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,160
That doesn't look like poo owl.

1507
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:48,160
No that looks like the Tootsie Bro pop owl.

1508
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,440
Yeah tootoo.

1509
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,440
Who sounds like Tigger actually now that I think about it.

1510
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,720
Gadget Dale.

1511
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:55,840
Have I said on the show before.

1512
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,600
Gadget always had to save their asses.

1513
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:02,880
Confirmed or not but somebody said that Chip is dressed like Indiana Jones and Dale is dressed like Magnum P.I.

1514
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,080
Yeah that's a hundred percent.

1515
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:04,960
That's got to be right.

1516
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:10,320
Yeah I was kind of making that observation in Japan because they're pushing these guys in Japan right now.

1517
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:10,640
Yeah.

1518
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,840
The two adventurers of TV at the time.

1519
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:14,160
Yes.

1520
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:20,560
And Gadget was supposed to look like the girl in the movie Real Genius.

1521
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,720
The Val Kilmer movie.

1522
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:22,960
Oh.

1523
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,880
Kind of a crushable dork character.

1524
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,480
That's like a wrestling move.

1525
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:27,600
It all makes sense.

1526
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,960
I know my type.

1527
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,280
You just steal what's popular.

1528
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:34,960
The wrestler Sting is just the crow basically.

1529
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:35,200
Yeah.

1530
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,800
I mean all that you know that Fred Flintstone is.

1531
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,160
Ralph Cramden.

1532
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,040
Jackie Gleason.

1533
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:45,760
Yeah it's a tradition.

1534
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:48,720
That's a big family.

1535
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,600
I like those shirts.

1536
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,960
There's a guy with a turtleneck in the back.

1537
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,320
Family shirts are really good.

1538
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:57,920
That's much better than like hashtag Disney dab or whatever people's shirts say now.

1539
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,440
And I'd like to dress like exactly as Regis is dressed in this.

1540
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,320
Yeah that's fun.

1541
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,600
I would wear that.

1542
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,560
I would wear that too.

1543
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:05,520
Oh but it's love.

1544
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,440
His love is really peeking out.

1545
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,640
He's really close to Mayor from Jaws.

1546
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,880
No anchors on that jacket but very close.

1547
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:13,520
You're right.

1548
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,480
I believe Paula Tompkins has that suit.

1549
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,880
Not the exact suit but got that suit made.

1550
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,280
He has every suit in this special.

1551
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,880
This is not a song I like.

1552
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:23,600
Jackamo.

1553
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,400
What is this song?

1554
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,600
Jackamo.

1555
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,600
It's familiar.

1556
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,760
This was another like late 80s early 90s kind of hit.

1557
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,440
Jackamo.

1558
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,400
Oh yeah.

1559
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:38,560
I'm anxious to do more MMC and I'm not sure how to do it.

1560
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,760
Is it commentaries?

1561
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,120
Is it an episode?

1562
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,480
It looms large when I went to Disney MGM studios.

1563
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,240
God this is where the guys are.

1564
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,120
I'm not sure.

1565
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:47,920
I'm not sure.

1566
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:48,720
I'm not sure.

1567
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:49,440
I'm not sure.

1568
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,760
God this is where the guys work.

1569
01:10:52,960 --> 01:11:00,320
Where all my boys, Dale Godboldo and Ryan Gosling, that cool looking Canadian kid.

1570
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,160
Paula the swimwear has come back around and is fashionable again.

1571
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,200
Yeah I guess that's true.

1572
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:09,760
Wave pool.

1573
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,040
Oh my gosh too fast.

1574
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:11,840
Too fast cuts.

1575
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:12,320
Catch a kitty.

1576
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,200
Great.

1577
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:13,760
Green screen.

1578
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,000
Wow into the water.

1579
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:29,200
Ooh lady it's a classic take off the sunglasses because you cannot believe.

1580
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:29,440
Yep.

1581
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,960
Anything where that happens edited back and forth.

1582
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:35,840
It would be interesting.

1583
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:40,080
What's the first time that's ever happened in a piece of filmed entertainment?

1584
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,760
We discovered that trick.

1585
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,720
I mean I'm sure it's like a net movie or something.

1586
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:45,680
It's like beach party.

1587
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:47,840
Yeah I guess all the.

1588
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,480
80s cool sunglasses guys sort of emanate from.

1589
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,240
Yeah I'm sure there was.

1590
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,080
Whoa check it out.

1591
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:01,920
That's an interesting historical the popularity of Ray Bam sunglasses.

1592
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:06,320
Like there was a point in time where they were not as ubiquitous.

1593
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:11,200
And then I think it's risky business brought them back into the popular consciousness.

1594
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,160
But that company has been bought and sold a few times.

1595
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:14,720
Right.

1596
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:18,800
Why is Goofy with Pinocchio here?

1597
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:23,200
And why does Goofy have beach wear out and Pinocchio is just wearing his regular.

1598
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,280
I think he's wearing slightly shorter shorts.

1599
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,400
Pinocchio.

1600
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,520
I rolled those up.

1601
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,320
And then Tigger has beach wear and Chip and Dale have beach wear.

1602
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,000
Better than 40s uniform.

1603
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,080
But there's no way you put Pinocchio in the water.

1604
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:35,520
Hell no.

1605
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:35,840
Why?

1606
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,200
It would float.

1607
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,760
You put you give him a bath he warps.

1608
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:40,560
Yeah he warps.

1609
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,600
That's a literal joke.

1610
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,240
Waterproofed.

1611
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,000
You want to put a wooden pocket in the water.

1612
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:46,880
You're out of your mind.

1613
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,320
But that's not them.

1614
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:49,920
Why did you use that title there?

1615
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,320
The only place where it would have been appropriate.

1616
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,560
I love that old man eating a hot dog.

1617
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:54,960
Yeah.

1618
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:55,520
Your future.

1619
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,880
That's your favorite Disney character.

1620
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:58,160
Yeah.

1621
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,720
Papa Steve old man eating hot dog.

1622
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,000
And Regis in that one shot.

1623
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:04,240
Yeah.

1624
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,080
Okay.

1625
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:06,880
I mean that looked fun.

1626
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,160
I would want to go there as a kid.

1627
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,800
They did a good job of that.

1628
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,080
My god they did a good job with me always.

1629
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,800
Wooden puppet face down in the wave pool.

1630
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,440
These specials ruined me.

1631
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,040
Look at what I'm doing right now.

1632
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,120
Doing a podcast about them.

1633
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,160
I watched willingly watched 90 minute ads all the time.

1634
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,680
They were my favorite shows.

1635
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,120
I am broken.

1636
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:37,840
You heard it here first.

1637
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,680
Great place says Alan Thicke.

1638
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:46,720
Scott would you rather be one of the beautiful people on their way to Coachella right now?

1639
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:48,800
Where did that already happen?

1640
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,120
Is it their honor in Christ the least?

1641
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,560
I think it's going on right now still.

1642
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,880
It's a two weekend last weekend one.

1643
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:55,520
I believe so.

1644
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:01,120
I cannot think of a place I'd less rather be.

1645
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:07,360
Even if there's like that most I see five bands I'd like to see at Coachella and I'm like I'll

1646
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,120
wait for them to come to me.

1647
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,480
I think I could do it.

1648
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,760
Hold on guys guys.

1649
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,960
Now if they were at Coachella.

1650
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,280
What song is this?

1651
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,520
Oh, it's the annoying.

1652
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:22,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1653
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,160
Those are their scarecrows, but they definitely look like they're on the crosses.

1654
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,040
They're honoring.

1655
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:31,040
I know that's how you hang a scarecrow, but it really looks like extremely.

1656
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,800
You don't have to make it like that though.

1657
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,000
No, that's insane.

1658
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:36,500
Whoa.

1659
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:41,360
Those are four crucified scarecrows.

1660
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,520
If there was three, it'd be really spooky.

1661
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,720
Shall I release Jesus of Nazareth or the scarecrows?

1662
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:49,680
Is that Teddy bear up in the balcony there?

1663
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:50,880
No, that might be the chicken.

1664
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,240
It's claret.

1665
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:53,280
Oh, it's a chicken.

1666
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:55,840
Oh my God.

1667
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,920
Those are scary strangers.

1668
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,920
It's the strangers in an early role.

1669
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,400
Christ's time on the cross was not filled with dance.

1670
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,200
No, that's on that day.

1671
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,000
That's fun.

1672
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,720
Did you guys do square dancing in gym class?

1673
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,480
Wait, we've talked about this before.

1674
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1675
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,000
I guess it was Jim.

1676
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,280
I believe that's a weird thing where they're like, we're going to just

1677
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,520
wage you into the pool of touching each other.

1678
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,680
Yeah, so rock and roll.

1679
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:30,880
Red on those days.

1680
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:35,040
We were in third or fourth grade was when we did it.

1681
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:38,640
So I don't think anyone was really just kind of dip in their toe and even

1682
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,920
thinking about that sort of thing.

1683
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:43,280
Well, I'm just yeah, I'm not saying I'm like I was so

1684
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,080
horny or something.

1685
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,760
I was just it was uncomfortable.

1686
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,680
Have I said on the podcast before how I knew that I was out of step with

1687
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:52,320
people starting to boys and girls starting to like each other?

1688
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:53,920
I don't know.

1689
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:59,600
In fifth grade, I realized that a lot of the kids are like, where is everybody at lunch?

1690
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:05,440
A lot of them were going and playing single out on the playground together.

1691
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,240
Oh my gosh.

1692
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:06,560
Christ.

1693
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,160
They were coordinating.

1694
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,040
That's insane.

1695
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,960
An outdoor singled out.

1696
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,600
I don't know what the prize ultimately was.

1697
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:14,800
They were only 10.

1698
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,560
Gee, what could it have been?

1699
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:20,160
But that was a bunch of 10 year olds all emulating Chris Hardwick.

1700
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,040
That's insane.

1701
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:22,320
Truly.

1702
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,120
Now, no one should emulate Chris Hardwick.

1703
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:26,800
Jesus.

1704
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,200
This is the best.

1705
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,000
I love this.

1706
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,600
Hey, how are you?

1707
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,600
He didn't ask for the kiss like usual.

1708
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,160
Yeah.

1709
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,440
Muckracker Regis.

1710
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:54,800
Cinderella mice.

1711
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,880
I can't tell you.

1712
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:02,800
Erin meeting Suzy and Perla was a precious moment.

1713
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,640
I will cherish this for.

1714
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:05,680
Is there a photo of it too?

1715
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:07,040
I did.

1716
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,320
I is a video.

1717
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,600
I've videoed the whole thing.

1718
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:10,320
That's good.

1719
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:11,520
I've taken screenshots.

1720
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,600
But yeah.

1721
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,960
She said, you're my favorite in the most sincere way.

1722
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:18,560
Oh my God.

1723
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,240
As if she was six.

1724
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:30,640
Then I met Captain Hook and I put up a hook next to him.

1725
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:33,920
He kind of got a kick out of that.

1726
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:38,240
But then he put my hook down dismissively and pointed at his own.

1727
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,240
As if to say number one.

1728
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:41,040
That's great.

1729
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,000
Good character business.

1730
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,200
Well, what is this?

1731
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,160
What is going on?

1732
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,200
Is that Tom Snyder?

1733
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,480
Oh, give kids the world a wonderful charity.

1734
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,480
That might be the founder, the guy who started it.

1735
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:55,760
He looks like Tom Snyder to me.

1736
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,240
So we're not allowed to make fun of anything.

1737
01:17:58,240 --> 01:17:59,120
No jokes.

1738
01:17:59,120 --> 01:17:59,600
All right.

1739
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:03,680
I'm just going to be sad as in the hour of Christ's death.

1740
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:08,480
I think, OK, so I can get I know for a fact they are updating their ice cream parlor

1741
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,640
because I read some stories about it.

1742
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:12,560
They are expanding their ice cream parlor.

1743
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,800
Scoop Scoops dot com.

1744
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,080
On the mouth, I guess.

1745
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:25,440
Oh, all right.

1746
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:28,160
I don't know.

1747
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,280
What do we do?

1748
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:29,760
Yeah, I know.

1749
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,360
They're in a real tough spot here.

1750
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,640
Oh, really tugging on the heartstrings.

1751
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:39,440
They got some Louis Armstrong factoids to express.

1752
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,400
He played on the Mark Twain at Disneyland.

1753
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:44,320
Great charity.

1754
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,280
Still going strong.

1755
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:46,560
Check it out.

1756
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:47,280
Look at Mickey.

1757
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:47,920
It's the world.

1758
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,600
There's Pinocchio.

1759
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,920
There's a big edit in the song.

1760
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:57,680
So we don't have as much of this to do as we thought.

1761
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,800
Oh, but still a little bit of the song.

1762
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:02,720
Still the bridge.

1763
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:03,360
Right.

1764
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,960
Is this the best song on the whole show?

1765
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,080
I think it has to be right.

1766
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,800
I like Descapade.

1767
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,320
You think Escapade is better than this?

1768
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:13,120
I think Escapade is a better song than What a Wonderful World.

1769
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:13,600
Yes.

1770
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:14,800
Well, again, that's interesting.

1771
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,720
I mean, maybe not their version, the song itself.

1772
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:23,600
We'll wait until the record scratch happens in this and they cut to another version of Hot, Hot, Hot.

1773
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,920
Hey, kids, bet you never dreamed you'd meet Buster.

1774
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:30,560
Let's go.

1775
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,760
Din, din, din, din, din, din.

1776
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:42,960
The first time Erin came to take the Universal tour, which began the relationship and marriage,

1777
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:47,360
I said, if people came to take my tour, I was like, anything you want me to,

1778
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,200
any factoids you want to request?

1779
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,280
And she was like, oh, yeah, I loved when I was a kid.

1780
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:56,880
And the tour guides would say this is in old Mexico is where they filmed the Escapade video.

1781
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,960
So I made a point of it for her.

1782
01:19:59,440 --> 01:19:59,920
Wow.

1783
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,120
That's if that's.

1784
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,120
And that cemented the first date happening, I'm sure.

1785
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:03,920
I think it did.

1786
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:07,840
That showed that I was receptive to her demands.

1787
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:08,080
Yeah.

1788
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,560
And you wielded tremendous power.

1789
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:15,520
Speaking of tremendous power, Reeds is still in the outfit.

1790
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,080
Coachman.

1791
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,960
Thick Furious.

1792
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:21,680
Yeah.

1793
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,800
What is that t-shirt the guy's wearing?

1794
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,200
He agreed that that comedy would be entirely on me.

1795
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:25,440
Who is that cat?

1796
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,800
Yeah, I'm trying to figure, well, what is that shirt that gentleman is wearing?

1797
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,640
It's like a no something.

1798
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:33,440
I like it's like a Joe Cameli kind of character.

1799
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,480
Shazam for shirts.

1800
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,600
Oh, there's the Easter rabbit.

1801
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,240
There he is.

1802
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:45,520
Oh, Jones kids are in the parade.

1803
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,480
Nowadays, it doesn't have to be pleasant.

1804
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:54,320
Hop Dreamworks hop that rabbit who loves to play the drums.

1805
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,160
Russell.

1806
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,920
Jim is Russell Brand, isn't it?

1807
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,840
Jim Hill said that Hop is going to replace half of Animal Kingdom.

1808
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,160
Hop was going to be on all the rides.

1809
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:07,360
Wait, these are all like Navy men, admirals.

1810
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,480
Are those real Navy men?

1811
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,920
Oh, the guy who came in here was 80 years old was in the Navy.

1812
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:20,000
Oh, and he had a giant crazy toupee on his head and he was very shaky with this.

1813
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,120
It was scary.

1814
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:23,520
Thank you.

1815
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:25,120
He still hasn't though.

1816
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,240
Your hair is pretty shaggy.

1817
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:27,840
You didn't like it was two weeks ago.

1818
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:28,660
Hmm.

1819
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,280
Did he not cut anything then?

1820
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:32,960
He didn't do a thorough cut.

1821
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,160
He may not have gotten all the nuances of what I was looking for.

1822
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:40,320
I sort of wanted to get out of there quickly because I kind of wandered into the situation.

1823
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,800
You went in with a picture of Henry from the country bears.

1824
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,320
Give me one of these.

1825
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:49,600
Once he started talking about the battleship that sank and how many men went in the water

1826
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,960
and how many came out shark circling.

1827
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,120
He did a thing where he started shit talking like

1828
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:00,480
people who cut hair at a train station because he was like, you don't want to go.

1829
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,760
He's like, how do you want to cut in the back?

1830
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:02,720
And I was like, you can blend it.

1831
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,960
And he's like, you're going to want a neck.

1832
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,760
So if we blended, you're going to see your neck.

1833
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,440
You should just do it like a square.

1834
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,640
I go, oh, sure.

1835
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:10,960
Okay.

1836
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:15,360
And he goes, if you get your haircut at the train station, they'll just do whatever you say.

1837
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,840
And they don't, they don't tell you what they think.

1838
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:21,600
That's not a universal reference point anymore.

1839
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,320
I go in about 40 years, I think.

1840
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:24,960
I go, yeah.

1841
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:25,760
Oh, thank you.

1842
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,120
Thanks for the tip.

1843
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:28,160
Whatever.

1844
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:29,680
And he's like, they'll just do it.

1845
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,120
They don't care what it looks like.

1846
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,000
And I go, oh yeah.

1847
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:32,960
The train station.

1848
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,160
Don't trust the shoe shine.

1849
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:35,120
Is that a train station?

1850
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,720
Got to go to a real cobbler for that.

1851
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,000
Mad at a trend from 1939.

1852
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:43,200
I like that Mickey too.

1853
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:43,760
That's great.

1854
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:44,960
I would show Lindsay a picture.

1855
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,440
Don't buy a pack of cigarettes without the tax sticker on it.

1856
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,800
You don't know what they're sticking in there.

1857
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,280
Soon Lindsay will be home and you can show her a picture of that.

1858
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,080
She can say, hmm.

1859
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,200
My sister had a daisy hat like that I think.

1860
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,320
So they're just playing the instrumental Easter parade song and

1861
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,240
it's just singing.

1862
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:05,040
Easter parade.

1863
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,040
Still in the.

1864
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:09,200
Who's next?

1865
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,000
Is Robin there?

1866
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,360
I think, is that Mrs. London?

1867
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:11,600
Is that Robin?

1868
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:12,400
Or Mr. London?

1869
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:15,520
Robin.

1870
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:16,020
Robin.

1871
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:18,080
No, not Robin.

1872
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:18,560
Oh.

1873
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:19,060
Brendan.

1874
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,200
Is Robin not born?

1875
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:25,520
No, Robin's a little older than me so he has to, I think.

1876
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,240
So he has to.

1877
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:27,440
You didn't think him.

1878
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:27,920
That one.

1879
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:28,880
A little mad at Robin right now.

1880
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,720
See like the kid not standing still.

1881
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:31,200
That's great.

1882
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,560
That's so funny and charming.

1883
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,680
I think Robin's actually a little like more old.

1884
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:36,720
I like the colors there.

1885
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,200
That's a nice little shot.

1886
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,240
They got that right.

1887
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:43,120
Can we buy a shirt with the Kissimmee St. Cloud logo on it?

1888
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,480
I mean there were so many.

1889
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:45,280
Is there like a T-public?

1890
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,960
Should we sell a shirt?

1891
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,600
No, well we shouldn't do too many knockoff.

1892
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,920
Can you, you can put a town's name on a shirt.

1893
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,920
I guess that's true but I would want that logo.

1894
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:56,240
Matt.

1895
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:00,560
Like in a varsity kind of like college font, Kissimmee St. Cloud.

1896
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:06,080
We should get Letterman jackets from like Kissimmee U or I mean Kissimmee High.

1897
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:08,320
Oh they put everyone up at the Grand Floridian.

1898
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,040
Nice.

1899
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:09,920
Yeah, hell yeah.

1900
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:10,400
Hell yeah.

1901
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:10,800
Fancy.

1902
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,120
Convenient and fancy.

1903
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:16,160
That's the benefit of being Deborah Minchow.

1904
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:22,400
Remember the stories of Eisner wanted all the housekeeping at the Grand Floridian to

1905
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:27,200
carry the linens and towels and wicker baskets up to each room and they're like this will take

1906
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,680
weeks to try and clean.

1907
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,800
We need to use the carts.

1908
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,200
Eisner you're mad.

1909
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,600
He had some, he was blue sky-ing it.

1910
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:43,120
He was a good blue sky and a good on game but it wasn't a boutique hotel where that's feasible.

1911
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:43,360
Yeah.

1912
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:44,240
Ray Lago.

1913
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:50,400
There's no list of credits without at least one funny name.

1914
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:51,040
It has to be.

1915
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:54,800
It seems strange that you couldn't get, I feel like I could list 100 people I know.

1916
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,400
And Dell Moody is kind of funny.

1917
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:59,600
The set design just said quote Jimbo.

1918
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,120
Yeah I saw that too.

1919
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:03,040
Whoa.

1920
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:04,640
That's going by real fast.

1921
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,480
Alan picks wardrobe by Rick Pallick.

1922
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:11,120
I remember Rick Pallick and Sherman Oaks and I remember all the late like Pat Riley and

1923
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:13,280
the Lakers would have been dressed by Rick Pallick.

1924
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:13,920
Oh wow.

1925
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:17,760
Kurt Ramis's wardrobe provided by Rick Pallick.

1926
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:18,480
Rick Pallick.

1927
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,160
We should get Rick Pallick on the show.

1928
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:23,200
Joe Rogan talks about DMT to a 10 year old boy.

1929
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,120
If you like that.

1930
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,960
If you like that you might also like Triumph of the Will.

1931
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:35,360
No it was going to start playing the 1989 parade which we'll have to wait for another day.

1932
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,720
At some point yes.

1933
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:37,840
Well that was delightful.

1934
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,560
That was a lot of fun.

1935
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:42,480
1995, 97's still available to watch.

1936
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:46,960
If you have requests of things you'd like commentaries on we've seen people call for

1937
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:49,920
those and we're aware of them but we've only done the holiday tie ins.

1938
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:54,960
Those have forced our hand but we hope you're having a happy Easter today.

1939
01:25:54,960 --> 01:26:02,560
I actually as a little like parting note I you know soon you'll hear my thoughts about

1940
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:06,080
my trip to Japan but Easter big deal there.

1941
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:10,160
I went to the Tip Top Easter show and I didn't write them all down.

1942
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:11,200
Let me make sure I can remember them.

1943
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,920
But here's my parting Easter thoughts.

1944
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:20,000
From these are the lyrics of the Tip Top Easter show at Tokyo Disney Sea.

1945
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:25,600
Honey bees begin to dance as the flowers grab their hands.

1946
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,480
We cannot apologize.

1947
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,960
Easter makes us come alive.

1948
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,280
That is the most wholesome thing I've ever heard.

1949
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,080
I love it.

1950
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,800
I don't know why we cannot apologize.

1951
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:45,040
I'm not sure what they're that lyric was said many times in a long show.

1952
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,240
Very polite culture.

1953
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,800
Maybe just giving a heads up.

1954
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,800
And they should be able to apologize better than anybody.

1955
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:51,680
You would think.

1956
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:53,200
They can't apologize.

1957
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:57,360
Well they're just doing their you know what they were put on earth to do.

1958
01:26:58,400 --> 01:26:59,840
Bloom and pollinate right.

1959
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:04,640
It's kind of they're like keeping it 100.

1960
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,560
Edwin did not care for that.

1961
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,720
Edwin is a grumble real loud at that.

1962
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,680
Did not like that wholesome observation.

1963
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:13,360
He's right in front of the fireplace now too.

1964
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:16,240
Like a real like if he had an Easter bow on it would be perfect.

1965
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:20,160
In your Easter bonnet.

1966
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:22,640
He's yawning now.

1967
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:23,680
Now he's upset.

1968
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,200
All right I guess let's get out of here.

1969
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,520
I don't like when I sing in general as I've discovered.

1970
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,440
I mean he's as unhappy with that as anything.

1971
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:36,960
Yeah he's always unhappy honestly.

1972
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,960
He's got to go outside and so do we.

1973
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,920
Open the tomb for the children of the world.

1974
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,400
Jesus.

1975
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,000
Roll back the rock.

1976
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,080
Climb off your cross for the Christians of the world.

1977
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,720
And now I like Easter.

1978
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,040
Happy Easter.

1979
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:57,600
Happy Easter.
