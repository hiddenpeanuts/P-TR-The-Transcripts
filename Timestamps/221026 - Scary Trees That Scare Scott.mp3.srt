00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
["Avengers Theme Song"]

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,480
Welcome to Haunt Cast the Fright, the cemetery gate,

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,920
behind which a good boy, a scared boy is trapped,

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,120
cornered, and forced to tackle some major fears

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,800
that is Scott Grave Digner, and thankfully,

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,640
I have some help and some backup from Jason Skeleton.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,140
I'm very excited for this.

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,520
And Michael Madsen.

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,520
Thank you, yes, that's how you say it.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,360
Now, this is a bit of a, this is kind of a second take.

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,440
Here's what happened.

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,400
We got caught on some weeds,

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,440
but I intended to be a quick opening

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,200
about something that happened last week

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,360
involving producer and Jimmy Buffett's best friend,

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,200
Frank Marshall.

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,320
If you can imagine bringing up Frank Marshall

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,320
caused a massive rerouting.

20
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,680
It was so thorough that we said,

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,840
all right, let's just call that a false start.

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,920
We'll release that on its own.

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,600
You'll hear that, I don't know, maybe tomorrow or something.

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,440
We'll figure that out.

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,560
It was so thoroughly its own thing.

26
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,600
Yeah, it's like Europe after World War II,

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,920
we got involved with the Marshall Plan.

28
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,560
What?

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,400
Wow.

30
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,320
It's like a Dennis Circuitus.

31
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,240
It's like a Dennis Miller joke over here.

32
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,800
Oh, I'm trying to get my packet together.

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,640
Oh, is he back?

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,840
Yeah, he's back on Rumble.

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,040
For his radio show.

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,760
For his, yeah, just his rambles to his wife.

37
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,600
Yeah.

38
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,560
Anyway. That's great, dear.

39
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,920
That's very funny, dear.

40
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,600
So we decided to reset, we're calling that its own thing.

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,600
And we are starting over to focus on the issue at hand,

42
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
which is, if you can see in the title,

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,360
Scary Trees That Scare Scott.

44
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,440
Uh-oh.

45
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,840
You all right?

46
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,680
I'm okay.

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,400
Anyway, so thorough was the tangent,

48
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,880
that sometimes the tangent becomes a mini episode.

49
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,160
We decided to refresh, take a deep breath.

50
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,440
I had more to say too.

51
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,800
We're not gonna do it here, I'm focused, but I'm just.

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,000
Well, maybe the more to say can come out

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
over the course of many, many episodes.

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,280
That's fine, yeah, yeah, yeah.

55
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,800
Down the road.

56
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,400
But for now, look, they'll hear that tangent later.

57
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,080
We split off, that went down that road

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,160
and we're going down a very scary path indeed.

59
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,240
Scary Trees That Scare Scott.

60
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,720
I've been passionate about doing this for a little while

61
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,880
because it seems like something good to do

62
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,320
in a haunt cast season is to address something

63
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,680
that genuinely scares me.

64
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,360
Always had, I go straight back to three years old with this.

65
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,240
I know my whole life I have been frightened

66
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,320
of talking trees basically.

67
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,600
I think we're gonna talk about some animatronic trees.

68
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Probably some are puppets.

69
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,160
Maybe some don't even move,

70
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,360
but they still have devious grins.

71
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,160
This is something, I'm describing something

72
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,760
and it'll start to feel so familiar as you hear it,

73
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,160
but it's omnipresent in movies, in television,

74
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,760
in places, in toy stores, department stores, restaurants.

75
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,880
The more I started digging, the scary trees never stop.

76
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,960
That's true, yeah.

77
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,480
Now, I wanted to put it on me.

78
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,280
I wanted to make myself the recipient of this fear,

79
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,000
but I don't wanna make any assumptions about you guys.

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,640
How do you feel about anthropomorphized trees?

81
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,440
Yeah, I'm afraid of them.

82
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,640
I think it all starts like many things,

83
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,840
starts with The Wizard of Oz.

84
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,400
Yeah, yes.

85
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,240
That's gotta be the root of it.

86
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,720
I think a lot of people are scared of that sequence.

87
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,520
The wizard of Oz is, yeah, there's talking tree,

88
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,520
like trees are throwing apples at the heroes of the movie.

89
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,520
And everything in Wizard of Oz is so scary,

90
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,840
but like hypnotic, especially to a child,

91
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,600
because of just the way they made that movie.

92
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,880
Everything, I don't know if you,

93
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,560
I remember just, I would feel unease

94
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,440
watching the whole movie basically,

95
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,360
even though I liked it and I liked Scarecrow a lot.

96
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,000
It's all upset, it's kinda like a bad trip, I think.

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Not that I super know a bad trip.

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,960
But like, where somebody might,

99
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,800
if somebody with different taste than you

100
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,040
might regard it as like, hey, that was fun,

101
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,280
but if you're a little edgy and if you're a little kid

102
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,440
and you've been told, oh, you haven't seen,

103
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,280
oh, The Wizard of Oz, what a, oh, you're going to love

104
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,800
The Wizard of Oz, and then it's full of scary voices,

105
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,480
scary things, death rounds every turn.

106
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,680
So much of, even like the characters you like

107
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,240
when they get those closeups with the soft lens,

108
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,560
you go, oh, God, it's like, yeah.

109
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,440
Like even the lion, who I like a lot,

110
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,920
he's like, they go to the soft lens closeups of his face

111
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,800
and it's just the makeup you can see real clearly

112
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,120
and like the fake fur and you're like, oh.

113
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,200
I think I always recognize The Wizard of Oz

114
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,320
is from a different time and that was like

115
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,080
part of the unsettling, in the way that I'm like,

116
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,760
I'm scared of things in like 1940 Pinocchio,

117
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,280
just snow white or anything, because like,

118
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,280
I just feel the like weird grimy 30s, 40ness of it.

119
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,640
It's not like Charmin Newsboy.

120
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,800
It's like, I don't like when the lion says like, no.

121
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,120
That's the comforting part.

122
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,120
And like weird, like the cancer causing makeup

123
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,800
that's caked on those people.

124
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,720
We're like watching men get poisoned.

125
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,240
The original what, Tin Man couldn't do it

126
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,080
because he broke out, I think.

127
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,400
Is that what happened, they lost an actor?

128
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,480
I believe so, I could be completely wrong,

129
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,680
but I believe that's what happened.

130
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,520
Something like that.

131
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,480
They didn't figure this shit out for,

132
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,840
it's rumored that it's part of why Andy Kaufman

133
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,760
died so young, was you got poisoned by the makeup

134
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,000
for the hideous film Heart Beeps.

135
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,840
Is that right?

136
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,960
I think it's in the mix as a possible,

137
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,040
although I wanna say, I forget if it was lung cancer,

138
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,880
but I've definitely seen it suggested

139
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,560
that the makeup made him sick.

140
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,280
Oh man, I've never actually heard that.

141
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,120
Yeah, not sure.

142
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,720
Don't quote me on it, but I'm not making that up.

143
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,480
Yeah, well, so look, we're watching.

144
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,320
Yeah, Buddy Epson.

145
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,200
Buddy Epson was originally cast as the Tin Woodsman.

146
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,040
No kidding, that's interesting.

147
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,000
But he was essentially poisoned by the makeup,

148
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,520
which was made of pure aluminum dust.

149
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,920
Oh, God. Jesus Christ.

150
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,800
It's probably in him when he died.

151
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,480
It's like the ultimate,

152
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,160
like the way glitter sticks around,

153
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,240
it probably like, it was in his bloodstream.

154
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,200
Yeah, nine days after filming started,

155
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,280
he was hospitalized sitting under an oxygen tent.

156
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,880
Fuck.

157
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,400
That's really serious.

158
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,960
Now I don't know, did they just use,

159
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,840
I mean, Buddy Epson lived till 2003, so at least he didn't.

160
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,840
We got a big run in,

161
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,400
but we're lucky we got any Hillbillies,

162
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,280
we're lucky we got any Barnaby Jones.

163
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,880
Right, so he had a good career, a TV career,

164
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,600
but yeah, that was, so I don't know,

165
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
did they just put, who played the,

166
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,520
what's his name, who played the Tin Man?

167
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,760
I forget the P. Jack Haley is one,

168
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,560
uh, Bulger is one of them.

169
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,320
Ray Bulger was a scarecrow.

170
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Okay.

171
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,720
But did they use the aluminum makeup still?

172
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,560
Jesus Christ.

173
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,400
They were like, well, that guy,

174
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,240
fucking Buddy Epson can't handle it.

175
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,920
He ain't tough.

176
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,640
Get a non-pussy in here.

177
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,480
Yeah.

178
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,880
Our boys are going, fighting overseas,

179
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,680
and you can't handle a little powder on your face, dear.

180
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,320
Smoking in your face, just ridiculing you

181
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,880
for not being able to handle costume makeup.

182
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,160
Everything you're eating also causing pain.

183
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,000
Right.

184
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,200
Have you found Tin Man?

185
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,720
Jack Haley.

186
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,960
Jack Haley is the hit Tin Man, okay.

187
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,400
And Ray Bulger is scarecrow.

188
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,480
Look, that movie, and that scene, you're absolutely right.

189
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,080
I went back and rewatched it to see

190
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,960
if it would bother me in the same way.

191
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,120
It's the most abrasive sequence ever.

192
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,720
The tree slaps Judy Garland.

193
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,600
If you're believing the character,

194
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,640
well, let's go, all right, in reality,

195
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,920
this is a 16-year-old, I believe, Judy Garland.

196
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,560
If you're buying it narratively, it's even worse,

197
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,720
because Dorothy's supposed to be 12.

198
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,680
You're watching a young person just get smacked,

199
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,800
and then the voice, dear God,

200
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,240
what are you doing?

201
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,800
This is a film of wonder and magic,

202
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,240
and they're so gnarled at the,

203
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,480
here's one of my big things immediately with scary trees.

204
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,880
I'm putting this on it to say scary.

205
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,520
I'm asserting, if you guys wanna not call them scary,

206
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,520
to me, any alive tree is scary,

207
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,920
and I'm made uncomfortable by the degree of,

208
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,960
we're supposed to be replicating something that is hard

209
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,840
and that's made of bark and that's solid,

210
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,880
but at some point, rubber's gonna have to enter into this,

211
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,640
and the gnarled mess of bendy rubber

212
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,720
at the bottom of the, at the base

213
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,200
of those Wizard of Oz trees, disgusting.

214
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,720
Like, what if I had to be in that?

215
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,120
Oh, that's a nightmare.

216
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,040
Somebody makes me be in a tree thing.

217
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,480
It's the start of, just even, we've talked about it

218
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,920
many times, Power Rangers, Starlight Express,

219
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,680
sort of when there's a material,

220
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,960
that when they're trying to replicate the look of a material,

221
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,120
but it has to be a costume

222
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,720
because it's an anthropomorphized character, it's odd.

223
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,040
It's not good, it'll bend, and it makes it weird,

224
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,960
especially when you're a kid,

225
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,080
because it doesn't look like the right material,

226
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,200
and the same way with the trees,

227
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,880
where trees have bark, it's hard, it's not rubbery,

228
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,920
so seeing an abstraction of real life in that way,

229
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,760
especially with a scary face and scary voice, is disturbing.

230
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,720
Yeah, yes.

231
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,680
I'm gonna try to, maybe inspired by Wizard of Oz,

232
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,160
and if you have a better way of ranking these,

233
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,080
I just wanna clarify with some of these,

234
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,040
how scared I am of them.

235
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,640
So being that these are kind of ultimate scary trees to me,

236
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,120
and they pelt our heroes with apples

237
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,000
after smacking them on the face and arms,

238
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,640
horrifying, one of our beloved classic films.

239
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,160
Anyway, there are five out of five apples.

240
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,400
So that's the, if I give a tree only one apple,

241
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,320
that means I'm not too freaked out by them.

242
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,240
Yes, I see. Three of you are in the middle,

243
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,520
but five, they make me feel like I'm being pelted

244
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,360
just by watching them.

245
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,800
Oh, this is great, because I have a list I'll get to.

246
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,640
Oh, boy.

247
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,680
After we see some more prominent examples,

248
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,160
I have some, I would like some feedback on it.

249
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,440
You're just gonna pelt me?

250
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, I'm just gonna pelt you with images,

251
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,840
and I will be in return pelted by the apples

252
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,760
sitting at your feet.

253
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,000
I will tell you how many apples I'm throwing back,

254
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,840
how many I wanna hit those trees with

255
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,120
to try to knock them down.

256
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,120
You know what, I was gonna say,

257
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,120
now, we should have maybe done this for Halloween,

258
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,440
maybe next year, return to Oz.

259
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,280
Oh, yeah.

260
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,320
Which I've been thrilled that hasn't come up

261
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,960
or been voted for.

262
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,040
Yeah.

263
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,480
What's going on with the trees?

264
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,920
And are the trees back?

265
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,240
The trees aren't, there's a thing called

266
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,520
a lunch pail tree in it.

267
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,440
And that's actually like a good tree.

268
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,960
So there's not the scary tree situation.

269
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,560
No, I don't know, there's no such thing.

270
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,040
Well, here's a big one,

271
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,760
and maybe you have this prepared,

272
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,080
but how do you feel about the McDonaldland apple pie trees?

273
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,920
That's definitely one of those.

274
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,080
That's a two apple.

275
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,520
I am not terribly afraid of the,

276
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,480
they were not my favorites, and I think they did,

277
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,320
maybe the only sin with them is that they remind me

278
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,640
of the Wizard of Oz tree, or did at the time.

279
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,800
They're sort of gone now,

280
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,560
but they were around in ages three, four,

281
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,760
which is when I recall being the most,

282
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,000
I don't know if I ever vocalized tree faces,

283
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,920
but you know what the problem with them is?

284
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,960
It's smiles, it's big goofy smiles on trees.

285
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,080
If a tree is presented as scary,

286
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,320
then it's correctly classified.

287
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,320
If it's got a big frowny face, then that's fine,

288
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,960
because that's what they are, they are scary.

289
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,400
But if one is supposed to be, is supposed to read

290
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,640
as friendly like the McDonald's trees, no, you're scary.

291
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,960
A smile doesn't help with that.

292
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,960
But before we get into scary, would you say,

293
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,120
and I couldn't think of a better example,

294
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,120
would you say Groot is the only good smiling happy tree?

295
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,800
I have no problem with Groot.

296
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,640
Yeah.

297
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,820
And that might play into, this might be a related fear

298
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,960
to the fear that I've talked about the most on the show,

299
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,880
my fear of big things in small places,

300
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,440
with Big Boo in Mario being the ultimate example of this.

301
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,200
I'm so worried about Big Boo on this Mario Kart ride,

302
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,640
because I haven't watched a video yet.

303
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,480
Is Big Boo in it?

304
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,200
I don't know, but I mean, there's a decent chance.

305
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,160
Big Boo is one of his famous villains.

306
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,400
I'm not kidding or playing it up,

307
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,640
that when I talk about some of these trees,

308
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,440
I feel pangs in my chest, and when I talk about Big Boo,

309
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,680
I feel pangs in my chest.

310
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,280
It's a 3D ride, so if they make Big Boo like Giants

311
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,560
on the ride or something.

312
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,240
Look, I know that that ride, well, I don't know.

313
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,240
I don't know this, but my sense is that that ride

314
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,440
keeps moving, and the problem with Big Boo

315
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,520
is when you end up stuck in a room,

316
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,680
especially, I think as I've said,

317
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,480
when you go through some door,

318
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,420
and then the door takes you to, you're trapped by blocks,

319
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,040
and the only thing in the block trap is you and Boo.

320
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,640
Jesus Christ.

321
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,480
Uh-huh.

322
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,080
Terrifying.

323
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,000
I don't think that that's gonna happen in the ride.

324
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,320
Unless it breaks down.

325
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,160
At the Boo part?

326
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,720
In the Big Boo part.

327
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,520
The AR gets stuck too, and I just have to,

328
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,680
and he's just blinking.

329
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,920
And then you could just throw AR shells at him,

330
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,040
I guess, over and over again.

331
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,000
But that's not how Big Boo is defeated.

332
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,280
I better have unlimited.

333
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,880
Yeah, wait, shells don't do anything to Boo.

334
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,600
No, shells don't do anything to Big Boo.

335
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,040
I don't think anything does anything to Boo.

336
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,040
Yeah, if you have a star, usually, you can hit Big Boo.

337
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,040
Okay, I'm amazed that in watching Mario land footage

338
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,760
that I'm not more upset by the big plants.

339
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,720
Oh yeah, yeah.

340
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm kind of delighted to see the big plants around.

341
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,400
Somehow they aren't, maybe I'll feel differently in person.

342
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,240
But it's the fish.

343
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,880
What about a big chain chomp?

344
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,040
Are you afraid of the chain chomp?

345
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,960
I am not too fond of big chain chomps.

346
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,040
Yeah, so what about a Venus flytrap

347
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,160
kind of thing like this?

348
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,920
I'm not scared of what you're showing me.

349
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,760
Okay.

350
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,600
If it was moving and there was kind of a snappiness to it,

351
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,000
which is, again, what upset me

352
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,760
about the trees slapping Dorothy.

353
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,920
Have you watched Little Shop of Horrors ever?

354
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,600
I've watched Little Shop of Horrors.

355
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,440
I'm fine with Little Shop of Horrors.

356
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,280
Fine with Audrey.

357
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,120
Audrey II is okay.

358
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,560
Yeah, it's such a fun movie.

359
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,840
I think it helps if I was not exposed

360
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,000
to some of these things as a child.

361
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,880
Like if I'm finding something new and big now

362
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,400
probably won't scare me as much as something

363
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,280
where I still feel the negative energy

364
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,880
from like seven, eight years old.

365
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,720
Well, there's a level.

366
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,760
Did you ever play the original Ninja Turtles Nintendo game?

367
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Like home edition?

368
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,720
I played, yeah.

369
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,960
I don't know if I did.

370
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,560
Jason, did you ever play it?

371
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,880
I did play that, yeah.

372
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,640
Do you remember the underwater level?

373
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,480
Not really.

374
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,960
Okay, because if you had the game,

375
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,600
you would remember this because it's one

376
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,840
of the most stressful memories I have in my life

377
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,640
and they just released all of the games as a collection

378
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,680
you can get on Switch or PlayStation

379
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,520
and the underwater level, I was playing it the other day.

380
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,960
It's still as stressful as possible.

381
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,960
There was seaweed, the controls were bad.

382
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,600
It was hard to navigate as the turtles were like swimming

383
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,440
through the sewer.

384
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,560
You had 90 seconds to defuse 12 bombs

385
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,520
and I remember being four years old, just wrecked,

386
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,400
wrecked with like stress.

387
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,200
It was not a particularly fluid game either.

388
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,040
It was very stiff.

389
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,360
Yeah, kind of a bad game.

390
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,000
It was the first game before the arcade.

391
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,320
Then they switched to that style of game.

392
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,200
But I was playing it the other day and I could feel it.

393
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
I could feel that four year old or whatever,

394
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,240
five year old memory of just,

395
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,760
oh, I gotta do this or Michelangelo dies.

396
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,600
Like New York is gonna blow up.

397
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,680
You're having to save your friend, don't you?

398
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,200
Yes, because it was incredible.

399
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,240
I've seen many other people say like if they played it

400
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,400
when they were little, but yeah, you're right.

401
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,240
If there wasn't a big thing in the game,

402
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,600
you're just talking about that you still feel the stress.

403
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,160
Right, I'm saying, yeah, I'm agreeing with like

404
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,320
when you were younger, that stuff can still be unlocked

405
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,040
in there, because it's scarring.

406
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,920
What I was saying about Groot is that I think I'm fine

407
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,280
with Groot because of his proportions.

408
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,200
He's very skinny, string bean.

409
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,000
I don't like big rotund trees

410
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
because they have big faces that fill up that.

411
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,560
Like Groot's face is as wide as a human's face.

412
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,320
But when you stretch to an uncomfortable degree,

413
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,720
like where maybe a tree's face is like twice as big

414
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,280
as a human face.

415
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,400
Oddly, that bothers me more than trees with a face

416
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,040
that's like 10 times bigger.

417
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,600
For some reason, that's exaggerated enough.

418
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,680
The rules of this are really weird.

419
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,240
So, okay, it's so crazy.

420
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,080
Maybe that's why I'm not afraid of Audrey.

421
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:26,080
Audrey's so crazy huge, but it's like mild extension

422
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,840
or magnification of something that should be small.

423
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,000
So Grandmother Willow from Pocahontas.

424
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,160
That's a good question.

425
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,400
I'm not, that's a one apple.

426
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,560
I'm not afraid of Grandmother Willow,

427
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,360
and I was not afraid of Grandmother Willow

428
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,680
in the theme park show that existed of Pocahontas.

429
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,520
Yes.

430
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,920
I don't like Grandmother Willow.

431
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,600
I've never been fond of the character

432
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,320
or the film in general.

433
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,120
But, so I'm not gonna go chase down

434
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,040
any Grandmother Willow media,

435
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,040
but no, not afraid of Grandmother Willow.

436
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,880
So you will not be watching the upcoming

437
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,760
Grandmother Willow Disney Plus series.

438
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,080
Live action.

439
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,960
I saw they announced Willow was coming back.

440
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,040
I was hoping it was the other.

441
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,320
It's not, it's the, oh God.

442
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,520
It's Grandmother Willow, yeah.

443
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,640
Jesus, all right, all right.

444
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,560
No, no, but not because I'm scared.

445
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,920
She's also not interested.

446
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,000
She's also young too.

447
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,960
She's young and hot.

448
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,320
Yes. Oh well.

449
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,360
Wasn't she, she wasn't always a tree though.

450
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,080
No, no, I think she passed away and became the tree.

451
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,960
So it's about just a woman, is what you're saying.

452
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,760
It's about a Native American woman.

453
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,120
A willow rising.

454
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,040
Maybe sometimes she passes a tree

455
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,720
and puts her hand on it, and that's a little,

456
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,840
that's an Easter egg for the true willow heads

457
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,640
because they know she's gonna become a willow.

458
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,680
Sure. Yep.

459
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,560
Let me get into the one that I know caused it.

460
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,320
This for sure is it,

461
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,560
because it's a swirl in my head

462
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,160
of I know that these existed in department stores,

463
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,280
and I kind of knew the McDonald's one,

464
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,040
and they all look similar to the ones from this commercial.

465
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,760
And when I was selling you guys on this idea,

466
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,520
these were the ones that freaked me out.

467
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,640
I didn't even remember the brand.

468
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,720
I knew it was a fruit snack of some kind.

469
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,560
Oh right, yeah.

470
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,800
There were a lot of ads, and I figured it out.

471
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,360
It's called Sun Kissed Fun Fruits,

472
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,840
and there's a compilation called

473
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,720
Sun Kissed Fun Fruits Laughing Tree, 80s, 90s.

474
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,440
And this is what caused it.

475
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,960
This might be too long of a little commercial to play,

476
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,120
but you'll hear them at some point,

477
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,120
and just know as goofy as this is

478
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,840
that it caused a genuine panic with a three-year-old.

479
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,320
Hear anything?

480
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,160
Negative.

481
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,640
Sun Kiss searches high and low for fun fruit trees.

482
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,640
The only tree is funny enough to grow Sun Kissed Fun Fruits.

483
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,720
I found them!

484
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,040
Oh God.

485
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:57,040
A kid has a bunch of metal detector headphones,

486
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,960
and he's trying to find these trees, and then he does,

487
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,880
and then he gets pelted by fruit.

488
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,960
It's these big trees, and they have big pieces

489
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,560
of, it's not really leaves, it's like giant lemons

490
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,640
and strawberries and grapefruits and stuff,

491
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,840
but then they rain little fruit pieces down,

492
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,480
which is supposed to be delightful,

493
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,240
but I was scared, like this kid gets hurt.

494
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,600
You could get knocked out by what they all shake,

495
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,280
and they all do it at once.

496
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,320
They all like, it's a big hail of fruit.

497
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,520
Of fruit snack, yeah.

498
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,200
Do you understand at all why I'm afraid of these fruit trees?

499
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,880
Yeah, well those trees, I mean those trees look like,

500
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,000
if you told me those were in, just name a product

501
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,600
in a commercial from when I was a kid,

502
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,480
I would say, oh yeah, I remember that.

503
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,480
They just seem like those trees were everywhere.

504
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,920
We grew up with those trees.

505
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,760
Yes, yeah.

506
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,320
It's not true necessarily, but they are burned in my brain,

507
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,480
and yes, I understand there's something

508
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,520
that's very unnerving about it,

509
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,400
and it's what we're talking about, it's the like.

510
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,240
I'm glad you agree.

511
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,160
I didn't know if I'd be facing just a stone wall here.

512
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,360
I don't know that my blood pressure has risen

513
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,240
talking about it necessarily now.

514
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,560
Because you weren't afraid of it then,

515
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,000
but you understand where I'm coming from.

516
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,560
Well, I was unnerved by, I was unnerved by a lot of it

517
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,800
as a kid, I remember this, I remember the McDonald trees,

518
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,280
and it's all eerie, it's zoobily-zoo.

519
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,320
There's like, especially the vibe of, I don't know,

520
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,400
of this time.

521
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,280
The fact that it's supposed to be, as I was saying,

522
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,320
if it's presented as you're supposed to be scared of this,

523
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,360
and then you are, great, I know where to put that

524
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,600
in my brain, but if you're told, here's some cute trees,

525
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,440
I don't like this, I'm scared of the trees,

526
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,400
well, that's your weird problem then.

527
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,920
I don't know what box to put them in.

528
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,760
There's no way, I don't think, is there a way

529
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,840
to make a rubber tree look right?

530
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,040
Like a cartoon tree you can-

531
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,920
Some of them don't, some of what we'll talk about,

532
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,160
these even, look, if I didn't grow up with them,

533
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,120
I don't know, I am afraid of these still.

534
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,920
Yeah, I mean, they are laughing at the children.

535
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,160
It was another one you had shown us,

536
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,800
where it's like the kids were a little in distress,

537
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,720
and they were laughing at them.

538
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,720
They're looking for dinosaurs in this one,

539
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,680
yeah, here, let me get another bit of laughter in, hang on.

540
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,760
Here's another ad.

541
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,520
The laughter is really a big part of it too.

542
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,360
I think so.

543
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,720
When I was describing all this to Erin

544
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,880
and saying we're gonna do this episode,

545
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,640
she was like, I don't understand,

546
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,640
when I showed her a clip of this,

547
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,200
she's like, first of all, I just like them, this is great.

548
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,360
And why do you have a problem with this?

549
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,280
That laugh, oh, that's exactly what I love to do.

550
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,560
I love bellowing, I love, open the cas, oh!

551
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,480
It's like way in my wheelhouse, so why am I so unnerved?

552
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,960
There's something about the way they're stacked

553
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,360
on top of each other and they're all identical,

554
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,080
and I agree with you, Jason,

555
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,560
I feel like I'm being laughed at.

556
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,280
I think they're laughing at the kids, not with them,

557
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,680
and pelting them with shit.

558
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,320
Well, okay, so let me, can I get your feedback

559
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,520
on one of these McDonald apple pie tree ones?

560
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,360
Yes.

561
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,840
Okay, this is like 15 seconds into the commercial.

562
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,360
It's on YouTube as a trip through McDonald land,

563
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,400
and here they are.

564
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Oh no, bad, bad, bad, bad, no.

565
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,360
So they're silent.

566
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,880
Giant nose bouncing around, no.

567
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,480
The full on ripoff of Sid and Marty Croft style.

568
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,320
Sid and Marty Croft.

569
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,800
Oh, I didn't even go down the route,

570
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,840
so I know there's scary trees in those.

571
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,440
I think there are puffin' stuff ones,

572
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,160
and that's like, hey, hell no,

573
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,680
I don't owe that to the listener,

574
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,240
I don't need to watch this shit.

575
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,160
We gotta do full Sid and Marty Croft eventually.

576
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,160
Now how about the very rare cherry trees, cherry pie trees?

577
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,440
What, really?

578
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,440
McDonald's this?

579
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,120
Cherry pie trees in McDonald land?

580
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,800
Hey, Ronald, the cherry pie is ready.

581
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,720
That's right, Big Beck, red, ripe, and ready to pick.

582
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,920
Let's get started.

583
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,440
So Ronald, Billy, and Big Mack picked and picked.

584
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,320
So they're just kind of frozen in rigor mortis.

585
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,760
It appears to be a similar tree.

586
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,440
I don't, I didn't have a problem with that really.

587
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,400
The apple pie, look, I think when they're still,

588
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,480
that's fine, they've benerved me a little bit

589
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,320
at the playground.

590
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,200
I'm not gonna go stand next to the apple pie tree.

591
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,080
I'm delighted by the premise of an apple pie tree.

592
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,080
That's great, not the problem.

593
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,880
I've not, you know, I was rating them two apples,

594
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,360
but when you showed me that giant nose bouncing around,

595
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,080
that notches it up to four.

596
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,600
Why did they do a closeup of the nose?

597
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,240
No need for that.

598
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,080
Horrible.

599
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,960
That's just an old, it's some like six year old crew guy

600
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,320
with his fist in there, shaking it around.

601
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,280
It's like, I'm trying to think, are there examples of,

602
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,880
you know, objects that don't talk or have eyes

603
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,320
that commonly are given eyes and mouths in media

604
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,920
that aren't scary?

605
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,200
Like, so much of it is just, we see a tree every day,

606
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,560
they don't talk.

607
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Now we're seeing in all-

608
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,960
Maybe it's the everyday aspect.

609
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,800
That's what I'm trying to think.

610
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,080
I mean, like Officer Big Mac, I always loved,

611
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,440
I know there's never, I was never afraid of Mayor McCheese

612
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,560
or Officer Big Mac.

613
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,480
But yeah, is there like another thing,

614
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,480
like trees that we see every day?

615
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,400
Like so much of it as like,

616
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,960
we know we can trust the trees in our daily life.

617
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,720
I don't love when a book is alive.

618
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,280
I don't like a book having a face.

619
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,520
That's an, and effectively so in Hocus Pocus,

620
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,600
that there's like a big eye in the book

621
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,720
that brings the Sanderson sisters to life.

622
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,440
Like that's what it's supposed to do is unsettle me

623
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,920
when I was a kid, but I don't want to see that really.

624
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,400
I'm not gonna go out of my way.

625
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,720
What other fun, are there like talking books?

626
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,800
I'm trying to think.

627
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,400
Page Master?

628
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,680
I didn't see Page Master.

629
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,520
Okay, there's a book in there I think.

630
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,960
There's the Evil Dead.

631
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,800
Right?

632
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,160
The book and the Evil Dead.

633
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,640
I don't really know those movies.

634
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,160
Yeah, I don't really know them that well either.

635
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,200
Yeah, that's a good question.

636
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,960
Maybe it is something about that like,

637
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,800
they're, yeah, they're all,

638
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,360
they're around you all the time and they don't have faces.

639
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,200
You can trust them in real life, but maybe you can't,

640
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,080
especially when you're a child.

641
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,480
Now, shouldn't I be less, in working this out,

642
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,240
shouldn't I be less afraid of trees

643
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,120
because they are stationary and they can't run after me

644
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,560
the way like a scary clown could?

645
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,560
But I think it's like, really, the scary thing then becomes,

646
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,800
what if it's too late?

647
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,200
It was too late for Dorothy.

648
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,640
She was right next to him.

649
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,560
She's within grasp.

650
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,360
So if, yeah, if you're at distance

651
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,120
where you could run away, great,

652
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,280
but if you're anywhere close and they can just like tackle you,

653
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,520
like give you a big hug and then pull you in,

654
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,760
I think I'm afraid of them eating me.

655
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,480
That's what I, I don't know.

656
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,800
I have never thought about what I am worried

657
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,480
a big tree is gonna do to me, but I think it's eating.

658
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,000
And I think the fact that they have roots

659
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,160
that go into the ground, it feels like they're gonna like,

660
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,920
that like the earth is their stomach or their intestines.

661
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,680
And they're gonna suck me. That's interesting.

662
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,360
They're gonna shit me into the center of the earth.

663
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And then I like suffocate in there

664
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,120
or it's like monstrous stomach.

665
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,640
And maybe there's other people

666
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,400
that are all like moaning and trying to get out.

667
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,760
That's interesting. That's bringing up,

668
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,440
I'm trying to think that all of a sudden that's,

669
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,680
that diverts me to a different thought of like,

670
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,240
I think there is something where people go down a tree stump.

671
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,760
Am I thinking of like Inspector Gadget or something?

672
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,000
I don't know. They do that in Inspector Gadget?

673
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
That might be like, not that he gets eaten.

674
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,240
That might be like a secret thing that he goes into

675
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,400
for like his headquarters or something.

676
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,640
Maybe he's in the opening. I don't know.

677
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,880
Does Fred Penner go into a tree?

678
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,440
Remember Fred Penner's place?

679
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,480
I know he think he runs around a tree.

680
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,880
He was like a Kenny Loggins looking guy with a guitar.

681
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,520
That was a very like low budget Nickelodeon kid show.

682
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,360
Is that what I'm thinking of?

683
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,120
I'm sure nothing grotesque happened in Fred Penner's place.

684
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,240
Somebody had like a tree elevator to get to a base, I think.

685
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,640
Shit, was it Inspector Gadget

686
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,040
or was it what Scott's saying, this guy?

687
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,400
Like in the opening credits of Inspector Gadget?

688
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,640
Somebody had a tree thing

689
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,480
that he would go into an elevator.

690
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,320
Doesn't feel like Gadget to me.

691
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,520
He exists in like steel and metal in my world.

692
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,360
Yeah, that's what I think.

693
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,000
There was some thing as a child

694
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,840
that somebody would go in an elevator to get to a base.

695
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,840
And I was obsessed with it.

696
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,680
Listeners got it.

697
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,520
Somebody's, somebody has a point.

698
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,360
That diverted me.

699
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,120
Anyway, real quick, my thought is also that

700
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,840
I don't know that I ever had that thought

701
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,520
that the tree was going to eat me,

702
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:37,520
but being a kid being, and I don't know how much like,

703
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,480
I don't know for lack of a better term,

704
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,400
how many forests were around,

705
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,000
but in the Midwest we had a decent amount of like,

706
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,520
oh, there'd be a big bunch of trees.

707
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,960
And when you're little and when it's dark,

708
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,520
going in a bunch of trees is scary as shit.

709
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,360
Yes.

710
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,680
So with the very- Lost, yeah.

711
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,000
Getting lost.

712
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,640
Yeah, so like there were a decent amount of like,

713
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,760
places around where you could like go into the forest.

714
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,600
Inspector Gadget goes into a garbage can.

715
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,440
I remember that, yes.

716
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,520
And climbs down the ladder.

717
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,360
I remember that.

718
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,480
So there's something else.

719
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,600
Somebody had a tree that he would go into.

720
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,400
It was a secret tree base.

721
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,600
That's a really good idea for a secret base.

722
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,440
I love it.

723
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,280
But again, that's like, the mechanics are involved.

724
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,440
Engineers had to come sort that out for him.

725
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,280
That's true, yeah.

726
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,200
That's not like, imagine being, think about this.

727
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,240
You go down into, you get eaten by a sun-kissed tree.

728
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,920
And then you're in like a rubbery root world.

729
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,520
Imagine it's all undulating,

730
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,600
like they're disgusting floppy lips.

731
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,400
I didn't have the imagination to think about

732
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,760
dying that way as a kid, which now,

733
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,720
I never fully fleshed this out.

734
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,120
This is like a discovery in the last week.

735
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,440
I've been like, there's maybe subconsciously,

736
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,520
I thought the trees were gonna eat me.

737
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,360
And then I'm like inside rubber bark.

738
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,200
Oh wow.

739
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,720
And then I die there.

740
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,120
Yeah, I can see what you're saying.

741
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,720
Cause like, the mouths, they all see they're sinister

742
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,160
and they all seem like they're gonna eat whatever.

743
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,680
Let me show you this.

744
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,200
This is later in the sun-kissed compilation.

745
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,160
It's these motherfuckers.

746
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,640
This episode is making me swear a lot.

747
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,480
I'm mad at these guys.

748
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,320
About the sun-kissed trees.

749
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,140
Yes.

750
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,940
This is the one, look at this one.

751
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,420
It is all white.

752
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,260
It is white as a ghost.

753
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,340
Oh yeah, scary.

754
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,540
Look when his mouth moves, it like sucks in.

755
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,540
Look, that guy's, he's ready to slurp a child.

756
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,540
This all white one.

757
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,140
I don't think I ever saw this as a kid and thank God.

758
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,980
Oh wow.

759
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,820
This is so much scarier.

760
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,700
I remember eating those snacks

761
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,740
with like the covered in like, they're covered in like.

762
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,060
Why were they white?

763
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,380
They were covered in, shoot, they were like.

764
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,940
Creams, Supremes is the name of that.

765
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,900
Yeah, I had those once or twice.

766
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,500
Oh like Raisinettes kind of.

767
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,340
Yeah, yeah.

768
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,180
Okay.

769
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,740
And then it's, and look in the product shot

770
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,260
and then just he's blurry in the background

771
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,540
looking over the whole thing.

772
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,700
You think you're gonna trick me

773
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,380
with this box in the foreground?

774
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,140
Like, oh a delicious fruit, no, no, no.

775
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,700
My eyes are on that blurry object in the back.

776
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,940
It's gonna devour me.

777
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,780
Oh wow.

778
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,260
Make me live in him.

779
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,580
I think there's really something to it being part of nature

780
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,100
because nature is I think on some level scary to us.

781
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,940
Storms, scary.

782
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,940
Rain, scary.

783
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,380
Especially when you're a kid.

784
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,460
And I'm remembering now and I've looked up

785
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,820
to just to confirm rock, a rock structure.

786
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,340
Well you love fake rocks, but I don't think

787
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,660
you guys will like the Return to Oz character,

788
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,180
the Gnome King.

789
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,940
He is, he manifests himself in a bunch of rocks

790
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,300
with a face and I will walk around and show,

791
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,700
you gotta get, look up the Gnome King.

792
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

793
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,860
Go to image.

794
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:42,380
And obviously they're making him look scary, but boy.

795
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,540
Oh, you know what?

796
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,660
You know what the problem with the Gnome King is,

797
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,860
is his big real eyes.

798
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:51,540
It's the disc, if he had kind of abstract pebble eyes,

799
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,620
no problem.

800
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:57,620
I think this is the, it's the combo of natural structures

801
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,100
with being humanized.

802
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,580
Like stone and flesh should not meet.

803
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,740
Bark and flesh should not meet.

804
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,460
Yes, there's something like even more,

805
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,460
like obviously as a kid seeing the fly

806
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,660
some Cronenberg movie would freak you out.

807
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,660
But imagine, yeah, like it's being a kid

808
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,500
and like, oh, the grass is alive.

809
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,020
This, like this big, the bunch of like rocks

810
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,780
that are in this field are alive.

811
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,940
The tree is alive.

812
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,900
And for some reason in media, they went with tree mode,

813
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,660
cause tree makes the most sense because it's got arms.

814
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,820
It looks like a human body.

815
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,980
So it's the easiest to anthropomorphize.

816
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:39,860
So, so like your world, on top of it,

817
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,060
just looking straight up creepy.

818
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,060
Your world view has to change.

819
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,860
You have to think as a kid,

820
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,980
yeah, there's a chance.

821
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,820
There's a chance.

822
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,660
Yeah, yeah, I have to allow for this possibility.

823
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,980
I was already afraid of the trees

824
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,460
because I know I can get lost in them

825
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,340
and there could be like murderers in there.

826
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,740
But on top of it, the trees might be alive too.

827
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,580
Jesus Christ.

828
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,980
So the gnome king, you know, you're not coming up.

829
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,660
There's not as many, you saw the,

830
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,500
you see the pictures.

831
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,340
I saw the gnome king.

832
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,220
Yeah, it is the eyes, I think, do it.

833
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,420
If it was just a stone figure.

834
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,780
Well, you're showing us this final form of him.

835
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,620
Yeah, that's right.

836
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,140
But that's even worse.

837
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,420
That's really insane.

838
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,980
Well, I don't know, in a way he's like goofier.

839
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,260
I think I maybe don't like the gray version.

840
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,100
He's, yeah.

841
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,940
You are certain that Return to Oz

842
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,540
is more unnerving than The Wiz?

843
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,940
Or is it just a different way?

844
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,460
Because there's some unnerving design work in The Wiz.

845
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,460
The Wiz is a little different.

846
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,580
It's a different sort of unnerving,

847
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,380
but there's some creepy, I think Return to Oz more so,

848
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,060
but I, your mileage may vary.

849
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,580
Let me get into one that,

850
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:48,060
because these exist in Theme Parkdom as well, obviously.

851
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:52,380
And this idea, it got back in my head

852
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,700
after we talked about Adventureland with Gabrus,

853
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,660
and there was something, we definitely played this clip.

854
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,900
There's something at Adventureland,

855
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,580
otherwise pretty unthemed.

856
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,660
There's not a lot of like mythology and IP there,

857
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,700
but they seem to love and be proud of their character,

858
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,300
the haunted tree.

859
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,460
And let me just refresh your memory on this.

860
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,500
["The Haunted Tree"]

861
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,340
Heh.

862
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,940
["The Haunted Tree"]

863
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,780
Oh my God.

864
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,540
["The Haunted Tree"]

865
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,020
Jesus Christ, oh my God.

866
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,220
Yeah, that audio on that really

867
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,820
takes it up a couple levels of crazy.

868
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,260
Yeah, the first voice I believe in there was an owl.

869
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,420
That was an owl living in the tree.

870
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,060
And then it pitched down even crazier.

871
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,580
I mean, this really, and like, yeah, I'm no fan of it.

872
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,300
The head could not be bigger here.

873
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,220
This is like big gnarled roots.

874
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,420
This face is, you know, twice as big,

875
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,220
three times as big as the Sunkist trees.

876
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,860
Look, if you're scared of it,

877
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,540
that's why you want it there,

878
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,660
because it's effectively scary, sure.

879
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,580
But like, this is very, why would you like this?

880
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,300
Why would anyone like this tree?

881
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,980
Yeah, oh, it's so unpleasant, and that noise.

882
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,940
And it's also, you can hear the bad recording.

883
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,980
It's crazy.

884
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,100
Yes, yeah.

885
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,660
Wait, let me rank that one.

886
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,820
That's a, it still might be a four.

887
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,820
Well, oddly, I would give that a four

888
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,500
where I give the Sunkist trees a five.

889
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,340
You didn't see that.

890
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,220
And I give an extra, I give a five and a half.

891
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,780
I need another half apple for that all white one.

892
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,500
You didn't see, yeah, you didn't see it

893
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,020
when you were a kid, this tree.

894
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,860
That's really the difference.

895
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,100
If I had ended up at Adventureland,

896
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,100
I mean, I would have been just afraid

897
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,900
of like a confident New Jersey resident to me.

898
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,900
That would have scared me forever.

899
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,620
That would be the topic of this episode.

900
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,660
Yeah, yeah, my biggest fear.

901
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,340
Men who are comfortable with themselves.

902
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,180
That's right.

903
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,940
Okay, so there's that one.

904
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:07,940
But when you're talking trees in physical environments,

905
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,620
the one probably a lot of people are going to

906
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,620
is the Rainforest Cafe tree.

907
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,140
There's a lot of those.

908
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,460
I would imagine every Rainforest Cafe

909
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:22,860
has some iteration of their tree, which is Tracy Tree.

910
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,620
Now, I know I'm not alone in this one.

911
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:30,980
Again, as I said, Erin does not share this fear at all.

912
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,940
Every tree that I showed her,

913
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,500
before I turned the laptop around, I would go like, ugh.

914
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,300
And then I'd turn around and she would smile or giggle.

915
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,060
She doesn't have this one bit.

916
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,820
But I know that people are afraid

917
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,540
of the Rainforest Cafe tree.

918
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:49,580
There's weird mythology, creepy pasta stories

919
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:53,940
about the tree, and a Reddit post with the title,

920
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,940
whoever designed the talking tree in Rainforest Cafe

921
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,300
can go fuck themselves.

922
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,740
So I get a little bit of backup here.

923
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:06,740
Even though most Tracy's, I would only give three apples.

924
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:10,500
Yeah, there's a little bit of a different,

925
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,860
some of them have different looks.

926
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,940
They're all destroyed, I think, now at this point.

927
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,620
I think I'm the most unsettled by the wear and tear.

928
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,780
I think it's the possibility of wear and tear.

929
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,340
Wherever these Sunkist trees are rotting away,

930
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,300
they must be so hideous at this point.

931
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,300
This one has just, the paint is just so chipped.

932
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,620
Some of them have different eye colors, which is interesting.

933
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,740
Some are blue, some are brown, some are gray.

934
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:42,460
There is a wide range within the Tracy trees.

935
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,940
These are all supposed to be the same characters.

936
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,820
And like I said, most, I would say, are three.

937
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,140
I'll show you some threes over here.

938
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,260
Basic model, I'm unnerved by these eyes, right?

939
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:58,300
Big wide eyes, but it's kind of standard issue.

940
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:02,940
The more severe and angular the features get,

941
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,540
I get a little bit freaked out.

942
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,220
And then we get into, okay, that's-

943
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,740
Okay, yeah, some of these sculpts aren't great.

944
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,300
At least three and a half, right?

945
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,260
Yeah. And kind of the ghostly white.

946
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,980
When it doesn't match the color,

947
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:20,460
when the animatronic face part isn't the same color

948
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,740
as the tree base, which is not animated.

949
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,580
Don't like that.

950
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,860
Yeah, an up and running and well kept up Tracy.

951
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,260
I always liked seeing Tracy tree.

952
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,820
Yeah, that's what you said when you,

953
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,460
now you look, you haven't weighed in a ton.

954
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,620
I don't think you have this fear.

955
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,780
I don't really have this fear.

956
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,220
Certainly unnerved by the Wizard of Oz,

957
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:46,620
when I would see it as a child and just see random scenes.

958
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,460
Kind of, I think if you watch the whole movie,

959
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,260
the dust bowl stuff at the beginning and end

960
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,500
is also a little unsettling for different reasons.

961
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,700
Cause you see what it was like when you were a kid.

962
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,540
Yeah.

963
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,380
So yeah.

964
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:06,540
So I, yeah, but I think part trees,

965
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,780
I think it's kind of a case by case basis.

966
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,900
I don't have, I remember Tracy tree.

967
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:15,060
As a kid, I find it more scary actually now, I feel like

968
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,580
than it doesn't stick out to me.

969
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:20,300
Cause I remember her, her, him, Tracy, female tree.

970
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,180
It is a female voice.

971
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,020
Female tree.

972
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,540
But now that I see it here, I go,

973
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,660
oh, that is a little scarier.

974
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,500
But I was so thrilled to be in the Rainforest Cafe.

975
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,380
Everything was a magic.

976
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,700
It's easy to miss Tracy tree.

977
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,660
There's a lot going on.

978
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,460
So you aren't forced to spend time with Tracy tree.

979
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,620
Yeah, I think now I'm most unnerved

980
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,700
by like a non-active Tracy tree,

981
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:45,700
like five feet away from a stack of like the book.

982
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,900
The Tillman Fertitta book, which Scott,

983
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,300
I mentioned this to Mike,

984
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:53,220
but I don't think I mentioned it to you that I only just

985
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,340
in the last few weeks learned about Tillman Fertitta's

986
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,580
family's multi-generational mob connection.

987
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,020
Oh, oh boy.

988
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,100
So that was a fun discovery.

989
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,260
There's some guy stuff.

990
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,900
That's great.

991
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,500
Grandfather and uncle ran like the gambling

992
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,620
and different operations in Galveston, Texas.

993
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,460
And yeah.

994
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,460
Texas mob.

995
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,740
Texas mob.

996
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,740
Future episode.

997
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,820
Galveston mob.

998
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,660
I mean all the big.

999
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,100
We got a lot of Galveston to get into.

1000
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,460
I don't even know where to begin.

1001
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,300
Club three,

1002
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,580
because we don't want to get in trouble with them.

1003
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,420
Yeah, no.

1004
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,500
Let's go as deep as we can.

1005
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,060
I mean, the building blocks are vacant.

1006
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,060
I'm reading a book about Benny Binion,

1007
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,340
the namesake of Binion's casino on Fremont Street.

1008
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,180
Oh, right.

1009
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:38,460
He was a bootlegger to start.

1010
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,300
He was a bootlegger.

1011
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,580
And the book starts with like,

1012
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,180
well, Benny Binion didn't always do his own killing,

1013
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,180
but sometimes like, it's like, oh, okay.

1014
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,300
It's still the name.

1015
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,820
It's a tribute to the, whoa.

1016
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,660
Yeah.

1017
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:53,140
This guy's a here and I, Oscar,

1018
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,260
the guy, I forget his last name.

1019
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,540
There's a steakhouse named after him at the Plaza Casino.

1020
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,980
He was the mayor of Vegas.

1021
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,900
His wife is now the mayor of Vegas,

1022
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,060
but he was also a mob lawyer.

1023
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,020
Although he insists there's no such thing as the mob.

1024
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,540
By the way, his steakhouse is just down the street

1025
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,620
from the Mob Museum in Vegas.

1026
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,460
Oh, okay.

1027
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,260
So, lot of interesting Vegas mob stuff.

1028
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,100
Yeah.

1029
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:17,920
What a zone.

1030
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,020
All right by Neonopolis,

1031
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,940
the shadiest mall in the world.

1032
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,420
Yeah.

1033
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,220
I also, you know what I forgot is that,

1034
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,780
here's another variant with Tracy,

1035
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,740
or variable rather, is the degree,

1036
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,700
look, like kind of small,

1037
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,300
her lips are often black.

1038
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,180
Right.

1039
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,340
Like a witch's might be.

1040
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,060
So that's a little unsettling,

1041
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,340
but the bigger the lips get,

1042
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,620
that like I'm more scared.

1043
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,220
This is like, oh wait, I'm gonna go with,

1044
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,980
this is a, we started with a three,

1045
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,740
then I like the giant black lips

1046
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,420
and her face is falling apart and the color is weird.

1047
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,740
This is I think a three and a half.

1048
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:55,060
And then I take it up to four with just red human lipstick.

1049
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:55,900
Ooh weird.

1050
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,740
And eyeshadow.

1051
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,580
There's full makeup.

1052
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,420
Yeah, there's a full face.

1053
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,460
Thin eyebrows?

1054
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,460
What are you thinking?

1055
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,300
Why?

1056
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,900
Here's what I think it makes her actually scarier

1057
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,100
than some of the other ones,

1058
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,420
is that she feels like she's a person trapped

1059
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:12,140
inside the tree and her head is poking out of the tree

1060
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,660
because she's like doomed to live as a tree

1061
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,100
for the rest of her days.

1062
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,140
You think this is a curse.

1063
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:17,980
The other, right.

1064
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,700
Doesn't it seem like it versus the Sunkist trees

1065
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,980
who like have their faces more in the shape of.

1066
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:23,940
More integrated.

1067
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,900
Right, exactly.

1068
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,260
This feels like a human face is bulging out of a tree,

1069
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,620
which means something has gone terribly wrong.

1070
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:33,660
Why would a tree have a human face emerging from it

1071
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,900
unless it was a person that was cursed?

1072
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,900
This might be, maybe this is a reason why the tree mafia

1073
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,980
might want me and might devour me.

1074
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,820
What if I get eaten by a Sunkist tree

1075
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,140
and I'm kind of like kicked around the center of the earth

1076
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:54,020
by roots, I'm like physically kicked around

1077
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:58,020
until they find a rainforest cafe that needs a face.

1078
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:02,380
Then my face is like stretched bigger than it is.

1079
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,660
I'm like, I'm made big and then shoved out of that,

1080
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,220
but my body's gone.

1081
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,460
So I have no bodily agency anymore.

1082
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:13,100
I, yeah, I think we could probably differentiate.

1083
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:16,700
Grandmother Willow and Tracy are in the same category

1084
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,980
of people trapped.

1085
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,460
And the other ones are pure trees come to life.

1086
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:26,460
I think that Grandmother Willow is less of a,

1087
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:30,660
it's less scary because that's a reborn situation.

1088
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,340
I think that's maybe a good thing

1089
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,340
that she gets to exist in some way.

1090
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,660
Right, at the very least.

1091
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:38,220
And communicate with her family.

1092
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,540
Tracy's alone, I think.

1093
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,940
I think Tracy's nowhere near.

1094
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,060
She doesn't always seem happy.

1095
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:44,900
That's true.

1096
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,940
There's some miserable Tracy trees.

1097
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:47,780
Yeah.

1098
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,660
It's a good point.

1099
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,780
I'm wondering if this is the time for me to bring up

1100
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,700
some things that I discovered.

1101
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:00,420
So I was unsure where to start with this.

1102
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,820
So sometimes if I'm,

1103
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,460
if I wanna just get the gears moving

1104
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,980
and looking stuff up,

1105
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:08,700
I will just type in a very broad generic phrase into Google

1106
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,940
just to start opening tabs and stuff.

1107
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:15,620
So I typed in animatronic trees theme parks.

1108
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:20,620
And I found the companies who make these trees.

1109
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,620
Like manufacture these trees.

1110
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,660
So I wanna get your feedback.

1111
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:28,660
So this first one is called Dino Make.

1112
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:31,660
And this is just on a list of trees

1113
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,340
you would possibly buy from them.

1114
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,180
Here's.

1115
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,500
That's a three.

1116
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,020
Not a fan, but just in the middle.

1117
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,660
And not the scariest I've ever seen.

1118
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,420
Here's a sample of one of their products.

1119
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:46,820
This is a big tree and it's moving around.

1120
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:47,980
It's moving its face.

1121
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,060
It's moving its arms.

1122
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,500
Oh, I don't like it.

1123
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,060
Now that he's moving four.

1124
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:53,900
Okay.

1125
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,340
So that's Dino Make,

1126
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:01,340
which is located in the Sichuan province in China.

1127
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,780
There does seem to be a lot of Chinese manufacturers

1128
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:05,620
of big animatronic trees.

1129
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,740
Yeah, now this is a little more of a big wise tree.

1130
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:12,420
This is the company is called My Dinosaurs.

1131
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,420
What do you think about this one?

1132
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,220
I'd have to see it move.

1133
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,060
Yeah.

1134
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:17,880
Okay.

1135
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,620
Let's see if I can get this,

1136
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,700
get this going.

1137
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:25,780
Cause this, this'll kind of, kind of move, I think.

1138
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,860
You didn't buy one, did you?

1139
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,700
No.

1140
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,060
Well, yeah, this eye is just.

1141
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,340
Put it up in my front yard.

1142
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,500
Blinking.

1143
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,340
Yeah.

1144
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:41,260
If that came to life and started slapping shit around,

1145
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,360
then that that's potentially a four,

1146
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,340
but I'm gonna leave it at three for now.

1147
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,300
Okay.

1148
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:51,300
So that's, that's My Dinosaurs located in Zigong, China.

1149
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:58,140
Now this chunky fellow, big talking tree for theme park.

1150
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:02,500
This is from a company called Only Dinosaurs.

1151
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,860
Of course, Only Dinosaurs is also located

1152
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,860
in the Sichuan province in China.

1153
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,780
What do you think about him?

1154
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:10,980
This is a little small.

1155
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,980
Can you, can you play that video bigger?

1156
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,700
Yeah, let me try this.

1157
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:15,540
Oh my God.

1158
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:16,780
Oh my God.

1159
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,580
This guy's got real chubby cheeks.

1160
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,980
Let me see, let me see it move.

1161
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:21,820
Okay.

1162
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,820
That's really the, cause you know,

1163
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:25,500
still I'm not too afraid of any of them,

1164
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,860
but it's that motion.

1165
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:31,860
This animatronic talking tree, these companies,

1166
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:35,860
by the way, for as much as they're called like Only

1167
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:39,820
Dinosaur or My Dinosaur, they sell a lot of other stuff.

1168
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:40,660
It's not a dinosaur.

1169
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:41,480
Yeah.

1170
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,440
Hmm.

1171
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,400
These are real closeups of the moving branches

1172
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,440
with like public domain music.

1173
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,560
I think these are fantastically made.

1174
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,400
Yeah, they look great.

1175
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,760
There's real crafts.

1176
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,800
Now I'll tell you that that last one that we showed,

1177
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,920
they did say in the world of the tree,

1178
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,240
the talk, the world of the child,

1179
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,160
the talking tree is a symbol of kindness and wisdom.

1180
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,640
What?

1181
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,240
So how do you feel about that?

1182
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,080
No?

1183
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,120
No, it's incorrect.

1184
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,080
Okay.

1185
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,000
They don't know children.

1186
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,920
They know this person never met a child.

1187
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,240
Well, their description ends with whoever sees

1188
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,880
this big talking tree will be very fond of it.

1189
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,680
Now look, I, very fond.

1190
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,280
Jason might be.

1191
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,120
I might be.

1192
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:29,240
I mean, and all of these ones, by the way,

1193
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:34,240
you're looking between 1000 and like $5,500.

1194
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,120
Now.

1195
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,360
Surprisingly not that crazy.

1196
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,840
Surprisingly inexpensive.

1197
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,840
And on Alibaba, I found a bunch for sale.

1198
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,200
Okay.

1199
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,680
Also with different companies

1200
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,480
in the Sichuan province in China.

1201
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,440
So that's your, Sichuan is your one stop shop for,

1202
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,680
you could, you go to Sichuan, load up on.

1203
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,760
Yeah, I get a bunch of them.

1204
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,560
10 animatronic trees.

1205
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,400
Yeah.

1206
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,720
As long as you can handle the shipping on that.

1207
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,800
This is the place to go.

1208
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,680
And I, and then just sort of like off the beaten path,

1209
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,720
I guess you'd say, I found them.

1210
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,600
There is a ski resort in Japan called Rutsutsu.

1211
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,440
Okay.

1212
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,280
And they have a big indoor complex

1213
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,480
with like a fake European village

1214
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,560
and like an animatronic band of like dogs

1215
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,160
dressed in barbershop gear.

1216
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,000
Whoa.

1217
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,920
And then they just have this tree.

1218
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:27,760
Okay.

1219
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,000
Sort of moving in the lobby.

1220
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,160
I'm not too.

1221
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,000
These are all.

1222
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,920
Upset by this one.

1223
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,040
These are all kind of the same.

1224
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,280
They don't feel like humans trapped in trees either.

1225
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,720
They more feel like tree come to life.

1226
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,200
It's about, we figured it out.

1227
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,120
It's about trunk integration.

1228
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:46,960
It is trunk.

1229
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,640
How well do you blend in with your trunk?

1230
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,040
Yes.

1231
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,920
If I sense any face.

1232
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,280
I've texted you both a photo from the cartoon movie

1233
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,760
of the last unicorn.

1234
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,600
And this is something I was not,

1235
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,440
this is not from my childhood,

1236
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,280
this is from Lindsay's childhood.

1237
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,120
And we watched this movie a couple of years ago

1238
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:10,160
and there is a very scary tree

1239
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,120
that I've mentioned before on this show.

1240
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,080
It's pretty upsetting.

1241
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,440
It's a very bosomy tree.

1242
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,280
Yeah.

1243
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,240
And I was like, is this an ass?

1244
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:23,240
No, it's a lady tree that captures the character

1245
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,520
in her tree bosom.

1246
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,560
It's like squeezes someone.

1247
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,400
Basically.

1248
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,240
Yeah.

1249
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,080
That's what we're seeing happen.

1250
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,240
That's what you're seeing in this photo.

1251
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,960
You can see by even this like the drawing and the lines,

1252
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,160
it's very unnerving.

1253
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,560
This is someone on earth's exact fetish.

1254
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,720
This is like. 100% it is.

1255
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,560
That's what they saw at the right time.

1256
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,360
To get smothered by a lady tree's tree bosom.

1257
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,920
It's a bunch of things at once.

1258
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,440
It's anthropomorphized and smothering

1259
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,920
and trapped in gigantism.

1260
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,760
Yeah. Yeah.

1261
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,600
There's a lot going on there.

1262
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,280
Enjoy, well enjoy that it came up

1263
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,760
if you're one of those people and you're here.

1264
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,600
Finally it did.

1265
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,440
Yeah.

1266
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,280
They talked about it.

1267
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,080
That's weird.

1268
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,120
Animation doesn't factor in a lot for me

1269
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,360
because animation you can blend.

1270
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,200
Yeah. Yeah.

1271
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,320
Not gonna be good trunk integration.

1272
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,640
Right.

1273
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,840
Maybe I haven't been afraid of an animated talking tree.

1274
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,600
You have a yard.

1275
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,680
So you would not consider getting one of these trees

1276
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,080
that you can order.

1277
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,240
No.

1278
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,320
Cause if I had a yard

1279
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,880
and a spare thousand dollars sitting around.

1280
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,520
You would get an animatronic tree.

1281
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,080
I would consider reaching out.

1282
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,040
I think I'd be concerned.

1283
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,240
What is the shipping from the Sichuan province?

1284
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,080
We all want.

1285
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,880
And how you program it and all those things.

1286
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,880
We all want an officer Big Mac McDonald play place

1287
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,240
in our yard.

1288
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,080
Yeah.

1289
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:45,920
We do want that.

1290
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,160
Even if we don't have children.

1291
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,000
Yeah.

1292
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Which we've seen priced out in a few thousand dollar range

1293
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,720
up to 10,000 or more.

1294
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,560
Yeah.

1295
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,760
But a robot tree seems like a lot of maintenance.

1296
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,080
Yeah.

1297
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,720
And I don't think you actually want to keep those outdoors.

1298
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,840
I think that that's where the wear and tear.

1299
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,640
Look how bad the wear and tear is on Tracy.

1300
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,720
And she's indoors.

1301
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:07,560
Yeah.

1302
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,080
I think the elements can't be.

1303
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,000
Although certainly a lot are kept outdoors.

1304
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,840
Yeah.

1305
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,960
Just due to their, well, including a,

1306
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,840
I was like, I don't know this offhand,

1307
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,400
but I would be shocked if there was not one in Efteling.

1308
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:26,200
And Efteling is like you had 20 times the budget

1309
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,400
to do that Adventureland one.

1310
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,040
Take a look at this Efteling,

1311
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,120
which I think is just called the fairy tale tree,

1312
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,120
but I could be mistaken.

1313
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,240
Here's Efteling.

1314
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,800
What do you think on scariness of this?

1315
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,720
I think, this I showed to Erin and she's like,

1316
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,720
well, that's a macula.

1317
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,720
This is like an incredible.

1318
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,560
It looks great.

1319
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,400
Yeah.

1320
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,520
His brow being so furrowed is a little unnerving.

1321
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,160
But the fluidness of the mouth,

1322
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,600
I think makes it less scary.

1323
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,200
Yeah.

1324
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,440
I think even a good example of tree mouth undulation

1325
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,280
bothers me.

1326
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,520
Yeah, he's kind of scary.

1327
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,560
I respect the craft of this a lot.

1328
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,400
Yeah.

1329
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,320
But I don't, I think I might be walking by kind of quick

1330
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,880
if I ever move to Efteling.

1331
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,520
By the way, these fabrication companies,

1332
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,280
some of them are like, we've worked with clients like IKEA

1333
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,640
or the video game company Square NX.

1334
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:31,480
The, one of them had shots of like their thing

1335
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,320
in the Bellagio conservatory that they update every season,

1336
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,520
like this sort of.

1337
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,400
Oh, has there been a tree in there?

1338
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,920
I'm sure they have.

1339
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,800
They do like three or four of those a year.

1340
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,600
I'm sure one of these have shown up.

1341
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,600
Oh, listeners, if you've ever been in the Bellagio

1342
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,960
and there's been a big talk, oh, which that in general,

1343
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,840
send us your talking to what talking trees have haunted you

1344
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,840
or delighted you.

1345
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,680
I don't mean to dictate the conversation.

1346
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,360
Jason, is there a chance that you could get a talking tree

1347
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,760
and like use it as furniture?

1348
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,080
Like you could sit in its mouth and read a book.

1349
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,880
I didn't see any as furniture.

1350
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,720
What I did see.

1351
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,480
No, no, he's gonna fall in.

1352
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,280
I'm just saying he really wants to purchase a tree

1353
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,480
and I'm trying to think of a practical way

1354
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,320
to get it inside the house.

1355
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,760
I think it's more decorative than anything else,

1356
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,880
but I would think you would need a yard for just size.

1357
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,360
But the thing I did come across,

1358
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,080
all these dinosaur fabricating companies,

1359
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,400
when you went through testimonials,

1360
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:31,560
there's like theme parks, zoos, museums, traveling shows.

1361
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:34,160
But if you kept crawling down on the one website,

1362
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,680
you would just see like someone credited as dino lover.

1363
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:42,000
And I was like, oh, these are just individuals

1364
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,120
who have purchased the dinosaurs to have.

1365
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:45,960
So you could.

1366
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,840
So you could.

1367
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,640
It sounds like Jason really wants a tree.

1368
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,480
Yeah, I know.

1369
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,920
Now I sort of want, as much as I don't wanna see a tree

1370
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,800
and have one.

1371
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,880
I want Jason to own a tree.

1372
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,320
Yeah, yeah.

1373
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,600
I don't, well, how much, how crazy is that

1374
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,800
if you had to put a cap on the shipping,

1375
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,520
what's the full project?

1376
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,360
What are you willing to invest?

1377
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:07,280
I am concerned that like say a $2,000 tree

1378
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,040
is coming with $1,000 of shipping.

1379
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:10,880
Yeah. Yeah.

1380
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,700
Big time.

1381
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,880
That's gotta be the heaviest thing.

1382
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:17,080
Unless you go get it and bring it on the plane.

1383
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,560
That is true.

1384
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,000
What's the assembly like, you know?

1385
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:21,840
Yeah.

1386
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,680
Do they have to send a guy?

1387
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,520
And then that's labor.

1388
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,360
Oh yeah.

1389
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,180
Yeah, labor.

1390
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,020
Absolutely.

1391
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:29,440
Okay, say, okay, you're talking to the people over in China

1392
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,320
about making you a tree and they go, all right,

1393
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,080
here's the deal, it's 1500 bucks.

1394
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,560
For an extra 500, we can make the tree very busty.

1395
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,280
Do you do it?

1396
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,360
Bustiness is not my concern with the tree.

1397
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,680
I think width.

1398
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,560
I think the wider it gets, the chubbier cheek it gets,

1399
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,640
I think it gets less scary.

1400
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,560
I disagree.

1401
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,520
You disagree.

1402
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,440
Like I said about Groot, I like skinniness.

1403
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,280
You got to.

1404
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,120
Bulbas freaks me out.

1405
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:01,760
You get to design the tree to your specifications.

1406
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,880
Yeah.

1407
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,640
That's, yeah, yeah, yeah, well, take us through,

1408
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,760
yeah, what choices are you?

1409
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,640
And if you had to pick one that you have,

1410
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,780
what you just showed us,

1411
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,400
what's the most important element?

1412
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,400
And when you're choosing your Chinese animatronic tree,

1413
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,680
what's element number one?

1414
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,480
Yeah, that's a good question.

1415
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,360
Do you want the face to be close to the ground

1416
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,560
or do you want it to have some height?

1417
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,360
Close to the ground is where we've never seen

1418
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,200
close to the ground.

1419
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,440
Well, but you know what I guess what I mean by that

1420
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,160
is like some of the stuff you were showing, Jason,

1421
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,320
the mouth is kind of like three feet off the ground

1422
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,160
or two feet off the ground.

1423
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,880
It's not sort of Wizard of Oz style

1424
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,160
where the mouth is more where a human head would be.

1425
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,400
Oh, this is lower, I guess.

1426
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,840
Yeah, this is lower.

1427
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:39,680
It's chubby cheek.

1428
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:44,680
The eyes are very expressive on the only dinosaur model.

1429
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,040
Also, all of these show different pictures

1430
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,960
with different, they assure you it can be customized.

1431
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,480
Oh, look at this guy.

1432
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,000
This guy's got like googly eyes.

1433
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:59,560
Oh.

1434
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,380
Would you want that?

1435
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:01,480
Weird, is that yours?

1436
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:02,320
Yeah.

1437
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,520
No, I don't.

1438
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,880
I think if you could configure it to googly eyes,

1439
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,720
like this one's older, this one looks more like a hobbit.

1440
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,560
I don't like that.

1441
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,380
No.

1442
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:12,400
The Hobbit, the cartoon Hobbit nature.

1443
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,480
No, that's out for me.

1444
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,200
Oh, this one is facial hair.

1445
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,040
That looks like Frank Zappa.

1446
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,720
This one is Frank Zappa.

1447
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,560
He does.

1448
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,520
Frank Zappa, weird.

1449
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,000
The Muppet News Reporter, what's his name?

1450
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:23,840
Right, right.

1451
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,680
Huh, Guy Smiley?

1452
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:27,520
Yeah, yeah.

1453
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,960
Yeah, like I think this, I'm reasonably certain

1454
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,160
this is the Bellagio in the background of this.

1455
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,520
Oh, that does seem, that feels like Bellagio style.

1456
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,800
Yeah.

1457
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,080
Well, I don't mind that mustache one at all.

1458
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,440
That's a half apple for me.

1459
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,280
Okay.

1460
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,180
So I'm trying to think, yeah, what would I want in a tree?

1461
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,040
I guess I would want it more low to the ground

1462
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,160
because then it's less scary

1463
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,760
because it's less like the Wizard of Oz tree.

1464
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:54,000
Yeah, also, if you put this in a yard,

1465
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,520
birds are gonna fuck this up.

1466
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,240
Animals are gonna fuck this up.

1467
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,680
You're the one who wants it.

1468
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,080
Yeah, don't put it in the yard, Jason, you can't.

1469
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:02,920
You gotta put it in.

1470
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:03,740
I guess.

1471
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:04,580
You gotta put it in.

1472
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:05,420
That's like a boat.

1473
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,880
Now you have a boat with the added expense of it

1474
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,240
that has to come from China

1475
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,700
and you have to program a little animatronic show

1476
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,880
to make it blink or else it just stays there dead.

1477
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,000
You gotta put it inside the house,

1478
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,560
you gotta have the tree's mouth open

1479
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,440
and you gotta put part of your bed in it

1480
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,640
so you sleep in your bed,

1481
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,640
but hardly under the tree or in its mouth.

1482
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,600
Hardly gnawing on it.

1483
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,900
Yeah, head in.

1484
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,640
Your head will be inside the tree.

1485
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,640
No, an MRI.

1486
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,960
No.

1487
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:32,800
A tree MRI machine.

1488
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,480
Oh, this is my nightmare.

1489
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,200
You're just, don't make Jason get partially swallowed.

1490
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,160
No, this is, no, the trees want it.

1491
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,000
That's what you're playing right into their hands.

1492
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,280
Bards are big clown beds.

1493
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,200
They're big bark hands.

1494
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,760
The tree hands grabbing the bed

1495
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,440
and pulling the bed into its mouth.

1496
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,680
This is the way Jason gets eaten.

1497
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,640
But that's why he wants to go out.

1498
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:57,280
I mean, if you had a large entryway

1499
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,440
like in the ski resort hotel,

1500
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,120
like I think just walking in, you were greeted.

1501
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,400
So you had the nicest house.

1502
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,240
Yeah.

1503
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,740
Like with a ceiling that big,

1504
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:10,600
we're talking, you gotta be in the palisades.

1505
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,240
Hey, you gotta remove, I don't want the chandelier,

1506
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,040
I don't want the stock chandelier.

1507
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,400
Take it out entirely.

1508
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,600
Cause I got a big tree coming in.

1509
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,740
Like, oh, you want an indoor tree?

1510
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:21,720
Well, not quite.

1511
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,560
Now, now.

1512
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,680
You're adding expenses.

1513
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,840
Now you have to have the chandel,

1514
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,840
the existing chandelier removed.

1515
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,440
That's a difficult job.

1516
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,280
Yeah.

1517
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,120
This is on top of that,

1518
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,440
you've clearly purchased a $3 million home.

1519
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,280
Right.

1520
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,120
And there's a tree in every room.

1521
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:39,200
Well, but if you, if you sell the chandelier.

1522
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,040
That seems weird.

1523
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,720
I don't think you're finding another buyer

1524
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,920
for a used chandelier.

1525
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,160
That has to transport so easily and there's so much room

1526
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,240
for breaking.

1527
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,620
When Jason becomes the like flow of Hulu

1528
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:55,120
and he's on every commercial for a decade

1529
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:55,960
and he like just racks the money up.

1530
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,680
Well, when the other Hulu guys get eliminated.

1531
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,520
Yeah, well Jason's gotta do that.

1532
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,880
They get taken out like the cave,

1533
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,680
the Geico cavemen who didn't matter.

1534
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,520
Right, right.

1535
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,280
When it becomes only you, your grand scheme.

1536
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,960
So then you have the $3 million house.

1537
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,400
There'll be a tree in every room.

1538
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,560
There'll be a tree integrated in every room.

1539
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,240
What's the clearance?

1540
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,600
What's the clearance in this room for the ceiling?

1541
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,880
For like a tree, an animatronic tree.

1542
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,320
The toilet will be a stump.

1543
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,160
Yeah.

1544
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,880
You poop into the.

1545
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:25,040
Like Inspector Gadget or with a garbage can.

1546
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:25,880
Or no, you go into it.

1547
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,440
This isn't like Inspector Gadget at all.

1548
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,440
He didn't have a stump in the toilet.

1549
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,720
In the opening he shits in a stump, right?

1550
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,560
That's the opening of it.

1551
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,240
Not in the one I watched.

1552
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,360
That's what happens.

1553
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,200
Yeah.

1554
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,360
They didn't make it part of the song.

1555
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:43,280
At least it happens in the French Stewart sequel.

1556
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,400
Inspector Gadget 2.

1557
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,240
Yeah.

1558
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,440
That's deep in the straight to video.

1559
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,440
You know, I have become a bit of a plant guy

1560
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,280
in the last couple of years.

1561
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,080
I have a bunch of succulents, tiny succulents.

1562
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,360
So that's what this is all about.

1563
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,720
You're a plant guy.

1564
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,080
Yeah, so I could see expanding this.

1565
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,360
So do you want talking flowers as well?

1566
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,160
You know, I think that's a different,

1567
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,000
like we were asking.

1568
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,840
Fetish?

1569
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,160
I'm asking Scott about the,

1570
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:13,920
these are from versions of a creature from Chomper

1571
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,280
in Plants vs. Zombies.

1572
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,120
What are you talking about?

1573
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:18,960
Chomper?

1574
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,320
In Dino Make sells these plants.

1575
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,560
They call it Chomper?

1576
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,120
His name is Chomper in the game Plants vs. Zombies.

1577
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:33,120
These are fabrications of some of the creatures, I think.

1578
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,040
And I think the scary plants that have like teeth and claws

1579
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,680
and stuff, that's a different thing.

1580
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,280
That's meant to be scary.

1581
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,080
I'm not going, we are not recording in Jason's mansion

1582
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,520
when this works out.

1583
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:49,280
When Jason is still earning his pittance compared

1584
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,080
to what he's made in this being the flow of Hulu.

1585
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:53,920
Yeah.

1586
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,800
I better throw a bone to the guys.

1587
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,040
We'll still do it.

1588
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,720
All right, make some room between my myriad

1589
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,240
of animatronic chompers.

1590
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,680
Sexy flowers.

1591
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,320
We can record in the greenhouse.

1592
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:12,040
They're not, when you boil it down to the practical reality

1593
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:15,200
of like, oh, where do theme parks get these creatures from?

1594
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,880
Where does like Hershey Parker, Dutch Wonderland,

1595
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,440
like where do they get these plants?

1596
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,200
And I mentioned those because like some of these websites

1597
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,640
mentioned we fabricated stuff for these parks

1598
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,000
and such and such.

1599
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,880
If you're willing to spend like a MacBook Air's worth

1600
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,560
of money to get an ant, you can have one of these.

1601
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,240
You are willing, it sounds like.

1602
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,440
I mean, I'm curious.

1603
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,360
I'm curious.

1604
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,200
I'm curious about the-

1605
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,760
You brought in an extra dollar for certain beer,

1606
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,720
but this, 1,500 bucks for a talking tree is here.

1607
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,320
Absolutely not 899.

1608
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:50,640
Ooh, now, $5,000.

1609
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,160
A guy, a little animatronic guy from my home.

1610
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,720
I think this is gonna happen.

1611
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:56,960
I love that you're a plant guy.

1612
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:57,800
I didn't even know that.

1613
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:02,800
Yeah, I have bought some off the like adoption shelf,

1614
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,240
they call it.

1615
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,160
They're looking a little winded,

1616
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,800
but I take them home, give them some sunlight,

1617
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,400
water them and keep an eye on them.

1618
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,240
You can bring them back to life.

1619
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,120
You're like a hard luck case

1620
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,640
as far as the plants are concerned.

1621
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:14,720
I do like a hard luck case.

1622
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,920
Look, this is very nice

1623
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,600
and I'm happy you're enjoying being a plant guy,

1624
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,520
but this is madness to act like this is somehow

1625
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,600
the same thing.

1626
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,640
So because you have five succulents,

1627
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,840
therefore it would make sense for you to buy

1628
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:28,440
a several thousand dollar Chinese animatronic tree.

1629
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,760
I'm just considering.

1630
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,200
Wow. I'm considering.

1631
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,680
I want you to do all of it.

1632
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,920
I'm not discouraging any of it.

1633
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,240
I just don't know if like I took care of a cactus

1634
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,480
is proof that the infrastructure

1635
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:42,680
is gonna work itself out.

1636
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,240
Well, I'm sure the sticker shock,

1637
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,440
the actual reality,

1638
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,000
like my car lease ended and I went,

1639
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,640
I'm just gonna buy it.

1640
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,840
And I was at the dealership for three hours yesterday.

1641
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:56,400
I thought like, all right, I'm just gonna buy it.

1642
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,560
They're like, well, the new model looks really,

1643
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,840
no, no, I don't wanna do that.

1644
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,080
And they're like extended warranty.

1645
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,800
I'm like, no, I don't know.

1646
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:04,960
I just wanna finance.

1647
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,360
I just wanna get it.

1648
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:09,960
And it was a three hour ordeal.

1649
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,880
Now imagine you're doing this via a translator

1650
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,720
and you're discussing length of stump nose.

1651
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,160
That's what I'm thinking.

1652
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,040
I'm not too concerned about the language barrier.

1653
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,840
I am concerned about like, okay,

1654
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,040
this is the cost of the car.

1655
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,800
Well, that's the base cost,

1656
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:32,040
fees and taxes and APR.

1657
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,440
You might not be concerned about the language,

1658
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,520
but somebody's gotta pay for that translator.

1659
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,480
Yeah, somebody that's gonna have to be a translator.

1660
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,640
You're splitting that cost.

1661
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:40,840
Maybe they do take care of it.

1662
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,680
Maybe they're happy there's a perspective buyer,

1663
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,720
but the costs are adding up.

1664
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,320
How do you explain you want the robot to hug you

1665
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,440
every night?

1666
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:47,880
They need to be able to do that.

1667
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:48,720
I don't know.

1668
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,400
I think they work with a lot of international clients.

1669
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:54,920
So I think we'll be able to,

1670
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:59,480
I don't know how programmable in terms of hug capability

1671
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,320
a lot of these are.

1672
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,000
You're gonna want that though.

1673
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:03,840
Yeah.

1674
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:08,000
Do you want us to massage it such that the arms

1675
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,000
don't just hard snap and it risks just like slicing

1676
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:15,200
your neck clean through.

1677
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,240
I don't want my neck sliced for sure.

1678
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,600
And then the other thing is I'm like,

1679
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,200
okay, do you guys have stock voices

1680
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,520
or can I record some voices for it?

1681
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,720
Can the tree be me?

1682
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,920
Can the tree be like-

1683
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,280
Good night, Jason.

1684
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,280
I love you, Jason.

1685
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,120
We can take care of it, right?

1686
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:33,560
And do you want, you have a microphone in front of you.

1687
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:34,800
You could save them some work.

1688
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,880
Do you have a sample of what you might wanna say

1689
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:37,720
to yourself as a tree?

1690
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:40,080
Well, let's take the example of an entryway one.

1691
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,960
Like, hello, welcome to my home.

1692
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,680
I was just gonna say like you.

1693
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,520
Yeah, so it's just me.

1694
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,360
You don't even do a voice.

1695
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,680
It just sounds like me.

1696
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,720
Okay.

1697
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:49,880
So I love you, Jason.

1698
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,360
Welcome home, you've arrived.

1699
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,920
I love you, Jason.

1700
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,120
I love you, Jason.

1701
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,960
You may have been gone, but I didn't stop loving you.

1702
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:02,000
How about, okay, try this one.

1703
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,600
Pooping my stump, Jason.

1704
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,640
Pooping my stump, Jason.

1705
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,520
I can't wait till you go to sleep in my mouth, Jason.

1706
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,160
My mouth is extra warm today.

1707
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,200
My mouth is extra warm today.

1708
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,600
Don't worry about the pressure drop.

1709
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,400
I know it got colder outside.

1710
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,040
See, is this less scary to you?

1711
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,280
Like, if we could program-

1712
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,840
Yeah, it's all perfectly natural.

1713
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:27,920
Don't worry.

1714
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,960
It's been humid, so my bark teeth are soft.

1715
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:35,200
They would only be able to gum you slightly,

1716
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,240
not chomp your face off.

1717
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,080
Oh!

1718
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:40,600
See?

1719
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,360
All right, I'm loving this.

1720
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,200
This is the kid.

1721
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,160
It started as scary trees that scare Scott,

1722
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:54,160
and then it became a viable animatronic tree ownership

1723
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,000
for Jason.

1724
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,640
Who was a plant guy.

1725
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:57,720
Who was a plant guy.

1726
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,800
Let me run through a couple other,

1727
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,040
because they exist.

1728
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,320
Sally Darkrides made a few.

1729
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:09,280
Friend of the show, Anise, let me know,

1730
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,640
not even knowing we were doing this,

1731
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:13,480
he out of the blue yesterday DM'd me,

1732
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,120
hey, you should know about the restaurant

1733
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,400
Bugaboo Creek in Canada.

1734
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,240
Yes.

1735
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,280
Which I think people have mentioned to us before,

1736
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,560
but that it had something called Timber the Talking Tree

1737
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,400
that talks about Canadian history.

1738
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,840
Love that, that's a one apple for me.

1739
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,240
Christmas tree is a little less scary.

1740
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,280
That seems like a Christmas tree that you might buy

1741
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,000
in a sharper image.

1742
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,120
And Canadian history is delightful,

1743
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,480
so I have zero problem with that.

1744
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:40,080
It bugged me out when I started typing the phrase

1745
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,280
Timber the Talking Tree,

1746
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,120
because I was like, wait, didn't I do this already?

1747
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,200
No, no, no.

1748
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,160
Dollywood had something called Tinker

1749
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,160
the Talking Christmas Tree.

1750
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:51,360
Both used that full phrase.

1751
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:54,440
So let's be clear, Timber is not Tinker.

1752
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:57,480
Timber is Bugaboo, Tinker is Dollywood.

1753
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,240
Scott, I don't wanna correct you,

1754
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,000
I have to correct you.

1755
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,840
Bugaboo Creek is Canadian themed,

1756
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,720
and they were in America.

1757
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,800
And I believe I've been to one.

1758
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,880
I think they're out of business now.

1759
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:13,720
Really?

1760
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:16,200
But I'm pretty sure my mom was like,

1761
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,680
oh, we gotta go to this place.

1762
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,600
It's a steakhouse with animatronics.

1763
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,200
A Canadian themed?

1764
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,240
I think, cause it's a lot of moose,

1765
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,840
and that sort of business.

1766
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,680
There's like little places in Canadian airports

1767
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:31,880
that are full of big huggable bears and mooses.

1768
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:34,560
Area served United States,

1769
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,800
Canadian themed American cuisine.

1770
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,760
Whoa, wow.

1771
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,760
Oh yeah, there you go, it was based in Rhode Island even.

1772
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,040
Wow, that's wild.

1773
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:47,280
Wow, that really complicates it more in a fun way.

1774
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,400
I think I would have liked this.

1775
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,160
Wait, oh, so this isn't a place we have to go to,

1776
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,800
because it doesn't exist, right?

1777
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,680
Oh, so we could do this episode no prob.

1778
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:56,520
Yeah.

1779
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,320
Oh, we gotta learn about moxie the moose

1780
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,160
and goose the moose.

1781
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,320
Oh, there might still be some.

1782
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,440
They closed a bunch.

1783
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,560
There was a bankruptcy, but.

1784
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:03,880
Yeah, there was a bankruptcy.

1785
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,040
But maybe there's a few.

1786
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,400
Lot in Massachusetts.

1787
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,120
Listeners help us out, Phil.

1788
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:12,040
Well, the official website is archive.orged.

1789
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,160
So I think that doesn't sound good.

1790
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:16,840
Oh, and you know this is old,

1791
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:20,880
cause it says try our Bugaboo Club lunch combos for 7.99

1792
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,320
in finals America.

1793
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:23,840
Please.

1794
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,040
I don't think so.

1795
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,000
So I don't know, could have been.

1796
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,680
This is from 2016, I don't know.

1797
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,760
So anyways, oh, here's a big,

1798
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:37,040
speaking of stuff that listeners have alerted us to,

1799
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,320
and I'm happy we get to go out on some,

1800
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:41,280
look, this is the one I'm about to show.

1801
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,120
This is a WONR.

1802
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,920
I'm not scared of this at all.

1803
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,480
This is from the oft-mentioned

1804
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:50,760
animatronic-filled grocery store, Stu Leonard's.

1805
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,280
They have something, they have a tree

1806
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,200
that is specifically advertising

1807
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,600
a particular brand of water.

1808
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,320
That water is Poland Spring.

1809
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:03,280
And here's a taste of the Poland Spring tree.

1810
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:05,360
It's my pretty white tree.

1811
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,440
And I live deep in the Woonkei lane

1812
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,800
where Poland Spring water comes from.

1813
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:13,520
From natural springs found deep in the ground of my home.

1814
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,360
I love it.

1815
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,280
Bear with it, we got a fun song coming up.

1816
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,080
Sip, sip, sip.

1817
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,880
Glug, glug, glug.

1818
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,440
Poland Spring water, give me a hug.

1819
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,360
Sip, sip, sip.

1820
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,200
Yum, yum, yum.

1821
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,720
Poland Spring water, give me some.

1822
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:32,560
I mean, that's-

1823
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,480
Honestly, you know what?

1824
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,720
The song- No apples.

1825
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:37,120
Yeah, the song takes it to the point where-

1826
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,920
The song, I love the song.

1827
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,440
Hate Poland Spring water.

1828
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:41,280
Love the song.

1829
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,120
Oh, that's a good point.

1830
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:45,720
It's kind of a very specific tang to it.

1831
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,440
I love the apples for Jason because of that water.

1832
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:48,800
Yeah, five apples.

1833
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:52,280
I've prepared some non-Poland Spring water for you, Jason.

1834
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,800
Sip, sip, sip, my saliva.

1835
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,120
Sip, sip, sip.

1836
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,360
I'll take it, my man.

1837
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,040
You should do one of the either sip, sip, sip

1838
01:09:59,040 --> 01:09:59,960
or give me a hug.

1839
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:02,160
Whichever one you wanna program into your tree.

1840
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,320
Oh yeah.

1841
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,280
Sip, sip, sip.

1842
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,000
Give me a hug.

1843
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,120
When you finish drinking.

1844
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,640
No, don't try to do both.

1845
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,280
Don't choke, I love you too much.

1846
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,120
Went down the wrong pipe, I told you.

1847
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:19,360
So you know what, that's good news.

1848
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,400
Getting towards the end, that's one that I like.

1849
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,880
What about this one, and do you even consider it

1850
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,040
in this category?

1851
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,640
There's a big tree that I find scary

1852
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,920
but does not have a face on a ride.

1853
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,960
It is the Whomping Willow.

1854
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:33,800
I am scared.

1855
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:34,640
On the Harry Potter.

1856
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,480
I am scared of it.

1857
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:36,560
That part kicks me out big time.

1858
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,000
I think the whole ride is scary.

1859
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,880
I get a little scared every time I'm on it.

1860
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,520
A lot of it has to do with the dangling legs

1861
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:44,440
but also the proximity to everything.

1862
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:47,080
It does feel like the Whomping Willow is gonna hit me

1863
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:48,040
when I'm on that ride.

1864
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,400
This is an intimacy that you don't enjoy.

1865
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,920
Well I do and the idea that I like

1866
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:53,920
makes me a little uncomfortable.

1867
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:54,760
Everything makes me uncomfortable

1868
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,200
but it does scare me still a little bit.

1869
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,240
Spiders, I'm not a big spider guy.

1870
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,800
That part makes me wince a little bit

1871
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,840
even though it's silly.

1872
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,320
I know, I feel dumb for still being scared of the spiders.

1873
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,920
But I'm scared of all of it a little bit.

1874
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:10,080
You're so disoriented in that Whomping Willow.

1875
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,080
Yeah and you're on your back and it's like

1876
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,680
you don't feel comfortable in the way.

1877
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,400
Still even though you know how it's gonna move

1878
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:18,160
you don't know how, you still are a little taken aback

1879
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:20,000
when you get plunged onto your back

1880
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,680
like a little baby or something.

1881
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,120
And then that thing is like,

1882
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:26,720
the noise is so loud and it's so impressively big.

1883
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,960
Even without a human face,

1884
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,640
just the branch coming down makes you go like,

1885
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,680
oh this is big, this could really crush me.

1886
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:37,000
Sometimes a face might be helpful actually to humanize it.

1887
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,880
Even as much as I hate trees with faces,

1888
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,160
usually there's something very sinister

1889
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,320
about an alive tree without a face.

1890
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:44,800
Whomping Willows for sure.

1891
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,200
And I think a lot of people are afraid of trees

1892
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,600
because of Poltergeist,

1893
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,000
which I've never seen all the way through.

1894
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,400
But that has a very terrifying tree scene

1895
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,200
where it's smashing its way through.

1896
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,600
It's very Whomping Willow-esque.

1897
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,880
Poltergeist is so scary, we watched it not long ago.

1898
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,600
And it is a very, very scary movie.

1899
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:03,760
Have you seen Poltergeist?

1900
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,320
I don't think, is that the one with the,

1901
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,760
she's sitting in front of the TV?

1902
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:08,600
That's a couple movies.

1903
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,440
There's a lot of horror movies.

1904
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:13,520
The poster is like a little girl in front of the TV.

1905
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,240
Oh yeah, I guess because she gets taken in.

1906
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,320
And then yeah. She gets taken in.

1907
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,080
Yeah, I can't remember if I've seen all of it,

1908
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,640
but it is on HBO Max and I do have it,

1909
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,960
like I added a bunch of harm.

1910
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,280
They have a ton of horror movies up right now.

1911
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:29,960
Jason, Poltergeist is still in your queue on HBO Max.

1912
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:33,000
Should I pull it up for you using my big branch fingers?

1913
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,720
Never know when David Zaslav is gonna yank it.

1914
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:41,400
He's scarier than any talking tree.

1915
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:45,080
There's one, there's another one too.

1916
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:46,640
I kind of remember this going around.

1917
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,640
Oh, by the way, I just want to point out Produced By.

1918
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:50,720
All right.

1919
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:51,560
My man.

1920
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,880
We'll hear more about that, my man.

1921
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,680
See you around tomorrow or something.

1922
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,040
And we ain't talking Waldo Sanchez.

1923
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,760
Yeah, you'll learn more.

1924
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:01,600
Okay.

1925
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:03,920
Just quick other one.

1926
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,640
This was a little viral last Christmas.

1927
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:12,640
There is a mall in Nova Scotia with a gigantic talking tree

1928
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,960
with kind of a like harlequin clown face.

1929
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,560
Did you ever see this floating around?

1930
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,080
I don't think so.

1931
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,920
This is kind of the ultimate like,

1932
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,040
this is non-trunk integration.

1933
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:29,040
This is just a big weird white, like a baby clown face.

1934
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,760
But this is so big, it's almost ridiculous to me.

1935
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,720
I'm oddly not afraid.

1936
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:35,840
This is Woody in Nova Scotia.

1937
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:36,680
Yeah.

1938
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,000
This apparently was a tradition in Nova Scotia

1939
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,320
that they hadn't done in 15 years ago.

1940
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,440
Look at this like scuffed up.

1941
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:47,040
This is like the mask that the Joker wears

1942
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,400
in the bank robbery in Dark Knight.

1943
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,520
Scary scuffed up face.

1944
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:56,160
This one's scarier to me than the new and improved.

1945
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,000
Oh, the wink.

1946
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:57,840
There's a wink.

1947
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,160
The wink is pretty upsetting.

1948
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:03,360
I also saw that if one of this tree's eyelids droops,

1949
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,240
the way that they have to fix it is just a mall employee

1950
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,880
with a giant pole.

1951
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,200
It has to just like shove it back up.

1952
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,760
That's like the Tussien Monstros teeth get brushed.

1953
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,240
Oh yeah, absolutely.

1954
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,080
Who knew this was a job?

1955
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,320
Oh wait, is this in Philadelphia?

1956
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,840
Is this Franklin Mills?

1957
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:18,680
This is not.

1958
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:19,520
No, no, no.

1959
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,560
This is in Nova Scotia.

1960
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,400
Oh, Nova Scotia.

1961
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,600
Is there something like that in Franklin Mills?

1962
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,640
I think there is something, yeah.

1963
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,920
And then just one more little thing,

1964
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,840
and it's a little bit off, because it's not animatronic,

1965
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:35,520
but what's ironic about this fear that I have,

1966
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:40,520
trees coming to life, is that alive trees played a,

1967
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:45,720
or at least one alive tree played a huge part in my career.

1968
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:47,520
Oh.

1969
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,760
A pivotal job, oddly, that I took,

1970
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,800
and who knew that it would be.

1971
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,480
The very first time I was ever associated with Funny or Die

1972
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:01,520
was a video called Arbor Days, spelled D-A-Z-E,

1973
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:06,400
and this was a purposefully hokey,

1974
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:10,160
Jim Carrey style premise wish comedy,

1975
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:14,120
but in this case, it is a guy who does not respect trees

1976
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:17,440
and the environment, and then he becomes a tree

1977
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:18,920
because his son wishes it.

1978
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,560
It's a fake trailer they made

1979
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,080
for like a purposefully kind of hokey movie,

1980
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:26,840
and this Funny or Die video stars Tim Allen.

1981
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:30,160
This is, in thinking like, oh, this might be

1982
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,160
like a weird hacky thing that Tim Allen

1983
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:36,400
would actually be in, and as part of this,

1984
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,880
his face is comped onto a tree.

1985
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,600
This is some of what I had to do was sift through footage

1986
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:45,960
of Tim Allen with his face made up to look like bark,

1987
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:49,040
which does, it just looks like he just like

1988
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,400
smeared liquid shit on himself.

1989
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,760
It's really weird, and then made weirder

1990
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:57,520
by seeing his face on a stationary tree.

1991
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,360
Anyway, this video is not the greatest.

1992
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,760
It seemed like kind of a rush job for them,

1993
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:07,080
and actually the situation was it was the holidays,

1994
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:10,920
and they didn't have a lot of hands around.

1995
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,760
Everybody was leaving, so we need somebody

1996
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:15,360
to take care of that Tim Allen video,

1997
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,320
so it got sent to me, and that was the first stuff

1998
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,800
I ever did for them, and then I was working there

1999
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,320
full time, like six months later,

2000
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:27,320
and I was curious if this video still existed anywhere,

2001
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,920
Arbor Days, because Funny or Die is like a graveyard

2002
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,480
at this point, and I looked it up,

2003
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,320
and it's not on Funny or Die anywhere,

2004
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:37,480
but it is on Tim Allen's personal YouTube,

2005
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,760
and I pulled it up on his personal YouTube,

2006
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:43,080
and I was shocked to hear my own voice

2007
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,960
as the narrator of this trimmer.

2008
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,040
Oh, you don't remember that.

2009
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:51,640
I am 90% sure I was not the voice in what they released,

2010
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:56,640
and I think what is on Tim Allen's site is a rough cut.

2011
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,200
I think it was something they showed him

2012
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,080
just to show how it was going,

2013
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,640
because the color's all weird,

2014
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:07,360
and my voice is only coming out of one speaker,

2015
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,400
and his audio sucks.

2016
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:14,400
It's a real pile of shit, this particular leaked version,

2017
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,480
but it's up proudly on Tim Allen's YouTube,

2018
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,840
and I pulled it up just to show Aaron,

2019
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:22,240
oh God, remember this fucking thing,

2020
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:24,320
and my voice is in it, that's weird,

2021
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:30,320
and then my son, God bless him, walks over or watches this,

2022
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,800
and then he goes, again, which is what he says for again,

2023
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,240
and then we play it again, and then I'll put it up

2024
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:41,040
on the big TV, and he kept asking for it over and over again.

2025
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:45,920
Again, again, twee, twee, and he's like,

2026
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,240
Tim Allen laughs in it, and he goes, ha ha ha.

2027
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:54,400
Somehow this became my son's favorite piece of content,

2028
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,880
this weird old funny or die thing,

2029
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,600
which maybe, hey, maybe this will set him off on the,

2030
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,440
maybe he will not carry the sins of the father,

2031
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,360
he will not be afraid of trees,

2032
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:07,400
because of this earliest two and a half year old memory

2033
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:11,360
of I remember watching this tree video that I liked,

2034
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,800
and Aaron's rationale was, well, think about,

2035
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,360
he's here, this is a video with the voices

2036
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:19,160
of his father and Buzz Lightyear.

2037
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:20,120
Oh, good point.

2038
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:20,960
Yeah, that's a good point.

2039
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,880
These are the only voices mostly talking in the video,

2040
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,240
which makes me very happy if that's how he,

2041
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:31,360
so anyway, maybe, I think my boy is not gonna be afraid,

2042
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:34,200
I think, oddly, after all this, I helped him,

2043
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,020
and he's not gonna share the same.

2044
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:38,540
And he also is not gonna,

2045
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:41,980
he's not gonna put up with all these woke people.

2046
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:45,380
Yeah, he's not gonna waste all his money on avocado toast,

2047
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:48,300
or the $10 oat milk.

2048
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,820
There is a, in the video, you could tell maybe he put

2049
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:53,140
some of his own agenda in it, because he does say,

2050
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:54,580
we're selling that he's a guy who doesn't care

2051
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:57,020
about the environment, and then he's like,

2052
01:18:57,020 --> 01:19:01,260
like, oh, what, is this, oh, he turns into a tree,

2053
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:02,980
and then he says, oh, is this a punishment,

2054
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:06,700
because I didn't watch that Al Gore thing,

2055
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,580
which I wonder if he improvised,

2056
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:09,980
which, by the way, I've told you guys this,

2057
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:11,540
and I'm not gonna say it, but this,

2058
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:13,180
my first job for Funny or Die,

2059
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:17,300
I'm sifting through Tim Allen improvising,

2060
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:19,660
when you wind him up and let him go,

2061
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:23,140
the places that he goes, and this is not my place

2062
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:27,620
to leak what I saw, but I will never forget what I saw.

2063
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:29,100
This is funny when you say this,

2064
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:31,680
because off the record, I've heard a couple people

2065
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:36,000
about various celebrities, when you let them improvise,

2066
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,560
it's insane, it's truly insane.

2067
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:42,440
Why are Tylenol bottles so hard to get open?

2068
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:45,720
Child safe, seems like they're adult safe.

2069
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:48,680
I mean, that would be probably a better improvised learning

2070
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,420
than most of these, but anytime it's like, oh, yeah,

2071
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:53,280
by the way, so and so, when they improvise, Jesus Christ.

2072
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,400
Yeah, yeah, yes.

2073
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,140
It's either like they say insane things,

2074
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:58,600
or they cannot do it.

2075
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, I've seen the,

2076
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:03,080
oh, Funny or Die gives you, this became the job,

2077
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:05,840
was getting a sense of who is a great.

2078
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:06,680
Yes.

2079
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,960
Improviser, and who actually cannot,

2080
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,560
who's like, and who out there is much worse

2081
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:14,240
than your friend you brought onto the shoot.

2082
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,080
Yes.

2083
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,160
There's a name in my head, I will say it

2084
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,880
as soon as the episode is done.

2085
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:21,520
I wish I could reveal to the full audience.

2086
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,440
Anyway, if you're ever curious for more information

2087
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,280
about the Tim Allen, I shouldn't even offer that.

2088
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,820
Anyway, go to Tim Allen's YouTube, or we'll post it,

2089
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:31,660
to hear my vocal collaboration.

2090
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,220
But this is the first time your son is enjoying your work.

2091
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:36,500
Yes, yeah, you know what, it's the most he's responded.

2092
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,060
You make him listen to the podcast every week,

2093
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:38,900
and he doesn't like it.

2094
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:39,740
What do you think, huh?

2095
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:40,580
He hates it.

2096
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:42,100
Yeah, went a little long with that tangent,

2097
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:44,460
I guess, okay, I understand.

2098
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:47,720
By the way, Funny or Die, just a, you go to Funny or Die,

2099
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:51,060
and there's just pictures of videos that were there,

2100
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:54,400
that aren't there anymore, and so it's unclickable.

2101
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,780
I can't watch Arbor Days with Tim Allen,

2102
01:20:56,780 --> 01:20:59,300
and then under it, there's thumbnails for other things,

2103
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:00,740
and the thumbnail right under it is a video

2104
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:03,500
called Murder House, and the thumbnail is Lindsay K. Tide.

2105
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:04,340
Oh my God.

2106
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:06,820
It's like 15 year old video.

2107
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:07,660
That's crazy.

2108
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:10,460
Yeah, Brandon Johnson, do you know what this video is?

2109
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:11,660
No idea, no clue.

2110
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:13,460
Michael Bush, Chad Foglan.

2111
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:14,360
No idea.

2112
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:16,380
Yeah, anyway.

2113
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:20,580
So, I just don't know how, how do you land with it?

2114
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:22,340
This is like a CV website now.

2115
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:24,740
I was just having a discussion with, a couple months ago,

2116
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,260
Anthony Geo and Evan Susser, and we were like,

2117
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:28,900
does the Funny or Die website exist?

2118
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:29,740
Can you go to it?

2119
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:30,700
And we were like, we don't know.

2120
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:32,560
And we go, you know what, we're not even gonna check.

2121
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, I checked.

2122
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:38,100
I found a video with your fiance that I couldn't watch.

2123
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,560
I also saw that Jason is a extra

2124
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,340
in a video called Puppet High.

2125
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:43,620
You're an extra?

2126
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:44,460
Is that?

2127
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:45,300
Puppet High?

2128
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,140
Puppet High.

2129
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:48,740
Oh, I do remember this.

2130
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:52,260
Yes, I remember driving to a high school in Orange County.

2131
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:53,900
You didn't go to Orange County for that?

2132
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:55,300
And I had to.

2133
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:56,140
To be an extra.

2134
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:56,980
They pulled a soul.

2135
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:58,100
And I barely made it, because they're like,

2136
01:21:58,100 --> 01:21:59,540
we only need you for three or four hours.

2137
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:01,860
So I was like, oh good, I have to go to something.

2138
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:05,060
And three or four hours, they did like one shot.

2139
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:06,860
And I was like, I have to leave.

2140
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:08,860
And they're like, okay, thanks for coming down.

2141
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:09,860
I don't think you're in it.

2142
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:10,700
I didn't see you.

2143
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,420
Yeah, I'm not in it, because I left,

2144
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:13,860
because they were like artists.

2145
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:14,940
There was a good year,

2146
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:17,700
there was a good year where we were fooled a lot by them,

2147
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:18,540
I think.

2148
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:19,380
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

2149
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:20,300
Just like, yeah, come and be in this video.

2150
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:21,140
And you're like, okay.

2151
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:22,460
And it's like, no money.

2152
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:25,020
Maybe gonna be in it?

2153
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:26,260
Certainly aren't gonna have a line.

2154
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:27,820
I remember those things that, those like,

2155
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:29,660
I was not there for a while,

2156
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:31,420
and then I needed a gig a few years later,

2157
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:34,300
and I did these branded things with you and Lindsay together.

2158
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:35,140
Oh yeah.

2159
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:37,620
I found something, this was never my experience

2160
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:39,540
in the early 2010s at Funny or Die,

2161
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:40,940
but a couple years pass,

2162
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:43,060
and then I found a new challenge as a director,

2163
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:45,420
which is every actor coming up to you and saying,

2164
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:46,780
I have to go.

2165
01:22:46,780 --> 01:22:47,660
Oh yeah, yeah.

2166
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:50,180
That's what happens when you pay shit money.

2167
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:52,380
I was like, I can't believe this is like,

2168
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,100
and I'm like, look, I'm rooting for you.

2169
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:55,220
You should get out of here.

2170
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,060
Yeah.

2171
01:22:56,060 --> 01:22:56,900
You have better things to do.

2172
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:57,740
Right.

2173
01:22:57,740 --> 01:22:59,820
There's people in those videos whose careers exploded

2174
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:01,940
after filming that shit.

2175
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:02,780
Yeah.

2176
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:04,420
Like, they probably went off,

2177
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:07,780
and they probably did the key auditions

2178
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:08,780
because I let them leave.

2179
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:09,620
Right.

2180
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:13,180
Well, it's whatever, like whoever was making the phone calls,

2181
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:14,740
like every now and then once, I was like,

2182
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,140
yeah, I can be there for like six or eight hours,

2183
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:18,460
and then I have to go.

2184
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:19,660
And then when I got to set,

2185
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:22,100
no one had any idea what I was talking about,

2186
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:23,900
because whoever I talked to on the phone

2187
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:25,780
was not there on set,

2188
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:27,140
and everyone was just looking at me

2189
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:28,540
like I was speaking Greek.

2190
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:31,780
Well, ending the month on true horrors.

2191
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:32,620
True horrors.

2192
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:35,940
Swyfe as a minor player in a funny or die video,

2193
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:38,340
circa 2014.

2194
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:40,940
Well, I clicked on the tab that said library,

2195
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:43,020
and it says we are currently populating

2196
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:45,780
and reconstructing the complete library.

2197
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:46,620
How?

2198
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:47,440
Why?

2199
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,460
Why did it get unconstructed?

2200
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:49,900
What did you do?

2201
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:53,780
They literally fired the guy who had all the videos,

2202
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:56,420
because there was a day where there was a,

2203
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:58,820
all of us who still talk from there were like,

2204
01:23:58,820 --> 01:23:59,820
tomorrow's your last day,

2205
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:02,660
send a list of every video you ever wanna see again.

2206
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:03,980
So we had to like rescue them,

2207
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:06,380
and we didn't think to rescue Arbor Days with Tim Allen.

2208
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:08,340
So no one will ever see the true cut.

2209
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:11,380
You have to watch one with my voice, not stereo mixed.

2210
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,180
This page is unusable.

2211
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:15,540
It's like that new website, Seamafor,

2212
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:16,380
if you know what that is.

2213
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:17,220
I don't know what Seamafor is.

2214
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:18,740
This is the guy, Ben Smith,

2215
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:20,980
who was the head of BuzzFeed News,

2216
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:24,460
and then he was a columnist at the New York Times.

2217
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:29,180
He left to do a startup, and this is what it looks like.

2218
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:32,780
It looks just like this Funny or Die library page.

2219
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:36,020
It's just gibberish, and the very first thing is like,

2220
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:37,740
Louis C.K. apology?

2221
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:40,180
Why would you have that be your first thing that comes up

2222
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:41,900
on your Funny or Die library page?

2223
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:44,300
That's what happens when no one has looked at it.

2224
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:46,180
You're the first person to click on it.

2225
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:47,020
The audience.

2226
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:48,300
Why no one's been around these parts,

2227
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:49,580
it's been seven years.

2228
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:51,700
It also says, a deleted scene from Louis.

2229
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:53,780
I don't even think it's an actual apology.

2230
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:55,700
The audience doesn't even know what we're talking about.

2231
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:57,460
No, no, nor do they care.

2232
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:59,180
I've started to wrap my mind around,

2233
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:01,820
there will be, we might already be there,

2234
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:03,460
that the phrase Funny or Die does not provoke

2235
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:06,020
any recognition, and certainly no care.

2236
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:10,300
This links to a 10-year-old Vulture article

2237
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:13,940
written by Elliot Glazer, who is now a TV writer,

2238
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:17,100
I believe, himself, that's the brother of Alana Glaze.

2239
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:19,180
This doesn't make any sense.

2240
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:22,540
There's just clips from at midnight from 2015.

2241
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:23,860
This is nothing.

2242
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:26,060
You're never going to find any sanity.

2243
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:28,260
The further you venture into these forests,

2244
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:30,620
you will get lost, you will get swallowed

2245
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:33,020
as if by a terrifying tree.

2246
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:35,260
This might, the lack of logic,

2247
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:37,780
or the lack of any basic web design,

2248
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:40,020
might be giving me the heart palpitations

2249
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:41,580
that these scary trees give you.

2250
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:43,340
You need to calm down by getting in the mouth

2251
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:44,180
of a tree and lying down.

2252
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:45,020
I do.

2253
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:46,860
Letting them breathe.

2254
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:47,700
The moist mouth of a tree.

2255
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:48,900
Onto your face.

2256
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:53,180
Look, I think, I feel like I sorted through some stuff.

2257
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:54,060
I feel better.

2258
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:55,980
There's some that I'm more comfortable with.

2259
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:57,820
Sunkissed trees, I will never.

2260
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:59,860
Snow White Scary Adventure Trees.

2261
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:01,540
They are presented as scary.

2262
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:04,300
Nobody says, and you love these, right?

2263
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:05,740
So I'm fine with them.

2264
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:10,980
Similar, the trees on the Haunted Mansion,

2265
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:13,900
when you're going backwards, down the hill,

2266
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:17,340
which I believe, if everything goes according to plan

2267
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:19,940
in a few days, will not be discussed.

2268
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:20,780
Not be discussed, correct.

2269
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:21,780
Next year, next year.

2270
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:23,460
Okay, you'll have to wait.

2271
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:25,940
But again, presented as scary.

2272
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:30,940
Listener, I am so curious what trees were in your life.

2273
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:33,780
What trees terrified you, or am I wrong?

2274
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:36,900
Are these all wonderful, lovable huggables?

2275
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,820
And I've got the whole thing wrong.

2276
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:42,940
And I, oh, and you know what?

2277
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:43,980
Oh wait, I forgot one.

2278
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:46,140
FAO Schwartz, I think.

2279
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:47,940
That might be a source of weird trees for people.

2280
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:51,660
And Aaron says just like random Macy's would have.

2281
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:56,660
Like the Northridge Macy's in the valley had talking trees.

2282
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:58,740
Maybe made by companies like that.

2283
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:01,420
They wanna like jazz it up for the Christmas season,

2284
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:03,780
not knowing that they were terrifying people

2285
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:07,060
and giving them fear fodder for podcasts

2286
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:08,940
for over 30 years later.

2287
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:09,780
Yeah, wow.

2288
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:10,620
Okay.

2289
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:11,780
Do you feel more freaked out now?

2290
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:16,140
Where did your, are you more comfortable with trees?

2291
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:17,460
Are you gonna buy one like Jason?

2292
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:19,060
I'm not going to buy one.

2293
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:21,380
I would rather buy the Officer Big Mac

2294
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:23,060
or have it recreated for the money.

2295
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:23,900
Of course.

2296
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:24,720
Maybe it would be more expensive.

2297
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,500
But no, I'm not gonna buy.

2298
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:29,900
I'm in the same zone with trees.

2299
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:30,740
The scary trees.

2300
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:32,180
Okay, you retain the fears that you had.

2301
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:33,020
It's the same, yeah.

2302
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:34,420
Uh-huh.

2303
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:35,240
I feel better.

2304
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:36,140
Inspired by my son.

2305
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:40,020
I thank you listeners for helping me work this out.

2306
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:42,300
You survived Haunt Cast the Fright.

2307
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:45,580
Thank you for subscribing to the Cemetery Gate.

2308
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:47,060

2309
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:48,460
join us on our new Patreon tier,

2310
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:51,060

2313
01:27:56,420 --> 01:27:59,980
Hey, and also, I think the timing is right on this,

2314
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:02,780
that I think tomorrow, keep an eye out

2315
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:05,020
in the general podcast universe

2316
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:09,100
because the good boys might cross over with a burger boy.

2317
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:09,940
Oh yeah.

2318
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:13,060
So pay attention to socials.

2319
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:15,900
That's fun.

2320
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:18,060
Let me real quick, a little code,

2321
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:19,700
or I don't know what it is.

2322
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:21,240
I was given a tip here and I wanna see

2323
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,420
if this would inspire you to go to Wuhan real quick.

2324
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:24,260
Okay.

2325
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:28,700
So this is a person who's telling me, Landon,

2326
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:31,940
who is, I went, he's experienced Minotaur.

2327
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:32,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2328
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:33,860
Part of the Minotaur.

2329
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:35,240
A great dude.

2330
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:38,260
He said, there's a place thing called Reign of Terror

2331
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:40,100
that he thinks I would like.

2332
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:40,940
Okay.

2333
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:42,660
And I wanna describe it and I wanna see if it's possible

2334
01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:43,620
because there's a thing at the end here

2335
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:45,380
that might intrigue you.

2336
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:48,020
So he said, it's got echoes of Boney Island animatronics

2337
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:50,000
with fairground home haunt vibe

2338
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,660
of the old version of the haunted hayride,

2339
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:54,760
the atmosphere of knots, set depth of delusion.

2340
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,220
Oh, and it's all housed in a fading old

2341
01:28:57,220 --> 01:28:59,980
thousand oaks outdoor mall.

2342
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:01,060
Whoa.

2343
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:02,780
Oh, I know the mall.

2344
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:04,560
Of course I know, I believe the oaks.

2345
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,020
The owner stores all the stuff there year round

2346
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:08,300
and collects and expands the haunt

2347
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:10,000
with the props and sets of abandoned

2348
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,760
and closed down indie haunts.

2349
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,100
So the whole experience is massive.

2350
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:15,940
He says, make time for it next season.

2351
01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:16,940
Okay. Wow.

2352
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:18,540
Outdoor mall though.

2353
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:19,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2354
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:20,300
That's intriguing, right?

2355
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:21,140
Oh, absolutely.

2356
01:29:21,140 --> 01:29:22,580
Okay. Yes.

2357
01:29:22,580 --> 01:29:23,780
Yeah, hey.

2358
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:24,820
Nothing but love for those.

2359
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:29,620
The bad vibes of like, bankrupt or closed down other haunts.

2360
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:33,500
Like that's an interesting layer.

2361
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,580
I thought you might be intrigued by that.

2362
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:38,940
Yeah, dying mall, I love it.

2363
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:41,460
Alive tree, hate it, but not all.

2364
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:42,660
We found ones to love.

2365
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:44,800
Thanks for helping me through it.
