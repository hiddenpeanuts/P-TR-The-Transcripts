1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,320
Okay, I'm going to try something here just this is for the episode, but I just want to

2
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:37,680
try a different intro. Okay. Here we go. Welcome to Point Brothers, a podcast hosted by two

3
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,320
non-biological brothers who love points. My name is Mike Carlson. Joining me as always.

4
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,920
Hey, it's the points master, Jason Sheridan. Points master, Jason Sheridan. That doesn't

5
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,840
feel right. First off, you didn't tell me you were recording. Second off, you are the

6
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,200
points master, so I should not be taking that title. Well, no, I mean, you can be the points

7
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,760
master. Is there something more supreme than points master? The points god? The points guy?

8
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:15,640
Yeah. The points guy will comfort you if you steal his title. Supreme chancellor of points.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,160
Yeah. Mike, we could be, I thought about this, it could be the pointer brothers,

10
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:26,120
like the pointer sisters, but I think there are pointer brothers in some sort of space.

11
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,600
There's a Tim Robinson sketch, yeah. Yes. Well, there's that too, but I think I saw different

12
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,360
people that already took that name, but Point Brothers, I think, is available. Right. So,

13
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:43,040
if we wanted to quit podcast the ride and do our own thing, really forge out on our own.

14
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,400
We're quitting? We're not just doing it in parallel? No, there would be no time. Oh,

15
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:54,000
okay. This would be full Point Brothers. We would have to do 60 hours a week on this to really

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,680
master. Because you got to book flights and buy appliances to test stuff. So, yeah, I don't know.

17
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,840
By the end of this episode, we'll determine if we should quit podcast the ride. Oh, okay.

18
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,880
That's what we'll do. It's possible. Sure. Hi, everybody. Hi. Club 3. Welcome to Club 3.

19
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:20,160
Welcome to Club 3, you sickos. You sickos who voted for this episode. You asked for this.

20
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,880
You asked for this. Sickos in a good way, of course. I think they would have been more

21
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:35,840
sicko if they had voted for Madame. Do you think so? I think this is the ultimate sicko

22
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,480
choice for them. Do you think so? Yeah, because Madame still is like, even if you think Madame

23
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:48,560
is scary, which she is, this is a hardcore choice because everything else, I could see the value

24
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:57,440
in it. I could see the fun in it. But the only fun in credit card points is hearing how annoying

25
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,640
I am about it. You know what I'm saying? I'm happy to get an update, actually, because we've

26
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,080
talked about it in a little while. But everything else I could see, I could tell a person on the

27
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,000
street, we could go out right now. I could tell a person on the street, hey, we're doing a podcast

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,880
about American Idiot. And they go, oh, the musical or the album. They would say, OK, I understand

29
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,960
that. I say, there's a puppeteer and a puppet named Waylon Flowers and Madame. And I would

30
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,440
explain the sitcom. And you go, oh, I could see where that would be, a podcast. And then I would

31
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,480
say, well, we're doing an episode about my credit card points, not even credit card points in general.

32
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,920
It says on the choice this was this was chosen or written, excuse me. It says Mike's credit

33
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,960
card points. That's what people voted on. Sure. And somebody would go, oh, yeah, I guess.

34
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:51,840
Well, what do you mean? They're clearly not like haunted by the clip of Madame driving a big old

35
00:03:51,840 --> 00:04:00,000
car like I am. Like, I think that was from our sitcom intro or her talk show intro. And she like,

36
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,000
it looks like she's driving a big old car and like she's a little horrifying looking.

37
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,640
So that little scary theory kind of scares me. Although lately, I've also been like upset.

38
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:21,760
I've been getting a lot of ads for L.A. and Vegas performances of Vicky Lawrence and Mama.

39
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,480
Mama is not mad. Mama is not mad, which I had to remind myself sometimes to do it. And also,

40
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,920
so Mama was a character on the Carol Burnett show. That's right. Not portrayed by Carol Burnett.

41
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:42,720
Right. And then she got the character, got her own sitcom in the 80s that ran for a while.

42
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,160
Yes. And I really don't know anything about Madame, just that she's giving you a look when she's

43
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:55,440
posing back to back with. No, not Madame. You said Madame. Oh, see, I can't. I told you Mama

44
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,000
is not Madame and you didn't listen to me. Look, I'm just overwhelmed. I thought about

45
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,480
Madame driving that big old car and I got startled. Is this going this? This can't.

46
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:13,040
Mama and Madame cannot become the new Pucca di Beppo. This cannot happen. No. We cannot afford

47
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:20,560
that as a podcast. The confusion in the marketplace of Mama and Madame. By the way, I got to find this

48
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,640
because I want to give them credit. Someone did a super cut of the full

49
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:34,560
Pucca Saga and it's on YouTube and I do want to give them credit. The Pucca Saga. But I am terrified

50
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,400
to listen to it. Oh, you didn't listen to it? I listened to it. I haven't listened to it yet. It is like

51
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,680
half an hour long. It is so long. Somebody cut together. In case you're on Club 3 and you don't

52
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,400
know, just Jason has called. I want to ask you to do it again right now. Could you do it?

53
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,000
Do you know what it is? I do know what it is because I saw the logo and I hope to God this is

54
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
right. Okay, do it. Pucca di Beppo. Yes, you got it. You got it. Okay. So yes, there's been a long

55
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,560
multi-year saga of Jason calling it Pucca di Beppo and somebody cut together all the instances of

56
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,360
this happening on the podcast. God bless you for the amount of time on your hands to go through

57
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:28,320
and find all that. At ancientsroman11 on Twitter is the one who. Yes. Wait, no, he tweeted about

58
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:34,800
Sha Na Na. Shit. Oh, Jason shouted out a different wrong user. I mean, that sounds like a good user.

59
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,960
I guess Twitter would have a good listener. But I just used the word user like I did a couple

60
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,480
weeks ago on the show. That's not what I meant. Somebody who uses people. You hate users. You

61
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:57,280
hate fake friends. Fake, yeah, fake ass friends. But yes, so there's a lot of topics we've covered

62
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:04,560
that were voted on this month. American Idiot, the musical specifically, but it is also like

63
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,520
an anniversary of American Idiot. And there was an episode idea for Olivia Rodrigo's guts

64
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,680
for me to review the first half of that, which I would I was excited about that. I was like,

65
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,600
oh, I would like to do that. Then there was Don't Blame Conan, the segment that David Letterman

66
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:30,160
did over a decade ago during the whole Conan NBC fiasco that we've talked about on the show before,

67
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:37,920
which is just such a fun, funny thing that a lot of people like. Evan Susser, of course, likes it.

68
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,200
Guy Selga is a big fan of Don't Blame Conan. He was tweeting about it when we posted the-

69
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:50,560
It's one I recall every so often. I have the book. I never read The Late Shift, but I definitely

70
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:57,200
like when, oh, I'll Ask for Christmas, that Conan J. Leno hardback, and it's in a box somewhere here.

71
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:08,320
I never read. Okay. Just to clarify, the user on YouTube, Banshee Neat, cut together a fan

72
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:19,360
compilation. It's called Buka D underscore Epo, podcast fan compilation. It is 26 minutes, 17

73
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:30,640
seconds. I have it saved right in my watch later, so I didn't lose it. I lost the tweet. Thank you

74
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:42,320
so much for doing that. I will go down that rabbit hole. Yes. It's fun. I have a lot of questions

75
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,680
about the Pepo saga, but that would take too much time today, I fear, but there's still questions

76
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,120
because there's so many different ways that it manifests the Pepo situation.

77
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,640
This simple mispronunciation was going on for years before I actually ate in the restaurant.

78
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,760
Yes. One of my favorite things is that you said the wrong thing because you never ate there,

79
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,120
which is really good, like as if you went to the restaurant. That's a pretty reasonable

80
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:23,120
excuse. I guess, but it was out in the world. It's not like you go to a new restaurant and

81
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,560
it's like you're saying the name of it all the time while you're eating. But anyway, check that

82
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:37,680
out. Today, we are doing credit card points, and we are, of course, Scott-free. We are free to be

83
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:45,520
naughty. We are free to be bad little point boys. You get extra points every tangent.

84
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,720
That's right. Yeah. Bonus category this month. Do you think Scott would grimace when I said,

85
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,280
well, this is an episode hosted by two naughty little point boys? Yeah, absolutely.

86
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,560
You think so? Yeah, I might have grimaced a little. Did you? Well, no, I liked it.

87
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,960
You like it, yeah, because you're a naughty little point boy. Yeah.

88
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,680
Yeah. So yeah, today's episode is hosted by two naughty little point boys, but Scott has sent

89
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:18,800
in an audio message. Oh, fun. And he told me not to listen to it before it goes on air.

90
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:25,440
It's just going to be incredibly distorted static. It's possible. It's going to be a shock to our

91
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,640
system. Do you think it's some sort of audio weapon? It could be a weapon. It could be like

92
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,360
Manchurian candidate activation, you know. So he's going to activate you or me or like,

93
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,440
what do you think? Okay. Well, I hope it's not some sort of auditory bio weapon. I guess bio

94
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,120
weapon is not what the word is, but an auditory bomb or something. But here we go. Scott here

95
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,480
in a Scott-free episode. I'm just going to take a few minutes of your otherwise Scott-free time.

96
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,240
First of all, I want to thank you for selecting Mike's credit card points. I think it will be

97
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,560
very educational. And here's why. I think this will serve for you the listener as something of

98
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:12,400
a Scott simulator. You will get to sort of being John Malkovich into me as my co-hosts talk and

99
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:18,640
talk and talk and talk about the kind of thing that they talk about whether on or off the show,

100
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,120
whether in a podcast or at a party, if I don't change the subject. And we'll see if by the end,

101
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:32,160
you don't start expressing a certain degree of, I don't know, annoyance or boredom or

102
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,480
some of the qualities that I sometimes express. Perhaps you, the listener will unlock your inner

103
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:45,440
Scott. But if we want to do something very different next month, I would like to vouch

104
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,280
for the topic. Bug main does whatever it wants. And in doing so, I want to acknowledge a voting

105
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:58,160
block that I know is out there that I will call the never buggers. I see you. I know you're there.

106
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,440
I want to see if I can make a cell to you specifically. Let me say this. I know bug main.

107
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,080
I know this man. And one thing I know about him is that he is a true blue theme park fan. He is a

108
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:18,560
big Epcot guy. He is a Disney world hotels guy, like all of us. He is us. Bug main is us. Honestly,

109
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:24,320
if you're the kind of person who's mad that club three is not about theme parks more often,

110
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:31,200
your best bet might be to let bug main do whatever he wants. Another thing that could happen

111
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:38,800
is that what bug main wants is to not do this. He might ghost me in text message form,

112
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:45,040
not show up to a record, and then we would just move to the next topic down. So a vote for bug

113
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,200
might be a vote for not bug. Think about that. It is definitely a vote for chaos,

114
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,320
a vote for Skittle, and a vote for Scattle. Please consider that, especially after you have

115
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,360
listened to what I assume will be two hours and 45 minutes of Mike's credit card points. All right,

116
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:10,640
have fun, everybody. Buzz buzz. Okay, well, wow, what an impassioned plea. Yeah, I don't know why

117
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,640
you wanted me not to listen to that. I was thinking he was going to like really lay something down

118
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,160
and shock. Did he think I would maybe like railroad bug or something? I like that he used

119
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:27,760
the terminology Scott free. Yes, but that's very respectful. But he used it twice very close together.

120
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,400
So that could be fury. And you think that would also be understandable. It's I've been respectful

121
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:40,880
and furious before. It's very complicated. When was the last time you were respectful and curious?

122
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,560
No, respectful and furious. Oh, sorry. Like you're biting my tongue. It's a new thing.

123
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,520
I'm working on it. Respectful and furious. Can you think of a time when you were respectful and

124
00:13:51,520 --> 00:14:00,480
furious? I think, oh, probably any time I've had to deal with like a car dealership for sure.

125
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,800
Like, I don't want to scream at the people, but I, you know, you're there for like,

126
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,560
you're going on the two hours and it's like, you're approaching, you know, you know, you're

127
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,560
going to be approaching our three soon. And it's like, oh, I, these people are just doing

128
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:23,200
their job. Unfortunately, their job is totally nebulous and insane. Right. Okay. That makes

129
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,720
sense. So you're saying you have, you had a problem maybe with that and now you're, you're,

130
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,840
you're better. I think so. You're better at it. Well, I don't think today I'm going to make you

131
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,440
furious. I think you're going to be elated. I think I am going to be elated. Yeah, for sure.

132
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:45,920
Yeah. I mean, very interesting, uh, bug main hypothesis, uh, voting block, a lot of voting

133
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:55,680
blocks talk lately. Uh, so I'm curious to see how that would play out just so, um, to give people

134
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:05,200
some context. We are recording this, uh, Thursday, November 7th, about two days after election day.

135
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:11,200
So the one recorded on the Monday before election day was a little squirrely and this one is

136
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,400
probably a little squirrely in a different way. Um, I guess, yeah, I think we'll be squirrely. Uh,

137
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,680
hopefully it doesn't sound like we're, uh, depressed. Yeah, sure. Um, but yes, uh,

138
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,680
we're doing this Thursday. So it sounds like Scott is planning on being back for the next

139
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:35,360
maybe three, I suppose, unless he just thrusts bug upon us, which it would be funny too. So it

140
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,680
sounds like he will be back for at least a club three if bug is involved, but I wonder if bug

141
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:46,320
doesn't win this, will he just say, I can't do it? I don't know. Here's a good question. Does bug

142
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:53,040
know anything about this? Does he know anything about our Patriot tier structure? No, no, does

143
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,120
he know anything that he has like was an option? Oh, I don't know. I bet he doesn't, but I could

144
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,840
be wrong about that. Um, well, Jason, do you want to throw some, I mean, I'm not anti-bug,

145
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,840
um, but do you want to throw anything out for the future club three poll? Well, um, you know,

146
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:17,680
the runners up, uh, we're all pretty fun. I actually like, Oh, hotel talk could be very fun.

147
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,560
You just want to call it hotel talk. It could be Jason's hotel.

148
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:29,360
I just met like, there's so many Disney and universal and like theme park hotels that we

149
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:36,560
have not touched upon. And I feel like I appreciate hotels and amenities more and more as I get older.

150
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,720
My mom always said like, Oh, you hardly spend any time in the hotel room. And I'm like,

151
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,680
I spend a lot of time in the hotel room. These days, you know, I spend much more time in the

152
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,120
hotel room. So you're, so what do you want to call that, that choice to throw to the list?

153
00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:00,640
I think I met more like, uh, uh, you know, Polynesian or grand California and club three,

154
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,480
like, well, I don't know. It's what the people want. Okay. So you want to do the

155
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,920
grand Floridian on club three. I don't know. You can put it on somebody else to nominate it. So

156
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:18,320
we can't, it's possible. We could do like the, um, you know, uh, the moderate, uh, moderate or

157
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:24,720
something, um, Port Orleans or Port Orleans. Okay. Pick one. Throw to the listeners.

158
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,440
I'm not trying to put my finger on this scale. I'm asking you to do what I'm asking you to put

159
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,240
your Scott just put his finger on the scale. Okay. He put his buggy finger on the scale. Well,

160
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,560
we all approach it differently. You're just throwing out ideas. I had the phrase right

161
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,520
before I pulled in here of a show, an episode on club three called, uh, Mike and Jason's infinite

162
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,800
playlist, where we just go back and forth and talk about the music we've listened to in the last week.

163
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,840
So I'd like to throw that out on that would be, and if Scott's there, it would be Mike, Jason,

164
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,400
and Scott's infinite playlist. Oh, sure. Yeah. And that's just, that's just talking about what

165
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,040
we've listened to. Well, you know, I played, I listened to so many podcasts. I feel like I

166
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,720
listened to more of that. Well, then that's on your infinite playlist. Sure. Sure. Okay. I love

167
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,600
to shout out, you know, especially friends and peers and stuff. Well, you will be able to shout

168
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,640
out so many peers and then I will be able to shout out many peers too, like Sabrina Carpenter

169
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:29,040
or Olivia Rodrigo. Okay. Cause we're all in the entertainment. Yeah. That's what I'm saying.

170
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,320
My man. All in the entertainment industry. Okay. So today's topic on club three, and let me read

171
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,960
the full, full little blurb here. It was nominated by Ethan Abraham. And he said,

172
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,440
I don't think it's a full episode, but I want to hear Mike's credit card point stacking reward

173
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,040
technique. And then did add maybe a small time griffs and living, uh, living frugally round table.

174
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:57,280
So thank you for that suggestion. And this, this sort of idea, I just simplified it when we put in

175
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,120
the poll, but I said on the second gate that I think we have to expand it a little bit to other

176
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:10,160
points, other reward apps. And yes, if, if a grift, you know, happens upon this conversation,

177
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,000
then we will talk about it. Sure. Um, because, uh, I think you and I share a love of points.

178
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,480
We're both point enthusiasts when it comes to apps, when it comes to credit cards, et cetera,

179
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:30,160
et cetera. Um, and it's, it's a daunting topic for me because I really, I tallied everything up,

180
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,040
how many different rewards points I'm subscribed to. And it's like 30 or so, like it's at least

181
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:44,320
30 when you combine like fast food apps, when you combine hotel rewards, uh, airline rewards

182
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,880
and credit card points, like it's so many. And there's things I'm even forgetting. Like

183
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,360
I thought I would be able to have a concrete number and I, I I'm still finding different rewards

184
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,960
points. And for the average person, I feel like I was trying to analyze this. Why is this? Why do

185
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:06,080
we like points? Is it just cause it's gamified? Is it because like, Oh, this is, uh, we're winning.

186
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,800
It's at like having like playing a fighting game and you get a certain amount of points

187
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,800
or like you collect coins in Mario. Is that where a lot of this comes from? Do you think?

188
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:21,600
I think so. I mean, just getting freebies, like just knowing there's money on that tape, like,

189
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:31,840
Oh, free, free, uh, burrito, like free burrito at McDonald's. So yes, I will. I went to McDonald's

190
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:39,520
before this and spent some points. Oh, great. I spent 3000 McDonald's rewards points. I think

191
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:47,680
it was 3000 on a large coffee. I think, wait, let me check out my McDonald's. So what we're

192
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,480
going to be doing a lot is, and I hate to be vulgar. You know that I hate to be vulgar,

193
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,000
but we're going to have a little bit of a Dick measuring contest here today. We're going to say,

194
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,240
how many McDonald's reward points do you have? How many Jersey shore shore points do you have?

195
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,360
And we'll try to figure out like, who is the superior points haver as well. Well, there's,

196
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,760
so there's so many questions to answer today. Will we stay on podcast the ride or we leave to

197
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,600
do full time points and who has more points? I suspect it's you. I suspect you have more points

198
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:27,040
than I do. Okay. Well, let me tell you, I just found out the bad, some bad news. Uh, my McDonald's

199
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:35,680
points, I am currently at 3023, but I had 1300 points that expired at the start of the month.

200
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:41,600
Well, that's the, that's the most depressing news I've heard all week on Thursday, November 7th,

201
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,120
2024. That's the most depressing thing that's happened this week. This is a thing that I hate

202
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,280
with point when they do like, you gotta use them or they expire. That shit sucks. Yes, they do.

203
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,280
They do that. And it sucks. I feel like how did you let that expire? I don't know. And I live so

204
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:05,360
close to one. You should be going twice a day. Yeah, I don't, I don't think that will be good,

205
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,280
but don't have enough health concerns. I've already pulled back on refined sugar and

206
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,200
unfortunately I do feel pretty good, but I also feel a little bad.

207
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,840
That you're not eating more McDonald's? No, I'm not eating more sugar. Sugar specifically.

208
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,560
Cause you just said this, the doctor said you should probably eat less sugar.

209
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:35,520
Yes, she, she's very, she's big on like more fruits and vegetables. Try a smoothie at the

210
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:42,960
start of the day. So I'm like building a target. You can get a sugary, natural smoothie. I think

211
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,920
she, she is more like natural sugar is better than refined sugar, than like candy sugar. I think

212
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:55,600
that's probably right. So she's saying it's better to have a strawberry than eat pixie sticks. It's

213
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,360
like, I'm going to try making like almond milk, frozen berries, handful of spinach, scoop of peanut

214
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,240
butter, ice. And that'll be sweet. So that will taste sweet. That will taste sweet and it will also

215
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:13,040
like be good for your body. Cover up the greens and be good for the body. So, but I was bummed

216
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:19,280
at the points expiring. I am bummed that CVS doesn't just send me $4 for candy every week.

217
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:25,040
They're too crafty now. They send $4 in like- Have you noticed the CVS has changed since we started

218
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:31,440
talking about it? The last two years, I feel like it's changed a lot. Sometimes I get $4. Sometimes

219
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:38,000
I get like $10 off 40. Yes, I know. And it's like, why the fuck would I be spending $40 at CVS?

220
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,080
Like- CVS is like a devious boy, like a boyfriend who treats you poorly, but then like for a couple

221
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,560
weeks treats you well. Yes, that's a great metaphor. And then you're like, oh, you know what? We did

222
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,640
have a rocky month, but look at what the boyfriend is doing now. But we had a really fun weekend.

223
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,320
We had a really nice weekend because that's when you get that $4 like scot-free. You get that $4 off

224
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:04,400
or a 50% off sometimes you get. It's like 50% off one item at CVS. One item that is not on sale.

225
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,120
Every other item at CVS is on sale. Well, that's the little trick too. But yes, once in a while,

226
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:16,880
they give you that good weekend with that shady boyfriend. Yeah, you go to like a bed and breakfast

227
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,480
and you have so much fun. So much fun. And then it erases the sting of the last few months of like

228
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:29,600
not responding to my texts, not calling me back. But then, yeah. So here's another pet peeve.

229
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:36,320
And this is I'm trying to fix it. But before the pandemic, for the start of the pandemic,

230
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:43,440
I would sign up for every like stores email newsletter to get coup, like free side dish,

231
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:50,560
free dessert. Yeah. And then 2020, everyone switched their marketing to emails. So now

232
00:24:51,280 --> 00:25:00,400
I am bombarded with like so many emails. I signed up for too much. And so I have 6,000 unread emails

233
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:08,400
in my inbox. I have to go through every day and look for actual emails from like friends and

234
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:16,080
coworkers and doctors. Like I have to find the real emails. How long does that take you to find?

235
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,760
I mean, I know what you're saying to some degree, but usually they'll stick out. It doesn't take.

236
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,640
They stick out. And I've been, you know, faving those senders so they go to the top.

237
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,840
Yeah. But have you unsubscribed? Because you can unsubscribe. I'm trying to unsubscribe.

238
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,320
Open your email right now. Let's take a look. It is open right now.

239
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,240
Okay. What do you got in there? Let's start reading it.

240
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,280
Like Roman's bookstore. I like from its bookstore.

241
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,320
Fromins? Roman's. In Pasadena. Oh, yes. That's where we met Robert Evans, of course.

242
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,240
And so Rita's Italianized. I should probably unsubscribe.

243
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,040
Unsubscribe right now because they do it live on mic.

244
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,320
They moved out of the valley. I will unsubscribe right now.

245
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,440
Yeah. So you're getting, because you know, you can bulk a race, like promotional emails

246
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,080
and go in the promotional tab on your Gmail and then you can auto select all of it, essentially

247
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,600
6,000 emails at once and then trash them all. Is that an auto?

248
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,040
Yeah. But basically, I mean, you have to do a couple, you have to do a couple clicks,

249
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,360
but it will do that. So you can, you probably won't miss a personal email,

250
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,920
but it won't get thrown into that pile. But there could be deals. There could be

251
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:25,760
deals. I need the old Navy emails. Old Navy always has a deal.

252
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,480
They always have a deal. And there's always like a weird, like every

253
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,240
different store has a different way to try to trick you into going in there.

254
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,920
And old Navy is like, there'll be like four stacking codes on top of each other.

255
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,840
It's like they'll have a sale, but then they'll have an additional 10% off code.

256
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,040
And then if you like, maybe sign up for their email, you can get an extra five or something.

257
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,480
This is a hypothetical. I don't want to slander old Navy by getting their

258
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,440
promotional strategy wrong, but they have a thing where it's always a running some

259
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,880
like percentage off sale. If you look at their website.

260
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:02,240
Yeah, I was always to like, I was, uh, that's one of the things that I sometimes find difficult

261
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:09,120
with credit card points is like, I don't buy clothes a lot. Like I go through little phases

262
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,840
where I refresh my wardrobe, but I was always an old Navy guy.

263
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,720
And then I kind of tried to switch to J crew factory, uh, cause I thought that you tried.

264
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:27,120
I did for a few years and then I thought those clothes got worse, but old Navy and gap factory

265
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,440
felt like the quality got better. You made a blanket decision in your life to

266
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,600
pivot from old Navy to J crew. It wasn't a blanket decision. It just happened naturally.

267
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,800
It was an organic decision to pivot away from old Navy.

268
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,880
Was it, was it cause you were like, I'm going to have to be dressing fancier now that I'm an older

269
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,920
man? I, I, uh, I think it was in my lead twenties, early thirties. And I was trying to like dress

270
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:57,600
nicer, especially when I was like on the dating scene, I was trying to look respectable.

271
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,680
It wasn't until I realized, uh, well after that, like, oh, some people,

272
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:10,560
mostly men show up to dates looking like trash or like super shitty hypothetical dirt bag

273
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:16,480
boyfriend. We were talking about CVS how you end up with a dirt bag boyfriend or a new term

274
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,360
that's probably going in the dictionary of like word of the year. Situation ship.

275
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,000
I don't hear that. I mean, I hear that a little bit, but I hear that mostly from you.

276
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,040
I believe young people are saying it, but I don't, I don't hear it in my everyday life.

277
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,200
Here's the thing. Also young people might've been saying it through two to three years ago,

278
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,480
and it just got to me. Well, I believe that. Yeah. So are, what would you say now your clothing?

279
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:48,640
Are you more of an old Navy man still? Um, I think now I try to, but be a little, um,

280
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,080
I don't think old Navy is the worst offender fast fashion wise, but like these pants are old Navy.

281
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:00,720
The shirt is D pop, uh, and this jacket is just, or this hoodie is just for the loom from Amazon.

282
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,040
Uh, I just wanted a plain gray hoodie. Um, and did you start shopping at old Navy because you

283
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:13,120
were a little sailor boy and you liked the name old Navy. I ask them every time I go in and I

284
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:20,480
salute them and I confuse all the teenagers and 20 year olds. I worked there and say at ease boys.

285
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:26,640
When you come into old Navy, I, before I come in, I say permission to come aboard and I have to scream

286
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,040
it because no one's ever at the entry way for that store. And you want all the employees to

287
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:38,080
kind of line up and salute you as you come in. I know there are, have too many obligations to do.

288
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,480
And you play a good ship lollipop on your phone. You blast it as you're going through. Yeah. Well,

289
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:51,360
okay. I mean, I'm clothing brand sort of agnostic. I'll buy, I'll wear anything from any place.

290
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,160
I don't buy anything that's that expensive. Generally. I do buy on D pop like second hand

291
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:01,040
thrift. It's not a big fan of second hand. You don't like it. Jane got me really into it. And

292
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:07,280
there's just so much theme park stuff on there. There's nothing wrong with it. And I like having

293
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,840
some old stuff, but there is like part of me that like feels like the ghost of the people who wore

294
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:17,840
it are in the clothes. Sure. Even if they're not dead, I feel like there's like something like the

295
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,480
shirt could take me over. Like I I'm, I'm being half serious when I say that there's like something

296
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,520
about secondhand clothes where I'm just like, Oh, another person wore this. I almost feel like

297
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,080
I'm invading their space or I'm inhabiting their body on some level. I don't know. There's some

298
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:38,400
weird thing I've had since I was a kid about wearing someone else's clothes. I like it to feel

299
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:44,720
like it's, Oh, this is mine. Like I have, I have planted my soul in this t-shirt that has Chuck E

300
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:51,360
cheese on it, which I do have a lot of graphic teas of characters I liked when I was 12. Yeah.

301
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:57,280
You're much better at rotating stuff. I feel like maybe I am. I don't know. I have a lot of shirts.

302
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,840
I have too many shirts and I have to get rid of a bunch because there's just too many make a depop

303
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,760
account. Sell some of them sell shirts now. T-shirts. Yeah. Huge market for it. Yeah. Yeah.

304
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,200
But how much am I going to make for like, not a lot, but a Coles Mario t-shirt that I don't wear

305
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,360
anymore. Oh, I see what you mean. I don't have anything really good in vintage. I think I,

306
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,640
I have my old rock and roller coaster t-shirts somewhere and that's like 20 years old,

307
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,440
25 years old. So there's a few old pieces, but I don't think anything I have right now is valuable.

308
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,160
Okay. So yeah. So you're, so you're primarily your old Navy man now.

309
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:40,320
I think so. Okay. You know, joggers only hold up for so long. Yeah, sure. Like whether they're

310
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:47,760
sweatsuit or, um, twill, uh, I believe is the word. I always call it like khaki material.

311
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,200
Okay. I just call all slacks khaki. I tried to put on my old, some older jeans

312
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,120
to my LCD sound system show and I was like, Oh, they were like too small. And I was like, Oh,

313
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,440
dad, I don't want to think about dad can't get into his old jeans anymore. Yeah. No, I don't.

314
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,680
I did, by the way, I got into them when I wore them. Oh, so I still, I still got it. I'm just

315
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,920
saying, I was like, Oh, this is a really, Oh, this depresses me. Well, I also, the slim fit jeans.

316
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:19,280
There are a lot of styles of the 2010s was a menace. Why did we do that? Why did we all

317
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,440
make ourselves so uncomfortable? I don't know. I don't know. Um, anyway, so you have how many

318
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:30,800
McDonald's points? Uh, I said like 3000. Okay. I have 2,277 McDonald's points. Okay. Just use

319
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:38,960
3000 to get, um, uh, a large iced coffee. And for me and McDonald's, I tend to hoard points.

320
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,680
I tend to get up there. What you're talking about 12,000 points, 13,000 points. And then I'll try to

321
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:48,080
maybe use them all at once or on a big order. I don't know why that is, but that's my McDonald's

322
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,040
strategy. I think with every other type of points, what I'm generally doing is I'm getting some and

323
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,280
I'm spending them. That's what I've been doing lately for almost everything is I'm spending those

324
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:02,560
points fast. I think maybe five years ago when I talked about points for the first time on podcast,

325
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:07,120
the ride, I was more of a hoarder. I was more like, Oh good, I'm going to save it up for a big

326
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:13,200
thing. A big, uh, vacation, a big Wendy's meal. I would, I would take my points and I would,

327
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,760
I would put them in a little pile and wait and see them accumulate. And now for whatever reason,

328
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,360
I'm just like a jumpy with points ready to spend. I'm ready to spend them. And I don't know why

329
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:30,080
that's just life. I guess you change when you get older and I've changed. Um, and I, and I'll say

330
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,920
this, I have less time for points right now. And this is the thing I love. I love this topic

331
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,480
suggestion, but I do have less time for points. We're still, we still have a lot to talk about,

332
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,880
but I do have less time for points. And that's just what happens when you have a child and you

333
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,920
get older. But, but you know, as she goes to school, I will start to gain more hours. I will

334
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:58,160
start to get my time back and get more points back. Sure. Um, as far as other fast food points,

335
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:05,280
what, which ones do you like? Which apps, which, which rewards programs are you a fan of? Uh, uh,

336
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:11,920
Jersey Mike's, I think Jersey Mike's has a very good rewards program. It's called shore points,

337
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:17,040
which I appreciate shore points because sometimes it's just McDonald's reward. Sometimes these fast

338
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,680
food companies, they don't have a fun name. And I feel like that really hurts it, but shore points

339
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:27,760
to me, I've always loved, I've loved shore points. Yeah. And of course you are from there. So that's

340
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,640
why you have a personal affection is because you feel when you spend your shore points, when you

341
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:37,600
gain a few points, you feel, it feels like home. It feels like home. I mean, it's more North Jersey

342
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:43,760
was where Jersey Mike started, but still Jersey Mike's you step in there, the employees behind

343
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,040
the counter say, hello, Jason, you salute them and see, I say Addie's boys. There's a number of them

344
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,280
in Burbank. Uh, now actually, yes. One is opening up pie chains, old apartment. And it's like, can

345
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,560
you imagine if that had been there when we would eat there three times a day, we'd eaten there so

346
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:08,560
much. Uh, I do think, uh, Jersey Mike's is reasonably close to a decent, like East coast Hoagie.

347
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,600
Yo, do you think it's comparable to the back home Hoagie? I think it's comparable. Um, uh, I love

348
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:19,440
Philly's best, which is a local chain of like Philly centric food, cheese steaks and hoagies

349
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:28,160
and tasty cakes and such, but they could put a little more meat and vegetables in those sandwiches.

350
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,120
Oh, you want more? Well, you can add like double meat and you can add, but it's a little more

351
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:39,280
money. Yeah. But Jersey Mike's I think does a pretty good job at loading those up. Even if you

352
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,840
get a smaller one. Right. Um, I have 59 shore points in my account currently. I spent

353
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:52,320
shore points last night on a free sandwich. Oh yeah. So just yesterday I spent free spent points

354
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,680
shore points on a free regular Jersey Mike's sandwich. Um, and I'm trying to figure out it's

355
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:04,000
the app makes it a little confusing how much, uh, how many like points add up to actual sandwiches.

356
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,480
And that's what, uh, that is a pet peeve of mine when it comes to points is that I want to clear,

357
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:15,520
um, a clear answer for how much one point equals how much a dollar or what 50 points equals. Yeah.

358
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,200
So if they keep it a little bit nebulous, sometimes I feel like they can change stuff

359
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:26,720
and I don't like that because Dunkin donuts, these motherfuckers had me on the hook for a while. They

360
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,440
opened that Dunkin donuts in Burbank a couple of years ago. And man, it seemed like you could get

361
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:38,000
a free coffee every other time you went there. Yeah. And points, man, points meant so much more.

362
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,160
They were worth more at Dunkin donuts in these early days. And then all of a sudden the switch

363
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:50,720
was made. Yeah. Well, the food quality has gone downhill remarkably. Like it is gnarly. The donuts

364
00:36:50,720 --> 00:37:00,400
still fine. Okay. Like I much more prefer our many local mom and pop donut shops here, but I like

365
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:08,160
their fake sugar coffee at Dunkin. I don't make the concoctions like on TikTok where it's like

366
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:17,520
20 caramel swirls and 10 caramel shots. Yeah. All right. Like, let me hold on one thing. You just

367
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,840
said the food quality at Dunkin got worse because I don't know that the food quality at Dunkin has

368
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:27,360
ever been high. I feel like the breakfast sandwiches there used to be delicious. I read

369
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,160
sandwiches and bagels. We also always used to get them before it went on trips.

370
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,880
You're not tearing up thinking about that, right? No.

371
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,480
I disagree with that. I think the food has always been awful at Dunkin donuts. I think the coffee's

372
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,360
been good to find. The donuts have been good to find. But anytime I've ever gotten anything else,

373
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,520
it's like it fell on the floor and they're handing it to me in a little paper bag.

374
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,960
Well, the Burbank Dunkin donuts always had some sort of funny business going on.

375
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,280
There is always funny business in the Burbank Dunkin donuts.

376
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:06,400
I am not just being facetious when I say that. All the employees, I think, walked out and they

377
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,360
had to bring in new employees at some point. There was some sort of a massive walkout.

378
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,280
I hadn't been back there in months and months. Then about a month ago, and I'll talk about this

379
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,480
in one second, about a month ago, two weeks ago, whatever, I went in there and I was wondering,

380
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,480
hell, is it different or is it the same? No, it was absolutely the same. No one knew what was

381
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,480
going on. They're doing their best in there. It just seems like there's a problem with the

382
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,200
way it's organized. It seems like there's a problem with communication because I had to ask

383
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:38,720
for my mobile order and they didn't seem to know where it was. There's a lot of fumbling around.

384
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,040
Then I said, well, I ordered the Halloween Munchkin donuts and they were like, oh,

385
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,280
we don't have those. Then they just gave me a bunch of other ones. I didn't want those.

386
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,360
I wanted the ones with the black and orange sprinkles.

387
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:57,120
Yeah, I was mostly at some point going to try the half of this is coffee and a half of this is

388
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,920
orange syrup or half of this is coffee and half of this is green.

389
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,760
I guess I would have tried it. Here's a grift. Here's a small-time grift.

390
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,360
I don't know. This maybe doesn't always work, but what I would do with this Dunkin',

391
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,760
okay, don't tell anybody. What I would do with this Dunkin' is I knew by the end of the night

392
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,640
which donuts they wouldn't have in stock. Say Dunkin' closed at eight, which I think it does

393
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,840
seven or eight, they would always be out of a jelly donut when I would try to do it.

394
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,520
But what happens then is because it's the end of the night, there's a bunch of donuts they got to

395
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:38,000
get rid of. They give you the day-old. I would order on mobile a jelly donut. You go up in the

396
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,240
front or you go up either the front or you go on the drive-through and you would say, oh,

397
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,560
I'm mobile order. You would say your name and they go, oh, we're out of that. I would go, oh,

398
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,800
you are. Oh, I'm sorry. They go, well, do you want something else? I go, oh, yeah, regular donut,

399
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,800
whatever. Then I think there's two things going on here. They feel bad that I came expecting a

400
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,960
donut with jelly in it. Then at number two, they got a bunch of donuts they need to get rid of

401
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,680
because it's the end of the day. They would hand me a bag and it would be full of donuts.

402
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,480
Okay. I showed up at a recording once with a bunch of donuts and I'm like,

403
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,400
oh, Duncan's about to close. They gave me the day-old. They gave me the end

404
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,520
and everyone thought I was insane. But this is pretty common for bakeries or donut shops.

405
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,200
That's right. But that is a little bit of a trick. You would have to agree.

406
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,120
They open a Boss Bagel around here and they gave me a ton of bagels because it was closing.

407
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,080
Bagel Boss.

408
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,160
Bagel Boss. What do they call it? Boss Baby?

409
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,160
They open a Boss Baby.

410
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,120
They open a Boss Baby. A Boss Bagel would be good.

411
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,720
Bagel Boss, of course, unfortunately, a few years ago became notorious on the internet

412
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,360
because that crazy band screamed at it. Remember the Short Muscle Man?

413
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,600
I'll never forget the Short Muscle Man who screamed at the Bagel Boss.

414
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,720
And then he almost had a celebrity fight, but then he pulled out and I forget who he was going to

415
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,360
box. The guy from Bagel Boss.

416
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,360
No, I don't think so. What was that guy's name?

417
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,040
Well, he's in the Trump cabinet now.

418
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,040
Yeah, he's going to be the Secretary of State. I know the yelling man in the Boss Bagel is

419
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:19,280
definitely going to be in the cabinet. But yeah, so that is a little trick and I did do it a couple

420
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,520
times. I haven't done it in a while. And I'll be honest with you. I don't know now what they won't

421
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,840
have at the end of the day. I'm not confident like I was months ago.

422
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,680
I do know. Oh, here we go.

423
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,040
Yeah, here we go. Here we go.

424
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,040
You order the limited time stuff.

425
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,240
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

426
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,560
Because they're not going to have a lot of that.

427
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:38,880
Right.

428
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,960
In theory, unless it's like a dud where they end up with a lot of it.

429
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,520
Right.

430
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:50,640
So maybe if you're going to Starbucks, order the Wicked drinks at the end of the night.

431
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,640
You think they'll be out of the Wicked drinks?

432
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,520
Maybe. Well, I think the Halloween stuff, like they had spider donuts at Duncan,

433
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,920
where like it would be like a big spider in frosting.

434
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,200
Yeah, they don't have a lot of those.

435
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,160
They don't have a lot of those.

436
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,920
Like one tray or a half a tray of those.

437
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,920
Right. So yeah, you try to do that and you want to make them feel bad for you.

438
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,160
If I have a tip for all of the listeners out there.

439
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,920
Oh, you always want to make the service workers feel bad.

440
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,560
You want to make the service worker feel bad for you.

441
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,200
And then when they feel bad for you, you get extra.

442
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:19,760
Sure.

443
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,800
And that's the biggest thing you could probably take away.

444
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,240
None of this is financial advice.

445
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,760
I wouldn't recommend getting into points unless it's something you're ready into.

446
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,680
But a thing I can offer to all of you is that you should make

447
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,200
the people who work at these places feel bad for you, feel sorry for you.

448
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,400
Don't yell at them.

449
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,280
They're working probably for low wages.

450
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,160
They're doing their best.

451
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,120
It's a hard job.

452
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,720
So never make them feel bad because you yell, but it's okay to look pathetic.

453
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,840
It's okay to seem sad and pathetic when you do this,

454
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,560
because sometimes you'll get an extra little treat.

455
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,920
I think that's a smart play.

456
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,120
All right. Coming back a little.

457
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,680
I have a hundred and fifty eight short points.

458
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,160
A hundred.

459
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,440
Oh, you could get a couple.

460
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,920
I feel like you get a couple of regular giant.

461
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,040
Oh, I've never.

462
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,160
See, I always use my short points before getting the giant

463
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,320
and I've never ordered a giant from Jersey Mike.

464
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,920
Well, you know, I think what's happened is I use the app for delivery

465
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,800
a couple of times where we're like, it's later in the day.

466
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,520
We're tired.

467
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,320
We don't want to cook.

468
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,120
We don't want to go out.

469
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,000
Let me ask you this question.

470
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,400
Have you post mated a Jersey Mike's?

471
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,120
I've used the app to order delivery.

472
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,720
Oh, so it'll go through the app.

473
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,720
I think it goes through door dash.

474
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,480
Because I was going to wonder if you could get short points

475
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,280
when you do a Postmates, but it does auto do it through the app.

476
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,120
It auto does it through the app.

477
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,240
Is the giant sub like Dagwood sized?

478
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,640
Have you ever gotten a giant sub before from there?

479
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,280
I've seen.

480
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,360
I think Jane has ordered it.

481
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:50,640
And I think once we both ordered giant subs where you both ordered giant subs.

482
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,920
Yeah, we were really hungry.

483
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,640
You could.

484
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,160
But isn't a giant sub a giant?

485
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,920
I think it's just like two regular size subs.

486
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,680
And you ate that in a meal?

487
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:08,080
No, I would eat half and then say the other half for lunch the next day.

488
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,680
OK, well, that's a smart play.

489
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:09,920
Yeah.

490
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,880
That's a good tip.

491
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:11,680
Yeah.

492
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,480
And I'm being serious.

493
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,120
Well, you were, you know, during early days of the pandemic,

494
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,800
you were like, if I'm getting takeout, I'll get two entrees.

495
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:21,600
Right.

496
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,080
I have one the night and then one the next day.

497
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:28,320
Because the cost of even starting up a delivery is so high,

498
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:35,120
it does it like adding an extra entree doesn't really add too much more than just

499
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,280
like you may as well get it.

500
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,160
You may as well have the person bring an extra one

501
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,920
because that's not going to shoot up your costs.

502
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,680
You're already paying a certain high cost to have food delivered.

503
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:46,400
Yeah.

504
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,320
It's not going to jack it up so much.

505
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,920
You have to tip a little bit more.

506
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,360
But other than that, you may as well do it if you're going to like indulge.

507
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,240
For sure.

508
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:54,720
Yeah.

509
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,520
And I always try a lot of the restaurants I like at Burbank have

510
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,080
if you order direct from their website, if they have their own delivery guys.

511
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:04,880
That's better.

512
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,600
Yes, of course.

513
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,040
That's better for the business and often is faster

514
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,560
and often is like cheaper because they're not taking like this middleman.

515
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,240
These apps are all middlemen.

516
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,720
It's like this is the love and hate with apps

517
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,280
because a lot of these apps, these delivery apps,

518
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,640
they're basically just a middleman who's going to siphon money out of

519
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,880
you and the company that they're delivering.

520
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,680
Well, sure.

521
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,840
And even social media now, it's always just been data harvesting.

522
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,760
It's like if it's free, you're probably the product, right?

523
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,640
That's what they say.

524
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,080
Like, you know, I want to go ahead.

525
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,600
Sorry, I'm jumping all over the place.

526
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,400
I am too.

527
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,040
We should.

528
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,080
What did you want to talk about?

529
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,760
I want to talk about the Wendy's app.

530
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,880
OK, you're building the credit card points.

531
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,520
That is what?

532
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,080
Yes, I'm glad.

533
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,760
Yes, that is what we're doing.

534
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,400
We're building to the what's called the chase trifecta.

535
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,960
Are you still on the chase?

536
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,600
I am still on the chase trifecta, which is this is just a teaser, of course.

537
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,800
We still have another two hours of these other things to talk about.

538
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,600
Great.

539
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,960
The chase trifecta is having multiple three cards.

540
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,800
You can there is something where you have four cards, but I don't fuck with that.

541
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,800
I have three chase cards and you combine them to maximize your points.

542
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,240
That's sort of what we're building to.

543
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,960
But I want to get through a couple more apps and a couple more point reward systems.

544
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,600
A thing I like about Wendy's is Wendy's has reward points

545
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,200
and they also have deals in the app, which I like.

546
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,680
And the thing that I like about this is you can stack deals and rewards,

547
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,400
which is not the case.

548
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,480
McDonald's does not let you do that.

549
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,200
Correct.

550
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,680
So McDonald's will say we have a deal for what a dollar large drink,

551
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,280
two dollars for three cookies or something.

552
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,000
That seems crazy.

553
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,560
They wouldn't do that.

554
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,760
But you get my point.

555
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,720
It's a deal.

556
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,440
And then in addition to that, you would like to use some of your reward points to get a free item.

557
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,960
They will not let you do that.

558
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,720
It drives me crazy.

559
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:06,560
OK, but the trade off and I this I am not the only one who had said this.

560
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,160
I have seen on the way are Wendy's on Reddit.

561
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,160
Wendy's quality has gone way downhill the last few years.

562
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,640
They used to be the best fast food.

563
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,960
Now it's like I feel like Burger King's quality has gone up.

564
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,160
Wendy's has gone down.

565
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:27,200
Although Burger King chicken has gotten shittier during the chicken sandwich wars.

566
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,360
It was a big proponent of the chicken sandwich.

567
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,160
OK, wait, hold on.

568
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:32,720
Hold on.

569
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,360
OK, you've.

570
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,760
So wait, you're you are.

571
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,880
I am I am playing the game of this episode and I'm just don't think you left.

572
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,720
I am doing a lot of food like you're this is this is the second time in the episode

573
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,680
where you've stumped me by the take of the food quality.

574
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,240
Do you think when I'm trying to focus more on?

575
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,440
Well, that's what I'm trying to think about.

576
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,800
I'm trying to figure this out because I'm I'm being more analytical in talking about the points.

577
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,560
But then, of course, and I'm not mad at this.

578
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,800
You're talking about the quality of the fast food, which is a thing I like to talk about as well.

579
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,440
But some of this I haven't considered the Dunkin Donuts take.

580
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,880
I think it's completely absurd.

581
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,480
That food has always been garbage to me.

582
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,720
That food has been awful.

583
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,560
Maybe we just had better ones.

584
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,760
It's possible.

585
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,040
Sometimes you get stuff.

586
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,680
I thought my Jersey Mike sub yesterday was delicious.

587
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,400
I had a tuna.

588
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,120
I had a tuna.

589
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,880
I used to be a lot more skeptical.

590
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,160
I like their tuna, too.

591
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,120
I think it's great.

592
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:23,920
I think it's great.

593
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,040
And I added banana peppers.

594
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,240
I added dill pickles to it.

595
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,440
You can do that in app.

596
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,960
I like the hoagie spread.

597
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,720
I like the chopped cherry pepper spread.

598
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,400
I have cherry pepper spread in the fridge.

599
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,280
Hoagie spread.

600
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,240
Some places call it hoagie spread.

601
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,120
And that's what you're saying.

602
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:37,840
It's chopped cherry.

603
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,040
Chopped cherry peppers.

604
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,400
Is that come out of Mike's way?

605
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,440
Jersey Mike sub?

606
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,360
You have to add it manually.

607
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,800
No, it doesn't come on manually.

608
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,920
They don't give you a jar.

609
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,360
You mean you have to add manually.

610
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:51,280
I had to buy a jar just to have it.

611
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,080
So and what brand of hoagie spread do you have?

612
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,640
I believe it's here.

613
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,200
I'll find it.

614
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,160
Bento hoagie spread.

615
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,000
I'm getting the name wrong.

616
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,120
It's Italian American brand.

617
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,000
Italian American.

618
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,480
Going back in my Amazon orders,

619
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,280
which I do use Amazon more than I used to.

620
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,800
And it does suck shit.

621
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,320
That has definitely gotten worse.

622
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,360
Yeah, sure.

623
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,040
I'm just interested.

624
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,880
I don't know that you've ever said hoagie spread.

625
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,800
I don't know if you ever said those two words together

626
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,320
on podcast the ride before.

627
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,000
I feel like I don't call it.

628
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,360
I never call it that.

629
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,840
I just said hot peppers.

630
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,160
I see.

631
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,120
But that is called hoagie spread.

632
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,200
Some places call it hoagie spread.

633
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,920
I don't love that they call it that.

634
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,480
Hoagie is one of the funniest words for a sandwich.

635
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,920
I recently saw someone refer to the Philly accent as hoagie mouth.

636
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,120
And I think that is very hoagie mouth.

637
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,840
Hoagie also would be like a funny nickname.

638
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,080
Like if your little rascals character would be

639
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,480
like Jason Hoagie Sheridan or something.

640
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,680
Oh, it's Hoagie.

641
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,800
Here comes Hoagie.

642
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,080
He always has a big sandwich with him.

643
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,440
It does seem like a Hoagie's Heroes character.

644
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,720
Well, because on Hoagie's Heroes,

645
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,880
there would be a character named Hoagie and Hoagie.

646
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,760
Nicknames?

647
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,400
Yeah, I know that.

648
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,280
But I'm saying if it was called Hoagie's Heroes,

649
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,880
why would there be a different character named Hoagie?

650
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,200
Look, they weren't as precise at writing.

651
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,200
Well, you think writing was bad in the 70s.

652
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,040
So they would say, ah, shit.

653
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,200
Not Pento, Cento Hoagie spread.

654
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,080
OK, we got a character named Hogan on the Hoagie's Heroes.

655
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,120
We need another name.

656
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,160
What about Hoagie?

657
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,840
Oh, yeah, I guess so.

658
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,640
If you go into an Italian deli back here,

659
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,960
there's just a wall of Cento products.

660
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,280
It looks similar to salsa.

661
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:44,640
Kind of.

662
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,080
I mean, it's chopped cherry pepper,

663
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,360
is probably a little vinegar.

664
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,160
And it's good.

665
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,360
I have it in there.

666
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,040
I've had it in there for a while.

667
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,400
And I don't know.

668
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,240
I never know how long pickled or preserved products last.

669
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,440
So I don't know.

670
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,960
That's another Club 3 episode.

671
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,960
It's Pickled and Preserved Products with Jason.

672
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,040
If somebody wants to suggest that.

673
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:05,540
I don't.

674
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,840
I am a lot more conscious of expiration dates nowadays.

675
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:15,520
Because I used to eat anything.

676
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,880
Jade, living together.

677
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,880
Jade's like, throw that out to me.

678
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,440
You are like Homer with the big Hoagie behind the radiator.

679
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,600
I am like Homer with the big Hoagie.

680
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,400
It's just that nowadays, if I get a cold,

681
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,280
or I get stomach ache or food poisoning,

682
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,280
it's 10 times worse with that mess.

683
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,440
But in the old days, you would welcome the food poisoning.

684
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,880
In the old days, I had an iron stomach.

685
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,000
Although in the old days, I feel like you would be like,

686
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,760
yeah, my stomach really hurts.

687
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,720
And now it's because you were eating expired Hoagie sauce.

688
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,320
You were drinking a glass of hoagie.

689
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,000
Let's get to the whethies.

690
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,640
Hold on, hold on.

691
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,680
No, there's another thing, too.

692
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,480
I'm trying to imagine an episode of Hogan's Heroes

693
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,880
where Colonel Clink is very confused

694
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,320
because there's a character named Hogan

695
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,600
and there's a character named Hoagie.

696
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,080
And they had to write so many episodes a season.

697
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:02,640
Perfect.

698
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,600
One episode done.

699
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,520
Hogan and Hoagie.

700
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,680
And then Hoagie gets transferred to another Prisoner of War cam.

701
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,200
Hogan and Hoagie.

702
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:17,120
I mean, there's got to be a show where that is like a common joke.

703
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:17,920
The two characters.

704
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,800
I guess on New Heart, they had the three guys

705
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,800
that were all named the same.

706
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,680
Was it Bob?

707
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,160
Not Bob.

708
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,440
But they were Daryl.

709
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,720
This is my other brother, Daryl.

710
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,320
They would have the same name.

711
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,840
So that was kind of the gag there.

712
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,440
But Hogan and Hoagie.

713
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,080
Because maybe Seinfeld should have had a character named

714
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,000
Kramer and Cramie or something.

715
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,360
There's a character named Cramie.

716
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,000
Sure.

717
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,760
And Kramer keeps getting mad

718
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,480
because everyone keeps accusing him of the stuff Cramie.

719
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:44,960
Right.

720
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,200
All right.

721
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,440
Well, if you want to suggest for Club 3 next month,

722
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:55,680
Hoagie stuff with Jason or Hoagie sauce or pickled items or anything.

723
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,880
Anything in that vein.

724
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,800
I'm interested to hear it.

725
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,120
So Wendy's lets you stack.

726
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,720
So sometimes it'll say free large drink with purchase.

727
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,520
Sometimes it'll say free cookie with purchase.

728
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,200
And I like those because with Wendy's, you can click on that

729
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,320
and the free and the purchase can be a free item in your rewards column.

730
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,040
Did you know this?

731
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:21,760
I don't think I knew.

732
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,880
I don't think you knew this.

733
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,560
I don't think the world knows this.

734
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:28,560
Wendy's app does have decent offers.

735
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,000
They still do have decent offers.

736
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,760
So we'll get to the food quality in a moment.

737
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,200
But what you can do is you can go into your app

738
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,640
and you can say, OK, I'm going to use some of my points.

739
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,760
And like I'm just I'm in here.

740
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,040
For instance, I have 618 Wendy's points right now.

741
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,240
And I could get let's see with that.

742
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,040
I could get a Dave's single, just a regular hamburger.

743
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,720
So you could click on that and get your free hamburger

744
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,680
and then you could combine it with a deal.

745
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:02,880
So for instance, here I can get a dollar small chili with qualifying purchase.

746
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,840
So that would that would be OK.

747
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:09,600
So I can get now go to Wendy's after this and maybe I will.

748
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,520
I can get a hamburger for free

749
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,920
and then a small chili for a dollar.

750
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,640
OK, and that is so protein.

751
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,640
That's a great protein.

752
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,760
Even though you shit on Wendy's just a second ago.

753
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,760
I love Wendy's.

754
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,800
I just you lament the fall lamenting like I hate that lettuce

755
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,200
they use now with the big stalk down the middle.

756
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,880
They change lettuce.

757
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,880
They did change the lettuce a few years ago

758
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,240
and I had been researching this and following this

759
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,320
and trying to get to the bottom.

760
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,120
You've been following.

761
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:44,160
Is it just the West Coast or is it something else?

762
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,960
And I think it was during 2020.

763
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,320
Let us supply this is a disaster.

764
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,080
This is disaster capitalism.

765
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,240
Yeah, this is when there's some sort of crisis.

766
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,600
That's iceberg lettuce.

767
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,600
So you said the best chunks of lettuce.

768
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:02,000
And now it's just like it's just stock like.

769
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,560
Did you you crave iceberg lettuce?

770
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,200
I I didn't crave iceberg lettuce.

771
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,080
I craved Wendy's iceberg lettuce.

772
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:10,560
Really?

773
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,520
I've never heard another human being on the planet.

774
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,640
You get a beach.

775
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,640
You would get a big chunk on the junior bacon.

776
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,200
Yeah, no, I know.

777
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,000
I know what you're saying is like one of our things.

778
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,920
You like the Quarter Pounder.

779
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,680
You like Dave's single.

780
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:27,760
I like a junior bacon cheeseburger or regular McDonald's cheeseburger.

781
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,280
I like the little ones.

782
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,400
I think the little ones they use on the Big Mac are the little ones.

783
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,520
Maybe that's why you think some of the quality is declined is because.

784
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,800
Those I think are fine.

785
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,840
Those I think.

786
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,160
But I just I don't like the lettuce.

787
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,880
I feel like the cuts of chicken are not as good.

788
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,680
Like for the spicy chicken sandwich.

789
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,120
Yeah, I I would give you that.

790
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:53,040
Maybe there's a 20% drop off in the quality of Wendy's fast food.

791
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,840
But I don't think it's abysmal and it depends.

792
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,640
It's it's one of those where like you go to the one by the Empire Center

793
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,080
and it depends if they've got the A team working or they get the B team working.

794
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,200
Sometimes it's a little chaotic going to that one.

795
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:10,160
Sometimes the Empire Center at rush hour at night.

796
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,840
People are going into work.

797
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:16,000
It's right by a freeway off ramp on ramp, you know.

798
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
So it's just a little stressful.

799
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,920
Yes, I always order.

800
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,960
Let me ask you this.

801
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,640
Do you order your items, your fast food before going?

802
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,520
Oh, yeah.

803
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,080
On the app.

804
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:28,880
Yes, you do it.

805
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,400
I almost exclusively do that now.

806
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,240
I get really mad at myself when I forgot to do it or which is rare.

807
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,040
Well, I got really mad because I was I was visiting family.

808
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:42,480
I was back east in Pennsylvania and Jersey recently for the first time in like a year.

809
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,560
And I forgot to log into the Wawa app.

810
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,840
And any time we go to Wawa, we'd be at the cash register.

811
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,720
I was like, shit.

812
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,600
And I would try to open the app and it's like, log in.

813
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,560
And I'm like, I just buy the two dollar coffee.

814
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:59,200
And you couldn't get your rewards just by putting in your phone number?

815
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,040
I don't think so.

816
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,000
Or maybe you can.

817
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,720
And I just only go a few times a year.

818
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,400
How many Wendy's points do you have?

819
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,640
I have six hundred and hold on.

820
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,040
Hold on.

821
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,960
Six hundred and I know six eighteen.

822
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,800
I have three hundred and eighty three.

823
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,520
Three eighty three.

824
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,000
Oh, yeah.

825
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,400
Never mind.

826
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,200
I take it back that I was going to be losing to you in points.

827
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,640
It seems like I have more points than you, maybe.

828
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,600
I think so.

829
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,080
OK.

830
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:24,720
And what was and you still you were going to Wendy's like you would you redeem for,

831
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:29,440
you know, usually redeem redeem for a junior bacon cheeseburger

832
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,320
because those used to be a dollar and now they're like three bucks.

833
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:32,560
Yes.

834
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,440
I mean, everything is going.

835
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,320
Everything is up.

836
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,560
We know the price of meat is up.

837
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:41,760
But yes, now you also said and there's so many things you keep saying

838
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,680
that I keep forgetting to dig in on.

839
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,760
You said the Burger King has gotten better.

840
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,880
Well, I just think, you know, we get the Wednesday

841
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,920
Whoppers and Impossible Whoppers are like three bucks.

842
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,880
Is that a weekly?

843
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,160
Do you get that every week?

844
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,760
No, we don't get it every week.

845
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,720
You get the offer.

846
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,160
How many Wednesday Whopper days are you celebrating?

847
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,200
Maybe like once a month.

848
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,080
But like Jane, if we're doing fast food, Jane's vegetarian.

849
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,240
So she really likes the Impossible Whopper.

850
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,760
And I like it a lot, too.

851
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:10,720
That's another thing.

852
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,680
I don't like the Whopper.

853
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,120
I like the Whopper Jr.

854
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,080
Whoppers too big.

855
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,840
This is crazy.

856
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,120
I'm a little guy.

857
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,560
I'm a little guy.

858
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:19,680
I guess that's it.

859
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,480
Is it because is it more to do with the amount of food

860
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,120
or is it is it overwhelming to hold?

861
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,280
No, it's not overwhelming to hold.

862
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,200
It's just like the amount of food.

863
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,480
Like, I don't have a huge appetite.

864
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,120
I had a huge appetite for sugar and doctor's orders.

865
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,400
I'm supposed to cut back on that.

866
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:36,900
Sure.

867
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:41,040
The last time I went to Wendy's, I got a son of a baconator

868
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:45,040
and I had never tried the baconator set up before.

869
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,200
And I thought it was disgusting.

870
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,960
Too much bacon.

871
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,200
Hamburger tasted like hot dog.

872
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,920
Well, that doesn't sound bad to me.

873
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,800
Hamburger tastes hamburger tasted like hot dog.

874
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,480
It was just too much.

875
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,960
It was better to have a little bit of bacon

876
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,600
to get the flavor of the bacon and the cheeseburger.

877
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,040
How much was too much bacon?

878
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,640
How much bacon do you think is too much?

879
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,600
This is like it's a number of strips of bacon.

880
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,000
A number.

881
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,120
I forget the difference between the son of a baconator

882
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,840
and the baconator, but it's a lot of strips of bacon

883
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,920
and mayonnaise like I like the lettuce

884
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,360
and mayo to counteract it.

885
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,200
I don't think there's anything that I mean.

886
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,560
Okay, wait, no, I take that back

887
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,080
because the Duncan thing floored me.

888
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,640
The loving the fast food lettuce to me is wild.

889
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,760
It's only a Wendy's.

890
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,440
Burger King has okay lettuce too.

891
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,520
Is there another, and I guess I have to ask the listener,

892
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,000
is there another human being on the planet

893
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,920
that craves Wendy's lettuce?

894
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,520
There are a lot of posts on our Wendy's about the lettuce.

895
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,080
I'm not the only one who has noticed this.

896
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,000
How often are you on the Reddit for Wendy's?

897
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,200
Well, I think I follow it on my burner.

898
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,520
So every time I open the app, it shows me a gnarly picture.

899
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,520
Can you open up our Wendy's right now?

900
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,160
Yeah, sure.

901
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,520
I just want to see what the topics,

902
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,760
do you ever post on our Wendy's anonymously?

903
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:06,560
I don't think so.

904
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,520
No, I just, a lot of these apps I just like on

905
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,920
and I'm trying to get off them and read more books

906
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,840
and watch more movies.

907
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,360
Because you are obviously the best reader

908
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,640
of the three podcasts, the right host,

909
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,480
but when you say you read a lot,

910
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,720
is a lot of it just that you're reading the Wendy's Reddit?

911
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,880
No, no, I have my paperbacks and I met Kendall.

912
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,240
Like here's one.

913
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,560
Is this normal?

914
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,160
And I don't know what this stuff is,

915
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,680
but it's like a drink.

916
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,240
It's like a milkshake or it's a frosty

917
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,360
and then on the bottom there's orange sludge, orange goo.

918
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,760
It's the Spongebob pineapple frosty,

919
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,160
which people are very not thrilled about.

920
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:46,660
I had it.

921
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,200
How was it, the burger or the frosty?

922
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,240
The frosty.

923
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,440
Do you have the burger?

924
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,320
No, it's just a day's single with special sauce.

925
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,520
Yes, here's the thing with a lot of these promotions

926
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,040
and a lot of the fast food places.

927
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,840
They dress everything up to make it look different and it's not.

928
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,760
Now I will say that frosty is a different flavor,

929
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,720
so I appreciate that.

930
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,200
Pineapple, yeah.

931
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,120
And it is a pretty good, it's pretty good.

932
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,840
I don't crave it, but a lot of the times obviously

933
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:10,880
they're just trying to trick me.

934
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,760
Now I get tricked often to go and try a new item,

935
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,600
but it's generally the items they already have

936
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,680
and they're just like putting them in different sizes

937
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,920
and different configurations when you go.

938
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,120
Are you looking through our Wendy's?

939
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:24,720
Yeah, here's a picture of like a shitty looking spicy chicken

940
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:25,440
sandwich.

941
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,560
Yes, and they've opened this up and it's like half,

942
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,600
you can see inside.

943
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,400
A big nugget.

944
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,920
And that lettuce doesn't look good to you?

945
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,160
I don't like, I like leaf lettuce in a salad.

946
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,720
Okay, so that's not the type even of lettuce.

947
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,840
They changed it.

948
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:40,400
They changed it.

949
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,880
That looks like a healthier piece of leaf lettuce

950
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,640
or a healthier piece of lettuce.

951
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,440
Iceberg just is like a tasteless.

952
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,800
But it's mostly stock.

953
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,800
Let me ask you this about the lettuce.

954
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,080
Is the crunch satisfying to you?

955
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,440
Is it more of a texture thing?

956
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,560
I like the crunch.

957
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,320
I just think I like the lettuce, the way the lettuce.

958
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,000
You will say it's taste.

959
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,280
It's not taste because a lot of people have texture with food

960
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,640
and I feel like I have less of that,

961
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,480
but you think that it's more just taste

962
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,560
and not that you like a crunch, a healthy crunch.

963
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,600
Okay, do you notice different brands of water?

964
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,400
Can you taste it?

965
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,040
Yes.

966
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,640
Okay, I can do that too.

967
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,440
You can do it.

968
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,640
Do you think you do better than me?

969
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:17,200
I can't.

970
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,040
I didn't say I can do it better than you,

971
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,080
but I like hate the Sani and Awafina.

972
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,360
Club three, I agree with you.

973
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,520
Club three, water taste test.

974
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,840
If somebody wants to nominate that, Jason and I.

975
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,040
And then if Scott's there,

976
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,440
if we want to taste test different bottle of water.

977
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,160
Arrowhead and Evian are like.

978
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:34,640
Better.

979
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,280
Better.

980
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:35,920
Yes, better.

981
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,960
The kind, oh God, I forget the brand.

982
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,080
There was like a fancy brand they used to have at the Arclight.

983
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:47,200
And alkaline water, some places have, I like alkaline water.

984
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,480
See, I stopped doing alkaline water

985
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,400
because I feel like I saw a study that said it was bad.

986
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:51,760
I don't know.

987
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,080
And now I'm all, I know I tried to all be glass bottle

988
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,840
because of the microplastics.

989
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,560
Right.

990
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,640
So I try not to even have any of the glass bottles,

991
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,080
but yes, water I can taste.

992
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,520
But this lettuce thing is interesting.

993
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,120
I could see how it's better or worse,

994
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:06,960
but I didn't realize that that was such a thing that people missed.

995
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,680
There is also very funny comments on that spicy chicken sandwich picture

996
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,320
because someone talks about color correcting it.

997
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,280
Oh, to me it looked bad.

998
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,280
And they're like, wait, that's not your photo.

999
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,240
Did you color correct someone else's photo?

1000
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,760
That's insane.

1001
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,880
Someone on the Wendy's Reddit stole a photo

1002
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,120
of someone else's dirty chicken sandwich.

1003
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,120
I can't tell.

1004
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,240
It's so confusing.

1005
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,080
Here's a funny post where it's like,

1006
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,760
all this stuff looks like it's on sale.

1007
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,800
You put it in your bag.

1008
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,320
It's $2 more.

1009
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,120
That's fucked up.

1010
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,600
Well, Wendy's was using that dynamic pricing.

1011
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:44,240
They were like messing around with it, like it was Ticketmaster Airlines.

1012
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,800
So if you had a Wendy's like outside a concert or something,

1013
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,880
they would raise the price at the concert came out.

1014
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,360
Yeah, that's psycho.

1015
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,400
Dynamic pricing at fast food or at grocery stores,

1016
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,080
you should be in the socks.

1017
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,640
You should be at the center of town.

1018
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,600
Cut me off in 15 seconds.

1019
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,720
That's where the country's headed.

1020
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,440
Yeah, no, I know.

1021
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,520
That's where we're going.

1022
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,680
I forgot.

1023
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,360
Your Magneto helmet is right here that I bought you.

1024
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,760
Yeah, my Magneto helmet is a place of honor.

1025
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,760
It's under a big history of Marvel Comics coffee table book.

1026
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,120
It's so cool.

1027
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,600
You have a full-size Magneto helmet that I bought you.

1028
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,400
Anyway, it's right here.

1029
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,600
And I just got distracted by it.

1030
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,200
And I'm not going to cut that part out.

1031
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,880
Oh, here's one I think someone is being positive.

1032
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:30,960
Their frosty and fruit cup and loaded fries look reasonably good.

1033
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:35,680
Yeah, I mean, that could be color corrected to make it look a little more appetizing.

1034
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:41,520
It's kind of a grayish hue to it, which isn't so enticing to me.

1035
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,280
Look, I'm on some subreddit.

1036
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,400
I'm on Reddit a little bit.

1037
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,640
And I've never thought to even go on Wendy's.

1038
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,920
And I'm not again, I'm not I'm going to go on.

1039
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,120
It is what I'm really because I was trying to get to the end of the chicken sandwich.

1040
01:04:55,120 --> 01:05:01,520
I feel like I started you unintentionally got me into these subreddits because I follow like

1041
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,640
the squared circle wrestling subreddit.

1042
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:04,960
Sure.

1043
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,840
Yeah, Marvel Legends subreddit.

1044
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:13,920
People do cool little scenes with their actually pose their figures or they have all about it.

1045
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,280
I know all about it.

1046
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:17,680
You know what I like?

1047
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:22,480
When you get points and rewards points like I buy these toys from this company NECO.

1048
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,760
We've talked about it before.

1049
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,200
Generally, Ninja Turtles.

1050
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,600
I just got my comic con exclusive.

1051
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,840
For some reason, it took forever to get those in the mail.

1052
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:33,680
OK, Peter Laird, Kevin Eastman, creators and Ninja Turtles.

1053
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,440
Their original turtle design toys came in the mail.

1054
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,240
That's very cool.

1055
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,400
I was hoping it was the action figures of them.

1056
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:46,400
Well, they did make a Kevin Eastman for New York Comic Con, which has been procured

1057
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,920
by Griffin Newman for me.

1058
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,200
Oh, OK, that's good.

1059
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,760
Which because I get sold out so quickly on the website.

1060
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:52,800
Because you got me.

1061
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,680
There was a Todd McFarlane action figure in the nineties.

1062
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:56,240
Of course.

1063
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,840
And you would mail away for it.

1064
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,080
You got me that.

1065
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:06,480
But there was a more recent two pack with Todd and a spawn action figure based on his

1066
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,880
original childhood drawing.

1067
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,680
Yes, which is really fun.

1068
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,480
So yeah, I love that.

1069
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,600
And there's a character.

1070
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:17,120
They just made basically a Jack Kirby figure in the Ninja Turtles.

1071
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,400
Which I have in the other room.

1072
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,040
Which is great.

1073
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:19,840
Which is so much fun.

1074
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:25,200
So yes, I am hoping there's more Kevin and then eventually Peter figures.

1075
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,960
Because there's like animated versions of them.

1076
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,880
That to me is so much fun.

1077
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,680
Stan Lee figures, they've had those before.

1078
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:37,760
But to have the figures of the creators of the stuff hanging out with their creations

1079
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:38,480
on your display.

1080
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:39,760
Very fun.

1081
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,200
Eating pizza, having a party with a boombox.

1082
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,640
Like you always do fun little setups.

1083
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,000
I have so many fun little setups.

1084
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,920
But anyway, so yeah, I just finally got those toys in the mail and those are awesome.

1085
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,360
Because I don't know, they're great.

1086
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,560
Because they're original.

1087
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:59,520
The original version of the turtles and Kevin and Peter both had slightly different

1088
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,240
designs for like the original turtles.

1089
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,920
And they've rendered them beautifully.

1090
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,880
But so I looked on the website and I was checking like to...

1091
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,160
I forgot, I was just checking to make sure it said it had shipped.

1092
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,840
And NECA has reward points now.

1093
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:17,600
And they gave me like retroactive points for all the things I've bought over the years.

1094
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,240
Wow.

1095
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,800
Wait, did you have to ask for that or they gave you that?

1096
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,080
I just was in my account.

1097
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:22,480
Wow.

1098
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,280
And I was thrilled.

1099
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,520
So I'm looking through and I'm like, oh, I can get some of the universal monsters.

1100
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,280
I can get some gargoyles.

1101
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,080
And I have like...

1102
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,280
Disney gargoyles or just decorative gargoyles?

1103
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,320
Disney gargoyles.

1104
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,760
Okay, thank you for clarifying.

1105
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,640
And I have 28,855 points.

1106
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,320
And each figure is like 5,000 points.

1107
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,600
So I can get like five figures.

1108
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:43,520
Five figures.

1109
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,960
I'm like, you know, that's how much I make every year.

1110
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:47,840
Five figures.

1111
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:51,200
And then that's how many figures I'll get this year for free.

1112
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:51,700
Yeah.

1113
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,760
So I like that.

1114
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,400
Anytime I...

1115
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,760
That was a surprise rewards point situation.

1116
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,920
Because it's generally, yeah, you get rewards points for fast food, airlines, hotel.

1117
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,280
But toy reward points?

1118
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,000
Get the fuck out of there.

1119
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:04,720
That's crazy.

1120
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:09,360
So yeah, if you ever order from there, it will accumulate and you can get free toys.

1121
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,120
Let's see here.

1122
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:16,800
I wrote so many different apps and things down here.

1123
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:22,480
What do you think about Target reward points?

1124
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,520
Well, okay.

1125
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,560
So I like Target reward points.

1126
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,440
And that was, for a long time, I resisted.

1127
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:32,640
Like getting a store specific credit card.

1128
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,800
But I did get a Target card like six months ago.

1129
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,720
Just because they give you 5% off immediately.

1130
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:41,840
I resisted this too.

1131
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:46,880
This is where the point brothers are falling just in line with each other.

1132
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:48,080
And this is never...

1133
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,920
We've never talked about this before.

1134
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:50,240
No.

1135
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:53,120
You're hearing this conversation live for the first time, folks.

1136
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,800
But yes, I resisted as well.

1137
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:58,320
But this Target card, you get 5% off all your purchases.

1138
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:02,160
And then you also do accumulate points that can then be redeemed.

1139
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,560
Now, they just changed their point system.

1140
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,560
They had started like punch a phone number in a few years ago.

1141
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:09,280
Right.

1142
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:13,920
And I do go to Target fairly well.

1143
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,000
We still do the dry about pickup.

1144
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:16,720
Sure.

1145
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:17,600
You can do that.

1146
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:23,040
And that is one where I was like, oh, I try to have cash on me so I can give them a tip.

1147
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:29,360
Um, you know, because that is very nice, but I imagine kind of sucks.

1148
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,440
Although maybe it's nice to get out of the store and get some fresh air.

1149
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,320
Can't it be both?

1150
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,320
Can't it suck and be nice to get some fresh air?

1151
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,800
I'm assuming that's probably the most common.

1152
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:39,200
Yes.

1153
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:39,440
Yeah.

1154
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,600
Here's a little trick.

1155
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,400
If you're doing a Target order, okay?

1156
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:50,640
If there's a coupon, say there's 25% off a $50 order.

1157
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,120
Yeah.

1158
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:51,920
Something like that.

1159
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,200
And you don't want to spend $50.

1160
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,560
Maybe you only want to spend $30.

1161
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,280
Like whatever it's household products, it's beauty products.

1162
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:04,960
They do, um, like soap, beauty and soap stuff a lot.

1163
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,520
And then they do like, yeah, household stuff.

1164
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:12,400
But it's like often $10 off 40 or $10 off 50.

1165
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:16,480
If you still want to get a little bit of a discount, you can buy stuff.

1166
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,600
Say you sort of sending it to the home, send all your stuff to the home.

1167
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,480
You can buy $40 worth, get that $10 off.

1168
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:25,520
And then return stuff and you'll still get a chunk of that discount.

1169
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:29,840
Because what they do, they don't go item specific and then take the discount away.

1170
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,040
If you return things, they just split it up among your items.

1171
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,240
And it's a percentage of discount.

1172
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:36,400
Right.

1173
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,480
You're not going to get the full, say it's 25% off.

1174
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,280
You'll get basically 13% off.

1175
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:41,840
Okay.

1176
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,560
So if you buy, if you, as long as you spend and you hit that discount,

1177
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,160
you could return an item and then you will still get a chunk of it off.

1178
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:49,280
Sure.

1179
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:53,200
So it won't, it won't penalize you for returning other than just take a little bit

1180
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,840
of for the percentage of the discount, but you'll still save some money.

1181
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:02,160
Well, I will sometimes, sometimes we've had the experience where they,

1182
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,600
this isn't really a hack.

1183
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,320
It's just like, oh, I don't pay for that.

1184
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:14,160
Like you get grapes or blueberries and you open it up and there's a moldy one right in the center.

1185
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:19,200
So they do make it very easy to just go in the app and make a couple taps to get your money back.

1186
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:23,280
Oh, oh, if you get, this is like a Postmates or where?

1187
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,560
In the Target app.

1188
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:25,200
Oh, in Target.

1189
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:25,440
Yes.

1190
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,080
And the pavilions like grocery store app.

1191
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,120
Like that is, yes, you can do that with Walmart.

1192
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:35,440
You can do that on other apps is that sometimes if you go, oh, I need to return something.

1193
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:40,320
It just goes, keep it, which is what Amazon used to do, but Amazon is a lot stricter.

1194
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:43,520
Now, if there's a, like a, like a low priced item that you're going to return,

1195
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,480
they want you to return it.

1196
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,120
They're ruthless.

1197
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:45,920
They do.

1198
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:52,880
And like I had, I think I got one of these hoodies and the big hole appeared was in the cuff.

1199
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,560
And I was like, can I get a replacement?

1200
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,400
There's a big hole in this.

1201
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,080
And they're like, yes, send it back.

1202
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:04,400
And I'm like, well, you're just going to throw it in the garbage.

1203
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:09,600
Like I watched that Brandy Hillfield documentary and now I'm scared of like,

1204
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:15,440
oh my God, all this clothing waste is washing up on beaches in like Africa.

1205
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,000
And I'm like so guilty.

1206
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,680
And so I'm like, you know what?

1207
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:22,320
I'll take the new one and I'll just keep the old one.

1208
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,400
Just charge of whatever.

1209
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,600
So you'll pay for two.

1210
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:32,720
Well, in this instance, I was like, well, I don't want to send this back for $13, you know?

1211
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:37,600
So I'm like, well, I'll wear the one, wear the one out and I'll wear the one around the house.

1212
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,440
You know, so you didn't get any sort of discount.

1213
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,280
You just got a new sweatshirt.

1214
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,440
And this is because you're worried about clothing waste?

1215
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:48,400
Yeah, I'm like, if I send this back, I'll throw it in the garbage.

1216
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:52,160
But it's like, well, if I keep it, I'm sure I'll get used to out of it.

1217
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:57,920
You know, or like if I had to paint or something or like scrubby stuff, you know?

1218
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:58,400
Scrub.

1219
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,120
Okay.

1220
01:12:59,120 --> 01:12:59,680
Interesting.

1221
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:01,600
Or like I'm going to physical therapy.

1222
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,840
Oh, it doesn't matter which hoodie I wear.

1223
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,840
I just need flexibility.

1224
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,680
Can we go back to that moldy blueberry?

1225
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:08,960
What about it?

1226
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,200
Would what's the moldiest piece of fruit you've ever eaten?

1227
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,880
I do not eat moldy fruit.

1228
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:15,120
Okay.

1229
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,640
I throw the line somewhere.

1230
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:20,960
But a few years ago, I tried to get money back because I did a Walmart pick up.

1231
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,480
God, a dozen eggs.

1232
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:25,520
I kept picking them up and they were all broken on the pot.

1233
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,760
All but like three or four were broken on the body.

1234
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:31,600
We just kept picking them up and just egg would fall out.

1235
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,120
And it's just a huge mess.

1236
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,200
I need to call to get the money back.

1237
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,280
And it's kept getting transferred to calls.

1238
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,160
It was so much.

1239
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,160
Jason, I want to just describe what he's doing.

1240
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,200
I've got my head in my hands.

1241
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:45,920
He has put both of his hands on his head looking like so frazzled,

1242
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,240
like his cards blew up in front of him or something.

1243
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:48,740
Yeah.

1244
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,480
How long ago was this?

1245
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,040
When you had all your broken eggs?

1246
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,120
It was like 2021 or something.

1247
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,080
So we were doing the podcast.

1248
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,280
Did you bring this up on the podcast?

1249
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,000
This feels like you would.

1250
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:56,800
I don't think so.

1251
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,120
You would be like, can we do a topic called eggs?

1252
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:03,600
It was like a wimpy thing where he keeps picking up eggs and they fall out.

1253
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,120
And they didn't break because you did something comical with them?

1254
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:07,760
No.

1255
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,680
And it was like the Eglin's best, which is like a nice brand of eggs.

1256
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:12,720
A classy brand of eggs.

1257
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:13,360
It was reinforced.

1258
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,320
It was on sale.

1259
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,040
It's like top hat egg.

1260
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,880
That's like an egg wearing a top hat.

1261
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,760
I really don't notice the difference, by the way, with brands of eggs.

1262
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:22,960
I notice it with water.

1263
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:23,680
I don't really notice.

1264
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:27,520
Do you think you would notice the brand of eggs if you ate more raw eggs?

1265
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,240
Well, that's the thing.

1266
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:32,080
In Japan, they eat raw eggs.

1267
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,920
They mix it with rice for breakfast.

1268
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:41,360
Like their eggs are better quality so they don't have a lot of food poisoning.

1269
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,640
Well, Rocky ate the eggs.

1270
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,320
The movie Rocky.

1271
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,160
Rocky did eat the eggs.

1272
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:46,880
Yes.

1273
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,080
But you know what I'm saying?

1274
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:51,280
The cooking then obscures maybe the taste or the quality.

1275
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:55,920
I wouldn't know what is better unless...

1276
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:01,680
If it was right from the farm and it was properly prepared, then maybe I would notice.

1277
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,200
What's the ripest?

1278
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:07,280
You've never had eggs at a farm before, right?

1279
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:07,680
No.

1280
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:13,760
I think I went to a nice brunch place and it's like, oh, this yolk is so colorful.

1281
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:17,360
It's just like a better color.

1282
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:26,480
That's probably the fastest the egg has come out of the chicken and then into your mouth.

1283
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,720
Because I wonder what would be the difference?

1284
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,560
Say they had a chicken...

1285
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:36,560
I think it's just a richer taste of the yolk.

1286
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,560
Is there a restaurant where the chicken is in the back room?

1287
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,600
That's how fresh the chicken is, that the egg is.

1288
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,080
Excuse me.

1289
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:44,800
I don't think so.

1290
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,040
I mean, maybe a coop in a backyard.

1291
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:51,360
Do you think it would be a fun idea to have a restaurant with a chicken

1292
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,880
pumping eggs out, a bunch of chickens in the back?

1293
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,040
I don't know if I've ever seen...

1294
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,400
Someone must have tried.

1295
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,600
To have it like, oh, this is...

1296
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:05,680
You know how they bring out seafood restaurants where you see,

1297
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:10,480
oh, I would like to choose this salmon or I'd like to choose this whatever fish.

1298
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:16,160
This one would you be like, oh, I'd like to pick this chicken to hatch to open my egg.

1299
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:16,880
Exactly.

1300
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:17,600
Yeah, I don't know.

1301
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:18,880
Probably not.

1302
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,000
It seems unreasonable.

1303
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,520
It seems like a hard thing to do.

1304
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,320
Let me ask you this.

1305
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,920
Do you like when you get the fish with the tail and the head on it?

1306
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:26,480
No.

1307
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,000
Okay, I don't either.

1308
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,480
If I'm eating meat, I don't want to be reminded that it's alive.

1309
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,120
I just find...

1310
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,560
People eat fish heads, but I don't...

1311
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,080
I just find I don't know where the bones are.

1312
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:37,680
It does seem scary.

1313
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:37,840
It's hard.

1314
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:38,640
It's too treacherous.

1315
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:38,960
Yeah.

1316
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,880
It seems like I'm going to bite right into the bone, but I don't know...

1317
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,040
I'm very stupid and uncultured.

1318
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:43,680
That's what I'm trying to say.

1319
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:44,560
Don't put yourself down.

1320
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,800
I think a lot of people don't know where the bones are in a fish

1321
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:51,040
and are maybe hesitant to bite into a tail and to a little fish skull.

1322
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,400
I mean, like sardines.

1323
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,480
I got a couple cans of sardines in there.

1324
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,920
That's a good lunch or snack, but those you can crunch.

1325
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,000
Those bones you just chew right through.

1326
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,120
Oops, I ate the bones.

1327
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:01,360
Yeah.

1328
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:01,840
Oops.

1329
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,280
Well, but that's not an oops.

1330
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:04,560
You're not supposed to de-bones.

1331
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,440
Oh, good.

1332
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:06,640
I ate the bones.

1333
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:06,880
Nice.

1334
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:07,600
Yeah.

1335
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,400
No, that's good.

1336
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,680
It's good that you ate those bones, but they're tiny little bones.

1337
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:16,400
My stomach just rumbled so hard after talking about the tiny bones.

1338
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:21,680
My brain, not even thinking, not even consciously, got so...

1339
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:22,880
It would start salivating.

1340
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,000
My brain started salivating at the idea of tiny bones.

1341
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:31,040
I know they say do other point, like try others, include other stuff too,

1342
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:34,160
but they just really become a foodie podcast.

1343
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:35,840
Let me ask the listener this right now.

1344
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,520
And I guess Scott is a listener right now.

1345
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,960
So let me ask the listener this.

1346
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,000
Is this what you wanted?

1347
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,280
Is this what you thought this would be?

1348
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,400
Let's get to some credit card stuff.

1349
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,600
Is this what have you wrought?

1350
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,200
The people want the credit card.

1351
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,480
What have you done?

1352
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,600
So the Target card, I think is a good deal.

1353
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:57,760
Well, if you go to Target a lot and you buy groceries there and you buy other stuff,

1354
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,360
it makes total sense to do it.

1355
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,920
It's 5% off every purchase.

1356
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,920
And if you're even casually checking the deals, it makes a lot of sense.

1357
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:11,440
And if you're a toy person, they recently have been having 25% off like one toy,

1358
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,280
and they'll have different deals like that.

1359
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:17,520
And you can get a pretty good deal on something.

1360
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:21,760
I bought the neck of Vincent Price figure that just came out yesterday

1361
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,600
on the Target app.

1362
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,960
Because I get all these, I have all these different alerts when a new toy is available.

1363
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,600
And they also, Born to Rock Alf is on the Target app,

1364
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,680
but then it sold out before I was able to buy it.

1365
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,920
And he's dressed like Bruce Springsteen.

1366
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:41,520
And it's the episode where Alf sings to the teenage girl on the show that he's in love with,

1367
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:45,280
which Jason's making a face and I agree with the face.

1368
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,080
But it was the 80s.

1369
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,600
They weren't really thinking.

1370
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,760
Well, I was saying this, Jane, the other day,

1371
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,480
because we were talking about like 2000s teen movies.

1372
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,960
And I was like, yeah, I was in high school.

1373
01:18:54,960 --> 01:19:00,800
So it made sense that the characters were like teenagers, like cute, cute girls.

1374
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:05,600
And it's like, obviously, the actors are all probably 20 or 25 or something.

1375
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:11,440
But it's like, oh, yeah, there really was a lot of sexualization of teenagers in the 2000s.

1376
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:12,240
Sure.

1377
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:12,960
That was weird.

1378
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:14,400
It's weird now.

1379
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,240
Yeah, I hear you.

1380
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,040
But it all started on Alf.

1381
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:19,840
It all started.

1382
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:23,760
How old is Alf, though, supposed to be on the show, Elf?

1383
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:24,720
That's a good question.

1384
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:27,040
How do they age on Melmac?

1385
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,320
I don't know the answer to it.

1386
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:28,820
OK.

1387
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,680
But I don't think I've clocked a lot.

1388
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:32,880
I knew Alf.

1389
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,000
I had a stuffed Alf.

1390
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,200
I loved Alf.

1391
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:35,700
I don't know.

1392
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:40,880
I just called him Alf, which is like Hoagie on Hogan's Heroes.

1393
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,400
Alf and then his friend, Alf.

1394
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:42,960
His friend.

1395
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:43,760
His cousin.

1396
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:44,960
His cousin, Alf.

1397
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,280
They didn't think to name him like Spike or something.

1398
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:50,880
There should have been like a knockoff foreign Alf called Elf.

1399
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:52,080
There could be.

1400
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,280
Hey, I like to eat dogs.

1401
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,920
I just learned about I was OK.

1402
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:04,000
I've been getting advertised bootleg Star Wars blu-rays of like they call it the

1403
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,040
specialization like the original.

1404
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:10,240
It's ripped off original 35 millimeters.

1405
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:16,800
And I was trying to find on the website and there's, you know, all the new Star Wars

1406
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:17,040
stuff.

1407
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:20,240
They put the Mandalorian in a bad patch on blu-ray.

1408
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:26,080
But there was also like Turkish Star Wars knockoff like called The Man Who Saved the World.

1409
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:26,580
Yeah.

1410
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:27,440
So these are.

1411
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,000
Yeah, these are.

1412
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:34,240
We talked about this last month, like the different foreign ET knockoffs.

1413
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,280
Yes.

1414
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:39,360
Like Koki, which I think I forget which I forget which country that one's from.

1415
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:44,000
But yeah, after something's popular, a bunch of different countries and American

1416
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,240
filmmakers also will just make ripoffs of it.

1417
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:52,720
Well, I think I really hadn't gotten a lot of bootleg stuff, but I for Jane's birthday

1418
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:57,520
one year, I got a Spice World on DVD, Spice World, very out of print.

1419
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,960
Oh, so you bought a bootleg.

1420
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,760
So I bought a bootleg off eBay unknowingly.

1421
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,760
Oh, and then I thought it was real.

1422
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:04,720
I thought it was real.

1423
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:09,040
I thought someone had just found a box of it or stuff because I bought like Unbreakable

1424
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:13,040
on blu-ray recently for like six bucks or something.

1425
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,160
But that was not a bootleg.

1426
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,000
That is still in the shrink wrap.

1427
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,560
So what is a bootleg copy of Spice World look like?

1428
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:19,360
Well, here's the thing.

1429
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:27,600
The insert of the front and back of the case just seemed a little janky.

1430
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:34,000
And then I put the DVD in and I think it just starts the movie and it's a decent quality.

1431
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,160
I watched through some of it, just make sure it was okay to give as a gift.

1432
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,160
Should we delete this?

1433
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:42,880
Because now you're implicated in a bootleg crime.

1434
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,000
I guess it's on Club 3.

1435
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:46,880
Let me ask you this and the audience this.

1436
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,240
Does anyone from the FBI listen to Club 3?

1437
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:52,400
Do we have any FBI agent listeners?

1438
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:56,560
Because I once asked if we had any pilot listeners because it didn't seem right to me.

1439
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:59,680
People who are pilots to me seem so professional and together.

1440
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:00,960
Why would they listen to our nonsense?

1441
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:04,080
I think we did have one person say they were a commercial pilot.

1442
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:04,720
Oh, okay.

1443
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,080
Maybe two.

1444
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,760
I forget it, but I think one person did say.

1445
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,600
So I'm asking now how many FBI agents are in the audience?

1446
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,000
Do you think we have one?

1447
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,960
Or do you have a desk job at the FBI?

1448
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,000
Yeah, that counts.

1449
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,880
Are you a receptionist or a paperwork or a paralegal or something?

1450
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:27,520
Or like whatever position Skinner had, Mitch Pileggi on the X-Files.

1451
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,400
Or a third-party vendor.

1452
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,520
I'm sure they outsourced some stuff for the FBI.

1453
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:35,440
What would they outsource at the FBI?

1454
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,920
Entry or temps.

1455
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,480
I don't think that'll count.

1456
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:41,520
You don't think that counts?

1457
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:41,920
Okay.

1458
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:45,120
But what if the person who brings in donuts and coffee,

1459
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,680
this has to be somebody who's a food vendor at the FBI.

1460
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,640
I don't think I would count that.

1461
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,000
You don't think you would count that?

1462
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,520
I would still be curious about that.

1463
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,600
I love learning how systems work.

1464
01:22:53,600 --> 01:23:00,080
I would be interested if you said, oh, I go into the FBI and I change the light bulbs.

1465
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:04,560
Or I go in there and I'm trying to think what you would need in an office.

1466
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:08,800
I go in there and I just make sure that the pens have enough ink in them.

1467
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,680
There are nice pens at the FBI and I fill them with ink.

1468
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,440
The ink filler at the FBI.

1469
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,520
I do want to hear about it from the listener,

1470
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,480
but I don't consider that person what I'm talking about.

1471
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,400
I don't consider them an FBI agent.

1472
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,040
Yeah.

1473
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:21,680
Okay.

1474
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:26,000
But is the FBI where you're not allowed to say you work for the FBI?

1475
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:28,960
No, I think you're allowed to say.

1476
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:29,280
Okay.

1477
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:36,080
Because I knew a guy at the church I went to growing up.

1478
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:39,760
Guy there worked in the counter-terrorism division.

1479
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:42,000
Got very busy after 9-Eleven.

1480
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:42,880
Okay, sure.

1481
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,600
My stomach just grumbled as soon as you said 9-Eleven,

1482
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,320
so I don't think it's related to anything food-wise.

1483
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,320
I don't think it was rumbling earlier because of the bones.

1484
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,440
I think it's just because I'm hungry.

1485
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,040
Very funny detail.

1486
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:00,400
We were recording at Casa de Claire in Sheridan.

1487
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,760
It's the first time we've ever recorded here besides Zoom calls.

1488
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:04,000
Yeah.

1489
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,240
And Jane just texted from the bedroom, are you done?

1490
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:13,600
I assure you we are not, but I told her we can take a break.

1491
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:17,600
Are you dumb because it sounds like what you're talking is just dumb casual conversation

1492
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,280
or just because she wants to come out here?

1493
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,440
I think the dog needs a lunch.

1494
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:21,760
Okay.

1495
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,360
Well, she can come out here if she wants.

1496
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,240
We could take a pause.

1497
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:26,160
Anything's possible.

1498
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:28,000
We could keep talking while she comes out here.

1499
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,800
There's a puppy now here.

1500
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,960
We're talking about credit card points.

1501
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,960
Oh, we're about to really get into it.

1502
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:40,000
Jane just exhaled very, very loudly.

1503
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,120
We're creating content right now.

1504
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,720
All right, let's take a real break.

1505
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:45,360
Okay, fine.

1506
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:45,920
All right, all right.

1507
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:52,080
Jane has left your back from the restroom,

1508
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:56,400
and now she's left the apartment so we can get naughty again.

1509
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:58,720
We can start talking.

1510
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:02,720
The Point brothers can start getting to be little naughty Point boys again

1511
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:07,600
without the public commenting, without people hearing us

1512
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:10,240
other than the wonderful Club 3 listeners.

1513
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:15,120
Credit card stuff, credit card points in general.

1514
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,200
Again, not financial advice also.

1515
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:18,640
This is why I was thinking about this.

1516
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:22,560
Is anyone going to go into major credit card debt after they hear?

1517
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,600
Yeah, don't do that.

1518
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:24,480
Don't do that.

1519
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,520
Maybe just don't do anything because I don't want to be responsible.

1520
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,480
This is not financial advice.

1521
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:34,880
This is just a lively discussion about what might be possible

1522
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,600
if you engage with certain credit cards.

1523
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:42,160
But there's a couple things you can do that I do.

1524
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:46,000
I'll speak personally as far as credit cards.

1525
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,400
You can get bonuses from signing up for certain credit cards,

1526
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:54,560
and then after that bonus, you can earn rewards.

1527
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,840
Every card is a little different.

1528
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:58,320
Every card is a little confusing.

1529
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:03,520
You go on websites and it'll break down all the differences in the cards.

1530
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,200
But still, it's sort of confusing.

1531
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,920
And you have to make sure you're not signing up for something

1532
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,760
that's going to make you pay a big amount of money every year

1533
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,040
because some of them have fees.

1534
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:18,560
But there are cards where you can get 60,000 bonus points

1535
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,440
just for signing up and then hitting a certain amount of money

1536
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,000
spent on the card within three months.

1537
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:25,520
Yes.

1538
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:28,880
And that's, I think, when people say credit card churning,

1539
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,720
that's especially what they mean.

1540
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:34,720
People will sign up for credit cards specifically to get that bonus

1541
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:39,360
because then you can redeem that bonus for travel or whatever,

1542
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,720
depending on what the card is.

1543
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:45,280
And that is the most exciting thing when it comes to credit card points for me

1544
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:49,040
is those big bonuses if you can find a card that has it.

1545
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:49,920
Have you ever done this?

1546
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,760
Have you ever done a big bonus situation?

1547
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:52,240
Me?

1548
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:52,560
Yes.

1549
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:53,520
A number of times.

1550
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:54,400
A number of times.

1551
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:54,640
OK.

1552
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:57,120
What's your, can you recall?

1553
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:05,440
I think as I started to become a big boy, I started to become an adult.

1554
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,120
When you started going to J.Crew.

1555
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:12,960
Yeah, when I started going to J.Crew, I opened cards with Bank of America

1556
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:16,640
because that's where my accounts were.

1557
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:17,040
Sure.

1558
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:21,120
And so, yeah, if you spent a certain amount of money,

1559
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,440
you would get like 150 bucks or something.

1560
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:24,560
Right.

1561
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,360
So you've gotten, you think that's probably the biggest reward is like 150.

1562
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:30,240
I think the biggest I've gotten have been like 300 maybe.

1563
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:30,880
OK, OK.

1564
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,200
It's a contest, I suppose.

1565
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:39,280
What I do is I mostly use two cards nowadays.

1566
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:39,920
Yeah.

1567
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:44,640
And one that I like is a Capital One Saver card.

1568
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:48,240
And it's 3% cash back on food.

1569
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:48,480
Yeah.

1570
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,960
Be it restaurant or grocery store.

1571
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,960
So that's only for food.

1572
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:53,280
Yes.

1573
01:27:53,280 --> 01:28:00,160
And I have a Bank of America card, which is very confusing because it was like,

1574
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:04,480
you're a loyal customer and you have such and such accounts with us.

1575
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:11,840
So we're going to give you 1.25% cash back and then we're going to double it.

1576
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:18,560
So basically, that card is 2.5% on everything.

1577
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:19,040
Yeah.

1578
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:23,920
But it's like, oh, you need to keep up this balance between all your accounts over X

1579
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:24,960
number of months.

1580
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:25,440
Right.

1581
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:31,760
And so that is a pain in the ass trying to make sure I have enough money in accounts

1582
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:32,320
or whatever.

1583
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:37,280
But it's just nice, like I just use that card for everything that's not food.

1584
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,200
And then I pay it off every month.

1585
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:40,480
Right.

1586
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:46,240
So and that's a big way to get points is like put all your purchase on cards,

1587
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:49,600
pay them off before interest happens.

1588
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:49,840
Yes.

1589
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,000
Well, that's the big thing is like.

1590
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,360
Or pay the statement balance and that'll take care of it.

1591
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:56,240
Right.

1592
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:59,840
Because you don't want to get the interest because that's where they get you.

1593
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:03,360
These are all like designed to screw you essentially.

1594
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:07,920
They're designed to like make you get excited about the bonus and then you get like in debt

1595
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:12,160
and then you start having to pay them like 20% or something like something crazy.

1596
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:16,000
Interests are terrible on most of these cards nowadays.

1597
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:22,720
I feel like my parents have had cards like since the 90s and they're like,

1598
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:24,720
oh, God, this is getting up to 11%.

1599
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:30,720
And I'm like, my credit card is like 18 or 25%.

1600
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:31,840
Like it sucks.

1601
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:32,000
Yeah.

1602
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,880
I mean, some of these bigger cards is like 21.9.

1603
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:38,960
I'm looking right now, 21.99% interest.

1604
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:44,800
And yeah, you want to you only want to do this stuff if like you can pay your cards

1605
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,640
down every month if you just have money.

1606
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:47,280
Yeah.

1607
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:50,480
But like so if you're going to get a bonus on one of these cards,

1608
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:54,880
what I like to do and I've seen people recommend this is if you have a big purchase coming up,

1609
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:59,360
if you go, oh, shit, I need to like my car needs new wheels.

1610
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:00,480
It needs a new engine.

1611
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:02,400
It needs a new windshield.

1612
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,080
Let's say something bad happened to the car.

1613
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,400
I'm going to have to spend like two grand or something.

1614
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:12,080
That's the time to sign up for your new card to get the bonus because it's just

1615
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,320
you're going to be spending a bunch of money anyway.

1616
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:18,480
As long as you have the money to pay it off, then you can use that to get your bonus.

1617
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:22,880
Like that's that's the way to go about that in my mind to be to be responsible

1618
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:26,640
because you don't want to get in a situation where you're just trying to like spend another

1619
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:28,640
couple grand to get your bonus.

1620
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:30,960
You need to have a plan to get that bonus.

1621
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:32,160
Yeah.

1622
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:36,800
And that's like when we moved last year, I really probably should have opened a new card.

1623
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,320
It's a perfect time to do it.

1624
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:44,480
Thing on that, because the one car that people like that is the Chase Sapphire Guard.

1625
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,640
Well, yes, that's a big one thing.

1626
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:49,600
All these days, you don't need it.

1627
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,560
You like it.

1628
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:53,040
I hate saying all these financial institutions.

1629
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:53,840
Well, that's true.

1630
01:30:53,840 --> 01:31:00,000
But you like that one has very good perks and bonuses, but you have to spend so much

1631
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,200
in three or four months.

1632
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:06,960
And I just never could finagle like Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card

1633
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:11,120
earn sixty thousand bonus points, which basically translates to six hundred dollars

1634
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:16,000
after you spend four grand on purchases in the first three months from account opening.

1635
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:20,240
So, yeah, you have to be like, oh, I'm going to be spending a good like if you move in

1636
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:23,440
maybe to a house and you're going to spend on a washer and dryer, you're going to buy

1637
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:27,040
a new fridge, you're going to use that credit card to pay for the moving itself.

1638
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:28,960
Then that starts to get up there.

1639
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,480
It starts to it starts to add up.

1640
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:34,560
But yes, it is four thousand bucks is a lot of money to have to spend.

1641
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:38,880
But you get six hundred free dollars if you can hit it, which is good.

1642
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,200
Yeah.

1643
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:39,920
And I don't remember.

1644
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:42,080
I don't even see this is I got this so long ago.

1645
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:46,880
I don't even remember what smart way I did this because I think I did it smartly.

1646
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:50,080
Well, because that's one of the ones with an annual fee.

1647
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:50,640
Well, yes.

1648
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:53,440
And this is look, this is a discussion we I guess we have we can have it now.

1649
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:58,160
So so basically there are multiple Chase cards, but they call it the Chase trifecta.

1650
01:31:58,160 --> 01:31:58,880
Yes.

1651
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:02,240
Which is the magic combination of three cards.

1652
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:07,840
The Chase Sapphire Reserve card, the Chase Freedom Unlimited card,

1653
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:13,840
and then the Chase and Freedom Flex card, I think is what they're calling it now.

1654
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,040
You should just be freedom.

1655
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:18,640
And that's one where you pick each financial quarter.

1656
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:19,520
There's bonus.

1657
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:21,440
There's different ones.

1658
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:21,760
Sorry.

1659
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:22,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1660
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,680
Different ones for like gas is five percent cash.

1661
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:25,920
Right.

1662
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:31,360
And there's this quarter there's you get five percent cash back on any PayPal

1663
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:38,240
transactions on certain charities, on pet shops and vet services and McDonald's.

1664
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:39,920
OK.

1665
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,200
So you have the freedom.

1666
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:43,040
Oh, I actually just have the regular freedom.

1667
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,120
I don't even know if they offer that anymore.

1668
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:48,400
So so but it's the same as I think the Freedom Flex, which changes.

1669
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:52,960
I kind of gave up on these Chase card because it was too much to track.

1670
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:55,200
This is what I will admit to the listener now.

1671
01:32:55,760 --> 01:33:02,000
I have slacked in my tracking and sometimes I forget to even activate the bonuses

1672
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:05,520
and then I go, oh, shit, and then I completely miss

1673
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:11,120
that I should have been using my Chase Freedom card to buy my McDonald's

1674
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:14,480
and not my Chase Sapphire to buy my McDonald's.

1675
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:15,200
Right.

1676
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:16,240
So and I try it.

1677
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:17,520
I should be better because you could.

1678
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:20,640
But if you're really into this and you have free time on your hands,

1679
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:24,080
you can really optimize all your points because five percent

1680
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,280
cash back is pretty good.

1681
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,760
Obviously, McDonald's, if you're eating, you know, in the old days,

1682
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:30,000
you were reading McDonald's every other day.

1683
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:35,280
So you really could have added a point with five percent back.

1684
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,440
So that's the fun.

1685
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:43,200
If you have a brain for points and math, I feel like you can you will enjoy this.

1686
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:44,000
And I did.

1687
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,680
I did stay on top of this for I feel like for a year or so where I was like, OK, good.

1688
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:51,120
Now I have to make sure that every time I buy groceries, I go to this one.

1689
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:55,600
And when I do trap, when you go out to eat, you do the Chase Sapphire Reserve.

1690
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,400
So and I was really on top of it.

1691
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:03,120
And now I have like I still know the general points like how much

1692
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:06,640
something gets me depending on where I'm shopping or what I'm doing.

1693
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:10,160
But yes, so these are these three cards.

1694
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:15,840
And basically then what happens is you get all these points

1695
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:19,040
and then you can you can take the points and transfer them.

1696
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,800
So you can take your points from the freedom.

1697
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:26,080
You can take your points from the unlimited and transfer them

1698
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:32,800
to the reward portal of the Chase Sapphire Reserve, which has the best rewards portal.

1699
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,240
Yeah. So essentially all the points go in one pot.

1700
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:38,560
So you put all your points in one pot.

1701
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:42,800
You can use that for your stores or travel.

1702
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:46,400
I both travel for the show once or twice

1703
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:48,960
on like these rewards portals.

1704
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:54,000
I do think they, like everything else, are progressively getting worse.

1705
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,040
I agree with you.

1706
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,520
Yeah. The offers are not as good.

1707
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:02,880
And it's like you are sometimes better off just going to the hotel company's website.

1708
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:05,200
Don't fall for third party booking.

1709
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,640
That's a trick nowadays.

1710
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,480
Third party booking is a trick.

1711
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:10,080
You're correct.

1712
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,720
And it's like hidden a lot.

1713
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:19,280
So like oftentimes going right to Hilton or whatever, you will have a better.

1714
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:21,760
Yes, I agree.

1715
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:27,200
Sometimes sometimes if you have an airline tracker that says, oh, prices to Japan

1716
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:31,760
for flights is or they're down, whatever, there's a good deal going on.

1717
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,200
Sometimes you can then go into your rewards portal for the Chase Sapphire

1718
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:36,960
and see if it's reflected there as well.

1719
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,600
And sometimes it isn't.

1720
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:38,320
Sometimes it's not.

1721
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:43,120
Sometimes you add up and you go, oh, I may as well just spend $500 on a flight

1722
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:46,960
versus the like $600 in rewards points it's going to cost.

1723
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:50,400
So you do have to be vigilant as far as figuring that stuff out.

1724
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:55,520
But in the rewards portal, I find sometimes there are good deals

1725
01:35:55,520 --> 01:36:00,640
where you can use your rewards points to get gift certificates for other businesses.

1726
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:04,160
So for instance, right now in Chase Ultimate's rewards,

1727
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:11,760
you can get Apple gift cards, 10% off, Under Armour gift cards, 10% off.

1728
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:18,400
Chili's, my beloved Chili's, which I know you said is so far away right now in Encino.

1729
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:19,760
You and Jay love Chili's.

1730
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:25,120
You turned down us going to Chili's recently on the Marissa and Justin Halloween episodes.

1731
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:26,480
Because I get tired.

1732
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:29,040
I understand you get tired, but it is 20 minutes.

1733
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:29,920
We could do it.

1734
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:34,080
We don't have to do it today, but we could go because I want you to be a cheese

1735
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:34,720
influencer.

1736
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:36,720
I do want to see you do a cheese pull.

1737
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:39,120
Yeah, I do want to see it and I would love to see it added.

1738
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:43,120
But I also said I don't really like the mozzarella sticks.

1739
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:44,880
Well, when was the last time you had their mozzarella sticks?

1740
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,080
Not in a while.

1741
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:48,560
And you called them mozzarella planks.

1742
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:51,440
Well, because the tech talkers were calling them planks.

1743
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:52,000
But Scott called them a different thing.

1744
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I didn't say they were the official company brand, you know.

1745
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:56,960
It sounded like they were.

1746
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:01,680
It's like when we call it the Avatar Ride or something instead of Avatar

1747
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:04,160
colon flight of passage, you know.

1748
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:07,200
But planks is such an unnatural way to describe mozzarella sticks.

1749
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:07,680
I agree.

1750
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:09,840
I was just watching a lot of these.

1751
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:10,560
Why do these take?

1752
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,320
Where did mozzarella planks come from?

1753
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,080
It does look like a plank of wood.

1754
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,000
But but I know.

1755
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,840
But don't you think somebody like somewhere called them that first and then it just caught

1756
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:20,320
on?

1757
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:22,160
You think some tech talker just called them?

1758
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:26,000
I think someone called it in passing and then it caught on.

1759
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,320
Do you think any restaurant has something on the menu called a mozzarella plank?

1760
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:32,720
I mean, I'll Google it.

1761
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:33,520
I don't know.

1762
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:34,020
Maybe.

1763
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:37,120
So OK, back to the rewards portal.

1764
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:38,080
Let's go back in the portal.

1765
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:44,080
Macy's, you can get 15% off gift certificates.

1766
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:46,960
This is where I do think the value comes into play here.

1767
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:50,800
I think this is a smart way to use your points, at least lately.

1768
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:55,280
And again, I'm not doing as much travel, so I'm thinking more along the lines of,

1769
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:59,280
oh, do I have things to buy gifts, et cetera, et cetera?

1770
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:03,200
And that type of thing is attractive to me.

1771
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:03,840
They have a thing.

1772
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:09,120
If you buy Samsung, you get 15 times the points on your purchase.

1773
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:10,160
OK, yeah.

1774
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:13,680
So if you're going to get a new phone or something or if there's a different Samsung

1775
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:18,240
product you want to purchase, 15 points times 15 times the points is a very good deal.

1776
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:24,320
This is like I've seen hacks like this with Disney gift cards where it's like

1777
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:28,160
Chase or something has like more points.

1778
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:32,800
And then there's bonus for Costco or something like that.

1779
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:39,200
So they go and buy gift cards at Costco or CVS and they know they're growing on a trip.

1780
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:41,680
So they put money on that card.

1781
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:45,680
Now, if you put a lot of money on Disney gift cards, you have to

1782
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:49,440
you don't lose that card.

1783
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:52,080
You know, it's not really tracked well.

1784
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:52,960
So here's OK.

1785
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:56,640
You've stumbled on something that I forgot to say during the target part.

1786
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:00,240
This is how I get a little money off my annual pass.

1787
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:05,440
OK, is what you do is target red card five percent off any purchase.

1788
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:05,760
Great.

1789
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,920
You buy Disney gift cards.

1790
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:09,200
OK, you put those.

1791
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:11,520
Now, Disney does it in the dumbest way possible.

1792
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:17,360
You have to go to a separate Disney website to input your Disney gift cards.

1793
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:21,040
You cannot just use your Disney gift cards on the Disneyland website.

1794
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:27,120
There is a separate Disneyland website to load all of your cards into an account.

1795
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:31,360
And then you have to link that website to your Disneyland account.

1796
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,240
Now, I do it because I want to save.

1797
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:35,200
I want to save money.

1798
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:36,320
I want to deal.

1799
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,480
But you can do that five percent.

1800
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:42,160
So then you whatever Disneyland pass cost of the time, 450 bucks or whatever.

1801
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,640
And then that's that adds up.

1802
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:46,480
That five percent adds up.

1803
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:49,040
So I buy the amount I need in gift cards.

1804
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:50,560
I get the five percent off.

1805
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,080
Obviously, I pay that off on my credit card.

1806
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:54,880
And then I use that gift card to buy the annual pass.

1807
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,160
And I don't do the payment plan.

1808
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:58,240
Generally, I just do that.

1809
01:39:58,240 --> 01:40:05,120
Now, one time a year, generally, target offers 10 percent off on gift cards.

1810
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,040
And that's around the holidays, around the holidays.

1811
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:12,080
And that's the time to strike.

1812
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:17,200
That's the time you really can get some money off of the extra five percent.

1813
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:18,160
So you do that.

1814
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:21,200
And then you get even more money off of your annual pass.

1815
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:23,360
And I mean, depending on how often you go to Disney,

1816
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:26,320
it would make sense to just get some cards as well.

1817
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:28,720
If you're going to because you can use it in the park.

1818
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,360
So just so I have this straight.

1819
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:31,600
Yeah.

1820
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:35,120
Disney gift cards, you buy them at Target.

1821
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:37,200
They put the value on the gift card.

1822
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:40,480
But if you want to link that gift card to your Disney account,

1823
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:43,920
you have to go to a Disney gift card website.

1824
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:44,160
Yes.

1825
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,720
To then log into your Disney account.

1826
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,200
Yes.

1827
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:50,000
And throw the balance, like link the two.

1828
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:51,280
Correct.

1829
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:53,040
This is so much work.

1830
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:57,040
This is like when we were trying to link five day tickets

1831
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:58,960
and we were all having a terrible time.

1832
01:40:58,960 --> 01:40:59,920
We needed this was hard.

1833
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:05,680
All linked to get a virtual queue and finally figured out the queue.

1834
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:08,480
If we scanned a QR code, it would register.

1835
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:09,520
You go to Disney.

1836
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:12,720
I swear you go to Disney gift card dot com.

1837
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,600
So, OK, this is where we said this.

1838
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,440
That sounds a little like a scam.

1839
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,080
We've said it.

1840
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,200
It does seem like a scam.

1841
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:22,320
We've said it on every episode, but there is no episode more

1842
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:26,640
where Scott is like having a stomachache right now or a headache

1843
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:30,080
and he doesn't know why, but that his podcast has been taken over

1844
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:34,640
by talk of a website called Disney gift card dot com.

1845
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:36,000
That's coming in spoken.

1846
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:36,960
Well, the people have spoken.

1847
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:38,240
Obviously, they're loving it.

1848
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:40,080
They're listening to this and hooting and hollering,

1849
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:44,000
but coming like late in the episode to introduce a new website

1850
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,440
that we've never talked about before.

1851
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:50,560
Disney gift card dot com, which is the instead of just using

1852
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:52,400
a gift card on any of the Disneyland websites,

1853
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:55,040
they have a specific dumb website that you have to go to

1854
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:59,760
and that adds that basically you have to use.

1855
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:04,160
It's another middleman between you and just using a gift card.

1856
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:10,400
But it is also the same login as your Disneyland and Disney store login.

1857
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:13,040
It's all the same login, but you still have to go to different stores.

1858
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:16,880
Anyway, we will promise this and I'll tease this,

1859
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:23,040
more app talk coming up, more Disney confusion and app talk coming up.

1860
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:27,360
If in case you thought we'd get less naughty after this episode,

1861
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:32,560
all contrary, we're going to get more naughty with the app talk going forward.

1862
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:39,840
Basically, you can get a decent little deal off of Disney stuff

1863
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:41,920
using that confusing method.

1864
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:44,480
Now, if that was confusing, let us know.

1865
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:48,640
I'll make a little video, a little explainer video on this process.

1866
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:51,600
If you want, if you don't want, tell me also if you don't want it.

1867
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,320
See if I don't want to hear any more about this.

1868
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,960
You know what I'll save for the other episode,

1869
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:02,320
my reason that I get every Disney email twice because I have two logins.

1870
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:03,600
Oh, well, I have a couple of logins.

1871
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:07,760
Yeah, and it's a fucking nightmare and that adds to the email clutter.

1872
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:11,920
Yeah, I will let it.

1873
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:17,760
Was that your I have some, you know, talking about other points.

1874
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,440
Oh, well, hold on. Let me or credit card.

1875
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,120
Let me finish. Let me finish out this.

1876
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:23,840
OK, so so you really have to.

1877
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:26,400
This is it feels like such a young man's game

1878
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:30,800
to stay on top of the credit card points and the chase trifecta.

1879
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:34,080
I'm more and I'm more and I wish you know what I wish I could do right now.

1880
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:36,320
So I should get rid of all the cards and start new.

1881
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:39,920
You know, I wish I could I wish I could start fresh.

1882
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,840
I wish I could just watch your credit score.

1883
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:44,000
Wish I could be born anew. Sure.

1884
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,640
Start again if I could start if I could start again, a million.

1885
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:51,600
What's the line from Hurt the Nine Inch Nails?

1886
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:57,920
If I could start again, a million miles away, I would start.

1887
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:59,040
Keep myself.

1888
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:02,160
I would close my accounts.

1889
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:05,360
Because I do want to start because because once you have these cards, then

1890
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:10,080
depending on your credit score and how much they won't, you can't get unlimited cards.

1891
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:15,520
No, it's best to not open and it's best to open right cards a year,

1892
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:23,440
especially to if someone inquires, you need a car loan or your credit inquiry to rent

1893
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:27,280
a house or apartment. You have to watch that stuff.

1894
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:30,000
You have to watch that stuff.

1895
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:35,200
I had a very weird one where like I had a Wells Fargo Amex a while ago

1896
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:41,920
and it converted to a Visa and I'm like, I got this for the Amex Bennett.

1897
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:49,200
Like I got this for whatever signing bonus and like early deals on concert tickets,

1898
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:50,960
you know, Broadway tickets.

1899
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:54,800
Yeah. Well, like I look that happened sometimes with the card converts without

1900
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:56,160
your consent, essentially.

1901
01:44:56,720 --> 01:45:00,960
Like I had a Virgin America card and then Virgin went away, the airline,

1902
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:03,040
and it converted to an Alaska card.

1903
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:04,960
So I have an Alaska card still open.

1904
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:05,680
Yes.

1905
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:07,360
But I don't look Alaska.

1906
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:08,000
Come on.

1907
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,320
I wanted Virgin because of the purple lighting in the cockpit,

1908
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:11,760
not the cockpit, in the whole cabin.

1909
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:13,360
But I'll say this.

1910
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:18,240
I haven't traveled much and that Chase Sapphire Reserve card,

1911
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:22,160
they've upped the annual fee to 550.

1912
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:23,440
Jesus Christ.

1913
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:26,800
And the thing that would still be okay, because it comes with a lot of things.

1914
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:29,600
You get in lounges at airports if they're not too crowded.

1915
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,480
Yeah, but they're cracking down on third party cards.

1916
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:34,000
Yeah, that's true too.

1917
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,520
So that's a knock against it.

1918
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:38,000
But you would get a $300 travel credit.

1919
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
So basically if you were going to be traveling a lot,

1920
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,960
$300 would come off of the bill anyway.

1921
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:47,600
And a little tip, if you book your travel,

1922
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,720
like say with a hotel within a couple of months and then cancel,

1923
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:52,320
they would already credit the card.

1924
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:53,760
So you could kind of get around it.

1925
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:57,760
But it used to be like 450, it used to be maybe even less.

1926
01:45:58,320 --> 01:45:59,920
I think I'm going to cancel this card.

1927
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:01,280
Okay.

1928
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:04,720
I think that I'm going to give up my Chase Sapphire Reserve.

1929
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:07,040
That is okay to do every now and then.

1930
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:10,960
Yes, you shouldn't do like constantly open and close cards.

1931
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:13,200
That'll knock your credit score.

1932
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:15,040
But I think I got to close it this year.

1933
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:18,480
I think this is the last year, at least for a little while,

1934
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:22,400
of me having Chase Sapphire Reserve card.

1935
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:25,280
And it's a little disappointing to me

1936
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:28,560
because that's like my cool card in my wallet.

1937
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:29,920
That's a thick card.

1938
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:30,800
Is it metal?

1939
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:31,520
It's not metal.

1940
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:32,880
I hate the metal cards.

1941
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:33,680
I got a fresh one.

1942
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:35,760
I lost my other one.

1943
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:37,680
Ironically, you have a fresh one.

1944
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:38,800
It's not the full metal.

1945
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:40,800
But look, listen to this.

1946
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:41,680
Folks, listen to this.

1947
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:42,800
Put this up right against.

1948
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:44,480
If you're listening to your phone, listen to your phone.

1949
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:48,000
I'm using it.

1950
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,560
To cut cocaine on Jason's kitchen table.

1951
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:53,520
And I'm going to hand it to Jason.

1952
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,280
To cut Old Bay seasoning.

1953
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:56,400
This feels like metal.

1954
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:57,840
Maybe it is metal.

1955
01:46:58,880 --> 01:46:59,440
Maybe you're right.

1956
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:00,000
It's thick.

1957
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:00,640
It's thick.

1958
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:01,760
It's satisfying.

1959
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:05,440
It makes you feel important when you put and you buy stuff with it.

1960
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:07,280
So it really kind of hurts me.

1961
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:09,280
But we just haven't been traveling a lot.

1962
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:13,120
So I don't think it's worth it.

1963
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:16,400
I feel like I'm going to have to downgrade my Chase trifecta.

1964
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:19,520
I'm no longer going to be participating in the trifecta.

1965
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:20,160
Sure.

1966
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:21,360
Here's the thing with these.

1967
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:24,800
Well, you can sign up for that Capital One card and use my link and I'll get a bonus.

1968
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,400
No, but you'd love that.

1969
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:27,360
I would love that.

1970
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,640
I'd love everyone to do it.

1971
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,440
Do you want to give out your code to the listeners?

1972
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:31,920
I don't know.

1973
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,240
That's pretty low.

1974
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,920
I do have a lot of copays, though.

1975
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:40,640
The listener should sign up for it.

1976
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:43,680
Everyone in the Club 3 should sign up using Jason's code.

1977
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:44,880
There's a limit.

1978
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:46,240
I was going to say, is there a limit?

1979
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:46,880
There's a limit.

1980
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:49,360
Yeah, that would be a great scam.

1981
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:52,560
The problem with these metal cards, you can't put them in a shredder.

1982
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:54,720
You have to send it back.

1983
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:55,760
They give you a little envelope.

1984
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:56,240
Do they?

1985
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:57,200
Yes.

1986
01:47:57,200 --> 01:47:58,000
I didn't know that.

1987
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,720
Well, because usually I just sometimes I get a bag of shredding.

1988
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:05,680
I go to UPS or Staples and they have the iron mountain or whatever.

1989
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:07,360
And they put it in locked.

1990
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:12,000
When you get a new card, if it expires, they send generally a little envelope

1991
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,840
and it goes somewhere magical.

1992
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:15,760
I have never gotten that.

1993
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:17,360
You've got a tiny little envelope.

1994
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:18,320
Oh my God.

1995
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,960
So that makes you feel special doing that.

1996
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:21,760
I love this card.

1997
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:23,200
They just sent me a new one.

1998
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:25,920
So it's fresh again, fresh and important.

1999
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:28,240
Let me ask you this.

2000
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:29,440
We talked about the Target card.

2001
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:30,720
Do you have the Prime card?

2002
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:32,000
No.

2003
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:32,320
OK.

2004
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:33,840
I have that.

2005
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:36,000
That gives you 5% off.

2006
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,960
And then if you wait a couple, like if you're like, oh,

2007
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:41,920
I said this to me in three days instead of two.

2008
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:42,320
Right.

2009
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:43,440
There's another 6%.

2010
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:44,720
Right.

2011
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:48,240
Another 6% or just adds it to it?

2012
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:49,360
It takes up one.

2013
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:51,360
I think it no, no, it adds it on top.

2014
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:52,240
That is pretty good.

2015
01:48:52,240 --> 01:48:52,560
Yeah.

2016
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:59,360
And I forget whether that's in your account or I think it's all Amazon points.

2017
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:03,040
It kind of sucks that like everything else, Amazon is getting worse and worse.

2018
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:04,800
It's more drop ship crap.

2019
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:09,120
I just use it because I don't get out a lot these days.

2020
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:15,920
So but Target is like, OK, well, this is like a little more reputable.

2021
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:20,720
Like it's a Hamilton Beach can opener or it's like a OXO brand.

2022
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:21,200
Like it's not.

2023
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:22,320
Hamilton Beach?

2024
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:30,080
Hamilton Beach is like a known kitchen supply brand as opposed to just.

2025
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:32,960
Hamilton Beach sounds like you grew up on Hamilton Beach.

2026
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:36,880
I between coffee makers and can openers are probably frankly.

2027
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:40,240
Yeah, is it all a big scam though?

2028
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:44,240
You know how like the like people who make like in microwaves,

2029
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:47,920
there's a big article or something, a story about how there's all these

2030
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:49,920
different brands of microwave, but they're actually all the same.

2031
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:51,760
They're all coming from the same place.

2032
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:55,680
Oh, it's like how like Costco brand liquor is like, yeah, it's probably brutal.

2033
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:56,320
Great.

2034
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:57,760
Like everything's a scam.

2035
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:01,840
Everything's a big scam and trying to confuse you and the different like one

2036
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:05,120
thing's a luxury brand, but it's only just because they ship it

2037
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:07,200
to a place that's more expensive.

2038
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:08,240
Oh, probably.

2039
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:12,480
I learned recently about some made in the USA stuff is bullshit.

2040
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:14,960
It's like finished in the USA.

2041
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:15,600
Oh, wow.

2042
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:16,000
Really?

2043
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:16,560
Yeah.

2044
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:21,520
So like looking like union made in the USA, it's much different.

2045
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:24,560
There's a lot more qualifications on that.

2046
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:29,280
But do you think you could bring awareness to this by doing a parody

2047
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:32,880
of Bruce Springsteen's born in the USA called finished in the USA?

2048
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:39,680
Finished in the US went down to a drop town.

2049
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:42,720
I think it sounds like yes is the answer to that.

2050
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:43,440
I mean, maybe.

2051
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:44,000
Oh, yeah.

2052
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:44,720
I've seen Hamilton.

2053
01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:46,240
I know Hamilton Beach Beach.

2054
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:49,440
I've swam on the I've swam in the water at Black and Decker.

2055
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:51,040
Like these are known brands.

2056
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:53,600
Again, this is peace of mind.

2057
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:55,760
Like you're saying this could be all bullshit.

2058
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:57,440
Yeah.

2059
01:50:57,440 --> 01:51:02,800
But if it has the potential to burst into flames, I don't really like buying it.

2060
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:06,000
That electric kettle is kind of a no name brand.

2061
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:10,000
And it's because I thought it was a pretty color and didn't take up a lot.

2062
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,480
Let me throw out this idea for Club 3 next month.

2063
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:17,360
We record again at Jason's apartment and I walk around and comment on things I see.

2064
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:23,680
I mean, I would rather you not because I've got shit everywhere.

2065
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:25,600
We only ever have fun packed.

2066
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:27,680
Well, just just like maybe in the kitchen.

2067
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:28,960
We can even limit it to the kitchen.

2068
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:30,000
Kitchen's in order.

2069
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,480
Office is cluttered, but in order.

2070
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:36,080
And then you have to admit, OK, so if someone wants if somebody wants this,

2071
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:36,800
they can nominate.

2072
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:42,480
Mike walks around Jason's kitchen and fridge and comments on things and talks.

2073
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:45,520
I need permission from my better half.

2074
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:45,920
All right.

2075
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,240
Fine.

2076
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:46,480
All right.

2077
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:47,440
Don't nominate this.

2078
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:48,480
We'll talk about it.

2079
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:49,440
Maybe for January.

2080
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:53,200
We moved all our Tokyo treat boxes.

2081
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:54,160
Do you know about Tokyo?

2082
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:54,560
Yes.

2083
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:54,880
Yes.

2084
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:59,280
There's a little box of you get a box every month of different snack foods from Japan.

2085
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:00,720
And it comes from Japan.

2086
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:01,280
You track it.

2087
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,320
It comes right from.

2088
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:02,560
Right.

2089
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:06,080
Because I want to just I want to I want to root around in here and see if there's I can

2090
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:07,360
find the Taffy.

2091
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:09,600
I want to see if there's Taffy box.

2092
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:10,960
I think we've tossed any.

2093
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:11,840
Oh, there is.

2094
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:13,680
That's the that's the famous Taffy box.

2095
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:17,360
That's there is usually a few Taffy, but there's no Taffy in it.

2096
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:22,560
I don't think so, because I would love to see you massage your Taffy live in person.

2097
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:24,160
Oh, between the hands.

2098
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:24,400
Right.

2099
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:25,440
To keep it fresh.

2100
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:28,000
Well, maybe maybe everyone will get.

2101
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,960
Oh, I bought brought you guys back Taffy before.

2102
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:31,840
Yeah, yeah.

2103
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:38,640
I who knows how if it even gets it's always so hard to eat so much of it.

2104
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:40,640
You're not always in the mood for Taffy.

2105
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:44,240
Taffy is a real ordeal to chew and it can finish.

2106
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:44,640
Yeah.

2107
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:45,360
You know.

2108
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:48,960
OK, well, maybe in January I'll go through your fridge.

2109
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:53,760
OK, I have some other to do.

2110
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:54,400
Oh, wait, hold on.

2111
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:54,960
Let me finish.

2112
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:55,840
Let me finish this real quick.

2113
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:56,480
Credit card.

2114
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:57,600
OK, I just want to say, yeah.

2115
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:01,120
So the Chase Sapphire is probably going to go away.

2116
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:04,880
But if you like travel, that's if you're like traveling a lot,

2117
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:06,800
I think it makes some sense to do it.

2118
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:13,600
But yeah, that's that's that's the big credit card stuff that I've been doing lately.

2119
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:20,320
But maybe I look at all of this as a way to overhaul my whole my whole deal.

2120
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:21,200
My whole situation.

2121
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:25,840
It's always good to reexamine habits and structures you establish.

2122
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:26,080
Right.

2123
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:28,960
But anyway, yeah, you go ahead.

2124
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:30,320
What you were about to say.

2125
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:35,200
So I have some even stupider points that like.

2126
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,320
OK, so airline miles.

2127
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:40,080
Are you an airline miles guy?

2128
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:41,300
Geez.

2129
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:42,800
What do you think?

2130
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:44,400
I know the answer to that.

2131
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:45,120
Of course.

2132
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:46,640
So they call me Mr. Miles.

2133
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:49,680
Well, you got a lot of names.

2134
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:52,000
You got more names than I do.

2135
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:53,220
Yeah.

2136
01:53:53,860 --> 01:53:59,620
So I LAX Philadelphia is a route I fly regularly for 18 years now

2137
01:54:00,260 --> 01:54:01,300
for a long time.

2138
01:54:02,020 --> 01:54:03,380
That was on USA.

2139
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:08,260
Like USA had a big hub in Philadelphia and I would fly USA exclusively.

2140
01:54:08,260 --> 01:54:10,020
And then the price started to get bad.

2141
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:15,860
I started flying southwest and wouldn't fly direct, but wouldn't.

2142
01:54:15,860 --> 01:54:19,780
They used to have a lot of flights where you would fly into Vegas,

2143
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:21,540
but you didn't have to get off the plane.

2144
01:54:21,620 --> 01:54:23,940
But you'd have to sit there for like 30 or 40.

2145
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:24,580
Sure.

2146
01:54:24,580 --> 01:54:26,020
And then it would go on.

2147
01:54:26,020 --> 01:54:26,180
Right.

2148
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:28,500
That was fine because you just kind of sleep through it.

2149
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:30,820
Or you read a book or something.

2150
01:54:31,540 --> 01:54:38,020
So US Airways gets bought by American Airlines a number of years ago.

2151
01:54:38,020 --> 01:54:42,580
And all my US Airways points converted to American points.

2152
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:45,060
Now, I don't fly that much.

2153
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:49,620
So I've only bought flights with credit card with airline miles like twice.

2154
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:54,340
So I think I'm coming up on a free ticket.

2155
01:54:54,340 --> 01:54:57,220
I think I have like 16,000 airline miles or something.

2156
01:54:57,220 --> 01:54:57,460
Sure.

2157
01:54:58,100 --> 01:55:05,220
Now, in the early days of 2020, I had not used these miles or had not taken a flight.

2158
01:55:06,020 --> 01:55:08,740
So they're like, your miles are going to expire.

2159
01:55:08,740 --> 01:55:11,780
So I called and I'm like, there's a pandemic going on.

2160
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:13,380
I don't need to fly anywhere right now.

2161
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:13,940
What do I do?

2162
01:55:13,940 --> 01:55:17,140
And they're like, oh, here's what you do.

2163
01:55:17,220 --> 01:55:28,020
You go to the AA Advantage shopping portal and you can like go like this is just a middleman.

2164
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:31,300
So like, here's the home page right now.

2165
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:36,100
It's got like Apple, CVS, Nike, and basically what's Kohl's.

2166
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:46,820
And basically what it is, is you select the store and it just takes you to that website.

2167
01:55:46,820 --> 01:55:49,380
But it places whatever marker.

2168
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:52,740
It knows you went there through the American Airlines portal.

2169
01:55:52,740 --> 01:55:56,580
So I remember specifically the person on the phone was like,

2170
01:55:56,580 --> 01:56:00,900
oh, you can go to like the Walgreens website and buy a toothbrush

2171
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:04,900
and you'll earn one airline mile and that will keep your account active.

2172
01:56:04,900 --> 01:56:05,860
That's what we've been telling everyone to do.

2173
01:56:05,860 --> 01:56:09,700
Oh, so you just have to get more points to keep your current points.

2174
01:56:09,700 --> 01:56:09,940
Yeah.

2175
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:16,740
So I think at the time I probably bought like a cheap maybe they always have Old Navy on here.

2176
01:56:17,140 --> 01:56:18,340
And Gap on here.

2177
01:56:18,340 --> 01:56:23,860
So like for a long time I have been slacking lately

2178
01:56:24,420 --> 01:56:28,820
because then all these companies have apps and they make it so easy

2179
01:56:28,820 --> 01:56:32,020
buying shit on your phone and paying with Apple Pay.

2180
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:38,180
So it used to be very good about like go to the American Airline,

2181
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:41,860
the AA Advantage shopping portal, eShopping, I think it's called now.

2182
01:56:42,980 --> 01:56:44,260
Then you go to Kohl's.

2183
01:56:45,220 --> 01:56:45,860
Hmm.

2184
01:56:45,860 --> 01:56:46,260
Okay.

2185
01:56:46,820 --> 01:56:48,180
Then you go to Kohl's.

2186
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:53,620
So but they have bonuses like on this with airline miles.

2187
01:56:53,620 --> 01:56:56,660
So you'll earn five times as many miles.

2188
01:56:56,660 --> 01:56:56,900
Right.

2189
01:56:56,900 --> 01:56:57,140
Yes.

2190
01:56:57,140 --> 01:56:59,940
Or eight times like Sephora right now.

2191
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:03,940
Now three miles per dollar.

2192
01:57:03,940 --> 01:57:04,740
Eddie Bauer.

2193
01:57:06,580 --> 01:57:09,140
Are we headed for a complaint here or are you just telling me this?

2194
01:57:09,140 --> 01:57:10,180
I'm just telling you this.

2195
01:57:10,180 --> 01:57:14,580
I'm just like if you're telling the listeners if you're an airline,

2196
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:16,820
if you have one airline you fly all the time,

2197
01:57:16,820 --> 01:57:20,420
see if they have a shopping thing and you can rack up some more miles.

2198
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:24,100
So you're not redeeming your airline points for toothbrushes.

2199
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:26,340
You're just merely gaining more points.

2200
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:26,740
Yeah more miles.

2201
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:28,900
How many of you accrued the miles right now?

2202
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:30,340
Like 16,000 miles.

2203
01:57:30,340 --> 01:57:34,420
16,000 you know how many since the start of the pandemic 2020?

2204
01:57:34,420 --> 01:57:38,020
I don't well I have flown a bunch since 2020.

2205
01:57:38,020 --> 01:57:38,500
Oh I see.

2206
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:40,100
Went to Orlando, went to New York.

2207
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:42,980
And you used all those points and that's your airline of choice generally.

2208
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:48,260
That is my airline of choice and I think I'm just racking up points while I do it.

2209
01:57:48,260 --> 01:57:54,900
Now the even stupider thing that I do because it's just like well I'm dicking around on

2210
01:57:54,900 --> 01:58:02,420
the internet I may as well get something out of it is the Bank of America advisory panel.

2211
01:58:02,420 --> 01:58:02,900
What?

2212
01:58:02,980 --> 01:58:05,860
So this is the thing I signed up for years ago

2213
01:58:07,460 --> 01:58:11,940
where you just do surveys on your phone or on your computer.

2214
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:14,260
It tells you where you can do the survey.

2215
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:18,900
And it's like are you do you use investment at Bank of America?

2216
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:20,420
Are you happy with your savings?

2217
01:58:20,420 --> 01:58:23,060
And it's just all that like we're redesigning the website.

2218
01:58:23,060 --> 01:58:25,300
It's all Bank of America specific surveys?

2219
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:27,700
It's all Bank of America specific surveys.

2220
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:31,300
So then at the end of the survey you get a certain number of points.

2221
01:58:31,300 --> 01:58:35,780
And once you get to 20 points you could start cashing that in for e-gift cards.

2222
01:58:36,660 --> 01:58:41,540
So you get a $5 gift card to Dunkin or Starbucks.

2223
01:58:41,540 --> 01:58:43,780
Oh and this is called the advisory panel?

2224
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:45,620
Yeah the advisory panel.

2225
01:58:45,620 --> 01:58:51,860
And then sometimes if you're the member of the month you get like extra points.

2226
01:58:51,860 --> 01:58:55,060
Or like if it's a long survey you'll get 10 points.

2227
01:58:55,060 --> 01:58:56,660
Have you been a member of the month?

2228
01:58:57,300 --> 01:59:00,020
I've never been a member of the month unfortunately.

2229
01:59:00,020 --> 01:59:01,860
How many members of the month are there?

2230
01:59:01,860 --> 01:59:02,500
I don't know.

2231
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:03,780
I don't know how many people are in there.

2232
01:59:03,780 --> 01:59:05,940
How do you even know about a member of the month?

2233
01:59:05,940 --> 01:59:09,940
Well you only know if you go to the landing page for it.

2234
01:59:10,660 --> 01:59:12,580
Well does it list who the member of the month was?

2235
01:59:12,580 --> 01:59:14,900
Yes it features like the member of the month.

2236
01:59:14,900 --> 01:59:15,860
Does it?

2237
01:59:15,860 --> 01:59:16,420
Am I serious?

2238
01:59:16,420 --> 01:59:17,780
Is it a picture of the person?

2239
01:59:17,780 --> 01:59:19,060
I don't know there's not a picture.

2240
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:20,020
Like the rebel spy?

2241
01:59:22,660 --> 01:59:24,820
The Bank of America rebel spy?

2242
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:32,980
I just this was a helpful thing when I was like broke in 2017 and I'm like oh cool there's a

2243
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:34,900
survey I can get a cup of coffee.

2244
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:37,620
How many surveys are you taking a month?

2245
01:59:38,340 --> 01:59:40,660
I'm not again I'm slacking on all this.

2246
01:59:40,660 --> 01:59:42,660
At the height of your survey taking though how many were you doing?

2247
01:59:42,660 --> 01:59:44,020
Probably like five.

2248
01:59:44,020 --> 01:59:44,820
Five a month?

2249
01:59:44,820 --> 01:59:45,620
Probably five a month.

2250
01:59:45,620 --> 01:59:47,140
Okay that's not so wild.

2251
01:59:47,140 --> 01:59:51,780
So and then there are hoops to jump through like they give you the points you have to go to the

2252
01:59:51,860 --> 01:59:56,900
points store then you get the e-gift card then you have to keep track of that e-gift card.

2253
01:59:57,860 --> 02:00:01,300
And so you're still getting emails because you're on the panel?

2254
02:00:01,300 --> 02:00:02,020
Yeah.

2255
02:00:02,020 --> 02:00:04,820
The advice can I become a panel member?

2256
02:00:04,820 --> 02:00:05,860
Do you have an account?

2257
02:00:05,860 --> 02:00:06,740
The Bank of America?

2258
02:00:06,740 --> 02:00:07,240
Yeah.

2259
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:09,060
You probably can.

2260
02:00:09,060 --> 02:00:16,500
Or did they select you like were you selected like the owl selects kids in Harry Potter?

2261
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:23,700
Here's an April quick survey up to two points and one entry in the quarterly prize drawing

2262
02:00:23,700 --> 02:00:31,380
which is probably how they got me because I love prize drawings and raffles and I've won them before.

2263
02:00:32,020 --> 02:00:33,460
So what's the survey?

2264
02:00:33,460 --> 02:00:33,940
What is this?

2265
02:00:33,940 --> 02:00:36,340
What are their quizzing just on like Bank of America website?

2266
02:00:37,460 --> 02:00:39,460
Up to what is this about?

2267
02:00:40,580 --> 02:00:46,340
Take our April quick survey so and then they say like here's the closing data

2268
02:00:46,340 --> 02:00:52,260
the survey here are the devices you can potentially use it takes five minutes

2269
02:00:52,260 --> 02:00:58,500
but sometimes it'll say it takes 10 minutes and I also or like 20 minutes I can do them much faster.

2270
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:03,860
Oh wow this is the cockiest of social media usage survey up to five points

2271
02:01:03,860 --> 02:01:07,540
and one entry in the quarterly prize drawing time 10 minutes.

2272
02:01:07,540 --> 02:01:12,820
Bank of I searched Bank of America member of the month and it says AI says it doesn't have

2273
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:17,700
a member of the month program there's preferred rewards is this just something special is this

2274
02:01:17,700 --> 02:01:19,140
a special little thing?

2275
02:01:19,140 --> 02:01:25,060
It's the advice it's specifically for the advisory panel this is the stupidest thing

2276
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:28,900
I waste my time on but at least I get a little treat at the end.

2277
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:33,860
Advisory panel I just like how confident you were about taking a survey that you were really fast

2278
02:01:33,860 --> 02:01:35,540
at it okay I do see.

2279
02:01:35,540 --> 02:01:37,940
I am very fast at sometimes I just lie.

2280
02:01:38,900 --> 02:01:43,540
Whoa again you've admitted some things today that really could get you in trouble.

2281
02:01:43,540 --> 02:01:46,580
That I'm very particular about my lettuce and I'm bootlicking.

2282
02:01:46,580 --> 02:01:51,460
No no bootlicking spice world mostly okay I'm joining the advisory panel right now

2283
02:01:52,420 --> 02:01:56,100
uh how do you want to see I mean I'll do this I guess off off computer because.

2284
02:01:56,100 --> 02:01:57,300
Yeah don't take a little while.

2285
02:01:57,300 --> 02:02:02,100
I just want you to be member of the month more than anything I want you to get a sash.

2286
02:02:02,180 --> 02:02:09,140
I am trying unless I missed an email at some point and I honestly think they potentially

2287
02:02:09,140 --> 02:02:15,300
maybe just give you a few points and then they go like round of applause for Erica you know

2288
02:02:15,300 --> 02:02:19,540
there's like nothing to it and they never call you or anything it's all online.

2289
02:02:19,540 --> 02:02:21,700
I I've never gotten any phone calls.

2290
02:02:22,980 --> 02:02:27,940
Okay and is this like like I mean look we're this episode probably should have been over

2291
02:02:27,940 --> 02:02:33,540
30 minutes ago but um is this still the thing you're doing more than like the my Vegas rewards

2292
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:37,140
app like I want to talk about Cole's cash today I want to talk about my Vegas rewards we don't

2293
02:02:37,140 --> 02:02:40,900
have time for that unfortunately but is this the thing that you're spending the most like

2294
02:02:40,900 --> 02:02:45,700
what are you spending the most time on to get a couple dollars out of it.

2295
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:50,740
I think it's I have not Jane's much better at playing my Vegas.

2296
02:02:50,740 --> 02:02:54,900
Right but is there what is the biggest time waster that gains you any sort of rewards

2297
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:56,420
right now are you doing anything.

2298
02:02:57,300 --> 02:03:01,220
I don't think I'm doing much of anything occasionally I check in on this.

2299
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:05,460
Okay so what sounds like you've slacked as far as it sounds like the listeners have voted on

2300
02:03:05,460 --> 02:03:10,260
doing this episode when we're at our lowest as far as getting uh rewards and on top being

2301
02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:11,460
on top of things.

2302
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:14,900
Hey if you're in the gutter at least you're looking at the stars you know.

2303
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:25,380
I know I mean what you said couldn't be more applicable to what I said

2304
02:03:25,380 --> 02:03:30,420
that's for sure there's no doubt about it that that corresponded thoughtwise.

2305
02:03:30,420 --> 02:03:32,820
You're lying in the gutter at least you're looking at the stars.

2306
02:03:34,660 --> 02:03:40,740
But points are fun that's what I think I get I think that it's a fun little thing now you

2307
02:03:40,740 --> 02:03:45,940
would have had a lot more time in my life if I completely cut all of this out and I decided to

2308
02:03:45,940 --> 02:03:54,820
like commit myself to writing a novel commit myself to learning a new skill yeah probably by

2309
02:03:54,820 --> 02:04:00,660
now at this age I would have had some other accomplishment sure but everyone's trying to

2310
02:04:00,660 --> 02:04:04,820
screw you left and right you got to save money where you can everyone's trying to screw you

2311
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:08,260
left and right it's only going to get worse and you got to save money where you can you

2312
02:04:08,260 --> 02:04:13,220
got to be smart about it and you got to stay on top of what the different words my stomach

2313
02:04:13,220 --> 02:04:20,340
is growling so aggressively again has nothing to do with food on like a flay of fish or something

2314
02:04:20,340 --> 02:04:25,700
that flay of fish seems like it's more than 3000 oh the flay of fish are so much that

2315
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:30,740
inflation hit filet of fish harder than almost any other mcdonald's item I feel like and you know

2316
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:39,700
around um easter season fridays you know some people they got the filet of fish right they

2317
02:04:39,700 --> 02:04:45,460
mark it down that deal gets worse and worse every year what did it change it used to be like a dollar

2318
02:04:45,460 --> 02:04:51,860
50 of filet values get two filet of fish eat like a king I feel like it's worse now would you get

2319
02:04:51,860 --> 02:04:58,340
fries in addition to the two filet of fish no I it's too much I feel too bad you would feel bad

2320
02:04:58,340 --> 02:05:03,300
if you had fries and two filet of fish two filet of fish in a glass of water or a diet cookers

2321
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:09,620
that's enough glass ice water maybe a glass ice well you can have a double you can get a double

2322
02:05:09,620 --> 02:05:15,700
flay of fish as well yeah I wish I don't really I rarely do that but I like a flay of fish

2323
02:05:15,700 --> 02:05:19,300
that I've said I do one time they they screwed me on a breakfast sandwich and they just put a

2324
02:05:19,300 --> 02:05:28,180
patty from the flay of fish on my like bun or my my like whatever my uh uh your eggs my saw my

2325
02:05:28,180 --> 02:05:34,420
like bacon egg and cheese my biscuit okay my biscuit had a flay of fish patty on it once

2326
02:05:34,420 --> 02:05:39,860
filet of fish and the yellow folded egg that's I think there were both yeah or instead of the egg

2327
02:05:39,860 --> 02:05:43,460
they liked we're trying to pull a fast one on me once at mcdonald's that's crazy they put a

2328
02:05:43,460 --> 02:05:50,260
flay of fish patty on my biscuit I would like it if they sold that as an option I ate it a biscuit

2329
02:05:50,260 --> 02:05:54,580
yeah sure no problem I don't care with a flay of fish on it you know my problem with the big

2330
02:05:54,580 --> 02:06:00,260
the chicken big mac though is I haven't tried it yet just a lot of breading a lot of bread and

2331
02:06:00,340 --> 02:06:06,660
breading yes a lot of breading I mean look I've tried this with Wendy's like pub specialty

2332
02:06:06,660 --> 02:06:13,220
sandwich burger delicious sub a you know doing a spicy chicken on that pub sandwich with

2333
02:06:13,220 --> 02:06:20,500
mushrooms and bacon and a pretzel bun were way too much I like those I don't know I feel like

2334
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:27,220
we have different opinions on fast food in some ways yeah but that's okay sure that's what the

2335
02:06:27,220 --> 02:06:35,620
country is about it's not the time for that sort of talk no I know uh anyway uh I hope this episode

2336
02:06:35,620 --> 02:06:40,980
lived up to the expectations I don't think it did quite frankly I think we fell short here

2337
02:06:41,620 --> 02:06:45,460
I think that we didn't hit coal's cash I think there were different big targets

2338
02:06:45,460 --> 02:06:50,260
you want to hit coal's cash no we're still running out of time coal's cash that much not really okay

2339
02:06:50,260 --> 02:06:55,060
but I think it's funny to talk about coal's cash sure well that's a future episode our parents are

2340
02:06:55,460 --> 02:06:58,660
retirement yeah that's why I told my mom that's why inheritance

2341
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:06,900
is whatever coal's cash is in the family look I love a covington brand pajamas or lounge pants

2342
02:07:06,900 --> 02:07:13,700
covington brand you grew up in the town called covington right which is I think that's one of

2343
02:07:13,700 --> 02:07:19,220
the coals or crofton barrow you must have some crofton barrow my mom loves crofton barrow but

2344
02:07:19,220 --> 02:07:24,100
you lived coming you lived on covington which is next to hamilton beach right which is where

2345
02:07:24,100 --> 02:07:29,860
you used to go during the summer these are rare I know these brands better than the names of

2346
02:07:29,860 --> 02:07:35,700
extended family members crofton barrow yes crofton barrow I've heard that before but yeah coal's my

2347
02:07:35,700 --> 02:07:41,860
mom it loves a coal's like she loves the way that coal's confuses people and gives them coupons and

2348
02:07:41,860 --> 02:07:47,780
deals like that's a fun game the game of it's gamification in a lot of ways look I was a big

2349
02:07:47,780 --> 02:07:56,580
fan of uh jcp the jc pennies rebranded 2011 or 2010 where they just lowered the price on everything

2350
02:07:56,580 --> 02:08:00,740
but then everyone got mad because they're like there's no coupons I'm not getting a deal

2351
02:08:00,740 --> 02:08:05,460
the the rebrand of jc penny was just calling it jcp jcp yeah you got a bunch of t-shirts and

2352
02:08:05,460 --> 02:08:10,420
shorts let's say jcp on it yeah the tags have jcp oh but now you didn't get like a big on the

2353
02:08:10,420 --> 02:08:17,540
front of like a logo on the shirt no I got some track pants that have jcp on the butt

2354
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:24,180
yeah I do have bookmarked there are some like uh t-shirt companies and stuff

2355
02:08:25,060 --> 02:08:30,740
that are uh they sell t-shirts with like old department stores that are long like janes way

2356
02:08:30,740 --> 02:08:36,740
caldor okay is mervin still around I think it is but I don't know I think it is but like clover

2357
02:08:36,740 --> 02:08:42,020
did you have clover no that was probably an east coast one boscov's is the one that's hanging on

2358
02:08:42,500 --> 02:08:48,980
boscov's boscov's oh big boscov's is great they used to have mirrors the entryway on the ceiling

2359
02:08:48,980 --> 02:08:54,980
there was neon signs for all the departments there's a candy counter and an optical and a

2360
02:08:54,980 --> 02:09:00,180
travel agent and a ticket master a travel agent yeah you could book a vacation at boscov's and

2361
02:09:00,180 --> 02:09:06,580
buy some sensible so like it's a target where you could go book a book a vacation it was like an all

2362
02:09:06,580 --> 02:09:13,380
all of us are seeing a department store wow boscov's and it's gone no it's still going oh

2363
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:17,540
it is still going and you still hanging on still travel agents in there I don't know I don't know

2364
02:09:17,540 --> 02:09:24,020
boscov's you know I I did finally get to zombie sears and burbank oh yeah and it is sad it's only

2365
02:09:24,020 --> 02:09:32,180
one floor it's half full but I bought a cross body bag what for how much was it a good deal

2366
02:09:32,260 --> 02:09:37,220
well here's think it was 50% off from 40 but then there was another deal so it was only $15

2367
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:42,260
gosh well yeah we we should have done more sears talk on this episode but I don't know I mean to

2368
02:09:42,260 --> 02:09:47,140
sum up to sum up I think I would love to hear it from the listeners in the comment I guess

2369
02:09:47,140 --> 02:09:51,780
it shouldn't be in this comments because that's for club three but and on social media I suppose

2370
02:09:51,780 --> 02:09:57,460
let us know what your deals are what what your this is points oh I mean like in the patreon yeah

2371
02:09:57,540 --> 02:10:01,460
I guess that might be hard to track instagram or whatever wherever we post

2372
02:10:02,580 --> 02:10:07,060
because I think everybody has their own little deals they like I think this is I think this is

2373
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:12,660
a common thing for people I just don't know if they go as hard into all the apps yeah because

2374
02:10:12,660 --> 02:10:18,660
I have I look through I have every fast food app I have points in every account yeah and I don't

2375
02:10:18,660 --> 02:10:24,980
know if I don't know if that's common or not can you hear my stomach my stomach is so loud to me

2376
02:10:24,980 --> 02:10:29,860
I can hear it I wonder if the mic picked it up okay I wish I thought it was distracting

2377
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:38,340
oh no I didn't know did you skip breakfast I had a donut for breakfast okay so anyway apologize

2378
02:10:38,340 --> 02:10:44,980
if you can hear my cake raised okay well that's why the cake sticks in your gut a little more

2379
02:10:46,100 --> 02:10:52,180
was it because the raised donut is so light and airy yeah so I basically ate like a cloud you ate

2380
02:10:52,180 --> 02:10:57,780
a cloud of sugar yeah out of sugar I was eating a slice apple and peanut butter when you came in

2381
02:10:57,780 --> 02:11:03,380
and I was when I came in that you said you were covered in peanut butter you used my lips on my

2382
02:11:03,380 --> 02:11:07,060
fingers I didn't want to get it all covered in peanut butter like a baby that got into the

2383
02:11:07,060 --> 02:11:12,740
peanut butter jar I was kind of getting ahead of you you thought I was gonna say you were gonna

2384
02:11:12,740 --> 02:11:17,780
say are you you're just covered in peanut butter I was gonna be like look at this like I was gonna

2385
02:11:17,780 --> 02:11:21,620
come up with some like you look at this peanut butter jerk off or something and that would have

2386
02:11:21,620 --> 02:11:26,340
followed you around and you don't want to hear that are you like least the new lisa lampanelli

2387
02:11:26,340 --> 02:11:32,740
you're the king of me yes I am the new lisa lampanelli I'm the king of people uh the peanut

2388
02:11:32,740 --> 02:11:38,340
butter dickhead the peanut butter dickhead worthless users yeah there's one there's a

2389
02:11:38,340 --> 02:11:42,340
couple different nicknames that came up for you on this one but peanut butter jerk off I think

2390
02:11:45,460 --> 02:11:48,500
well your point brother and whatever there's another one in there and I can't remember what

2391
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:55,860
it was but uh anyway I mean you've survived podcast the ride club three again is this what

2392
02:11:55,860 --> 02:12:00,740
you wanted is this when you thought about it I think it is what they want it I don't know

2393
02:12:00,740 --> 02:12:05,620
maybe it is I think we were being light you know I do think we were being light I don't think we

2394
02:12:05,620 --> 02:12:10,740
were getting into anything we were being we were we're getting into our our dysfunctions our

2395
02:12:10,740 --> 02:12:14,420
personality you know what we don't do a lot is you know what we don't do a lot is is review the

2396
02:12:14,420 --> 02:12:19,460
our own performance but before the microphone is shut off sure you're right I think we were

2397
02:12:19,460 --> 02:12:23,620
being light and I think there was some information in here that's useful I think you're right I think

2398
02:12:23,620 --> 02:12:31,220
it is I think some of it's useful I think that the conversation was was was was was comical

2399
02:12:31,220 --> 02:12:36,900
I think the tangents were good just be careful just be careful don't get too deep in all this

2400
02:12:36,980 --> 02:12:45,140
don't get too deep in it don't eat too much fast food or like although honestly I love those stories

2401
02:12:45,140 --> 02:12:51,860
when like a chemistry teacher did you see this few years ago a chemistry teacher only ate hostess

2402
02:12:51,860 --> 02:12:56,740
snack cakes for a month and he like dropped a bunch of weight because he was just raw

2403
02:12:56,740 --> 02:13:01,940
calorie counting and it did work now that much sugar I was trying to wrap the show up but you've

2404
02:13:01,940 --> 02:13:06,340
pulled me into a conversation that I'd actually like to have I do think about that sometimes it's

2405
02:13:06,340 --> 02:13:11,620
like well meeting like McDonald's for dinner but I didn't eat lunch all day this is the argument

2406
02:13:11,620 --> 02:13:15,620
this is the argument is it is just a amount of calories but the quality of ingredients then

2407
02:13:15,620 --> 02:13:22,820
somebody will argue is a longer term issue because I know you can on the Taco Bell app count your

2408
02:13:22,820 --> 02:13:28,820
calories very effectively you can take ingredients off you could really calorie count your way into

2409
02:13:28,820 --> 02:13:34,420
losing weight just eating Taco Bell every day right you could do that but see that's this

2410
02:13:34,420 --> 02:13:40,580
different fast food I got to talk about I want the goo baby I want the nacho cheese but you can

2411
02:13:40,580 --> 02:13:48,500
selectively put the goo on well yeah I do I sub everything for beans and then if I want to pick

2412
02:13:48,500 --> 02:13:53,940
out I sub it for potatoes or fries hardshell taco is a little bit less caloric than a softshell taco

2413
02:13:53,940 --> 02:13:58,500
I didn't know that okay but then you take the beef you take the beef away and then you put on

2414
02:13:58,500 --> 02:14:03,220
either like a beans black beans or you can do chicken which is also less caloric than the beef

2415
02:14:03,220 --> 02:14:07,380
then you go okay I like a taco supreme better than I like the regular one because it's got

2416
02:14:07,380 --> 02:14:12,900
sour cream on it but then you go do I really taste the cheese maybe I take the cheese off

2417
02:14:12,900 --> 02:14:18,820
and you pull the cheese off that takes another 10-15 calories off and you just say sour cream so now

2418
02:14:18,820 --> 02:14:24,820
you got a hardshell taco with beans or chicken you put your tomatoes on there which obviously

2419
02:14:24,820 --> 02:14:29,780
have no calories maybe something else too and you still get your sour cream so now you've knocked

2420
02:14:29,780 --> 02:14:36,180
a lot of the calories off you've maybe 30 or 40 calories off of just one taco are you subbing

2421
02:14:36,180 --> 02:14:42,820
the sour cream for cheese or no I'm saying taco supreme comes with cheese and sour cream but you

2422
02:14:42,820 --> 02:14:47,860
if you think about it on my tasting the cheese on this maybe not pull the cheese off take it off

2423
02:14:47,860 --> 02:14:52,740
and then you still get your sour cream and you still get your goo because I hear you if you're

2424
02:14:52,740 --> 02:14:59,780
gonna go to these places you gotta get your goo I want my goo I want my baja blaze caffeine boost

2425
02:14:59,780 --> 02:15:04,260
you gotta get even though you know you're really not to put too caffeine after 4 p.m. it'll keep

2426
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:09,540
you up at night now this is a good if you and I were to write a book about losing weight on fast

2427
02:15:09,540 --> 02:15:16,180
food it would be a picture of you and it'll be called ggg gotta get your goo yeah and it would

2428
02:15:16,180 --> 02:15:22,020
be the the highlight of it would be making sure you still have the caloric big mac sauce if you're

2429
02:15:22,100 --> 02:15:25,860
getting it which I know you don't like Big Macs what I love Big Macs oh wait I'm thinking to

2430
02:15:25,860 --> 02:15:29,780
somebody else a quarter pounder I never get a quarter yeah that's right too big of me patty you

2431
02:15:29,780 --> 02:15:36,020
and I I read about the onion recall well yes I killed a couple people it's the first thing I did

2432
02:15:36,020 --> 02:15:41,780
I saw the news story then I sent you that's because of the hydrolyzed debate we had months

2433
02:15:41,780 --> 02:15:46,500
ago how you couldn't get sick from eating a mcdonald's which I guess that disproves it

2434
02:15:47,220 --> 02:15:54,180
but it was the onions specifically it's not the meat and it's not the goo yeah they had gotten

2435
02:15:54,180 --> 02:15:59,860
some onions from a distributor who I guess was doing a bad job keeping them clean so it was like

2436
02:15:59,860 --> 02:16:06,020
they were spreading foodborne illness but uh uh back to talking about delicious fast food is that

2437
02:16:06,020 --> 02:16:13,220
yes I think there is a way to take the calories off and get your goo because you go to those places

2438
02:16:13,220 --> 02:16:19,700
for your goo yeah and I don't know did we did the show just end I think so oh wait

2439
02:16:21,060 --> 02:16:26,340
one more thing okay yeah I as much as I enjoyed this I do think we should probably stick with

2440
02:16:26,340 --> 02:16:30,980
podcasts a ride I don't think we can become full-time points guys points brothers points

2441
02:16:30,980 --> 02:16:36,180
brothers well the yeah the points guys already got it locked down okay so I guess we will not

2442
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:41,540
be leaving podcasts the ride fortunately it would be really funny if we left it before Scott came

2443
02:16:41,540 --> 02:16:46,660
back too because like no one would be doing it oh it's like the sting you come back and the

2444
02:16:46,660 --> 02:16:51,140
casinos gone yeah or yeah we could leave right before Scott comes back and he comes back and

2445
02:16:51,140 --> 02:16:56,260
we're just gone from the record with a little note from the state yeah family's gone no trace

2446
02:16:56,260 --> 02:17:00,500
of us whatsoever and we're just like it says like or we just only a little note like that says like

2447
02:17:00,500 --> 02:17:05,460
ggg going to get our goo don't explain it yeah
