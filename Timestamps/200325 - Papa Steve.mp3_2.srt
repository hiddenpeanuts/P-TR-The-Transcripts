1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,680
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

3
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,360
I'm Jason Sheridan here today with Mike Carlson.

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,640
Yep, I'm here.

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,480
And Scott Gertner.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,680
This is very sober.

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,120
Yeah, fresh from the oven.

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,440
You do actually say something fun like fresh from the oven.

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,600
I'm Jason Sheridan.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,600
Well, I'm showing somber respect to a PTR legend today

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,240
because we're talking about the king.

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,560
I just mean, you didn't have to have any like prepared joke

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,640
where you could have said something dumb,

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,560
which is what we do oftentimes on The Second Gate.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,400
That's all.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,200
Well, I'm Jason Sheridan, the new king of sourdough.

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,400
And we're talking about the original king of sourdough today.

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,000
Papa Steve.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,360
That seems disrespectful.

20
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,200
It is disrespectful.

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,040
Make that claim based on nothing.

22
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah, I don't like this intro either.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,840
You wouldn't call the guy who took over

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,920
the king of sourdough?

25
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,360
Well, he has also passed on, unfortunately.

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,320
Oh, then the next guy in the succession?

27
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,800
Okay, so we're talking Papa Steve.

28
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,680
Okay, so yeah, Papa Steve.

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,000
Sorry, we're starting hot now.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,640
We're starting hot, we're starting hot.

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,880
Like a fresh piece of bread from the oven.

32
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,600
Anytime I do the intro,

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,200
I am just looking for what direction the dragging is going.

34
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,360
You got lulled too,

35
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,840
because before we started, I go, that's good.

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,680
You don't have to have a joke or anything.

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,560
Yes, you did.

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,960
You did so well.

39
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,200
It was my bad, it's my bad.

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,680
Yeah, Scott's fault actually.

41
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,680
Papa Steve.

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,520
Papa Steve.

43
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's explain Papa Steve.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,800
I think our deeper fans probably know already,

45
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,200
and we have declared him a PTR legend.

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,760
But let's recap from scratch,

47
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,040
as a sourdough bread is fresh made.

48
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
Right. Okay.

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,320
So we basically, I'll speak personally about where we,

50
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,160
Papa Steve.

51
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,720
Where your Papa Steve journey began.

52
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,280
Yeah, so basically there's a bakery tour

53
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,440
in Disney's California Adventure here in California,

54
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,400
and you get a little piece of bread when you start.

55
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,600
You walk through, you learn about the mother dough,

56
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,520
you see the little process, what happens, blah, blah, blah.

57
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,440
Then there's a big picture of a man named Papa Steve.

58
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,800
He's a kindly old man.

59
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,760
He's holding some bread in the picture.

60
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,760
He's in front of a lot of bread.

61
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,600
Yeah.

62
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,280
Also like stacks and stacks of bread, holding bread.

63
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,080
A comical amount of bread.

64
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,000
And when we were going there a lot early on

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,080
in my time living in California, we'd always be like,

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,680
it's Papa Steve, look at it.

67
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,080
And then we'd point and then there's various pictures

68
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,120
of Jason I have with Papa Steve.

69
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,440
Do you have the, are you, have he?

70
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,680
I at least have one or two.

71
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,320
I think I have a bunch of pictures somewhere

72
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,040
on a hard drive somewhere, but I at least have one photo

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,720
of you and Papa Steve on my phone.

74
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,760
Yeah, cause we're going back to like 2012.

75
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,040
Yeah, a while ago, yeah.

76
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,160
And we know that he's Papa Steve because of the quote

77
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,120
at the bottom of the frame, which when his quote is,

78
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,680
motto is good bread, good food, good people.

79
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,760
And then there's no further explanation of who Papa Steve

80
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,600
is, which I think contributes to some of the oddity.

81
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,440
Yes.

82
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,080
Sort of like we're supposed to know already.

83
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,920
Yes.

84
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,000
He's Dave Thomas or we're acquainted with him

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,800
due to commercials, but no, I don't know who Papa Steve is.

86
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,160
And in fact, the first he came up on the show,

87
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,000
I didn't know what you were talking about.

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,840
I had missed this.

89
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,680
Very fair.

90
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,120
I've certainly been in the bakery tour,

91
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,680
but I had never noticed Papa Steve before.

92
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah, and let's clarify.

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,600
This is not the bakery tour episode.

94
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
This is the Papa Steve episode.

95
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,280
I'm gonna ask about the rules here.

96
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,680
This is not the episode about the Boudin bakery tour.

97
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,520
No, well, I mean, if it comes up, it can come up.

98
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,560
It can come up casually, but yeah, it's just,

99
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,720
if I start talking about Rosie O'Donnell and Colin Mochrie,

100
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,560
I should probably wrap it up fairly quick.

101
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,120
That I think you should save.

102
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,960
Right, yeah, that's it for the official.

103
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,640
I'm not gonna like go do some material about it,

104
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,800
but if they were to even come up in passing,

105
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,120
are you guys gonna wince?

106
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,080
Well, they usually come up in passing every episode.

107
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,520
I'll allow a little, I'll allow a little.

108
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,280
Okay, but we just should not go overboard.

109
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,760
And then a further question beyond that.

110
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,600
Yeah, go ahead.

111
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
If this is not the Boudin bakery episode,

112
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,720
when that separately happens,

113
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,200
is that episode different than an episode

114
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,600
about the Pacific Wharf Cafe, which it services?

115
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,440
Different.

116
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,320
You're watching the bread be made for it.

117
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,520
I know the answer already before you even have to finish.

118
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,360
Obviously, those are all different episodes.

119
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,680
I assumed, I'm just getting the rules clear,

120
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,720
getting them on the page.

121
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,560
The Pacific Wharf.

122
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,840
Now they're certainly tied together

123
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,280
because you're watching bread be prepared

124
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,000
that is served in the Pacific Wharf Cafe.

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,840
Yes, this is more like though,

126
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,400
like the sunny eclipse episode of the Patreon,

127
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,240
where it's just, we wanna focus on-

128
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,400
Focus on a beloved character.

129
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,040
Yeah, beloved character.

130
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,760
Not a lot of topping bar acknowledge,

131
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,240
but not delved into.

132
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,000
Do we still then owe a separate cosmic rays,

133
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,040
starlight cafe episode that cannot be about sunny eclipse

134
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,760
for more than 5%?

135
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,960
Is, yeah, well, I would say more than 5%

136
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,600
can be a little sunny related,

137
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,480
but it's obviously gonna have to do a lot more

138
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,080
with those chicken sandwiches,

139
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,240
those delicious chicken sandwiches and the topping bars,

140
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,120
that dry iceberg lettuce,

141
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,720
that crisp dry iceberg lettuce you pull out

142
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,800
that has no nutritional value.

143
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,680
The wet caramelized onions.

144
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,520
Yeah.

145
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,200
We gotta talk about that.

146
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,440
Give me to that episode.

147
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,440
Yeah. Quick.

148
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,360
So.

149
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,000
The nothing tomatoes, the quality free tomatoes.

150
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,760
Yes, no nutritional value in anything on the topping bar.

151
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,120
It doesn't taste good at all.

152
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,640
So we, I submit to these rules,

153
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,720
I assume these were the rules, but I do,

154
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,120
I wonder if we can still do it and stay on track

155
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,960
without a sourdough keeper to keep us in line.

156
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,440
We'll try.

157
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,360
I feel like. If we need to summon somebody.

158
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,360
If we have to summon somebody, yeah, we'll find,

159
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,040
but I think if you have an idea,

160
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,280
if you have a thought about Pacific Wharf Cafe,

161
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,240
please say it now.

162
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,080
We'll just obviously have to get into it a lot more

163
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,960
on the other episode.

164
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,960
Is the thought allowed to be,

165
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,080
do we have to do an episode about it?

166
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
That is a thought.

167
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,000
Well, the thought is,

168
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,200
how long do we need to do this podcast in life?

169
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,960
So, I mean.

170
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,440
It's a marathon, not a sprint.

171
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,840
If we're talking a couple of decades of this podcast,

172
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,680
which I'm not trying to do a Doughboy's thing of like,

173
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,520
we need to end the podcast.

174
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,360
I don't think that at all.

175
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,200
I'm just saying.

176
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,880
I think opening day eatery with a secret menu item.

177
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,720
I mean.

178
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,360
I could see a scenario.

179
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,600
I could see a scenario where we do a mega episode

180
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,440
about like lucky fortune cookie, Pacific Wharf Cafe.

181
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,280
And then I forget the name.

182
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
Fortune cookery.

183
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,560
Cookery, sorry.

184
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,800
This is interesting.

185
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,640
I could see a mega episode of that.

186
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,520
Because I believe it's a Pacific,

187
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't remember now that I think Pacific Wharf

188
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,400
is also the naming structure of the beer truck

189
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
where you get.

190
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,080
Like Carl Strauss.

191
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,920
Carl Strauss.

192
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,880
Yeah, exactly.

193
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,920
And then there's the margarita.

194
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,880
I could see a mega.

195
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,720
It's obviously.

196
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,080
A Pacific Wharf episode could be a catch all.

197
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,280
Yes, I could see, but again, a mega episode.

198
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,120
Yeah, that's.

199
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,960
Two and a half hours.

200
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,200
Okay, we're committing to who.

201
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,440
But it's so much real estate there.

202
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,280
Yeah.

203
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,120
That it's got a lot.

204
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,440
Yeah, Carl Strauss, the margaritas.

205
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,920
I can't think of the Mexican restaurant.

206
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,600
A jam packed episode.

207
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,200
You're right.

208
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,040
I was gonna say jam packed episode.

209
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,880
You're salivating thinking about it.

210
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,080
Jam packed episode like our jam packed tummies will be.

211
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,920
Jam packed tummies.

212
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,960
It's Kuchina, I believe Kuchina, Kuka Manga

213
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,080
or Kusina Kuka.

214
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,920
I fucked it up before.

215
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,760
I don't wanna get it wrong.

216
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,880
Is there a day in there?

217
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,480
Do we have a day?

218
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,760
Maybe I could be wrong.

219
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,600
Like a D.

220
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Oh, the name of it.

221
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,440
Yeah, probably.

222
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,280
I mean, we should look it up.

223
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,440
Maybe not though.

224
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,400
Yeah.

225
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,240
Yes, possibly.

226
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,120
Frontierland one is Rancho Del Zocalo or something.

227
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,920
That, yes, that's a frontier one.

228
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,960
All I know is that when we did the early on,

229
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,120
we did the tortilla factory tour.

230
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,920
I was apparently saying a different language's

231
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,240
pronunciation of that word.

232
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,080
Oh.

233
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,160
One is Kusina and one is Kuchina.

234
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, I see.

235
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,960
And I kept saying the wrong.

236
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,800
Not as bad as.

237
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,120
I thought you meant tortilla.

238
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,040
Were you saying tortilla wrong the entire time?

239
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,360
Probably that too.

240
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,600
If we did an entire episode where all three of us

241
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,880
said tortilla.

242
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
Tortilla.

243
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,120
Like our grandparents.

244
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,960
Tortilla.

245
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,800
And we just didn't know.

246
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,640
Like Napoleon Dynamite.

247
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,480
Sure.

248
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,800
Mm-hmm.

249
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,520
So anyway, yeah, I recommend the tortilla factory.

250
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,280
Cause remember you get a free tortilla.

251
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,120
Tortilla, yeah.

252
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,320
You do and then you gotta do the scale.

253
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,040
Tortillas are good and quesadillas.

254
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,040
Quesadillas.

255
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,920
Well, we'll hopefully not get it wrong

256
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,440
when we do that up at the episode about Pacific Wharf.

257
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Pacific Wharf sounds nice.

258
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,680
Gotta devote some time to the photo opportunity

259
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,400
where it looks like you're in a book in a net of fish.

260
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,480
Oh, I love it.

261
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,320
I love that.

262
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,840
Yeah, so well, I guess that could be a main feed,

263
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,000
but that'll be a big Pacific Wharf episode.

264
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,720
But for now.

265
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,640
In 2031.

266
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,920
2031.

267
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,080
We have the podcast mapped out that far.

268
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,000
Yep.

269
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,840
So.

270
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,760
We're starting to bank, yeah.

271
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,360
We have it, it's pretty much,

272
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,920
what you're hearing was recorded several years ago

273
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,280
and we're, we've pretty much have it set through 2026.

274
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,120
That's right.

275
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,720
And just so we get a little topical,

276
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,360
we've done the Dana Carr VSNL sketch,

277
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,640
the Ted Koppel sketch where he's said different things

278
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,480
that could happen.

279
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

280
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,160
And we plug it in.

281
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,360
Yes, every possible way that Jimmy Carter,

282
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,840
I'm sorry, Gerald Ford could have died.

283
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,680
Yeah.

284
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,840
So if you hear us talking about the 2020 election,

285
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,960
that's us pre-guessing,

286
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,840
we've thrown out a lot of material about like Cuomo,

287
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,680
like people who didn't end up running.

288
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,520
Yeah.

289
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,640
We had to snip it, but we recorded it just in case.

290
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,480
Yes.

291
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,720
So yeah, we're covered all of our bases here.

292
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,560
So yeah.

293
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,040
So now when you hear us talking about

294
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,640
that it's down to just Bernie Biden, that's,

295
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,000
you just heard one of 30 options

296
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,520
that we recorded two years ago.

297
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,160
Yes, every possibility.

298
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,680
And one day maybe we'll release the alts where it was like,

299
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,000
we thought it came down to Bennett versus Biden

300
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,720
or Bennett versus Yang or.

301
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,960
Yeah, we had a lot of jokes about Bennett boys.

302
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,480
Bennett boys, yeah.

303
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,800
Or the outcome where it was clearly

304
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,160
Tulsi Gabbard unopposed.

305
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
Yes. That's true.

306
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,240
And then they also the option

307
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,400
where Jason entered the race somehow.

308
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,520
Sure, yeah.

309
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,360
Yeah.

310
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,000
And then we recorded all of, so without Jason,

311
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,840
because if he's the president, he wouldn't be there.

312
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,680
So.

313
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,320
The super delegates, all big fans of the podcast.

314
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,640
They love the podcast.

315
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,720
They love it.

316
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,400
They love minutia.

317
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,200
But anyway, let's get back to.

318
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,040
To the man.

319
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,320
February 2020 and.

320
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,280
Boy, the cat's movie was bad.

321
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,840
No, Papa Steve, there's so much.

322
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,400
The king of sourdough.

323
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,240
He sure is.

324
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,080
The king of sourdough.

325
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,920
The man legend.

326
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,240
We're basically going off of a picture frame here.

327
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,680
And so it's up to us now to fill in the information

328
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,960
about Papa Steve.

329
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,560
Let's pay him the respect by saying his real name.

330
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,840
Stefano Gerardo.

331
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,680
Unless.

332
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,520
Gerardo?

333
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,360
Gerardo.

334
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,640
Gerardo, yeah.

335
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,040
Not Gerardo.

336
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,880
Somebody.

337
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,720
Yeah, not Gerardo.

338
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,560
There's no extra R.

339
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,880
Yeah.

340
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,960
So we learned about this man.

341
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,800
Yeah.

342
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,400
This is related to theme parks.

343
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,200
The thing that attracted me to Papa Steve,

344
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,960
because it is just like a largely contextless picture.

345
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,360
When you think about Disney parks, especially,

346
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,720
that is some of the most expensive real estate

347
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,160
in the country, if not the world.

348
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,880
So the fact that there is just a picture,

349
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,320
essentially an immemorial picture of him,

350
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,960
because he passed before this park opened.

351
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,760
Just here with no context and maybe a mention

352
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,760
in the earlier on tour is interesting.

353
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,040
And it also, I do want to clarify,

354
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,640
he is not the founder of the Boudin Bakery.

355
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,600
Right.

356
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,920
He bought it.

357
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,640
Yes, there was a Boudin family who you learn about

358
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,360
in the video with Rosie O'Donnell and Colin Mochrie.

359
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,320
Now this video is pretty entertaining.

360
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
Let me set the timer though.

361
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,480
Isidore Boudin, as I believe is the French pronunciation,

362
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,760
but the Americanized English version is,

363
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,200
they do call it Boudin, as I learned in an informational

364
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,520
little documentary on the Boudin Bakery YouTube.

365
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,360
Oh.

366
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,560
Which I'm going to put this out there now.

367
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,080
That video has a good number of views,

368
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,120
but they only have 64 subscribers.

369
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,320
Folks, give them a subscribe.

370
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,720
Give them a subscribe to the nice Boudin Bakery people.

371
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,000
Who's those numbers?

372
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,840
Yeah.

373
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,000
If you can get them some, some ad revenue.

374
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,160
Make them partners.

375
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,400
So yeah, so, so I've, I've been reading that it,

376
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,360
so do we want to talk about Isidore more?

377
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,480
Do we want to keep talking about Papa Steve?

378
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,760
Isidore is covered mainly in the, in the-

379
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,600
Yeah, you're right.

380
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,240
Isidore is covered, but his big innovation

381
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,160
was taking French bread baking techniques

382
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,080
from master French bakers of which he was one

383
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,600
and combining it with the sourdough bread

384
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,800
that the 49ers, the miners would have

385
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,480
because it keeps for a while.

386
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,320
I see.

387
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,160
Okay, okay.

388
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,680
And their business is up and running in San Francisco

389
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,680
for decades, bun decades, but is starting to struggle.

390
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,280
Enter Papa Steve.

391
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,120
Steve.

392
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,120
Papa Steve's story, very strange, born in San Francisco

393
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,040
but moved to Italy when he was seven.

394
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,000
Then-

395
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,040
Left Italy when he was 14.

396
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,240
Left Italy, all right, yeah.

397
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,680
We're all comparing our same notes

398
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,360
and moved to France to become a great baker.

399
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,320
That's right.

400
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,240
And at 21 moved back to San Francisco

401
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,160
and became a San Francisco institution.

402
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,600
But how strange that he was born there, moved away.

403
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,520
Was it that his parents left also for bakery reasons?

404
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,840
I don't remember about the parents.

405
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,720
There's not a ton of Papa Steve information.

406
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,560
Not really.

407
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,120
No, and I'll say this for a few minutes.

408
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,480
I was throwing for a loop

409
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,640
because Papa Steve's son was named Steven.

410
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,560
Oh.

411
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,200
And the San Francisco Bay Area newspapers

412
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,880
had obituaries covered both of the sales

413
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,480
and purchases of this company, their debts.

414
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,400
But this is the way he, Papa Steve died in 97.

415
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,120
Yes, 97.

416
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,440
Okay, so we have the right guy,

417
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,080
if that's who we're talking about.

418
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,440
So, he found stall, look, the guy found stall around Europe.

419
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,720
A kid with a dream, he was 14,

420
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,200
he wants to go be a great French baker of bread.

421
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,720
That's pretty early.

422
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,400
That's early to know what you wanna do in life.

423
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,680
I assume he would have grown up around it.

424
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,680
He would have some inspiration.

425
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,720
I'm only speculating here.

426
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,920
Might have been his first food.

427
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,320
Maybe his pacifier was carved out of sourdough bread.

428
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,160
Interesting.

429
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
So he had the taste, the first thing in his life.

430
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,600
Was there ever a time in your life

431
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,400
where you thought about not necessarily being a bread baker

432
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,160
but any sort of like, you know, cake maker,

433
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,960
any sort of working in a bakery like that?

434
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,800
Jason, I'm talking about.

435
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,640
You know.

436
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,480
Poor Scott, you can answer too.

437
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,320
I mean, no, no is the answer for me.

438
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,880
No is the answer for me too.

439
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,280
I never really considered it.

440
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,280
I think I'm an okay cook, an okay baker.

441
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,280
I never considered it, but I did think it was interesting

442
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,960
because in college, I knew people who's like work study,

443
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,840
they would work at the on-campus bakery

444
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,880
and their shifts were so early in the morning.

445
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,560
That was a big thing.

446
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,560
I am not an early riser and much respect to Papa Steve

447
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,800
because as we'll get to later.

448
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,240
Oh my God, Papa Steve was an early ass riser.

449
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,080
Early riser.

450
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,520
Wow, but it's completely that.

451
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,120
You didn't like to sleep in.

452
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,920
Well, I never really considered the culinary pathway.

453
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,880
I have a cousin who got a culinary degree

454
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,520
and considered taking a job at Walt Disney World

455
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,160
but I think went back for additional training.

456
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,480
I think she got a baking, you know, pastry degree

457
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,320
and then went back to get a full chef,

458
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,280
whatever training you get.

459
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,120
What if you, I mean, like things don't have to be baked

460
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,120
in the morning.

461
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,120
It's just generally how things will people,

462
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,480
commerce works and everything.

463
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,760
Would you be into the idea of like a bakery

464
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,880
that opened at 1 p.m.?

465
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,760
Oh yeah, absolutely.

466
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,200
Well, but again, you gotta have it all out by 1 p.m.

467
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,040
Why?

468
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,860
So, huh?

469
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,080
Why do you have to have it out by 1 p.m.?

470
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,720
Well, if it's opening.

471
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,280
You're setting your own hours.

472
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,680
Oh, I see.

473
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,520
What if?

474
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,720
Yeah, I think if you're suggesting idea of a night bakery.

475
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,240
Okay, so it has to be 6 p.m. is when it opens

476
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,000
because you roll into work at 1 p.m.

477
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,800
and then everything's ready by 6 p.m.

478
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,880
So it's a night bakery.

479
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,080
I'm kind of into that

480
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,000
because it is interesting like the LA donut shops.

481
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,880
Some are 24 hours and then some like close up.

482
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,800
At like 3 p.m.

483
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,240
At 3 or 4 p.m.

484
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,080
Right.

485
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,000
And then reopen at like 5, 6 in the morning.

486
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,760
So where's the one that opens at 3 p.m.?

487
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,600
Yes.

488
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,480
You swoop in when all the other,

489
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,880
when those quitters are closing at 3.

490
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,200
Right.

491
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,240
Yeah, I mean, look, this podcast was,

492
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,240
we saw the space for comedy focused theme park podcast.

493
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,440
It seems like there's space for a night based bakery.

494
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,880
So, entirely night.

495
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,520
Jason Sheridan's night bakery.

496
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,240
Third shift, I mean, swing shift, graveyard shift,

497
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,160
they deserve fresh treats too.

498
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah.

499
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So yours can be good bread, good treats, good sleep.

500
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,640
Papa Jason.

501
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,480
Sleep.

502
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,600
Yeah.

503
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,440
Sleeping in.

504
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,320
I'm surprised to look at 16, 17 minutes

505
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,320
to get to Papa Jason already.

506
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,120
I mean, yeah.

507
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,960
I'm Papa Jason.

508
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,720
That could be another good way to open the show.

509
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,320
You said it's I'm Papa Jason.

510
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,280
Oh man.

511
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,360
Yeah.

512
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,840
Well, I did it in.

513
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,160
Okay.

514
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,800
I'm Papa Jason.

515
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,640
All right.

516
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,480
Papa's got a brand new bread.

517
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,480
I'm Papa Jason.

518
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,320
Papa Jason.

519
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,880
I feel like I do have a strong personal stances

520
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,440
on sourdough bread.

521
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,080
Sourdough bread, pretty high on my list of good bread.

522
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,320
Maybe number one.

523
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,160
Okay.

524
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,360
Of like the bread I like the most.

525
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,640
What did you consider everything in that though?

526
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,840
Do you consider like, as we've talked about

527
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,880
the pronunciation before, a croissant?

528
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,720
Do you, is that in the-

529
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,680
I'm not considering that.

530
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,520
Okay.

531
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,840
You're just saying it's standard bread.

532
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,400
I'm talking like brioche.

533
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,680
Brioche is probably up there.

534
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,520
Rye.

535
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,880
Potato bread.

536
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,200
I like potato bread.

537
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,040
Yeah.

538
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,880
Hmm.

539
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,000
But sourdough number one.

540
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,160
I think sourdough number one.

541
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,640
Sometimes it's too hard for me though.

542
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,480
Really?

543
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,080
I don't love a hard bread.

544
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,400
Unless it's like garlic bread,

545
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,720
like so hard that it like crumbles.

546
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,640
Yeah.

547
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,760
I'm into more of that.

548
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,000
I like a little resistance and the chewiness.

549
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,160
I think that's why I like it.

550
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,120
How much, let me ask listener,

551
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,280
how much resistance do you like when it comes to bread?

552
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,120
Let us know.

553
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,240
Let us know.

554
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,640
Biscuits, I mean biscuits are up here.

555
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,960
Well, biscuits are a whole different thing.

556
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,240
That's a whole nother world.

557
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,080
I also-

558
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,680
If you let us know with hashtag rise of the resistance.

559
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,480
That should make it pretty clear.

560
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,040
Very obvious what you're tweeting about.

561
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,280
I also have a distinct memory of being up in San Francisco

562
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,440
and visiting the Boudin Bakery.

563
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,080
Cause I was there for SketchFest

564
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,920
Doing your own artisan craft.

565
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,200
Doing my own artisan craft, that's right.

566
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,440
And then I did another artisan craft

567
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,680
of getting food poisoning.

568
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,640
And was very ill,

569
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,760
and miserable walking around San Francisco

570
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,600
and went to the Boudin Bakery

571
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,600
and got a small like thing of sourdough bread.

572
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,560
Cause they have it in every size under the sun.

573
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,280
That's pretty like tame.

574
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,320
It's very tame.

575
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,840
And just like walking around the wharf,

576
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,000
drinking ginger ale, gnawing on a small loaf

577
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,520
of sourdough bread to come back to life.

578
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,360
Like a rat.

579
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,080
Gnawing on it as the sea,

580
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,160
looking at the wonderful sea lions.

581
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,800
All those fun-

582
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,200
The sea.

583
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,240
There's a big, there's a wharf.

584
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,080
I know what you're talking about.

585
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,720
It's just the image of you like sick drinking ginger ale,

586
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,800
gnawing on a piece of bread while you're looking at sea lions.

587
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,120
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

588
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,200
And you're like, uh, like you're on the throw off.

589
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,480
That would push the other off.

590
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,320
Nice.

591
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,480
Those fights are good.

592
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,320
Yeah.

593
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,120
You can stop and stare at fights for a while.

594
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,720
Sea lion fights.

595
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,560
This is beautiful.

596
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,520
This is Steinbeckian California imagery.

597
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,640
Yeah, this is the real deal.

598
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,680
I like this sentence.

599
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,520
I assume that we, there are three websites

600
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,040
that we all went to independently.

601
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,600
Stefano became known as Steve Two,

602
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,720
his friends and customers,

603
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,160
and Papa Steve Two, his employees,

604
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,000
in his 60 years as Master Baker of Boudin.

605
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,200
So he made his employees call him Papa Steve,

606
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,520
but not his friends and customers,

607
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,480
which honestly seems a little bit like a power play,

608
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,320
like a power move.

609
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,800
Did he make them or did they like?

610
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,840
Well, it's unclear.

611
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,680
We don't have, we hopefully will be reached out to

612
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,160
by some people that worked under him.

613
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,080
Did his children call him Papa Steve?

614
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,400
It seems, well, yeah, it doesn't say family,

615
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,600
but customer, it says customers and friends, Steve,

616
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,120
people that worked under him, employees, Papa Steve.

617
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,920
I think this, I think the Papa thing,

618
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,480
it seems to have some nice symmetry

619
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,440
to his strong belief in the power of the mother dough.

620
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,280
Yes.

621
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,640
Because he really, and you guys might have these quotes too,

622
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,960
but he speaks with a lot of passion about the mother dough.

623
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,800
Yes.

624
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,240
I'll just, I'll read one of them.

625
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,920
You might have the same one.

626
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,800
But always referred to as she, you know,

627
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,560
like a boat or a gun that you call she.

628
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,400
Like a mother.

629
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,240
Yeah.

630
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,480
A boat, a gun or a mother.

631
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,920
She loves to eat the sweetness of the flour.

632
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,360
She eats one type of sugar, which is maltose,

633
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,120
which is the only sugar the wild yeast can eat.

634
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,360
You need to keep the mother healthy

635
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,160
so she can keep having babies and babies and babies.

636
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,440
The mother, keep the mother.

637
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,280
The mother.

638
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,320
I know what the mother dough is,

639
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,800
but I don't feel comfortable explaining

640
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,080
the concept of the mother dough.

641
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,360
Well, it is,

642
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,200
No, go ahead.

643
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,320
I was just going to say, correct me,

644
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,520
cause I'll get it wrong.

645
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,240
It is like the original master mold, not mold,

646
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,400
but the original like master, what would you call it?

647
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,400
Like configuration of dough that by which all the,

648
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,880
like dough comes from, it continues,

649
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,520
like they grow it essentially.

650
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,480
So the idea is like, it's an unconnected,

651
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,240
it's like an infinite.

652
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,440
Like we all connect back to Adam and Eve.

653
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,520
Yes.

654
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,600
It's like Grant Morrison's hyper entity

655
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,960
where he talks about like,

656
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,640
if you could see time and space from afar,

657
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,800
you would see you walking through the door here

658
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,320
and you would see you go all the way back

659
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,520
and into your mother's womb.

660
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,440
And that's how you would,

661
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,160
if you could see all of time and space at once,

662
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,400
it was not linear.

663
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,040
So the mother dough, it's the same way.

664
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,160
You want to see that all the bread came from this one thing

665
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,400
they made, you know, whatever, 150 years ago.

666
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,760
Whoa, there's Michael Bennett being sworn in.

667
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,240
Yeah, you could see that if time and space were all,

668
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,000
were not linear and you could see it all at once.

669
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,360
It's a starter.

670
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,000
It's a starter, like that is used

671
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,640
and then you put a little aside to use the next time

672
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,040
and then you put a little aside.

673
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,600
Right, but it grows as well.

674
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,440
Yes, it's alive.

675
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,280
Right.

676
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,800
It's alive and fermented.

677
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,640
I see.

678
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,480
That's what's goes on.

679
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,960
And a little bit is saved with every batch

680
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,880
so that there's always a piece connecting it back

681
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,720
to.

682
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,440
Is that what it is or is there just a master thing

683
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,880
that they take a little piece off of

684
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,240
and put it in the new batch?

685
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,080
I believe it's that.

686
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,720
I believe they,

687
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,680
so you put a little in, you mix up the dough

688
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,200
and then you put a little of that dough aside

689
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,560
and you just keep doing that.

690
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,400
I see.

691
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,040
So there's not like a master dough that's still somewhere.

692
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,760
I don't, yeah, I think I used to be confused about this too.

693
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,360
I don't know that there is like the queen ants.

694
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,240
That is exactly what I'm saying.

695
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,640
This bizarre undulating creature.

696
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,320
The Metroid.

697
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm imagining Metroid.

698
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,360
The game Metroid, that alien that's just float.

699
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,840
I assume anytime I've heard mother dough.

700
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,160
That's grown in power over the year

701
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,720
and lives in the San Francisco Bay.

702
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,680
Yeah.

703
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,680
Like a, what's the film, Tremors?

704
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,520
Tremors, yeah.

705
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,040
Is it a Tremors situation down below the,

706
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,960
I guess there's a lot of films where a character

707
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,040
is like hiding.

708
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,520
I feel like Godzilla starts that way sometimes.

709
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,360
Yes.

710
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,640
So that mother, yeah, that mother dough

711
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,200
is in the fisherman's wharf area.

712
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,080
And one day if displeased or if the mother dough hears

713
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,480
that a piece of her was not used in a batch of bread

714
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,640
to make a loaf, then she'll rise up

715
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,280
and like punch through the Golden Gate Bridge.

716
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,960
It looks like Clayface in my mind.

717
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,160
Batman animated series, specifically the Clayface

718
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,280
where it's like dripping.

719
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,120
Yeah.

720
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,040
Oh no, mother, mother rises.

721
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,560
Mother is angry.

722
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,880
And maybe somebody's happy, mother is like, finally.

723
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,720
Yes.

724
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,520
How else will they learn, mother?

725
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,680
Teach them.

726
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,400
Was Papa Steve married to the dough?

727
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,080
Papa Steve respected the dough on the official website.

728
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,400
The official, you can see there's like the lineage

729
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,320
on the Boudin website.

730
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,800
And it says about Papa Steve, he taught respect

731
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,000
for the mother dough and the Boudin family.

732
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,480
Here's another older picture of them.

733
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,400
I have that quote as well.

734
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,360
And then of course he is on every loaf.

735
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,240
There's an official seal with his picture.

736
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,080
Wow.

737
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,960
He's on every bag, every bag.

738
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,080
Right.

739
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,240
So we don't know his relationship with the dough.

740
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,520
You just know he respected it,

741
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,400
but we don't know behind closed doors.

742
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,840
We don't have a smoking gun document

743
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,720
showing the marriage attempt.

744
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,720
But I'd like to think that he made a little sourdough ring.

745
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,400
Yeah, oh my gosh.

746
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,240
For sure.

747
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,080
Yeah, yeah.

748
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,880
So I feel like sometimes with respect

749
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,480
comes a little bit of fear.

750
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,160
That's possible too.

751
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,160
He might've just reported back to,

752
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,200
he might've been just reporting back to the head honcho

753
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,400
like in private.

754
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,440
It was the emperor to Steve.

755
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,280
He was Vader.

756
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,560
Papa Steve was Vader and mother dough was the emperor.

757
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,400
I was saying.

758
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,200
It was really overseeing all of it.

759
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,960
So she was actually in control,

760
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,920
but she was more in the shadows.

761
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,600
Yes, yeah.

762
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,560
And then that newer mother dough that came,

763
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,840
that was just a clone.

764
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,160
That wasn't real.

765
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,200
That was a poor imitation.

766
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,720
That was a batch gone awry.

767
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,240
Yes, there were other attempts at it too

768
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,080
that were totally misshapen.

769
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,520
One of them was rye.

770
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,400
One of them, they got it wrong entirely.

771
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,240
They really messed up.

772
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,720
You gotta get seeds in there.

773
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,240
Yeah, there were no seeds.

774
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,840
Where did these seeds end up in here?

775
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,680
There were no seeds.

776
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,960
Sourdough?

777
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,120
So yeah, there was a clone of the mother dough,

778
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,560
but it was just, yeah, it was confusing,

779
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,200
but they figured it out.

780
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,240
There were books and.

781
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,680
I agree it's a confusing premise.

782
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,760
I actually did find it, again,

783
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,800
I'm sorry to talk about it,

784
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,880
but the Rosie O'Donnell tour,

785
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,600
I think is why I can visualize,

786
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,160
because they show here's a loaf

787
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,640
and a little plop comes out of it.

788
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,480
Right.

789
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,300
And that grows into the next one,

790
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,140
and then another plop,

791
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:02,280
and then just a little nickel-sized little piece

792
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,000
goes into the next batch.

793
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,840
It just seems weird,

794
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,040
because calling it the mother dough,

795
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,520
then it's like you don't know actually

796
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,680
that one of the pieces from the thing that came before

797
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,160
is actually going forward.

798
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,400
I know it grew out of it.

799
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,800
It's in there somewhere.

800
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,720
It's like putting blood in,

801
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,320
you know how you'd, I don't know,

802
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,000
you put blood in something too,

803
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,840
or like ashes in something to like.

804
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,240
Oh yeah.

805
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,080
The first.

806
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,040
It's like the multiple man.

807
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,880
It's like the X-Man.

808
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,160
It's like Jamie Madrox.

809
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,000
Madrox the multiple man, Jason?

810
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,040
Yeah, he can just keep making himself.

811
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,720
Like he just punches his hand,

812
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,840
and then there's another Jamie.

813
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,040
Yeah, but it comes from Jamie himself.

814
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,960
It doesn't come from one of his duplicates,

815
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,800
one of his multiple men.

816
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,640
Oh, that's true.

817
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,560
The duplicates can not make further duplicates.

818
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,400
That's right.

819
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,280
So if you imagine if he just keeps making duplicates,

820
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,040
he is the mother dough.

821
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,080
Mm-hmm.

822
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,760
Honestly, mother dough,

823
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,680
I really liked the idea of a mother dough

824
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,600
as like a character now.

825
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,880
So is this another episode now?

826
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,360
Separately the mother dough?

827
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,800
I think I may just go write a mother dough movie after this.

828
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,760
So maybe not even an episode.

829
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,720
Maybe this goes into my personal work.

830
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,560
Yeah.

831
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,400
Yeah, sure.

832
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,800
It's a good like, I mean, I don't know if it's horror

833
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,880
or action or sci-fi.

834
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,000
There's a lot of genres that it could take on.

835
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,840
Yeah.

836
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,040
Elements of all, I think.

837
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,840
Jason Sheridan stars.

838
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,680
Nice.

839
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,320
You want a CGI mother dough.

840
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,600
Am I, how do I feel about the mother dough?

841
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,160
I'm the baker.

842
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,440
Am I trying to stop it?

843
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,000
And I am, am I more like a reanimator type guy

844
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,600
who's really into it?

845
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,600
I think you're really into her, the mother dough.

846
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm scared differential.

847
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I think maybe you're carrying out murders

848
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,200
on behalf of the mother dough.

849
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,040
Oh, okay.

850
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,880
It's a turn.

851
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,720
Yeah.

852
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,560
It's like a horror movie.

853
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,400
Yeah.

854
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,240
It's a blown house.

855
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,680
Like blowing up restaurants of genres

856
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,080
that don't involve sourdough bread.

857
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,120
Just like, you know, like a Thai restaurant.

858
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,240
Look, you need a bread service, huh?

859
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,040
I'm giving you a good deal here.

860
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,080
What are you doing?

861
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,200
This bread lacks resistance.

862
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,680
Mother.

863
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,520
Mother.

864
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,360
Mother.

865
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,000
You're gonna rise us out of the simmer.

866
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,640
I've done your.

867
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,600
And then it's like, yeah, like a gnarly like 80s effect,

868
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,040
like a Clive Barker, like grotesque mother dough

869
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,880
that you report to.

870
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,960
So we sort of have this treatment

871
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,240
where it kind of rises up through sewers and pipes and.

872
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,040
Yes, that's good.

873
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,600
Like a blob sort of.

874
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,440
Yeah.

875
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,560
What part, one of the,

876
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,960
I think the first blob was filmed in Pennsylvania.

877
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,920
This will also be filmed in Pennsylvania.

878
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,840
Okay, great.

879
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,120
That theater is still there, the one with Marquis.

880
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,560
And we, the call time each day will be 1 p.m.

881
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,480
Yes.

882
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,280
So you will get to sleep in

883
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,720
because it's hard to get up early.

884
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,040
Can't go too late though.

885
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,000
I'll get too loopy.

886
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,880
1 p.m. to 5 p.m.

887
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,040
Oh, wonderful.

888
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,320
It'll take a year to make.

889
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,440
It's just in time for dinner.

890
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,040
Clint Eastwood directing?

891
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,880
Yeah.

892
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,720
These are Clint Eastwood hours.

893
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,040
One take.

894
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,440
Moving on.

895
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,320
Eastwood, Gervais, you know, the best.

896
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,120
Wait, does Gervais do limited takes?

897
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,080
They were kind of like,

898
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,680
let's get it done before footy matches, before soccer.

899
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,960
Is that in the afternoon?

900
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,640
I feel like it's more of a nine to five shoot.

901
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,200
It's also, this episode may come out

902
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,960
before a certain other episode,

903
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,320
but it's William Frawley.

904
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,160
Oh, right.

905
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,120
Hours too, where he's not working

906
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,440
if there's a Yankee game on.

907
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,280
No.

908
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,040
Gervais really the new Frawley.

909
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,480
Yeah, in a lot of ways.

910
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,280
Frawley really should have hosted some award shows

911
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,560
and roasted Hollywood.

912
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,640
You're all a bunch of bastards.

913
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,640
Everyone's quiet.

914
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,240
Go screw yourselves.

915
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,680
He's not even write jokes.

916
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,920
He's just cursing us out.

917
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,680
I'm going to take the piss out of you

918
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,000
and then I'm going to take a piss right here on stage.

919
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,880
Yeah, it falls over.

920
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,240
But first.

921
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,160
This concludes the Golden Globe Awards.

922
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,920
Curtin closes on his bald head.

923
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,200
Pretty baby.

924
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
By the light.

925
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,120
I'm so worried.

926
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,800
I'm so worried.

927
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,560
Please collect your awards at the side of the stage.

928
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,400
Shut up.

929
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,400
I got seven more songs.

930
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,040
So Papa Steve.

931
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,360
Papa Steve.

932
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,080
He loves the bread, you see.

933
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,920
Loves the bread.

934
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,600
He was called the sourdough king

935
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,400
by the late San Francisco Chronicle.

936
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,240
Yep, I have this.

937
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,280
Called his herb can.

938
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,200
Oh, of course.

939
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,720
Yeah.

940
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,760
It seems like maybe he was the first baker also

941
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,600
to have an open demonstration bakery.

942
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,440
Don't quote me on that,

943
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,960
but that seemed to maybe be the case.

944
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,240
Where, like in the Rosie O'Donnell, Colin Macri tour,

945
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,760
the windows are open so you can watch the process.

946
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,520
It's not behind closed doors.

947
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,360
That's part of it.

948
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,680
I love knowing how it gets made.

949
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,120
I get to watch those crazy shapes

950
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,400
and they cut the holes.

951
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,760
Seemingly, not so much the one here,

952
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,400
but in San Francisco or the bigger ones,

953
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,240
where they make like a crocodile.

954
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,680
They turn it into shapes.

955
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,640
They do like Mickey shapes, right?

956
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,400
Yeah, they do shapes here.

957
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,240
That's fun.

958
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,040
That's an underrated thing that more places should do.

959
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,120
Krispy Kreme over here in Burbank,

960
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,360
they have a, you can see into them making the donuts,

961
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,920
which is fun.

962
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,280
Excuse me, they have a conveyor belt.

963
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,480
That's all fun.

964
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,320
It's a glaze.

965
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,560
Yeah, you see the glaze, you see all of it.

966
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,200
And that's a whole, like while you're waiting in line,

967
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,560
you get to see a little demonstration.

968
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,920
And I feel like that's a real underrated.

969
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,280
You're smiling just thinking about it.

970
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,000
Is that right? I got a story about it.

971
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,920
Okay. Whoa.

972
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,720
So, and where I grew up, there was a Krispy Kreme

973
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,880
and me and my high school friends would go there sometime

974
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,160
because usually when you walked in,

975
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,880
if the conveyor belt was going, they'd hand you a donut.

976
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,920
You'd get a free donut if it was running.

977
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,480
And that happened to me here in Burbank once.

978
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,360
Yeah. That did happen.

979
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,840
And then I went back another time

980
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,560
the conveyor belt was going and I kind of stood there

981
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,560
and then I was standing there,

982
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,880
and the worker's like, can I help you?

983
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,760
I was like, oh, usually you get a free donut.

984
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,480
And they went, oh, that's for kids.

985
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,480
And I was like, wait, no, okay, maybe that changed.

986
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,600
But in the past, usually if the light is on,

987
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,920
if the odd light is on, which that's how you know

988
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,000
it's fresh, they're going through the glaze

989
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,560
and you walk in, they'll hand you one right after the glaze

990
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,440
and wax paper and everything.

991
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,480
But instead I walked in and was handed a brutal own.

992
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,920
The thing we do for children.

993
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,000
Yeah. But it was just kind of like, there's a nice,

994
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,800
I was like, oh, we just do that for kids.

995
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,000
Like there's a nice way to say that, but I was like, oh.

996
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,360
There was a deflating, that was more of a deflating way.

997
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,600
I don't want to deflate you further,

998
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,440
but is it possible that the first time

999
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,040
you were mistaken for a child?

1000
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,600
I know, cause I would have been like 17 or 18.

1001
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,040
Like by that point.

1002
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,800
Were you wearing a propeller beanie

1003
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,880
and holding a paddle ball or anything?

1004
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,560
Well, the California sun, you gotta keep out

1005
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,880
and the traffic is bad, but you can't be on your phone.

1006
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,240
So you gotta abuse yourself.

1007
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,120
Or a jug head crown.

1008
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,680
No, that's an older person wears a jug head crown.

1009
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,120
I've been begging you to wear a jug head crown for years.

1010
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,000
I mean, it's like a beanie.

1011
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,240
It's like a hood, a knit cap kind of thing.

1012
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,080
Yeah.

1013
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,480
I guess it's not practical to actually wear it

1014
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,360
like jug head wears it, which is tiny.

1015
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,960
Like how does it hang on his head?

1016
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,920
How is it connected?

1017
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,800
It's gotta be like bobby pins.

1018
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,640
Yeah.

1019
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,480
Yeah.

1020
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,320
But yeah.

1021
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,040
Comic book physics where it's just drawn.

1022
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,880
Yeah.

1023
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,840
It just drawn on there.

1024
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,760
They will, I will say about Krispy Kreme over here.

1025
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,600
I have been in there before where they have

1026
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,360
freeze set out for everybody.

1027
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,200
Yeah.

1028
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,920
Less than a year ago when we were in line,

1029
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,680
there was just a little section and it was free

1030
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,640
and everyone was just taking one

1031
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,200
as they went through the line.

1032
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,040
Exactly.

1033
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,880
Yeah.

1034
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,560
So I got one curmudgeonly baker.

1035
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,400
I think you should go to Hollywood.

1036
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,480
Probably up too early.

1037
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,040
You know, that's my problem.

1038
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,040
I'm about real early.

1039
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,880
I'm a little grumpy.

1040
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,480
You're not gonna find this attitude

1041
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,840
at the 3pm bakery.

1042
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,680
Right.

1043
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,520
No, not at all.

1044
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,480
Papa Jason's night bakery.

1045
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,680
Adults get free donuts at Papa Jason's night bakery.

1046
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,520
Sure.

1047
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,680
We cannot give you a free loaf of bread.

1048
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,520
Right.

1049
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,360
Free donut.

1050
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,400
So, did you get more about the open thing or no?

1051
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,240
No, it's that.

1052
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,080
Okay.

1053
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,240
So demonstration bakery, I think.

1054
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,640
Yeah, I got a fact.

1055
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,520
I found if you go to the Facebook page

1056
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,120
or the Boudin Bakery, which I did,

1057
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,720
they have some little tidbits and here's a tidbit.

1058
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,280
Papa Steve was asked to make sourdough

1059
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,600
for a dinner of Cardinals and Archbishops

1060
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,240
during the Pope's visit.

1061
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,320
Pope John Paul II, his visit to San Francisco in 1987.

1062
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,240
So how about that?

1063
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,080
Papa Steve making sourdough for the Pope.

1064
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,800
Was that his same tour where he played

1065
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,960
the Universal slash Gibson amphitheater?

1066
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,800
Oh, that's a good question.

1067
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,400
That's his visit to City Walk.

1068
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,480
Yeah, I think it might've been.

1069
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,360
Come to California, hit the big landmarks.

1070
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,680
Yeah, maybe.

1071
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,520
87.

1072
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,000
Did Papa Steve meet the Pope?

1073
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,280
The ultimate Papa?

1074
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,680
Papa John.

1075
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,880
Yeah, I stay corrected.

1076
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,280
It doesn't say there wasn't much further information

1077
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,600
on the trivia section of the Boudin Bakery Facebook page,

1078
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,760
but I'd like to assume he did.

1079
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,880
But at least he met a Cardinal or two.

1080
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,360
Well, so go on the, add that Facebook page too.

1081
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,440
Hit them up on YouTube and Facebook, get those numbers.

1082
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,680
Then they can have a fully committed social media manager

1083
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,560
so we can get more trivia all the time

1084
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,880
and do Papa Steve too.

1085
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,360
And if you're in San Francisco,

1086
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,160
go see the like big facility at Fisherman's Worth

1087
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,560
because it's a beautiful facility with lots of food stuffs

1088
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,480
and a little bit of, there's tours and info stuff

1089
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,400
on a bigger scale.

1090
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,600
Sea lions.

1091
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,920
I mean, the sea lions are, that's just a bonus.

1092
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,800
Now, something I was trying to figure out is,

1093
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,800
is there a framed photo of Papa Steve in other Boudin,

1094
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,280
in that bakery or in other,

1095
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,200
because there is a Boudin chain that's elsewhere.

1096
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,320
I believe there's one in Huntington Beach here in California.

1097
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,760
I think there's a lot of those.

1098
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,680
And some of them seem to have a Papa Steve photo,

1099
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,560
but it's not this Papa Steve photo.

1100
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,880
In fact, he looks a little more cross

1101
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,240
and kind of in work mode.

1102
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,080
It's not as-

1103
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,120
This black and white one?

1104
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,080
That seems familiar.

1105
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,600
Yes, the other ones I've seen are black and white.

1106
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:38,160
All the photos of him in all the stuff I was looking at,

1107
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,720
he does seem a little more stern.

1108
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,280
He definitely, like, he seems so like jovial and kindly

1109
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,240
in the picture at California Adventure.

1110
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,200
He's the sweetest man you've ever seen.

1111
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,440
Right, but maybe he was a tyrant.

1112
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,280
Could have been.

1113
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,120
A bread tyrant.

1114
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,120
Why do you dispute that?

1115
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,840
I think he was serious about his craft.

1116
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,680
All right.

1117
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,280
This might be a good time to say,

1118
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,160
I did find video footage of Papa Steve.

1119
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,000
Oh, great.

1120
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,520
And I think it more supports him being a very kind man.

1121
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,360
Great.

1122
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,360
He seems very sweet.

1123
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:17,360
The whole interview is very heartwarming.

1124
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,680
It again, you watch him,

1125
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,320
they think they say at the top of the news report,

1126
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,560
this is a fisherman's wharf.

1127
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,960
Not many people get to see,

1128
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,760
but it's what Papa Steve sees every day

1129
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,520
because he had to wake up so early.

1130
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,360
And there's some fun stuff.

1131
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,640
You watch him crack a loaf over his knee

1132
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,520
to show the proper degree of hardness

1133
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,560
it's supposed to have.

1134
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,440
A lot of it, it's all very nice.

1135
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,720
It's a good little profile

1136
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,400
and I would have just played it all

1137
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,200
except some of it's a little quiet,

1138
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,400
but I wanted to put this one part

1139
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,360
that'll give you his vibe,

1140
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,560
but also show you,

1141
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,240
it's a little piece of sourdough history.

1142
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,200
I certainly didn't know.

1143
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,280
So this is from like San Francisco news

1144
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,920
in the 80s sometime.

1145
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,240
And check it out.

1146
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,360
Here Gerardo baked,

1147
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,800
but also delivered the warm bread door to door

1148
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,360
to people's homes.

1149
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,200
You just pick up the loaf like this.

1150
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,040
And they always had a nail sticking out from the wall.

1151
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,880
You know?

1152
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,120
And that's it.

1153
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,200
So what we're saying here

1154
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,040
is that he delivered sourdough bread

1155
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,480
to San Francisco residents,

1156
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,280
much like a milkman.

1157
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,840
And the way that the deliveries happened

1158
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,920
were that people put a nail on their front door

1159
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,600
and you would just kind of like slam the bread

1160
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,640
against the nail and it would stick.

1161
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,280
So then you'd come home

1162
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,400
or go outside for the morning

1163
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,360
and on the wall

1164
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:47,120
would as appropriately like a framed photo,

1165
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,520
the main way that we know him now,

1166
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,320
your bread is up on the wall.

1167
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,160
Wow.

1168
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,000
Waiting for you.

1169
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,820
That's incredible.

1170
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,920
So you would open your door in the morning,

1171
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,080
you get the newspaper,

1172
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,000
you get a fresh bottle of milk

1173
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,120
and bread on your door.

1174
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,680
I mean.

1175
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,720
Lean out to that door frame.

1176
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,040
And if, okay, San Francisco famously

1177
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,680
prone to have earthquakes,

1178
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,040
a lot of them up there

1179
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,640
and I don't think this is still the case,

1180
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,080
but the advice for a long time

1181
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,400
has been wait under that door frame.

1182
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,160
Like that'll protect you during the earthquake.

1183
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,760
So if, you know, in 89,

1184
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,040
there's a massive earthquake,

1185
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,880
but like what are we gonna do?

1186
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,800
We might be here for days without food.

1187
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,640
Wait a minute.

1188
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,760
Papa Steve has already been here

1189
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,280
at four in the morning

1190
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,440
and right here on the only thing intact,

1191
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,520
the door frame is a piece of sourdough

1192
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,440
and this will sustain us until the power.

1193
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,240
Now, the structure of that sourdough

1194
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,200
probably would, in addition to nourishing,

1195
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,280
you would probably help reinforce the door frame

1196
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,800
because I think the door frame

1197
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,880
has been debunked as a system now.

1198
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,000
Yeah, I think that's not correct.

1199
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,840
Yeah. Right.

1200
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,680
That is not correct.

1201
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,200
But if you could cover the door frame

1202
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,080
in a firm sourdough casing.

1203
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,880
With the right resistance.

1204
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,360
Right. Yes.

1205
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,800
And you, because, oh wait, no,

1206
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,200
I was gonna start to talk about that triangle.

1207
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,840
That's debunked too.

1208
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,160
I think the triangle's been debunked as well.

1209
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,120
It's basically just go under a table.

1210
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,760
Go under a table or if you're in bed,

1211
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,360
just don't move, just stay in bed.

1212
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,560
But if you have a big enough table-sized loaf,

1213
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,680
that would be interesting.

1214
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,920
You just hide under that.

1215
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,160
So the safest place to be in an earthquake,

1216
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,520
especially in San Francisco,

1217
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,920
is at the Boudin Bakery.

1218
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,160
As they start flying,

1219
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,960
build a little fort for yourself

1220
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,080
and hide under it.

1221
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,960
And then, club sandwiches, chocolate croissants.

1222
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,400
And then when it's all over, yeah,

1223
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,600
then you've got a feast.

1224
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,080
Yeah.

1225
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,080
Just jamming that bread against the door.

1226
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,480
I love that. So delightful.

1227
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,760
And so what do you guys,

1228
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,320
now you've seen him in motion,

1229
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,480
you've heard him talk.

1230
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,240
Yeah, he does seem very kindly.

1231
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,080
That's great.

1232
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,320
I'm glad he's like Santa Claus

1233
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,640
because that's what he seems like.

1234
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,160
Yeah. Absolutely.

1235
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,520
But maybe he knew the camera's on.

1236
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,280
Maybe he's really a tyrant.

1237
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,120
We don't know.

1238
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,480
He's like come close to like breaking doors down

1239
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,040
by how hard he slammed those loafs.

1240
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:14,880
Yeah.

1241
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,440
We saw it hard too.

1242
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,760
Do you think he ever knocked on a door with a force?

1243
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,600
Maybe.

1244
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,440
It's possible.

1245
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,480
Yeah.

1246
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,680
Is there, yeah, what?

1247
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,640
Also, cleanliness.

1248
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,000
Like we've come a long way on like

1249
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,040
how we would treat food and stuff.

1250
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,280
But like, I feel like most of us

1251
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,520
wouldn't want to eat bread after,

1252
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,680
well, not you, but if a bread touched a door,

1253
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,960
I would go, I don't want to eat that.

1254
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,640
But you're fine if the bread touched a door.

1255
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,480
That's strange.

1256
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,960
I would just try to keep my door clean.

1257
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,720
So you've now got to extra scrub your door frame.

1258
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,560
Yeah.

1259
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,280
I, San Francisco is a little more hum,

1260
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,720
I would be a little more,

1261
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:58,600
in Los Angeles, it's so much dirt everywhere, you know.

1262
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,200
Sometimes ash, if,

1263
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,160
sometimes ash just falls from the sky here

1264
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,440
if something's on fire.

1265
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,400
True.

1266
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,600
And in the Valley, it's just,

1267
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,360
I feel like there's always just a fine layer of dirt

1268
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,440
on your car unless you really get it washed a lot.

1269
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,280
So how does this affect putting a loaf on your door?

1270
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,560
I'm a little more hesitant of like current state doors

1271
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,400
for this location.

1272
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,800
But San Francisco, you feel better about it?

1273
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,880
San Francisco, more of a humid climate I associated with.

1274
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,960
So I feel like getting a little more of a washing

1275
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,800
those doors.

1276
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,760
Which they say is gonna be, wait a minute.

1277
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,000
So you're, wait, you're okay with,

1278
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,480
it's getting a washing.

1279
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,560
And by that you mean the salt air in the sky

1280
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,920
is keeping your door clean.

1281
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,080
It's getting a constant washing.

1282
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,080
It's windy.

1283
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,160
Which is the drying process.

1284
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,000
Yeah.

1285
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,240
So you're fine with,

1286
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,080
so I,

1287
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,960
There's loaves on the door.

1288
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,120
They're being cleaned 24 seven.

1289
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:52,960
A season two.

1290
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,280
Oh man.

1291
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,120
I was gonna say, I was on my way to saying,

1292
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,920
I think that is the idea with the mother dough

1293
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,480
is that it does come from,

1294
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,640
there's something in the air in San Francisco

1295
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,680
is kind of the legend.

1296
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,960
That's what they say.

1297
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,800
It is that saltiness and that humidity that makes it,

1298
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,600
it's why the only the,

1299
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,560
if it can't be made in San Francisco,

1300
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,680
it has to have a little of that mother dough

1301
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,640
cause that's the little salty, humid spice.

1302
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,880
Like on Jason's door.

1303
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,600
Like on my delicious door.

1304
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,440
Clean, clean door.

1305
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,760
I don't wanna give out where you live.

1306
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,600
Okay.

1307
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,880
We really should so people can nail bread to the door.

1308
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,040
Please don't do that.

1309
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,520
Ha.

1310
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,680
You get an extra long nail so that every day,

1311
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,240
like 30 loaves.

1312
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,080
Okay.

1313
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,400
Remember dog studios.

1314
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,240
Yeah.

1315
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,440
A Patreon tier.

1316
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,520
Where? Sunset Boulevard.

1317
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,000
A Patreon tier where we give you Jason's address

1318
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,200
and you're allowed to nail bread to his door

1319
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,120
every morning if possible.

1320
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,600
If you're in the area.

1321
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,520
You get to.

1322
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,360
Yeah.

1323
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,560
You're paying us more for the privilege

1324
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,400
of delivering Jason's bread every day.

1325
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,880
Of doxing me with bread.

1326
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,720
I don't know.

1327
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,400
Doxing always is a bad connotation.

1328
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,240
This is a good one.

1329
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,080
Can you imagine?

1330
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:03,920
Can you get something out of it?

1331
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,240
All the different types of bread you'd have in the morning

1332
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,960
nailed to the door.

1333
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,440
Oh, but then you run into the tyranny of choice

1334
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,240
and we all hate that, don't we folks?

1335
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,160
You're eating 10 loaves of bread every morning.

1336
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,520
So the company Back in Family Hands.

1337
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,360
Yes.

1338
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,400
Was not always, was sold in 19, in the mid 90s.

1339
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,640
I believe 93.

1340
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,600
Yeah.

1341
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,000
They didn't sell to craft.

1342
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,840
Right.

1343
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,560
There was talk of it and they did not.

1344
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:34,000
And in fact, a bunch of the local bread makers,

1345
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,520
Boudin, Parisian, Colombo and Toscana

1346
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,080
is all joined together to form

1347
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,360
the San Francisco French Bread Company.

1348
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,600
In a very, as I learned in a very mundane video I watched,

1349
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,360
that was kind of like when the light bulb and the fish

1350
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,920
merge into Mr. Sparkle.

1351
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,440
Because this and this are now this.

1352
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,280
Right.

1353
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,360
Bum, bum.

1354
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,600
But I love, oh 80s dull corporate videos I'll watch all day.

1355
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,040
So it did teach me a little lesson.

1356
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,360
The San Francisco French Bread Company was like,

1357
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,080
you know, let's not go corporate, let's all band together.

1358
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,040
We've all been competitors, but if we share resources

1359
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,560
and there's strength in all of it.

1360
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,440
But I think though at the end of the day,

1361
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,840
Boudin won out and just is the winner.

1362
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,680
Right.

1363
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,080
So they were all the rest, we're all suckers.

1364
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,480
I believe they were all Boudin breads,

1365
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,720
the rebrand, eventually rebranded.

1366
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,200
It just became the uniform.

1367
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,440
Bun off briefly owned by the people who owned Hostess

1368
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,000
and Wonder Bread who collapsed a few years ago.

1369
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,400
And then the brands eventually bought by other companies

1370
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,800
and brought back.

1371
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:38,800
But then the company, the family rebought Boudin

1372
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,040
in the early 2000s.

1373
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,840
So it's back, so it is in Gerardo.

1374
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,680
It is in Gerardo.

1375
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,200
Steven, the son, I believe involved,

1376
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,840
Louis, the grandson, still involved, still with us.

1377
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,320
Well, somebody in this family is who posted

1378
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,240
that video clip that I want.

1379
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,600
They've posted videos about the family history

1380
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,160
and the history of Sourdough.

1381
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,200
So another YouTube channel you should follow.

1382
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,320
Yeah. Like Gerardo, get those numbers up.

1383
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,000
Get the numbers up. Yeah, please.

1384
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,400
Did we find the imposter?

1385
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,240
What?

1386
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:19,560
Did we find the man who is calling himself Papa Steve?

1387
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,400
What?

1388
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,760
Oh, and I think maybe, what are you talking about though?

1389
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,840
There's a different, there's a company that makes a product

1390
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,880
called Papa Steve's No Junk Raw Protein Bars.

1391
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,600
I did find those, yeah.

1392
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,600
Steve Dybold, some Stanford University grad.

1393
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,120
That's too close.

1394
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,160
That's too close to San Francisco.

1395
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,560
And he is calling his product Papa Steve's.

1396
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,600
Tsk, tsk, tsk, I say.

1397
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1398
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,600
I don't care for this at all.

1399
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,360
Bad blood, bad man.

1400
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,120
Bad people.

1401
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,880
If this were some sort of saga,

1402
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,200
he would inhabit the sector keeper's body

1403
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,200
and we'd fight him.

1404
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,520
This would be a very good,

1405
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,920
this is who would inhabit the sourdough keeper.

1406
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,760
Yeah.

1407
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,600
Unless the sourdough keeper

1408
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,440
wanna appear to us now?

1409
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,640
Silence, crickets, sourdough keeper?

1410
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,480
All right, just checking.

1411
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,320
Seems not to be here.

1412
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,440
Seeing if the skies were open.

1413
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,520
Yeah.

1414
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,320
So I don't care, I don't care for it.

1415
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,200
I think we should all boycott Papa Steve's

1416
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,560
no junk raw protein bars.

1417
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:28,800
You know, I will not specifically go to a website

1418
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,480
to order these protein bars.

1419
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,200
Yeah, do not do that.

1420
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,280
I wasn't, I'll be honest,

1421
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,320
I wasn't buying them before

1422
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,040
and I will continue not to buy them.

1423
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,640
This is like, you know, we have some sponsors

1424
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,520
and we read some ads on the main feed,

1425
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,560
but only on the Patreon do we have anti-sponsors.

1426
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,400
That's right.

1427
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,880
I've seen these in the world.

1428
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,480
I have seen these.

1429
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,320
I don't know about.

1430
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,760
Well, next time spit on them.

1431
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,600
One time purchase.

1432
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,440
Okay.

1433
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,260
Are you looking through the?

1434
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,440
Well, I want to see how much, how many bars,

1435
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,760
because it's saying a box is like 30 something bucks.

1436
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,560
And I'm like, for 10 bars?

1437
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,400
That's insane.

1438
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,840
This is some ballast point bullshit.

1439
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,120
This is worse than ballo.

1440
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,400
I don't even want to denigrate ballast point.

1441
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,480
They're on the up and they're coming around.

1442
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,520
They're on the rebound.

1443
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,800
They're on the, why are they on the rebound?

1444
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,840
Well, they got sold to a different brewer

1445
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,160
since we've done that episode.

1446
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,000
They got sold.

1447
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,840
They were?

1448
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:25,280
From the, to a brewery in the Midwest,

1449
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,080
a brewery company bought them.

1450
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:27,920
Oh.

1451
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,800
That giant beverage conglomerate spun it off.

1452
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,040
Oh, okay.

1453
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,120
So you're more okay with them.

1454
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:38,160
I think they're kind of, you know,

1455
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,960
getting their sea legs again, it seems like.

1456
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,000
But price point is what you're watching.

1457
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,480
Well, they might be watching it too, you know?

1458
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,320
Sure.

1459
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,840
After the, in the fallout of the episode.

1460
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,960
After the fallout of, well, clearly they,

1461
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,600
it seems like they were losing money

1462
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,480
or like they tried to expand to,

1463
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,160
I mean, all this stuff that happens with businesses.

1464
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:01,960
Much like Boudin seemed like they expanded into Illinois

1465
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,960
with their restaurants.

1466
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,800
My hometown.

1467
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,760
Which I think closed.

1468
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,600
So, I mean, it's a real gamble.

1469
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,680
Don't go to Illinois.

1470
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,080
Don't go to Illinois.

1471
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,120
It's the fatal mistake any business can make.

1472
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,000
Yeah, so, all right, back in the family.

1473
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,320
As we said, he liked to,

1474
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,200
he rose at 3.30 every morning.

1475
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,360
Oh, can you imagine, Jason?

1476
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,080
I mean, much respect.

1477
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,960
Much respect to an early riser king, you know?

1478
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,800
All right.

1479
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,040
I mean, I find that when I hear about like,

1480
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,040
executives or whatever,

1481
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,520
Mark Wahlberg getting up at three in the morning every day,

1482
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,760
I'm like, all right, I don't know, man.

1483
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,440
But for Baker, that's kind of the life, you know?

1484
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,600
It's the life you choose, yes.

1485
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,240
He would like go inspect the operations

1486
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,160
and talk to the staff,

1487
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,920
and then we'd walk around Spreckel's Lake

1488
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,600
in Golden Gate Park.

1489
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,080
So one unfortunate day, that is where he collapsed

1490
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,360
and subsequently passed away.

1491
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,280
But he died doing what he loved,

1492
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,280
being up early, saying hi to the family,

1493
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,600
and taking a nice little stroll,

1494
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:09,000
being part of the vibrant city of San Francisco.

1495
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,760
It's at least nice that he passed away

1496
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,560
in a place that was special to him.

1497
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,600
Chairman Emeritus, even after the sale,

1498
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,640
his title was Chairman Emeritus.

1499
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,920
So he was still involved, and yeah, up to his death,

1500
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,960
was checking out the Mother Doe.

1501
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,440
Paying respects.

1502
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,760
And if you wanna pay respects,

1503
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:32,160
he's buried at Holy Cross Catholic Cemetery,

1504
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,360
Colma, San Mateo County in California, USA.

1505
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,720
This is public information,

1506
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,960
I'm not digging this up somewhere.

1507
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,120
It's on Findagrave.

1508
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,800
Findagrave.com.

1509
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,440
Which is, yeah, I forgot that exists,

1510
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,920
and then, oh good, Findagrave.com.

1511
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,360
And you can find a lot of, I mean,

1512
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,520
of course, like Joey, is it Johnny Ramone?

1513
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,720
Johnny Ramone is in Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

1514
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,320
They're both dead.

1515
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:59,440
Yeah, but one of them has like a statue kind of grave.

1516
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,760
Well, find your favorite person's grave, I guess.

1517
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,600
It's quite a bit in Hollywood.

1518
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,840
This is what Jason is advocating.

1519
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,680
I'm saying, like, there's quite a bit in Hollywood.

1520
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:07,520
You can find a lot of graves.

1521
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,360
You can find a lot of graves.

1522
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,200
Grave doxing.

1523
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,360
Jim Morrison is in Paris.

1524
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,200
Jason is grave doxing.

1525
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,000
That's the one in Paris that has all this stuff.

1526
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Yeah, so I don't have anything else about publicity.

1527
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,760
I do have a little bit of a side note.

1528
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,240
I signed up for the Boudin Rewards Club as well.

1529
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,320
Oh, smart, you're getting out of that.

1530
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:29,160
Well, you get one free monthly bread reward.

1531
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,200
Jason.

1532
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,560
Do they send it to you, but you gotta be here.

1533
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,640
You gotta go to the store.

1534
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,040
There's one in Irvine, though.

1535
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,280
Okay. That's not too far.

1536
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,120
Not too bad.

1537
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,680
Huntington, I think, I think is a closer one.

1538
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,520
Oh, is there?

1539
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,920
If that's close, I see now.

1540
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,320
I'm not sure if that's a head or tails.

1541
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,600
So yeah, I'm a Boudin loyalty member now.

1542
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,680
And I think it's just, you have to make a purchase

1543
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,480
and then you get like a free loaf of sourdough.

1544
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,400
Oh, that's great.

1545
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,240
So.

1546
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,160
You're saving 89 cents.

1547
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,120
Yeah.

1548
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,880
Can you think about it?

1549
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,120
You make sense to go up to Huntington.

1550
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:58,960
Sure.

1551
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,800
Or where is Huntington? Down?

1552
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,640
Down.

1553
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,800
To drive all the way, to burn the guest money,

1554
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,120
to go to Huntington Beach.

1555
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,960
Take a bus.

1556
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,360
Buy something and then get free.

1557
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,600
Bottle of water, maybe?

1558
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:12,560
You're keeping it cheap.

1559
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,400
Water and bread.

1560
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,240
And you're purchase.

1561
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,400
Great.

1562
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,360
Water and bread.

1563
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,400
Christ meal.

1564
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,280
Once a month, Jason takes a bus down to Huntington

1565
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,680
and he gets a bottle of water.

1566
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,800
It's a three hour bus.

1567
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,280
And a loaf of sourdough.

1568
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,800
Cause that's how far it is from his house, which is at.

1569
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,640
Okay.

1570
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,480
All right.

1571
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,640
Findahouse.com.

1572
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,480
Again.

1573
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,040
Looking for an address for Everdog Studios,

1574
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,760
as I believe is on their website.

1575
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,080
Don't nail bread to their door though.

1576
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:45,200
Just leave bread in a wrapper that says to Jason.

1577
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,520
Oh, and Sunset Boulevard.

1578
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,680
But really, I mean, it's nice that we know

1579
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,080
about his life story now,

1580
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,560
but really how he'll live on forever

1581
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,680
is in this part of the park.

1582
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:01,600
And I think it, I'm just trying to analyze why we're so,

1583
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,480
became so enamored with him.

1584
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,920
And I think there is some, I mean, he's, he seems so sweet.

1585
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,800
He just seems like pure love from that picture

1586
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,680
that he's holding bread and he's in front

1587
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,160
of a bunch of other bread.

1588
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,400
And I was just imagining a greater scenario.

1589
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,840
Like it made me picture that he lives in like a bread cottage.

1590
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,680
Yeah.

1591
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:23,120
And if you went to visit him, he'd offer you

1592
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:28,120
cocoa boiled from bread served to you in a bread mug.

1593
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,400
Yes. And he writes with a piece of bread.

1594
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,680
He like dips the bread in some bread ink,

1595
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,560
like liquid bread ink.

1596
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,080
Like squeezed at liquid.

1597
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,640
Yeah. Everything he does is bread

1598
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,000
and he lives in a bread village.

1599
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,920
And yeah, I think that's right.

1600
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,000
He has a bread wife.

1601
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,600
He has a wife.

1602
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,960
I think Papa Steve on it makes him sound

1603
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,240
like more of a character as well.

1604
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,360
If it was like, just said Steven.

1605
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,200
Yeah. Yeah.

1606
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,680
It would be like, oh, okay.

1607
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,200
Like we would take a picture with it,

1608
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,840
but I don't think Papa Steven evokes something, you know.

1609
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,760
Yeah. Well, it's like Papa Smurf.

1610
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,480
Like Papa Smurf, yes.

1611
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,880
And by that, if you're extending out from there,

1612
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,480
if he ever wanted to swear,

1613
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,440
he said the word Steve instead.

1614
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,160
Steve.

1615
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,600
That's Steven cat.

1616
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,640
Steven, mother Steaver.

1617
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:19,080
Stay out of my Steven store, you Steve head.

1618
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,200
Yes. Yes.

1619
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,880
He follows Papa Smurf.

1620
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,560
He follows Papa Smurf logic.

1621
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,120
So yeah, I think all of that combined is why.

1622
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:30,960
It's Steve.

1623
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,360
Even Papa Steven wouldn't be this Steve.

1624
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,200
Papa Steven is such a name of a guy.

1625
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,040
I'm Steve.

1626
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,880
Papa Steven is like, I don't know.

1627
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,760
It seems somewhat lascivious to me.

1628
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,000
I immediately, I mean, I'm always thinking of Steven Tyler,

1629
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,440
but it makes me think of Steven Tyler for some reason.

1630
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,440
When I said Steven, I didn't think of Steven Tyler,

1631
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,640
but when you said Papa Steven,

1632
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,480
I thought of Steven Tyler.

1633
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,680
I'm thinking Steven Van Zandt.

1634
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,120
Little, well, he's a little Steven.

1635
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,400
Oh yeah.

1636
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,200
Little Steven also evokes something.

1637
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:02,840
Papa, Papa Steven would have hierarchy on little Steven.

1638
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,680
Certainly.

1639
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,600
Yes. Yes.

1640
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:08,080
Little Steven, yeah, he ranks lower because of the name.

1641
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,840
Papa Steven lives in the house.

1642
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:13,120
Little Steven, of course, in the underground garage.

1643
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,800
Yes.

1644
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,160
Papa Steve wakes up early.

1645
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,680
Little Steven stays at, oh no.

1646
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,520
Yeah.

1647
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,560
No, I'm not going to bed till the sun's coming up.

1648
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,480
He's like, hey, he was a gangster in Norway.

1649
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,320
He's got a-

1650
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,000
Well, sometimes it's always, the sun's always up there.

1651
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:38,320
So yeah, I hope, look, I hope this doesn't go away.

1652
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:42,840
I'm worried that like maybe Marvel will like start to

1653
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,720
go over here in the park.

1654
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:49,480
You would be mad if there was more Marvel and less and not-

1655
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,880
Well, no, I'm a big Marvel fan.

1656
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,920
I'm not going to be mad.

1657
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,800
I'm just hoping that all of Hollywood land area

1658
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,600
goes away before this area goes away.

1659
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,720
I would rather than move that way.

1660
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,840
I would rather, yeah.

1661
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,680
Yeah, totally.

1662
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,520
That's what I'm-

1663
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,120
Because I think you lose a little bit of fun origin now,

1664
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:08,320
like original California adventure with this part.

1665
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,320
This part, I think like still works in California adventure.

1666
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,000
There'd be no reason to do it.

1667
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,960
I think you could, I think it can be one of the last to go,

1668
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,920
but I think if we're getting rides instead of Wharf,

1669
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,480
I think Wharf's got to go.

1670
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,720
I think it's too profitable.

1671
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,560
I think they make too much money.

1672
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,280
I think people do-

1673
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,920
It's ultimately kind of the big,

1674
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,000
like it's sort of the food court essentially.

1675
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,840
Yeah.

1676
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,200
California adventure.

1677
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,360
So obviously like they probably are going to keep it there

1678
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,120
because it's people need to eat,

1679
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,160
but it could be like,

1680
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,480
it could be whatever a different Marvel food court,

1681
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,480
which would seem like a bummer.

1682
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:45,480
Any re-theming to IP food cart, who, what's the point?

1683
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,680
Not for that.

1684
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,080
If you want to put the X-Men's mansion here,

1685
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,480
I'm not going to fight you.

1686
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,880
Do I want a nod to Papa Steve in the X-Men's mansion?

1687
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,800
Yes.

1688
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,640
Yeah.

1689
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,460
Just a little something.

1690
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:00,320
Well, now what they have built in is that anything that goes

1691
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,280
can just end up in the, the Tyvon collection.

1692
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,120
That's true.

1693
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:04,960
Oh wow.

1694
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,800
Tyvon head.

1695
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,640
The mother dough.

1696
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,520
Honestly, I might like that more.

1697
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:13,120
If the bakery had to go and Papa Steve was hanging up

1698
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:13,960
in the line for Guardians.

1699
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,840
Oh man, that would be great.

1700
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,600
Or just like a little like kind of like kitty,

1701
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,160
like in the corner, a little off center,

1702
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,120
like, or in the basement,

1703
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,160
like kind of stacked up on top of something.

1704
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,000
Yeah.

1705
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:28,840
Yeah.

1706
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:29,760
Man, that I love that.

1707
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,560
I think they should just, yeah,

1708
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,200
take it off the wall in the bakery and put it in there now.

1709
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,720
It'll get more people talking.

1710
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:36,560
Yeah.

1711
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:37,400
You'll notice it more.

1712
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,220
Cause you could put, I mean,

1713
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:39,060
you could put it in the line too,

1714
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:43,360
where like the, the old Matterhorn Yeti is,

1715
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,200
or snowman, whatever.

1716
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,680
And then the 20,000 leagues octopus.

1717
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,960
And then there's Papa Steve.

1718
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:50,800
Yeah.

1719
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,800
And then like, mom, who's that guy?

1720
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:57,320
Why that, this is a nod in this ride

1721
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,080
to a famous San Francisco Baker,

1722
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,320
Steven Giroudo.

1723
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,720
Yeah.

1724
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:04,560
Oh wow.

1725
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,640
Stefano Giroudo.

1726
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,280
Stefano Giroudo.

1727
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,160
Sorry, sorry son.

1728
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,120
Stefano Giroudo.

1729
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,280
You got it wrong.

1730
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,000
Colloquially Steve, Papa Steve.

1731
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,920
But as we know him, Papa Steve.

1732
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:16,760
Wow.

1733
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,880
Well, his legend will live on.

1734
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,840
I'm, I'm, I'm sure of that.

1735
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,440
They seriously, now I would,

1736
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,840
if they ever did take down the bakery,

1737
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,600
if they don't put them in the Guardians,

1738
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,760
now I will be mad.

1739
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,880
That is my.

1740
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,800
Have they actually put anything new on Guardian?

1741
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,960
I don't think they have.

1742
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,320
They think they could be doing a lot more.

1743
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,560
They could be doing a lot more.

1744
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,400
Cause they were, yeah,

1745
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,040
acting like they were going to cycle stuff in and out.

1746
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,560
I always say that with everything.

1747
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:42,280
There should really be a face of Khalifa,

1748
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:43,840
the Whoopi Goldberg character.

1749
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,680
Yes.

1750
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:45,520
Golden dreams.

1751
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,360
See, but I, yeah, I think it gets complicated

1752
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:52,080
when it's a person, a public figure, a person.

1753
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:52,980
Yeah.

1754
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:56,480
The resemblance of a person.

1755
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,280
Mike at Dicey.

1756
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,120
Yeah.

1757
01:01:59,120 --> 01:01:59,940
In what regard?

1758
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:00,780
That they have to ask Whoopi?

1759
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:01,620
Yeah, probably.

1760
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:03,880
She loves appearing in theme park attractions.

1761
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:04,720
That's true.

1762
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,440
So gladly they'll, they'll move her over.

1763
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,280
No problem.

1764
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,120
Yeah.

1765
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:08,960
I agree with that.

1766
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,920
They should put some Bugsland stuff in the queue too.

1767
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:12,760
Sure.

1768
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,580
Why not?

1769
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:14,420
Yep.

1770
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:15,260
Strawberry.

1771
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:16,080
Big strawberry.

1772
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:16,920
Strawberry.

1773
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:17,760
Yeah.

1774
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,080
Strawberry for Guardians.

1775
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:19,920
Great.

1776
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,620
Well, until he ascends to his throne

1777
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:25,580
in the Typhoon collection,

1778
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:28,900
Papa Steve resides in the booting bacon.

1779
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,020
And go, you know, go check him out.

1780
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:30,860
Go take a picture with him.

1781
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:31,700
Take a picture.

1782
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:32,540
Send to us.

1783
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,380
Yeah.

1784
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:34,200
Yeah.

1785
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,380
We want to see people enjoying the spirit of good food,

1786
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,860
good bread, good people.

1787
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:41,260
Yeah, please.

1788
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:44,300
And then I will post the photo of Jason with Papa Steve

1789
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,260
and see if I have any more.

1790
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:47,220
You gotta try to find as many as you can.

1791
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:48,060
Yeah.

1792
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,220
I mean, I don't know if we did 10,

1793
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:51,100
but I think we did at least five.

1794
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,100
Yeah.

1795
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,580
But I, on my phone, I only have one.

1796
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:54,420
I must have.

1797
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,240
I'll look too.

1798
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,080
Yeah.

1799
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:56,920
Yeah.

1800
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:57,740
So yeah.

1801
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:02,380
So for bonus content of Jason posing

1802
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:04,100
with a framed photo of an old man,

1803
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:08,620
follow us on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.

1804
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:10,500
They know what they're getting into.

1805
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:11,860
They know if they're here already.

1806
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:12,980
Yeah.

1807
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:16,340
Hey, and keep subscribing to the second gate

1808
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:18,040
right here as you already are.

1809
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:21,220
And I'll leave you with another nice quote

1810
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:23,100
from old Papa Steve.

1811
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:27,500
This is what he said to the guy who took the reins from him.

1812
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,220
He said, don't worry about the ups and downs of the business,

1813
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,780
but if you take care of the bread and the mother dough,

1814
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:36,320
they will take care of you.

1815
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,540
Nice.

1816
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:39,660
Carry that with you.

1817
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:40,660
Yeah.

1818
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:42,740
The mother dough will take care of you.

1819
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:46,100
Mother dough is, may the mother dough be your God.

1820
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:48,820
All hail mother dough.

1821
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:51,860
Kill for mother dough.
