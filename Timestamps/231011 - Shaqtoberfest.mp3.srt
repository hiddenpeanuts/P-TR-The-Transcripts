["The Ride of the Second Gate"]

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,720
Welcome ghouls and goblins and freaks of all kinds.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,080
This is podcast the Ride the Second Gate.

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,920
My name is-

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,280
Well no, it's, well it's haunt cast the freight,

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,120
the cemetery gate.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,960
Shit.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,520
Well that's the risk, I said you do it.

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,120
I know, I said I didn't have anything, so.

11
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,360
Well, at least you can make up for it

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,120
by saying your frightful name.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,440
Frightful Narlson is here.

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,520
Great.

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,160
I'm joined by, of course, Scottlejuice.

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,000
Scottlejuice.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,960
And I'm here with-

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,040
Jagged Slash and Drain.

19
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,800
Jagged Slash and Drain.

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,640
Yeah.

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,160
On the cemetery gate.

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,640
On haunt cast the freight.

23
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,480
That's it.

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,600
Yes.

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,920
Yeah, we're kicking off, not the whole season,

26
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,000
but this is the first cemetery gate

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,960
and I'm excited with where we're starting

28
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,960
because, well, history might be an overreach.

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,440
I don't know about that.

30
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,280
But it is, certainly a pattern has been broken.

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,120
That's right.

32
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,120
Because what this, the haunt cast season has become

33
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,000
is when Mike goes and does haunts because he likes them

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,120
and then he tells us about them when we're not there.

35
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,360
It becomes a show and tell vacation slides.

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,280
But this time I didn't want, I wanted to be in the slides.

37
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,200
Right.

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,160
Literally, if they have them.

39
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,480
And thus, kind of for the first time, right?

40
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,160
I went to a Halloween event.

41
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,760
I went to a haunt with you.

42
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,400
Well, you went to a Halloween event,

43
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,040
but more importantly, you went in multiple-

44
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,880
Multiple.

45
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,600
Multiple mazes with scare actors.

46
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,840
You're absolutely right.

47
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,600
It's the big deal of this episode.

48
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,440
Wow.

49
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,280
You know what, and you're right.

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,120
We were talking when we were parting ways last night

51
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,120
about, well, what am I gonna say?

52
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,520
I don't wanna reveal my opinions

53
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,200
but I felt like my opinions are kinda simple.

54
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,080
And you said, Scott, you were overlooking

55
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,400
the big thing here.

56
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,560
You went in every maze.

57
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,920
I went in every maze.

58
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,760
Every maze.

59
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,360
That this event offered.

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,160
And we have not said the name of the event.

61
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,440
No, it's a big deal too.

62
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,440
The event is why I could not stay away from this.

63
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,440
I don't hear the name Halloween Horror Nights and laugh.

64
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,440
I don't giggle when I hear not scary farm.

65
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,920
Maybe I would in the seven, but you know,

66
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,800
when it was new, probably got laughs out of people.

67
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,920
Barry is scary.

68
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,520
But anyway, I just so enamored was I

69
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,880
with the phrase Shacktoberfest.

70
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,720
Oh, I tell you-

71
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,640
How could I possibly stay away?

72
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,480
So good.

73
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,320
It's good.

74
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,120
I mean, you're a big diesel stan.

75
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,600
You love the DJ.

76
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,440
You love the-

77
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,280
Absolutely.

78
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,000
You like Thoughty's on the Floor.

79
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,720
His song, one of his many songs

80
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,720
where he's driving a Mack truck.

81
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,320
Yeah, Thoughty's on the Floor, sure.

82
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,160
That's right.

83
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,080
And I never cared for the song,

84
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,560
That's How I Beat Shack,

85
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,040
because I don't wanna hear about that.

86
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,920
I don't wanna hear about anybody beating Shack,

87
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,360
even if it's a child's fantasy.

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,880
So that's on the band.

89
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,160
That was on my do not playlist at my wedding.

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,840
Sure.

91
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,880
I know DJ, you're gonna be tempted to play

92
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,240
That's How I Beat Shack, but not tonight.

93
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,080
Not on my watch.

94
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,320
Your wedding speech was just reading

95
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,320
the dozens of franchises that Shack has.

96
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,280
Like a few Papa John's, a few-

97
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,840
We're gonna get a little bit into that,

98
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,480
but yeah, for sure.

99
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,840
Shack is one of, I was saying this,

100
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,720
I love his strategy as far as getting associated with brands.

101
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,680
It doesn't feel so calculated like a rock.

102
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,520
You know, like a rock-

103
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,200
Well, I heard you saying this last night.

104
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,720
Where there's like an attempt to like,

105
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,400
if he's developing it from the ground up,

106
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,960
that is gonna be a luxury brand

107
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,560
if he's attaching himself to something that exists already.

108
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,400
He's tweeting-

109
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,240
To the best there is.

110
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,560
He's tweeting like statistics about the water,

111
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,760
or the energy drink he has today.

112
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,320
And you're like, this sucks.

113
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,000
Like, this is so annoying.

114
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,560
Like, just like, Shack is just like, what do you got?

115
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,640
Okay, general, great, got it.

116
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,680
Video game, I'm a fighting superstar, great, done.

117
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,600
Like, that's so much more fun than kind of this like,

118
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,240
really calculated version of like,

119
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,880
world domination in a way.

120
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,640
I think he does like, the ultimate big ticket

121
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,200
blockbuster version of like,

122
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,760
yeah, how this all started, which is like, you know,

123
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,920
a retired football player endorses a used car lot.

124
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,760
Yes.

125
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,480
He just, he doesn't do that.

126
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,320
That's not what it is.

127
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,240
He does the biggest brand version,

128
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,400
a Shack sized used car lot.

129
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,360
Yes, that's perfect, yes, I love it.

130
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,800
It's brands of the people, I think.

131
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,360
I agree, and especially doing something like this,

132
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,360
which can't be, this can't be a massive moneymaker for Shack.

133
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,240
I'm sure it makes some money, but it's not like,

134
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,480
this is not a theme park that people go to year round.

135
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,800
Well, and especially when you add up

136
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,640
how much time he's putting into it.

137
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,280
I mean, maybe the number would look good on paper,

138
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,120
but once you add it up, all the many hours,

139
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,640
and you'll listen, you'll understand when we explain

140
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,920
the level of Shack presence that is so evident

141
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,560
in every beat of Shack Doverfest.

142
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,400
Of course.

143
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,200
So it ends up being less than a minimum wage for him

144
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,040
once you add it all up.

145
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,320
That's true, so. Sure.

146
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,840
But yeah, I have a list of some of them,

147
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,160
we'll talk, we can talk about later,

148
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,160
but really what it is is right next to the Queen Mary

149
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,520
in Long Beach.

150
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,080
Some might say the parking lot next to the Queen Mary.

151
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,120
You could call it that.

152
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,360
Kind of. Kind of, yeah.

153
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,480
It's pavement for sure.

154
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,400
Using the Queen Mary as a backdrop.

155
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,960
Yes, the historic ship in Long Beach, California.

156
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,480
My old stomping ground,

157
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,800
which I used to one of our first trip reports.

158
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,960
One of the first second gates ever, yes,

159
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,760
was your little trip to. Venturing,

160
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,680
found the Queen Mary on the Chase Travel Store,

161
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,840
and learned it was incredibly cheap

162
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,640
because they had not really updated the rooms.

163
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,120
Now, I believe there is a new owner,

164
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,040
they have redone the room somewhat.

165
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,480
They still lease a good amount of the ship

166
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,240
to haunted tours and haunted events.

167
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,160
Yeah. Especially this time of year.

168
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,000
Like Shacktoberfest.

169
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,040
Such as Shacktoberfest.

170
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,800
This was done out of the remnants,

171
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,680
the pre-COVID remnants of another event called Dark Harbor,

172
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,120
which I never made it to,

173
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,680
but you can guess some aspects of it,

174
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,520
I would say from the title,

175
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,400
that the nautical theme will be very strong,

176
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,800
and then this will be a lot of dead men of the sea,

177
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,640
Yes.

178
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,400
and perhaps pirates and such.

179
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,000
You can picture all this.

180
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,040
And somebody, some visionary came and said,

181
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,240
all right, yes, all of that Queen Mary, yes, pirates, yes,

182
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,360
but how about also Shack?

183
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,960
Okay, well, do we scale back some of the pre-exist?

184
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,080
No, no, we just put Shack also there.

185
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,640
Yes, and then we add things to Shack,

186
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,720
like that, oh, he's a captain now.

187
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,560
Yes.

188
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,560
Shack also has a nautical past.

189
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,560
In some cases, it's like an evil Shack or a monster Shack,

190
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,240
but in others, it is a living, regular captain Shack.

191
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,080
Right.

192
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,280
If I could ask for a spoiler, any general representation?

193
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,120
Do you see that?

194
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,040
I was talking to Anthony Geo on text,

195
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,480
and he asked the exact same question,

196
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,680
is there any general around?

197
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,680
And no, the answer, not that I saw.

198
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,600
They're becoming, they're inseparable now.

199
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,440
It's like Conan talks about he can't go anywhere without,

200
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,960
being asked about Jordan Schlansky, his foil,

201
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,960
and that's, I think, Shack and the general,

202
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,800
instead, they're a classic comedy team now.

203
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,720
Yeah, it's time for another wave.

204
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,240
It's time for another wave of Shack and general.

205
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,640
I hope, I mean, unless it's over

206
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,040
and he's moved on to a different insurance, I don't know.

207
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,080
It could be.

208
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,920
Who knows?

209
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,200
We haven't even talked about the real Mazes,

210
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,600
but if you were to get the general,

211
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,880
I mean, it makes sense.

212
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,360
I don't know what he's the general of,

213
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,360
but there's some kind of military enlistment feel

214
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,720
to some of what we did.

215
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,680
Absolutely.

216
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,760
So seeing kind of, I guess I don't wanna see him dead.

217
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,280
Because that's what I'm flashing to, is kind of a zombified,

218
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,040
but I don't wanna see that little body splayed out.

219
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,880
I don't wanna, that would make me so sad.

220
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,120
You're saying see the general dead.

221
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,240
I don't wanna see the general, yeah,

222
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,280
I don't wanna see the general's corpse.

223
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,920
Can you imagine if you look down

224
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,160
and saw that little body on the ground?

225
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,080
No, my boy!

226
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,480
The audience doesn't know what we're talking about.

227
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,520
The general is an insurance,

228
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,200
is that the name of the insurance, the general?

229
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,880
Or like the general insurance?

230
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,240
And there's like a little CGI man who's kind of tiny

231
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,880
that Shack interacts with on these commercials.

232
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,200
And he's like, I don't know,

233
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,480
he looks like almost a cereal box mascot.

234
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah, he's a little CG character.

235
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,760
I think the Haunt would be about bad car insurance.

236
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,600
Because you can do parodies of other companies,

237
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,400
like Quicksilver is Mercury, No State is All State.

238
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,720
And he's showing you what happens.

239
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,840
He's showing you what happens.

240
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,200
We could add, if the Shacktoberfest team

241
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,040
could add you next year.

242
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,880
Is it like, Geico is like Blecho.

243
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,720
Yeah, that's good.

244
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,240
Like Mad Magazine would do it.

245
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,640
And he shows you the dangers of poor car insurance.

246
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
Wow, wow.

247
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,400
Which is like, well, all right,

248
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,320
as you started saying that, I was flashing to like,

249
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,240
what you guys have described, these horrible things

250
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,000
that you see at pre-prom, like the warnings about drinking

251
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,360
and driving, where bodies have gone through the windshield.

252
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,200
I was flashing to that,

253
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,640
but then I was like, that doesn't make sense.

254
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,240
That wouldn't make, the insurance wouldn't make you

255
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,200
go through the windshield.

256
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,200
So a scene of insurance going badly is just somebody with,

257
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,560
somebody who suffocates in a house of their own bills.

258
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,480
Okay, that's more. The bills are piled up so high,

259
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,880
they get them so frequently that it falls on them

260
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,040
and then just, you know, you see just like one toe.

261
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,880
Just like flicker in a little.

262
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,680
Which is a wicked witch from, with the laws.

263
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,040
Like the last, you're watching a man suffocate

264
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,280
under his own pile of insurance bills.

265
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,400
Yes, yes, that's good, yeah.

266
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,520
Yeah, pretty scary.

267
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,280
So then that would be a good way to make some more money

268
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,240
is to get all the other Shack endorsements involved.

269
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,920
I mean, we're blue-skying already.

270
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,480
I don't even know, when I was there last time,

271
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,400
I thought this is perfect.

272
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,360
This doesn't need anything to be upgraded,

273
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,240
but now this is a good idea.

274
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,080
Yeah, it's really good.

275
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,000
And then you do the signups right then and there.

276
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,280
A lot of these, you know, I think there's a pretty like,

277
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,640
we haven't talked about this much on the show,

278
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,320
but there's a pretty, like, there's product placement

279
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,520
in parks and then there's the very brazen,

280
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,640
here sign up for a credit card

281
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,040
while you're here in Universal Studios or whatever.

282
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,960
I don't think anybody's incentivized to do that,

283
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,120
but if you go through a maze

284
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,360
and you're scared into doing it,

285
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,920
I'm signing up for whatever that is.

286
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah, I mean, we got in, I mean,

287
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,040
I guess we could talk about it.

288
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,080
We got asked the question in the middle

289
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,760
of the last maze we went on too.

290
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,600
Yeah, that's right.

291
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,000
And like, I was willing to do whatever that person said

292
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,080
in that moment too.

293
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,040
So like, if they were just like,

294
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,000
hey, sign up for this credit card

295
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,040
or sign up for this insurance, I go, okay, yeah, where?

296
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,600
And I just like fill it out real quick and do it.

297
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,360
So it gets you out of there sooner,

298
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,040
because if you're here and like,

299
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,840
also like there's big like noises and metal hits,

300
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,400
I'm like, okay, better write fast, but also legibly,

301
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,320
don't wanna get my address wrong.

302
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,320
So for sure.

303
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,360
Well, agreed.

304
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,640
That's, you know, sorry to have a plus up right away,

305
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,240
but yeah, of course, General would be great,

306
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,840
but you know, something to dream about

307
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,040
for Shacktoberfest three,

308
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,200
because this is the second year of it, I believe.

309
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,200
It all reset in COVID, Dark Harbor, goodbye.

310
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,800
I don't know how Shack came to be a part of this,

311
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,320
but I'm so glad he is.

312
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,800
I'm so glad he threw his hat.

313
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,880
From the moment we walked up to it, I go, oh, this is great.

314
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,080
Like I thought it was gonna think it was less great,

315
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,000
but enjoy it.

316
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,880
But as soon as we got up, I go, oh, this is wonderful.

317
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,240
Yeah. I really, okay,

318
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
because if you're not in Los Angeles

319
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,160
and you haven't seen billboards,

320
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,880
probably the smaller billboards,

321
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,760
they didn't spring for the, you know,

322
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,960
if you've seen some of those, you know,

323
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,400
the half-size billboards advertising this, you know,

324
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,480
maybe you just see the word Shacktoberfest,

325
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,160
but maybe you see,

326
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,080
I'd say the main way he's contributed to this experience,

327
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,240
which is a photo of him holding his hand out,

328
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,080
and then a very like digital cliparty Jack Lantern

329
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,280
is putting his hand.

330
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,120
Yes.

331
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
And then you see this and you think, all right,

332
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,840
graphic design leaves something to be desired.

333
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,640
And also, I'm not sure I understand how this ties together.

334
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,720
What is this?

335
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't know that I've previously associated Shack

336
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,360
with being some kind of master of horror.

337
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,400
So, how's this gonna work?

338
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,880
And I'm fully prepping.

339
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,120
This also helps get me in the door, right?

340
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,280
I'm like, well, then we can do one of those episodes

341
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,000
where we go to a hokey thing, we poke fun at it,

342
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,680
and we park, we're led to our parking by nothing

343
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,000
but very young teenagers.

344
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,280
Okay, the first thing is we drive in

345
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,840
and there's different like attendance

346
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,520
scanning tickets for parking.

347
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,960
And I make a note that everyone literally looks 15 to 17.

348
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,880
These people look under 18.

349
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,000
So, it's completely, this part is staffed by teens

350
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,120
and real like not 19 year olds, absolutely like 16 year olds.

351
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,800
Long Beach High School's finest temporary seasonal workers.

352
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,440
Yeah, and they're all wearing big like the vests

353
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,480
that are reflectors on them.

354
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,440
But they all look too big.

355
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,320
They all look like they're not fitted correctly

356
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,080
because of their undersized teenage bodies.

357
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,400
So, that's the first note.

358
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,160
So, you start to think, all right,

359
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,760
I see where this is going.

360
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,600
It's gonna be a dumb thing full of teens.

361
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,600
And then you scan your way in, you head into security line

362
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,400
and it all changes when you see the entrance,

363
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,800
which is a big inflatable scary shack.

364
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,520
It's huge, a giant, Jason, I'll show you a photo of this.

365
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,960
Yeah, it is so big.

366
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,560
And immediately, if you aren't delighted by this,

367
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,960
I don't know what's wrong with you.

368
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,040
There would be no way you couldn't be delighted by this.

369
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,880
Yeah, immediately heart melted, get it.

370
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,640
I'm like, I don't know,

371
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,480
shack and horror, how do these tie together?

372
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,520
One look, okay, he's holding a big pumpkin in one hand,

373
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,760
he's got a big like crazy battle ax in the other

374
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,320
and he looks a little vampire-ish.

375
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,880
He's very imposing.

376
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,800
He's grown twice his regular size at least.

377
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,640
Two and a half.

378
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,040
He is large. It's perfect.

379
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,680
Right off the bat, he's got a strange neck cowl.

380
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,200
This thing shut me up.

381
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,920
I'm in, here we go.

382
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,680
I haven't even set foot in the place

383
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,840
and Shacktoberfest is off to a killer start.

384
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,200
And you can see there's a tunnel

385
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,600
inside this big inflatable thing that you walk through

386
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,000
and it's got fog and it's got lights already.

387
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,320
It's a big pumpkin.

388
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,200
There's a bunch of dried ghoulish pumpkins

389
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,000
and then orange lights flashing up and down the hallway.

390
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,600
It's super foggy, very like choir,

391
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,880
dark choir kind of music.

392
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,120
Pretty great in right away.

393
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,120
Yeah, and the vibe is right immediately as well

394
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,560
whereas I felt like, okay, it does,

395
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,720
this is the haunt vibe too.

396
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,120
This is the legit haunt like nots or anything else.

397
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,320
Immediately it didn't feel so cheap in these places.

398
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,200
This is important.

399
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,480
I was leaning on you to provide context

400
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,960
because I'm certainly looking at it like,

401
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,800
I don't know, to me, I don't do these things.

402
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,480
This seems pretty all right.

403
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,160
And when I'm checking notes with you and you're like,

404
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,720
no, this is a real deal.

405
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,920
We got a real haunt on our hands.

406
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,440
Right, yes, and I wasn't thinking

407
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,680
it would be like that at all.

408
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,600
So I underestimated it and immediately,

409
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,720
I mean, I don't know if it's maybe the hardest thing to do

410
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,400
is throw up some orange lights

411
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,440
and fill a hallway with fog, but they did it.

412
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,160
And I immediately was like, okay, all right.

413
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,120
They sure did.

414
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,600
And now, all right, still,

415
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,520
I'm gonna find an issue here if I can.

416
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,640
Shaq's likenesses, that's one thing.

417
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,040
He did a photo shoot last year,

418
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,840
probably not again this year.

419
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,960
That's okay, but I really wanna feel Shaq's essence in this.

420
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,120
And once we've made our way through the tunnel,

421
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,520
we start hearing the welcome messages.

422
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,040
Oh, the welcome messages are so good.

423
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,040
We were so delighted by this.

424
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,320
And I don't know, I didn't say,

425
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,760
it's funny, because sometimes this happens

426
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,600
and I look around and I'm waiting for every other person

427
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,160
there to just be like, yeah, cheer, yeah.

428
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,240
And that was not necessarily happening.

429
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,320
But yes, Shaq has several pre-recorded messages.

430
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,440
I don't think he's doing them live,

431
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,080
like the Disneyland announcers from home or anything.

432
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,960
But he has several spooky announcements to make

433
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,920
as you enter through his inflatable body.

434
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,840
I've written down the copy on the,

435
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,080
you never knew when they were gonna hit,

436
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,640
so I didn't get the best video of it,

437
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,520
because you just would have had to been filming

438
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,400
for five straight minutes.

439
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,920
But allow me to try my best.

440
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,280
Calling all zombies in the flesh.

441
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,320
Come trick or treat on the Halloween trails,

442
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,640
play some games, and party the night away with me

443
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,680
at the ultimate Halloween one-stop shop at Shaqtoberfest.

444
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,600
Great, I feel so welcomed now.

445
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,840
Yes, and it's Walex music playing underneath it.

446
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,400
And yes, it's great.

447
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,240
I wish they were fat.

448
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,880
The only note I have is I just wish it was

449
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,240
every minute.

450
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,760
So constantly, yes.

451
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,120
Because we were waiting for more of it,

452
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,640
and it was taking forever.

453
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,840
Another copy.

454
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,600
Hey, I'm so delighted by these.

455
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,520
Hey, I see all you monsters looking good.

456
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,120
We got games, we got candy, food, and drinks,

457
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,760
and we got a Shaq-sized Halloween party

458
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,400
waiting just for you in.

459
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,440
Yeah, great. So happy.

460
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,840
And now you just, there's an essence there.

461
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,080
It doesn't matter if he, I'm assuming at this point

462
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,360
he's not there in person.

463
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,200
Yes, it did.

464
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,720
But he put more of his stamp on it.

465
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,280
It set the table for it.

466
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,280
And like, not all of the grounds are as good as this area.

467
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,120
No.

468
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,480
But just having that first moment going in,

469
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,400
like over here, really elevates everything else.

470
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,360
And you find that, of course,

471
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,280
this man is very passionate about the Halloween season.

472
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,200
Well, that's what he said.

473
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,880
I heard him say it with his own voice.

474
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,480
You know the Shaq man.

475
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,520
Nothing the Shaq man loves more than creeps and ghouls.

476
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,440
Honestly, my life and entrepreneurship has taken me

477
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,520
in such a way that I can't be here every night.

478
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,560
And it drives me crazy inside.

479
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,640
I'm tearing my hair out

480
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,800
that I can't be there with you in person.

481
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,840
Because if it were up to me,

482
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,160
if I didn't already commit to all these other things,

483
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,280
I'd be right there with you doing the Thriller dance,

484
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,840
seeing DJ Lovecraft.

485
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,920
Watching DJ Lovecraft spin on his turntables

486
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,920
that uses a little bone.

487
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,600
If you know one thing about me, so now I get it.

488
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,960
The man loves his horror, he loves his tricks and traits.

489
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,280
I mean, we are adjacent to Los Angeles,

490
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,920
where he played for a long time.

491
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,840
I think there's warm memories there.

492
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,960
He's one fourth of the NBA on TNT panel,

493
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,640
which is a very fun show.

494
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,520
I feel like there's not a show like that

495
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,280
for football or baseball.

496
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,000
I will check in on the NBA on TNT if I'm flipping channels.

497
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You got Barkley.

498
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,760
You got Barkley, you got Kenny Smith.

499
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,480
Again, I can't tell you how much I would love

500
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,600
to not be there for the entire month of October.

501
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,400
I petitioned the league to not start the season

502
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,200
until Halloween season is over.

503
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,760
I said, look, I'm gonna be so miserable

504
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,920
and do a bad job for you

505
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,120
if I don't have a jack-o-lantern in my hand.

506
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,120
Yeah, I wish, I mean, I don't watch it,

507
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,240
so maybe that is what he's saying, we don't know.

508
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,800
Yeah, yeah, if you really, if you would just watch his face,

509
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,360
you will see Sheck's inner sadness.

510
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,600
His mind is drifting to Halloween.

511
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,000
If only I was in my own, I have my own hideaway

512
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,240
in Long Beach and I'm nowhere near it.

513
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,600
Captain Sheck's hideaway is unmoored without a captain.

514
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm letting everyone down.

515
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,960
The first mate is taking the ship

516
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,680
and I don't trust the first mate

517
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,800
to give the little shots of rum,

518
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,560
the confusing shots of rum.

519
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,600
I wanna be in there.

520
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,880
When people walk in, I want to be towering

521
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,960
over the hideaway bar, handing people.

522
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,400
Yeah, he wants to be at the event

523
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,840
and then he's gotta rest up for November 1st

524
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,720
when all the candy's half-price.

525
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,640
And then if there's one thing I love more,

526
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,200
I'd say, all right, my interests, number three,

527
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,040
basketball, number two, tricks and treats,

528
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,360
and number one, great deals.

529
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,880
Great deals, you don't have that many franchises

530
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,800
and business endeavors if you're not like a deal guy.

531
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,920
Sure, yeah.

532
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,760
Yeah, he would, Sheck would be comfortable

533
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,560
with the amount of deals I get sent to,

534
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,720
my Twitter sends a DM to me or a text.

535
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,520
Very impressed, we're cut from the same cloth.

536
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,680
Yeah, he would understand.

537
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,400
Now, again, it was hard for me to get video

538
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,320
of those announcements, but there was,

539
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,920
I just found on the YouTube channel,

540
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,920
this is a video he made promoting this whole thing

541
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,560
last year, just so you get the real deal voice.

542
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,400
And this is gonna be a little confusing for the listener

543
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,080
because at some point, his voice will change.

544
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,720
I think it's provoked by a throat clear,

545
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,520
but when you hear this, know that it is still Sheck

546
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,120
mouthing some words, but a different voice is coming out.

547
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
So here's this.

548
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,320
It's me, Sheck, this year, I am taking over

549
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,440
Southern California for my own twist on Halloween

550
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,940
at Shacktoberfest!

551
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,120

00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,160
Shacktoberfest.

555
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,400
Tickets go on sale soon.

556
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,880
Sorry about that.

557
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,880
That, interesting, my takeaway from that is that

558
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,440
he clears his throat to do a scary voice,

559
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,560
but the scary voice is easily much less scary

560
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,240
than his regular voice.

561
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,560
Well, right, it's like as if it would be like,

562
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,680
ah, hello there or something, like some really nasty Halloween.

563
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,840
You gotta go more in the demonic, like mangled direction

564
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,280
because there's no voice deeper than Shack.

565
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,840
You can't, this would work if it was,

566
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,640
Hey, hi, my name.

567
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,480
It was Rip Taylor.

568
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,600
Rip Taylorfest.

569
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,440
Yeah, that's true.

570
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,280
Rip Taperfest.

571
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,440
Oh, that's the only way it could have been better.

572
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,720
As if it was Riptober, Rip Taylorfest, yeah.

573
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,500
The confetti's gonna be spooky!

574
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,520
Only in October do I drop orange and black.

575
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,200
I save it all.

576
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,240
You're gonna get it all blasted right in your face.

577
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,440
Excuse me.

578
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,760
You're going to get the spookiest confetti you've ever seen.

579
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,520
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

580
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,240
But Shack, it's a flawed premise,

581
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,960
in otherwise a perfectly executed thing.

582
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,000
Shack's presence can also be felt in something

583
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,280
that we missed, which is the block party.

584
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,000
I regret that we've missed this.

585
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,520
It's called the witching hour, maybe.

586
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,120
It says this ghoulish spectacle is not to be missed.

587
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,280
Shack will call upon his minions to rise from their graves,

588
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,080
slide into the streets, and escape the dark,

589
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,200
damp corridors of the ship to celebrate Halloween.

590
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,200
This only happens once a night, so don't be late, or else.

591
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,160
What time is it happen, does it say?

592
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,720
30 minutes after the festival opens.

593
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,880
So we were there.

594
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,520
Because it starts at eight?

595
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,720
Yeah, but we were there.

596
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,600
How did we miss that?

597
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,320
Well, we were waiting for our pals.

598
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,720
We were waiting for.

599
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,480
I guess that's what we were doing.

600
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,200
Andrew Coth, recent guest and friend of the show,

601
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,920
his friend Brian, and the ultimate friend of the show,

602
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,720
Buzz Buzz Skittle Scattle.

603
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,520
Bugmane was in the house.

604
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,600
Bugmane was never going to miss Shack Doberfest.

605
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,840
It was a great group.

606
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,640
So what that's describing is a very common thing

607
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,320
that happens at all.

608
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,160
I don't know actually if it happens at Horror Nights,

609
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,520
but it definitely happens at Nott's Heft,

610
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,040
definitely happens at Six Flags,

611
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,360
where they unleash the monsters, where the haunts starts.

612
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,120
And it's always a big fun event.

613
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,640
So we should have made a note to see that,

614
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,280
but I wanted to see what that looks like.

615
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,240
Because that's always pretty fun,

616
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,560
because there's a little performance.

617
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,880
Nott's does it where a witch is on the mountain outside

618
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,320
and then it goes town and makes declarations

619
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,320
and says we're all going to die and stuff.

620
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,760
And then a parade of sliders, right?

621
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,000
And then a parade of sliders.

622
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And Six Flags, very similar.

623
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,440
So I wonder what the Shack version looked like.

624
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,320
I mean, I think maybe that had a little bit more pre-recorded.

625
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,240
Goblins, ghoulies.

626
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,440
He like calls upon them all and unleashes them.

627
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,000
Damn, now I'm upset.

628
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,120
Your captain is speaking.

629
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,400
Disembark.

630
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,840
This is part of the Queen Mary's 2023 reopening celebration.

631
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,080
You're all gonna die.

632
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,040
You're all going to be killed by my goblins.

633
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,520
This is Shack and I can't wait for you all to die.

634
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,360
Ha ha ha.

635
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,640
I've killed the general.

636
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,600
His little body is strewn about.

637
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,080
Shack is allowed to hold up the general's head.

638
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,920
That's okay.

639
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,200
I want it to be somebody.

640
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,000
If the general's gonna die,

641
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,520
it should be at the hands of somebody he loves.

642
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,760
There can only be one.

643
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,880
Ha ha ha.

644
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
Come on, you knew this was where this was going

645
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,320
when this campaign started.

646
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,360
So missed that, but then we're, all right,

647
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,560
we've made our way through the pumpkin portal.

648
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,160
Now we're in the first area,

649
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,160
which is called Shipwreck Graveyard.

650
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,600
This feature is a big water tower that says Diesel on it.

651
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,040
And there's a bar called Diesel's Boathouse.

652
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,560
Shack Diesel, DJ Diesel.

653
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,560
That's Shack's nickname or moniker.

654
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,680
I have to admit, I didn't know about DJ Diesel.

655
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,480
Is this a literal DJ?

656
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,320
Yeah.

657
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,160
Yeah, he spins.

658
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,000
This is what he goes by.

659
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,960
Yeah, I was asking if he was gonna DJ at the DJ stage,

660
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,560
but I don't think he has.

661
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,400
And like, if you look up DJ, like it's-

662
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
Who are you asking?

663
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,240
Well, I assume I was asking one of you, but maybe.

664
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,200
Maybe it was a ghost.

665
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,000
I didn't ask an employee.

666
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,400
I guess I assumed he'd either be at the opening

667
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,480
or closing DJing.

668
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,120
He DJ'd at, there was a Phillies game this summer

669
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,680
and your admission ticket to the game came with

670
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,280
free admission to the DJ Diesel set on the field afterwards.

671
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,120
Wow. Yeah.

672
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,000
So that is part of the whole thing.

673
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,640
But like, he's got some, I was looking it up,

674
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,360
he's got big crowds he DJs to.

675
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,040
He's at Fort Worth and I think maybe,

676
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,400
no offense to Shacktoberfest,

677
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,520
this crowd is not big enough to warrant

678
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,960
the actual DJ Diesel to show up.

679
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,800
Possibly not.

680
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,520
He was DJing at a win in Macau.

681
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,360
Whoa. Wow.

682
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,840
So this is a big crowd, this is in Fort Worth.

683
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,680
My God.

684
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,520
And I was like, that, I was like,

685
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,040
oh man, that would be great if he was here.

686
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,160
But literally, you know, this is about

687
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,640
a hundred times more people than were at

688
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,040
Shacktoberfest last night.

689
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,520
Yes.

690
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,960
Now this speaks to something that really helped me

691
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,080
to enjoy this event, that this was not

692
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,400
packed to the gills.

693
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,920
Yes, sure. I wonder if a little more

694
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,880
on a Friday or Saturday, we went on a Thursday,

695
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,200
which maybe like off timed it a little bit.

696
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,240
So I liked that.

697
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,800
This has been a hesitation about haunts for me.

698
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,560
If I am going to, if I'm gonna wait in a line

699
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,600
for something, for a maze, something I don't

700
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,040
inherently naturally wanna do,

701
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,200
and then I got a big line and then every like

702
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,680
inch of the place is crowded and it's tough to get drinks

703
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,960
and everything, you know, that's gonna

704
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,280
deter me in future haunt situations.

705
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,560
But this was, I guess I like one that is

706
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,960
fairly sparsely attended.

707
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,760
It's interesting, cause like, I know you,

708
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,200
I know what you mean by that, cause like

709
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,040
sometimes the crowds if you're outside get overwhelming.

710
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,760
But I would say that when you got a crowd

711
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,320
even going into a maze, it's actually less scary

712
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,640
because of how many, like we actually got kind of like

713
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,800
little solo groups to do these mazes.

714
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,240
And when you're at Horror Nights and it's like

715
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,960
a pretty big line, it's much more of like,

716
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,760
you're walking single file with a whole group.

717
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,000
So it's almost like you're missing more scares.

718
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,880
You're not getting direct scares a lot that way.

719
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,720
Really?

720
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,360
So you're saying what I experienced was scarier.

721
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,400
In some ways it was, cause like we were like,

722
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,560
there was a point in the last maze where like,

723
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,480
I think you three were back and I was with a bug upfront.

724
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,040
And we were just getting every scare.

725
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,680
There was no one in front of us, no one behind,

726
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,080
which that actually ends up stressing me out a little more.

727
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,200
Not sure. Not so much, but like more because

728
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,760
yeah, on Horror Nights, you can kind of go behind somebody.

729
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,920
You can kind of adjust your speed a little bit.

730
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,840
And then you're getting every other scare,

731
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,360
every third scare, like, and then you could see,

732
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,360
oh, a scare just happened.

733
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:31,360
So like in a way you did a scarier version of it last night.

734
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,280
In a way, did I do the scariest version of it?

735
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,120
Is this the scariest?

736
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,960
I don't know if I would go that far, but.

737
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,880
Well, you know what? I will.

738
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,680
I did the scariest haunt there is.

739
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,520
That's fair.

740
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,400
Shacktoberfest.

741
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,280
The last one we did was scarier.

742
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,920
The scariest haunt there is, says theme park journalist.

743
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,040
Disney Daddy.

744
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,080
Haunt X Disney, award-winning Disney Daddy,

745
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,920
and Haunt X-Part.

746
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,640
Haunt Daddy, Scott Kierner.

747
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,640
Award-winning Haunt Daddy.

748
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,000
It's my DJ name.

749
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,080
You want to change the Wikipedia to that.

750
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,280
Just for Halloween.

751
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,800
People don't do Halloween layovers

752
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,760
on their own Wikipedias, and I think they should.

753
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,280
Yeah, for this month, you're the Haunt Daddy.

754
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,960
Haunt Daddy.

755
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,640
They should enable green fonts,

756
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,760
little cobwebs up in the corner.

757
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,800
I would donate to Wikipedia if they asked for that.

758
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,080
They ask for donations all the time,

759
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,920
and I'm like, well, how many cobwebs and spiders

760
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,840
you putting on the page for Halloween?

761
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,320
How many Haunt Daddies he got?

762
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,840
Three single ghosts with three Caspers each.

763
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,560
Three dead kids, right?

764
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,400
We all have three.

765
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,800
Well, we're all in the ghost family.

766
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,960
We're the Haunt Daddies.

767
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,040
Only for Halloween.

768
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,880
Only for Halloween.

769
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,880
Disney Daddy switched to be the Haunt Daddies.

770
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,720
Yeah, well, it doesn't have the alliteration,

771
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,880
but it's still pretty good.

772
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,720
It happened again.

773
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,600
Our three sons died again.

774
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,440
For October.

775
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,280
All of us?

776
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,120
Just October, though.

777
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,960
Just October.

778
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,120
Nine.

779
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,520
Yeah, we had to bring nine sons back

780
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,440
at the wishing hour on the 31st.

781
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,280
I will say this, though.

782
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,640
Some of the mazes, there was one maze in particular

783
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,040
where the monsters were very casual.

784
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,840
Well, love that.

785
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,680
And they were just like.

786
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,500
I don't remember which one.

787
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,520
I felt like a not, you know,

788
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,360
I didn't feel like any of it was so aggro.

789
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,120
No, it wasn't.

790
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,560
Which was the casual one?

791
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,400
The one outside when we went to,

792
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,560
what was the pumpkin patch or whatever it was

793
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,720
where we go through that one where they were

794
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,120
like shining ravelites on us and like dancing.

795
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,920
That was breezy online.

796
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,680
It's open air.

797
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,560
A lot of this was open air,

798
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,080
which I said that does make actually

799
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,400
a little less stressful.

800
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
Because when we were inside

801
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,560
and there's a little more like tight quarters.

802
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,000
Oh yeah, there's the one where they like

803
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,240
kind of funnel you through a coffin.

804
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,800
Like if you go through the coffin shape,

805
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,120
but then that the tunnel always has the coffin dimensions.

806
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,720
Like the angular nature of it.

807
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,560
Yeah.

808
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,040
Well, you don't get something that's,

809
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,920
a pumpkin patch I feel like is immediately calming.

810
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,760
Well, maybe a regular pumpkin patch,

811
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,760
but here we're dealing with a diesel's pumpkin patch.

812
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,560
This is one where apparently it was touted

813
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,400
that he programmed the mix.

814
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,760
Like DJ Diesel prepared the set list.

815
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,000
Well, I would hope so.

816
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,280
Yeah, yeah, that's the least he could do.

817
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,200
It is his pumpkin patch.

818
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,040
I believe.

819
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,400
Remember we heard DMX?

820
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,240
Yeah, I was trying to remember what it was.

821
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,080
I might have always packed that ass up, but it's not.

822
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,920
No, it was DMX.

823
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,880
It was y'all gonna make me lose my mind up in here.

824
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,880
Oh, okay, yeah.

825
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,280
Kind of like a remix with sort of like melted sometimes.

826
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,760
Up in here.

827
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,760
Yeah, I can't remember if that was because of the DJ

828
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,120
or if that was playing on a different speaker.

829
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,000
There were like separate areas

830
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,920
with separate types of music playing as well.

831
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,680
That didn't seem to bleed that much.

832
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,520
No.

833
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,360
I was impressed by that.

834
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,680
For a temporary event.

835
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,720
But anyway, you're right.

836
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,400
You would think, and it actually do a good job of this,

837
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,360
I think, that it does seem like

838
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,560
a regular family fun pumpkin patch.

839
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,320
But what you don't realize, especially until,

840
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,360
you especially don't realize it

841
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,120
until you look at the website later,

842
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,280
things are very amiss at this pumpkin patch

843
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,160
because the story of this.

844
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,120
Did you somehow know the story or ever look it up?

845
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,160
I didn't know the story before.

846
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,840
I was looking at the things here.

847
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,480
You didn't know the continuity of the pumpkin patch

848
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,320
going in.

849
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,160
No, I should have.

850
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,000
That would have made it.

851
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,160
I would say it was not necessarily conveyed

852
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,000
with the signage or anyone weaving an oral history

853
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,080
before you went in because this is,

854
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,080
it belongs to an evil pumpkin worshiping cult

855
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,560
called the Cult of the Calabaza.

856
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,480
So these are, these are pumpkin worshipers.

857
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

858
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,920
And one can only assume pumpkin fuckers probably too.

859
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,840
I would think.

860
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,680
Well, they like it that much.

861
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,520
What else are they gonna do?

862
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,600
They worship it, yeah.

863
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,920
It's bound to happen.

864
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,720
Yes, we also did something bad on this maze.

865
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,560
We did?

866
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,400
Yes, we did.

867
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,520
Oh, you fucked the pumpkins.

868
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,400
We took five minutes.

869
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,400
Not the same, we each picked our own.

870
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,840
Then we, yes, we traded and mixed and matched,

871
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,760
but we didn't share though.

872
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,600
No, I've used.

873
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,080
Both of you have hall passes.

874
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,680
It's just a photo of a local pumpkin patch.

875
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,520
There was a pumpkin with a wig on.

876
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,880
A pumpkin with a wig on.

877
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,680
This is a regular,

878
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,760
and it's not even a pumpkin like carved

879
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,680
to like be good at oral sex.

880
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,680
That's just a big toothy, basic jack-o-lantern, please.

881
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,760
It's a normal pumpkin.

882
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it doesn't,

883
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,720
it's not some weird pervert pumpkin.

884
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,400
It's a normal jack-o-lantern.

885
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:39,400
I wanna see, I wanna fit my stuff between those big teeth,

886
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,800
the two big buck teeth.

887
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,640
I've heard of them.

888
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,480
It's never been shared on the podcast.

889
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,480
Seated for your pleasure.

890
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,760
Well, then when you're done,

891
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,320
it's seated for your pleasure, you know.

892
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,160
The pumpkin fleshlight,

893
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,800
the jack-o-lantern fleshlight,

894
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,320
only sold for these 30 days,

895
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,760
magical days of Halloween.

896
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,320
Yeah, so there's a whole narrative,

897
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,160
and there's like a pumpkin god.

898
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,240
I mean, you kinda piece some of,

899
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,280
I mean, I didn't really piece it together,

900
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,360
but there's a big,

901
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,320
there's big crazy robots in this place.

902
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,760
Animatronics. Wow.

903
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,120
That are good.

904
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,920
And they do a pretty good job for the most part,

905
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,520
hiding them, so you're around a corner,

906
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,800
and then like, what do you mean there's an animatronic in here?

907
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,000
It's huge, as tall as the room we're in right now,

908
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,280
but maybe taller, and moving,

909
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,800
and we can get, if we want, we could probably give it,

910
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,720
we can give it a hug, and maybe get hurt by it,

911
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,800
because it's moving its arms around so wildly.

912
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,640
Swing away the other way, yeah.

913
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,640
I mean, we could probably break it easily too,

914
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,840
but it was, there's a ton of stuff like this.

915
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,720
Yeah. Holy shit. Animatronic game.

916
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,640
Giant snakes and weird stuff.

917
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,000
There were a bunch of crucifixions that happened,

918
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,520
there were a bunch of like,

919
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,000
that was an odd, just a field of pumpkin sacrifices.

920
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,720
Yes.

921
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,440
Dark, dark Halloween. But what did we do that was bad?

922
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,280
Oh, we brought our drinks through the maze.

923
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,160
Oh, see, that's just you, I didn't.

924
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,600
Oh, you finished yours?

925
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,000
No, you know what, I was like, I gotta drive.

926
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,240
Scott did the same, followed the rules.

927
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,600
I ended up following the rules.

928
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,480
I poured a little of, I poured my remainder out,

929
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,520
because I had to drive,

930
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,360
Oh, wow.

931
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,960
and the Mai Tais at Tiki Terror were fairly strong.

932
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,200
That's true, they were, yeah.

933
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,040
Kind of was, right?

934
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,360
We both had Mai Tais, and mine wasn't quite done,

935
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,520
and I saw you clearing your cup,

936
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,880
so I thought you still had it in there.

937
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,000
No, I just wanted to, obviously,

938
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,840
just wanted to keep that priceless cup here.

939
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,040
I fucking lost it.

940
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,160
I'll give you mine.

941
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,960
No, that's okay, I have too many novelty cups

942
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,080
from Halloween events.

943
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,600
It's a whole cupboard.

944
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,440
Multiple cupboards, yeah.

945
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,280
It's a whole cabinet.

946
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,040
It's your only glassware.

947
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,360
Yeah, that's what I drink out of.

948
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,840
So I walked it through, and I was hiding it.

949
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,520
I was like, being bad, I hid it.

950
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,920
I never took a sip, though.

951
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,520
I didn't want anyone to see.

952
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,520
I think a scare actor or two saw it,

953
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,120
and maybe clocked it, but they really,

954
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,080
they would have had to tell him later,

955
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,800
because they shouldn't break character.

956
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,720
To be like, ah, what are you doing?

957
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,520
What are you drinking?

958
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,080
You're drinking in the maze again.

959
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,280
I'm like, next break, the next time I get to leave here.

960
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,120
You're going out of the list.

961
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,160
I will wait till Shaq hears about this.

962
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,000
We will tell him.

963
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,840
I'll get home, do my homework, and then I will.

964
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,680
And then I get to the end of the maze,

965
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,160
and they're like, Shaq wants to talk to you.

966
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,320
I'm like, what?

967
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,160
He's here.

968
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,720
Yeah, I'm so sorry, man.

969
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,560
You gotta get out of here.

970
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,280
You broke the rules of Shaqtoberfest.

971
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,200
You're led through another scary long pumpkin portal,

972
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,520
where then you just reach an office bungalow,

973
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,000
a temporary office bungalow,

974
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,800
and it's like the boss on dinosaurs,

975
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,680
where the room is too small for him.

976
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,720
It's Shaq at a desk in a bungalow

977
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,920
meant for a five foot five man.

978
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,600
And he's working on like logistics of every,

979
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,640
like, what do you mean we're out of funnel cakes?

980
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,280
We should have ordered enough funnel cakes

981
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,240
for a Thursday night,

982
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,560
and he's yelling at something on the phone,

983
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,600
and he puts up the finger like one second to deal with me.

984
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,280
Covered in flop sweat, he's got suspenders on.

985
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,120
Yeah, yeah.

986
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,960
Yes.

987
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,440
If we have to retire the pinks license,

988
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,280
then we can't,

989
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,880
we can get regular hot dogs in here tomorrow.

990
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,720
We already have hot dog bonus.

991
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,120
Does pinks mean that much to us, really?

992
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,400
On a stick, according to the map.

993
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,440
I told you it was redundant anyway.

994
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,080
Too much hot dog penetration.

995
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,720
People are gonna get confused.

996
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,720
But yeah, Shaq, he puts you on a list.

997
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,440
He's like, breaks my heart to have to do this.

998
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,360
I don't wanna rob anyone of Halloween joy.

999
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,200
But I have to make an example out of you.

1000
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,080
I wouldn't do this to my worst enemy.

1001
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,280
You will wear a sandwich board.

1002
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,720
I wouldn't do this to Putin.

1003
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,040
Even Putin deserves a happy Halloween.

1004
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,480
We will refund your admittance,

1005
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,560
but parking was through third parties,

1006
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,080
so I can't give you that back.

1007
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,080
That goes directly to the 15 year olds.

1008
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,320
They have it literally in cash.

1009
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,040
It's for textbook money.

1010
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,880
Yeah.

1011
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,480
Oh yeah, the third party is the Long Beach High School

1012
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,520
prom fundraiser.

1013
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,360
Yeah, yeah.

1014
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,200
Yeah.

1015
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,520
That's going to a good cause then.

1016
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,360
Better a car wash.

1017
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,080
And the prom is at the Queen Mary probably.

1018
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,200
So, love pumpkin.

1019
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,120
When we got to the end of it,

1020
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,480
King Koth noted that there was a crate

1021
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,960
where you could look through and very easily see

1022
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,400
where they were hiding the stockpile of Fog Juice.

1023
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,760
Oh yeah, yeah.

1024
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,600
So, and this is maybe something to keep an eye out for

1025
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,000
as we become bigger experts in the area of haunts

1026
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,720
and therefore Fog Juice, maybe learning our different types.

1027
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,560
Yeah, smart, yeah.

1028
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,680
Because Koth noticed the brand,

1029
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,080
the brand is Backwood Bay,

1030
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,760
which is not the company,

1031
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,720
but a sub-brand within Froggy's Fog.

1032
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,840
And it seems like a high end one.

1033
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,800
It says it leaves no odor

1034
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,400
and it lasts two to three times longer than Techno Fog,

1035
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,720
spelled with a K.

1036
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,480
So, if you're going to buy from Froggy's Fog,

1037
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,880
I think they bought the best Froggy's Fog.

1038
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,120
So, again, top tier items.

1039
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,480
Good job, Shaq.

1040
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,680
Maybe one of these years we'll review Fog.

1041
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,520
We'll find a way to review Fog.

1042
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,360
Get a Fog machine, get a couple,

1043
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,000
oh, and then do it just like wine tasting.

1044
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,840
Maybe, yeah.

1045
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,240
Now I detect some chemicals.

1046
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,200
I detect my own brain rotting.

1047
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,680
Oh my.

1048
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,200
This one actually clears my sinuses

1049
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,840
a little bit more than Foggy's Fog, okay.

1050
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,120
These are the positive effects.

1051
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,480
The negative effect is that

1052
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,840
I feel like I'm gonna pass out.

1053
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,320
The previous one clogged my sinuses.

1054
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,680
This one cleared it, you know.

1055
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,040
So, the middle, where I grew up,

1056
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,360
the middle school, the high school,

1057
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,400
and the community theater all shared one Fog machine

1058
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,960
for plays and stuff.

1059
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,880
And I feel like they just always bought

1060
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,360
the same pina colada scented fog juice.

1061
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,200
Oh wow.

1062
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,240
And it became very comforting to me.

1063
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,520
It's like, ah, play season.

1064
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,360
Pina colada.

1065
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,120
Every play you had a Fog machine?

1066
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,440
They would find a way.

1067
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,680
Which do you remember specifically a play?

1068
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,880
A lot of those pioneer services company

1069
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,920
with like 30 characters.

1070
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,840
Oh, like the junior high,

1071
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,680
like what we talked about. The junior high.

1072
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,680
Crazy camp.

1073
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,520
Right. Yeah, yeah.

1074
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,520
So we're starting like,

1075
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,560
and now this year's production of Sweeney Todd.

1076
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,400
And then like,

1077
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,960
why does it, what's this island smell?

1078
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,840
I don't know why the music man would have Fog.

1079
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,720
Carousel has some like dark moments.

1080
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,240
Anything in Britain,

1081
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,680
anything in like turn of the century or earlier London,

1082
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,920
you can just, ah, scene at the docks,

1083
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,600
Fog machines going, you know.

1084
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,120
We're doing ordinary people,

1085
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,120
but here's the thing,

1086
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,920
when they're in the locker room,

1087
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,400
it's real foggy because of steam.

1088
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,760
So we're using the Fog machine again.

1089
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,600
It's pina colada scented.

1090
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Yeah.

1091
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,560
The fog represents the turmoil.

1092
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,400
Yeah.

1093
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,760
Death of a salesman.

1094
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,000
It's a leaky pipe in his sad home, you see.

1095
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,040
Well, when he turns the car on

1096
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,280
and he tries to kill himself in the garage,

1097
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,080
it's a fog machine with a colada scent.

1098
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,920
Sweet relief.

1099
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,200
Sweet pina colada scented relief.

1100
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,120
So I guess you're right.

1101
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,360
Now that we've been brainstorming,

1102
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,080
you can use a fog machine in almost any different play.

1103
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,960
You're putting productions on.

1104
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,800
Yeah.

1105
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,620
Yeah. Okay.

1106
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,460
Well, that makes sense.

1107
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,240
I don't think I ever got to do a play with a fog machine.

1108
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,080
I think all mine.

1109
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,960
Have I said on the show that my mom

1110
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:21,920
directs elementary school plays to this day?

1111
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,760
I think so.

1112
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,600
Yeah.

1113
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,000
She did a very good Aristocats last year.

1114
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,840
No fog in that.

1115
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,560
Where's Aristocats in London?

1116
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,480
Where's Aristocats?

1117
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,300
Are they wandering around?

1118
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,140
No, France.

1119
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:33,960
France.

1120
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,800
Oh, okay.

1121
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,640
Yeah.

1122
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,360
Well, they got fog in France.

1123
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,840
That's by a river.

1124
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,360
A great production of Ordinary People Junior.

1125
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,200
Ordinary Little People.

1126
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,040
Wow.

1127
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,040
So I'm trying to, oh, this show,

1128
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,040
the play I was in was Rehearsal for Murder.

1129
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,280
We did not have a fog machine.

1130
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,400
Although we could have used it for the flashback scenes

1131
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,240
now that I'm thinking about it.

1132
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,600
That was in high school.

1133
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,520
It's a good way to indicate you're going into a flashback.

1134
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,360
Yeah, communicate with fog.

1135
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,360
Bad play.

1136
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,200
Very bad.

1137
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,280
This is not, we can talk about other mazes

1138
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,600
in that I did the mazes,

1139
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,180
but the absolute highlight of the night occurred,

1140
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,940
I think, after the pumpkin patch,

1141
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:20,340
which was in the same pumpkin zone.

1142
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:25,340
There was just a big, not bounce house, a bounce field.

1143
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,700
Bounce floor.

1144
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,540
What would you call this?

1145
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,580
A bounce floor, sure, absolutely.

1146
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,380
As lined with haystacks.

1147
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:35,500
As big as this room, I would say the floor was.

1148
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,940
It's a big, we're recording in a bigger room also.

1149
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,660
If it was just a garage.

1150
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,980
Maybe, but this is at least two garages.

1151
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:42,820
At least, yeah.

1152
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,300
Yeah, it was pretty massive, and you think,

1153
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,960
well maybe us, some late 30s men should not be up there

1154
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,280
with some children who are at this haunted event,

1155
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,320
but I'm like, it's also enough room.

1156
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,500
I think we're not crossing paths.

1157
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,380
I don't think we're bumping any of these kids.

1158
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,980
My time on this bounce floor,

1159
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,420
some of the most elated I've been.

1160
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:05,500
You looked like one of the kids jumping.

1161
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,220
He was having so much fun.

1162
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,820
I was so happy.

1163
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,860
Sprinted over there, lose the shoes,

1164
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,600
sprinted over there, bouncing up and down,

1165
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,040
just in the way you imagine a commercial

1166
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,280
of a kid jumping on the bed or something,

1167
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,360
with just that pure kid joy of bouncing up and down.

1168
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,200
Yes!

1169
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,020
Fists in the air.

1170
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,400
I got a video, Ken Coth took a video

1171
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,320
that I was very pleased to see after the fact.

1172
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,460
That shit that reads.

1173
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,520
What doesn't read is that I would just,

1174
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,880
I'd hit runs, right?

1175
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,000
I'd like for, this 12 seconds, I'm moving great,

1176
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,720
I'm making good time, I feel like I'm on the moon,

1177
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,760
and then like, okay, oh my God,

1178
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,320
oh flop sweating, dear God.

1179
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,080
And this is probably, I had just consumed the pina colada,

1180
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,680
and there of course had been the free shot

1181
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,000
at Captain Chex's hideaway.

1182
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,580
So alcohol's maybe the most hitting at this point,

1183
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:01,680
and then like, oh my God, bounce floors are hard.

1184
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,000
You felt the same way, right?

1185
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,600
That was nutty.

1186
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,000
Yeah, I for sure felt the same way,

1187
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,060
because I had just finished the drink.

1188
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,520
I also felt, I felt the same way,

1189
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,300
because I did something that I thought would be fun,

1190
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,620
and that ended up hurting me a little bit in it.

1191
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:21,420
You did a little like flip, or a jump?

1192
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,900
Well I did, so I immediately when I jumped on there,

1193
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,460
I took a professional wrestling back, flat back bump,

1194
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,520
onto the bouncy house,

1195
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,900
because I like, when I get in bounce house,

1196
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,380
I like doing wrestling moves or something,

1197
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,540
or I like tumbling, I like flipping around.

1198
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,520
And I haven't been on one of these in many years.

1199
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,620
So I landed on my back, I was like, oh yeah, that's fun,

1200
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:38,820
I popped back up, ran around,

1201
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,020
and yeah, it's hard on your legs and stuff.

1202
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:43,600
And then when, a lot of the kids were sort of cleared out

1203
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,220
by the time I got off.

1204
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,500
So I went, okay, I feel comfortable just doing,

1205
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,340
basically just jumping.

1206
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:51,820
Okay, now is it because you were on it, or?

1207
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,140
I don't know, I wasn't, you were making,

1208
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,680
you were going way up and back.

1209
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,620
So like you were doing much, I felt like you were like,

1210
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,220
if anyone was clearing the kids out,

1211
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:02,180
you chased them away, but I'm not accusing you of that.

1212
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,260
Because I don't think, I think for whatever reason,

1213
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,080
the kids-

1214
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,660
Those kids seem committed to being there.

1215
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:07,860
There were still kids there when-

1216
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,900
Bug was on there, you were on there, I was on there.

1217
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,820
And I don't think the three of us in tandem

1218
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:15,020
chased children away, it's possible, but I don't think so.

1219
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,740
We didn't all put on demonic voices.

1220
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:18,580
No.

1221
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,780
And say, we'll bounce you straight to hell.

1222
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,580
We didn't go, ahem, and then go, ah, go to hell,

1223
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,740
you kids, or whatever, like we didn't do that.

1224
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,580
So a lot of kids were going, I go, okay,

1225
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,540
I think I'll comfortably, I can comfortably do

1226
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,940
just kind of a jumping forward roll,

1227
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:33,100
like into a somersault.

1228
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:37,940
And I did it, and I forgot that because of a year

1229
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,540
of rocking a baby to sleep and carrying a baby,

1230
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:43,060
there's definitely something going on with discs

1231
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:45,580
in the upper part of my neck, that anytime I'm like

1232
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,180
walking up a hill or doing something,

1233
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,420
I can feel a little bit like,

1234
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,940
ah, that's a little too tight, that's different.

1235
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,540
So I did this thing, I did this forward roll

1236
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:56,420
onto the bouncy floor, and immediately went,

1237
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:01,340
oh shit, oh no, that's not good.

1238
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,380
And like, the rest of the night, I was like,

1239
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,540
if you know, not that it was so crazy,

1240
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:09,780
but I kept massaging to try to get this knot

1241
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,700
worked out of my spine.

1242
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:15,220
And I went, that is really, that makes me really sad

1243
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:20,220
that I can't do a simple tumbling act on a bounce floor

1244
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,460
at this age without feeling some sort of pain or uncomfortable.

1245
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,500
A perfect age to be doing such things

1246
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,620
as often as you want.

1247
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:30,100
Yeah, so I gotta look, I gotta get back on DDPY,

1248
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,820
I gotta do some yoga again,

1249
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,740
I haven't been keeping up with that.

1250
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,340
I gotta do a massage.

1251
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,740
Cause I gotta get a massage place in Fairbank,

1252
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:38,580
I'll send ya.

1253
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,900
All right, Jason winked at me too,

1254
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,060
I don't know what that means.

1255
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:47,060
You'll be amazed at what these senior citizens,

1256
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:52,260
these senior citizens can absolutely destroy you.

1257
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,780
Well, that's what you want, you want somebody to go,

1258
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,660
oh my God, I mean, this person's incredibly strong,

1259
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,980
cause they've been doing this for decades.

1260
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:03,380
So yeah, so anyway, it feels fine today,

1261
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,980
but there was a good 20 minutes where I was like,

1262
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:08,380
oh man, this isn't good.

1263
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,820
And then it was just like sore the rest of the night.

1264
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,420
Hey, this is Shaq, DJ Diesel,

1265
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,300
just reminding you any injuries incurred

1266
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,580
on the pumpkin floor are not the responsibility

1267
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,460
of Shaqtoberfest LTD.

1268
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,980
That's right, there's no nurse on the premise.

1269
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:21,940
I don't know what you think this is,

1270
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,140
Disneyland or Universal, we do not have a nurse.

1271
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:29,700
There's no infirmary, Captain Shaq's infirmary to go to.

1272
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:35,660
If you drunkenly fall off the ship into the harbor,

1273
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,860
we will not rescue you, but we will recover your body

1274
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:43,860
and use it as a future cadaver in the dead man's chest maze.

1275
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:47,380
The Catalina Express ferry will scoop you up with a big net.

1276
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:50,540
If you suffer a minor cut or abrasion,

1277
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:54,100
DJ Lovecraft does have a first aid kit behind his DJ console.

1278
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,340
If you want to go up and tap him on the shoulder,

1279
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,220
he can give you a band aid or some antiseptic.

1280
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:59,820
DJ is also the nurse.

1281
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,940
He is also the closest thing we have to a nurse.

1282
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,300
One of Shaq's major cost cutting measures.

1283
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,060
It's the reason we can do this event at all.

1284
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,580
But he can only help you in between sets.

1285
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,580
So you'll have to wait it out.

1286
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,820
Please wait for him to finish his song.

1287
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,640
If the music cuts out, it might be one of those,

1288
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,900
you know, dramatic dropouts where then it comes back in

1289
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:17,740
louder than ever.

1290
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,180
So use your DJ.

1291
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:24,140
So luckily I did not have to go to the hospital after that.

1292
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:27,900
I didn't collapse myself, collapse my vertebrae.

1293
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:31,220
I heard that was a, that was a blast.

1294
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:32,700
That was a real highlight of it.

1295
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,180
Yeah. It's the most fun.

1296
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:40,020
Now in terms of our strategy with this thing,

1297
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,420
we were weighing several options.

1298
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:43,260
Yes.

1299
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:46,560
This is a fairly inexpensive event to go to

1300
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,820
if you want it to be,

1301
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:51,320
but you start getting enticed by add-ons.

1302
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:56,320
And this is where your haunts expertise

1303
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,440
or just like, you know,

1304
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,480
your like ripoff radar was going off a little bit.

1305
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,400
And I'm glad that it was because I was like, I don't know.

1306
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,740
It feels like maybe we're going to want to do

1307
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:12,740
the VIP slam dunk admission where for only triple the price.

1308
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,280
We not only get, I mean, I'll say we got,

1309
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,520
we did do some of this, but it's like the front of the line.

1310
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,580
First of all, don't gotta wait for any of these mazes.

1311
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,040
That sounds good.

1312
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,120
And also you get access to the VIP slam dunk bar and lounge,

1313
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,000
which offers you sweeping views of Shacktoberfest.

1314
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,840
Yeah.

1315
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,680
We did not opt for this.

1316
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,720
You said, maybe this event will not be populated enough

1317
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:39,280
to justify needing a front of the line pass.

1318
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,200
And then look, and then look at us.

1319
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,520
There we were waiting in three minute lines, sometimes four,

1320
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,520
because we foolishly didn't triple the money we gave them.

1321
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,160
Sometimes no wait at all.

1322
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,680
Sometimes.

1323
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,440
Literally no wait.

1324
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,280
Walk through the line into the maze.

1325
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,280
Sometimes the only wait was how long it took

1326
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,680
to get through all of the barricades meant for

1327
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,160
an hour long wait that were totally empty.

1328
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,200
Yes, my suspicion was correct.

1329
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,440
And when you're looking at that,

1330
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:10,640
you're imagining the worst Disneyland scenario of a line.

1331
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,160
And it's not the case necessarily at Shacktoberfest,

1332
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,840
especially on a Thursday.

1333
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,040
Absolutely.

1334
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,440
Now, another issue with this clearly became now,

1335
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,400
was I jealous?

1336
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,160
I very much, once I saw it,

1337
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,200
wanted to go to the VIP slam dunk bar and lounge.

1338
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,720
However, I realized that is not quite on the ship,

1339
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,640
but a little platform next to the ship.

1340
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,000
And it does offer you sweeping views of Shacktoberfest,

1341
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,840
but guess what?

1342
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,960
You can't see the ship.

1343
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,040
So what are you looking at?

1344
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,120
A parking lot full of carnival rides.

1345
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,800
I can see that from the ground.

1346
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,760
And the city of Long Beach, I guess, probably.

1347
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,800
But also you're turned around from the pretty view.

1348
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,640
Oh yeah, you're right.

1349
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,760
You're looking at where all the shipping crates

1350
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,600
are lifted up.

1351
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,440
Maybe.

1352
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,280
The tall freeway.

1353
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,120
You can see a little freeway.

1354
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:52,960
I think it's probably.

1355
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,880
Mostly just like dark ocean.

1356
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,640
So I think we made the right call here.

1357
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:01,200
Any potential future Shacktoberfest goers,

1358
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,800
that's my advice to you.

1359
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,760
And you're gonna have to make up your own mind.

1360
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,320
I don't know if I can endorse or not endorse

1361
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:13,640
the add-on that we did do, which is the captain's combo.

1362
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:17,600
Now I discussed with you my desire to do the upcharge,

1363
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,400
which got us into Captain Shack's hideaway,

1364
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,880
which inside one of the mazes, Pirates Cove,

1365
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,360
is a secret lair.

1366
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,560
Captain Shack's hideaway, which is so secret

1367
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,840
you can only find out about it on the website

1368
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,960
of Shacktoberfest.

1369
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,840
And there you will toast to the pirate's life

1370
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,600
with a complimentary shot of rum punch,

1371
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,560
probably brewed up by Shack himself.

1372
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,400
Of course, yeah.

1373
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,320
He took a big ore, grabbed it right off the ship,

1374
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,160
brewed it up in bulk.

1375
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,760
So I wanted to do that.

1376
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,400
And you said, well look, if we're gonna be doing that,

1377
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,320
why not save $5 and gain access also

1378
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,720
to the engine room experience?

1379
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,880
Of course.

1380
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,640
We'll be saving money by that point.

1381
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,520
We're making money, you said, I believe.

1382
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,680
Yes, yeah.

1383
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,000
So that is what we opted for.

1384
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,840
What this led to was going into a bar

1385
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,920
that fit five people, with us five people.

1386
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,560
We were pretty quickly brushed out of there

1387
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,400
after we took our shots. When we say a bar,

1388
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,560
we mean the first part of a maze.

1389
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,680
There's a room in the first part of a maze

1390
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,760
with a little bar in it that we were very confused.

1391
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,120
And it seemed like everybody who came in there was confused.

1392
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,240
It was confusing.

1393
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,280
Despite the fact that many shots were laid out,

1394
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,880
and therefore this is probably where you take the shots,

1395
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,080
it still felt like, huh, this is it?

1396
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,800
And then there were two types of little shot glasses.

1397
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,800
And I know now that one of them was just pure

1398
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,720
Captain Morgan rum, best on the planet.

1399
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,320
This is some luxury you're paying for

1400
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,480
with the Captain's combo.

1401
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,280
And then there was another shot

1402
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,920
that was where there was juice in it,

1403
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,240
and that makes it more of punch.

1404
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,600
And they said, well, this one is a chaser.

1405
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,120
I heard the word chaser, and I thought, okay, wait.

1406
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,360
So here's the rum, and then I'll do the chaser.

1407
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,640
And they said, no, no, no, you only get one.

1408
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,040
Okay, but wait, wait, so one is the chaser,

1409
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,040
the chaser is in it, okay?

1410
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,920
And never have I felt so stupid.

1411
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,680
There's a lot of music playing as well.

1412
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,080
There's loud, like pirate spooky music,

1413
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,640
I believe playing as well.

1414
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,520
So we walk into here, which also we should mention,

1415
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,720
we thought was a real bar.

1416
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:23,040
The way it's promoted online makes you feel like,

1417
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,800
oh, it's like kind of a little bar area.

1418
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,240
You sit and you have a free drink,

1419
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,680
and then you can maybe drink some more.

1420
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,800
It is not that.

1421
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,080
Oh, I'm imagining like Trader Sam's.

1422
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,960
I'm like picturing this all, ooh, a hideaway in a cove.

1423
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,520
Captain Shack's hideaway.

1424
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,800
So I'm imagining that they imagineeered a little spa.

1425
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,080
I don't know why I thought for this case,

1426
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,200
this is gonna be like an incredible,

1427
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,120
and probably like a lot of details.

1428
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,400
Just so you know how like,

1429
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,720
the Trader Sam's has like the letter to Indiana Jones.

1430
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,840
I bet there's stuff like that.

1431
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,040
There's probably a letter to the general back at home.

1432
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,960
And maybe Kazam said, hey,

1433
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,080
if you ever need some of my Kazam magic,

1434
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,320
future Shacktow, it ties together the Shack-a-verse.

1435
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,160
This is what I thought I was gonna encounter.

1436
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,880
Yeah, Jason, go ahead.

1437
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:08,120
Well, the website does feature a picture of people laughing.

1438
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:09,840
Look at that room.

1439
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,760
But you don't know what it. It looks large.

1440
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,000
And they're also handling bottles of Fireball and Don Julio,

1441
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,040
which I don't think they'd let guests do that.

1442
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,040
No, this is. Yeah, not a guest for sure.

1443
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,200
Yeah, this almost seems like it's like a tasting,

1444
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,600
like a flight of full bottles.

1445
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,600
It is laid out.

1446
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,440
You know, you're right.

1447
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,200
That picture is why I was tricked.

1448
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,880
Does that not look like some kind of

1449
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,560
a haunted Trader Sam's-esque environment?

1450
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,800
Yeah, yeah, it kinda does.

1451
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,400
I mean, I guess you could make the argument

1452
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,240
they're wearing black.

1453
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,480
Maybe they're working, but then where are the guests?

1454
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,720
So yeah, you're thinking, okay, there's like a little,

1455
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,360
I don't know that I thought it was gonna be imaginary,

1456
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,520
but I definitely thought, okay, there's like a little room

1457
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,640
either on the boat or on one of these little houses

1458
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,000
or something that's a pop-up.

1459
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,440
And yeah, it's got some seats and it's just a private bar.

1460
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,120
It's the extra upcharge bar

1461
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,800
and it's got a little decoration in it.

1462
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,320
No, basically it's like if you went into a Horror Night's Maze

1463
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,840
and the first room had shots in it.

1464
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,560
Had a card table?

1465
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,640
Had a card table of shots.

1466
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,680
And you can't really hear the person

1467
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,560
giving the shots out very well.

1468
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,200
You can't all stand, your friends all have to stand in a line.

1469
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,240
There's not room to make a cluster of five.

1470
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,240
Yeah, you can't even all.

1471
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,600
Your backs are against the wall.

1472
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,120
And then it's in the middle of you trying to figure out

1473
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,920
how to take the shots, another group comes in

1474
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,800
and has the exact same questions.

1475
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,800
The exact same questions start being asked again.

1476
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,040
Glad this wasn't me.

1477
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:35,880
What are the shots?

1478
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,080
What are these?

1479
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,800
And then the same confusing explanation is given again.

1480
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,440
Well, this is Captain Morgan and it's also,

1481
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,720
this one is the chaser.

1482
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,560
This is the chaser and you're like,

1483
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,120
okay, so this is a chaser I take after this?

1484
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:47,960
No, no, no, no.

1485
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,920
This is, she goes, they're the same thing.

1486
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,760
She kept saying, they're the same thing.

1487
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:53,600
That's not true.

1488
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,800
That's literally not true.

1489
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,840
And I go, and I don't know if I said it

1490
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,680
or somebody else said it.

1491
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,760
And we're just like, okay, wait.

1492
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,040
So we take this and this, no, no, no, no, no.

1493
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,960
It's either one, this has a grenadine in it as well.

1494
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,680
And I go, okay, so this is just straight Captain Morgan

1495
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,200
and this is grenadine with Captain Morgan.

1496
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,480
Like, yes, okay.

1497
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,840
And in the middle of that, somebody goes,

1498
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,840
hey, so which one, which one are these?

1499
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,840
She goes, these are the same thing.

1500
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,640
And I'm like, wait a minute, they're not the same.

1501
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,920
They are not, you just, it took you explaining this.

1502
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,560
I would have been completely adrift.

1503
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,480
Oh, Scott, don't do two.

1504
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,120
I was holding two.

1505
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,760
Captain Shackle will excommunicate you from his ship

1506
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,600
if you do this.

1507
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,440
I did not approve this value.

1508
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,440
I did not approve a double.

1509
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,560
So thank God I saved you from that.

1510
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,400
But yeah, so.

1511
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,440
Oh my God.

1512
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,080
That was really confusing.

1513
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,200
And it was also because for a second,

1514
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,640
maybe we thought that Captain Shackle

1515
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:46,480
was separate from this room as well.

1516
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,720
So I go, well, maybe we're getting two shots

1517
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,000
because they promised us a free shot in the upcharge.

1518
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,880
So then, but then I was like, you know what?

1519
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,040
That doesn't make sense.

1520
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,800
There's no way you're getting an extra shot.

1521
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,560
No, this is it.

1522
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:02,160
Then you walk through a fun little maze as well.

1523
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,800
I just say also, just before the term chaser,

1524
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,280
maybe this person is not.

1525
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,880
I think she might not have known the terminology.

1526
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,720
Well, I don't think she knows.

1527
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,200
I don't think she knows the concept of chasing

1528
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:18,200
in which two separate parties are involved in a pursuit

1529
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,360
and one is in the front and one is behind.

1530
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:25,960
So a chaser implies that that is behind another thing,

1531
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:30,040
thus two little glasses, which is why I picked up two.

1532
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:33,480
Traditionally, a chaser follows a shot

1533
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,040
and thus is a separate beverage.

1534
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,440
Right, she didn't say it's a sweet,

1535
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,240
like these are the same alcohol, it's just one is sweeter.

1536
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,520
You can't have just the chaser.

1537
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,720
I mean, you can, I guess,

1538
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,440
but that's when you're drinking water.

1539
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,800
Well, you shouldn't have a choice that you had to explain

1540
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,040
at the start of a maze bar.

1541
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,920
Or like you should just be one option.

1542
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,560
Well, maybe a little sign.

1543
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,360
That's easier, but I was gonna say little sign

1544
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,520
and one just says Captain Morgan

1545
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,440
and one says grenadine and Captain Morgan.

1546
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,280
Yeah.

1547
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,240
And then you go, okay, got it, this is just sweeter.

1548
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,960
Also, it's the darkest room

1549
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:12,760
and they're just like slightly different shades of brown.

1550
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,200
Yeah, why?

1551
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,840
I mean, you could sort of.

1552
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,800
I could see that the one was a little like more opaque.

1553
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,120
Yes, yeah.

1554
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:24,120
So I was assuming, I at first absolutely thought

1555
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,960
this is just grenadine and this is alcohol.

1556
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,360
Yes, I thought one was just juice.

1557
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,960
Right, that's what it looked like.

1558
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,320
So this is down the list.

1559
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,800
I wish the person was not as in character also

1560
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:35,880
as I would have preferred

1561
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,440
because I think we were all like, ahoy!

1562
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,200
Like we're trying to do like, you know, fun

1563
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,760
with everybody else. What be the difference

1564
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,960
between these?

1565
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:45,960
So does ye VIP admission give me access?

1566
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,680
Right, right.

1567
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,560
Are we saved four dollars?

1568
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,200
My best to the captain and his wonderful combo.

1569
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,600
Where do you want me to drop off the Coke can

1570
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,040
that saves money?

1571
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,440
So yeah, so we finally, we figured it out.

1572
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,400
Everybody did.

1573
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,840
I just, I did not have the grenadine.

1574
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,160
I did the straight Captain Morgan.

1575
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,000
I think you did as well.

1576
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,440
I think everybody may have done that.

1577
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,280
I don't know, maybe not everybody.

1578
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,120
I don't know.

1579
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,320
I didn't clock what everybody did.

1580
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:21,040
But yeah, so then at that point, you go through the maze.

1581
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,160
I like taking a shot and going straight into a maze.

1582
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,120
Very fun. That's fun.

1583
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,840
It was a very fun thing.

1584
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,560
It's maybe like, yeah, like it would maybe be better

1585
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:35,320
to like take a puff of some strong weed to get

1586
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,800
like an immediate reaction.

1587
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,120
Michael, who are you?

1588
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,480
I'm just trying to figure out.

1589
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,360
I'm not saying I would like I'm just saying like

1590
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,280
it is a fun like action to do, but it's not like

1591
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,760
all of a sudden I got buzzed in the maze or anything,

1592
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,800
which would kind of be a fun.

1593
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,280
It would be fun, I guess, if you like had a real

1594
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,640
Captain Shaxx that was like what you're describing

1595
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,400
Trader Sam's, you sit there for 20 minutes,

1596
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,480
you do a shot, whatever.

1597
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,960
And then all of a sudden somebody yells, go on the maze

1598
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,080
and you got a little buzz and then you go do it.

1599
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:04,960
But it's still fun.

1600
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,280
It was still fun to like have that action

1601
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,360
and have it be the sort of a maze.

1602
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:12,720
Well, step two of the captain's combo,

1603
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,440
just to help the single listener who hears this assess

1604
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,360
whether to do the captain's combo.

1605
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,880
Maybe one person listening will find themselves

1606
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,800
in this scenario.

1607
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,600
The other thing that you get is the engine room experience.

1608
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,400
And we didn't know what that meant.

1609
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,560
And I thought, okay, now we're actually dealing

1610
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,680
with real Queen Mary stuff.

1611
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,320
This has to be on the ship.

1612
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,960
We're getting into the real history of it.

1613
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:35,800
Sounds interesting.

1614
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,280
Maybe is this some sort of haunted experience

1615
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,920
deep in the bowels of a big ship's engine?

1616
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,320
That sounds cool.

1617
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:47,320
So you head towards that and you get into just a brightly

1618
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,760
lit regular lobby of the kinds of entertainment

1619
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,240
that you can do while you're staying there.

1620
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,840
I don't know if you participated in any of the attractions,

1621
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:58,440
Jason, when you stayed on board.

1622
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,280
I just kind of did.

1623
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,840
There were some self tours.

1624
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:03,520
And then when I was coming back one night,

1625
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,400
the ghost tour was coming through

1626
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,920
and I sort of stopped and listened to some of the spiel.

1627
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,560
And then I went back to my room.

1628
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,880
So you stole a little of the ghost tour.

1629
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,840
So I stole a little of the ghost tour.

1630
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1631
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,840
So I didn't know if it was gonna be like that,

1632
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:22,240
but you just entered the most brightly lit room ever

1633
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,160
that has the regular daytime banners up,

1634
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,800
which say like,

1635
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:31,680
see the sets from their finest hours,

1636
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,760
Winston Churchill and the Queen Mary,

1637
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,880
original sets from darkest hour.

1638
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,400
What, Gary Oldman?

1639
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,800
Yes, Gary Oldman, yeah.

1640
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:43,440
Yes, well, I don't know if I feel the haunted nature.

1641
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,280
I know, I know.

1642
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,720
I was like, okay, wait.

1643
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,480
But maybe it's, and then we saw the sign,

1644
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,320
because there's all these just bright museum style exhibits

1645
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,640
and there's big pictures of Walt Disney,

1646
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,920
there's a big picture of like very young Alfred Hitchcock.

1647
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:55,840
Luke Costello.

1648
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,680
Luke Costello.

1649
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,480
Luke, I've seen the Luke Costello photos.

1650
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:02,480
It says star of Who's on First.

1651
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,840
Star of Who's on First.

1652
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,160
Who's on First, the movie.

1653
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,240
Yeah, so there's a Cary Grant.

1654
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,760
I heard they're giving Taika Waititi the Who's on First.

1655
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:12,600
Oh, I heard that, yeah.

1656
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's gonna update it.

1657
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,080
Oh, we needed to be.

1658
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,200
Got two million up front for it.

1659
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,800
Finally, expanding it to two hours and 20 minutes,

1660
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,720
like old movies are legally required to be nowadays.

1661
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,640
But how did they end up,

1662
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,960
how did they get this team together with such unusual names?

1663
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,280
Farm system. It just seems like,

1664
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,280
yeah, I wanna see kind of the money ball

1665
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,640
like interviewing every one of. AAA, AA, single A.

1666
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,560
What's the name, sir?

1667
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:36,760
What?

1668
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,000
And then you get to do the scene

1669
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,400
every time the new player is met.

1670
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,360
No, I asked your name.

1671
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,200
What?

1672
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,680
No, the name of you, your name, what is it?

1673
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,520
Yeah, yeah.

1674
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,360
Hmm?

1675
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,280
Shut up, Pearl Harbor has just been bombed.

1676
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:54,880
So there is radio, stop this nonsense.

1677
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,200
But yeah, then we went down into the engine room

1678
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:04,200
and this was kind of, well, was it spooky?

1679
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,320
I don't know what the normal lighting is

1680
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,640
in the engine room in normal times

1681
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,800
because I guess it was kind of like reddish light

1682
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,320
that gave it a kind of a vibe,

1683
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,600
but we're in like an engine room,

1684
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,880
which is like, it was cool to be sort of

1685
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,640
in the bowels of a ship like that

1686
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,280
and it all looks authentic because it is.

1687
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:29,160
And it's playing like big band music.

1688
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:32,520
We're saying it's like graveyard jazz.

1689
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,720
Yeah, I guess that's a better way to, yeah, you're right.

1690
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,920
Yeah, well, but don't, don't, don't, don't.

1691
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:41,120
We're saying the whole time we were making up the,

1692
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,680
this sounds like an instrumental of a villain song

1693
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:49,680
in an unpopular Disney animated film from like 98 to 2006.

1694
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,160
We're like, here's where the villain captures the hero

1695
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,360
and sings a song about what he's all about.

1696
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,520
Pull up a seat.

1697
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:01,760
You ain't going anywhere, not for the next eternity.

1698
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,040
You used to be home on the range

1699
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:08,280
and now you wanna be home in my slaughterhouse.

1700
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,120
Yeah.

1701
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:14,120
Yeah, so you could kind of say anything

1702
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,040
while this was playing.

1703
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,080
Because it just went infinitely.

1704
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,120
We're in an engine room lit really red

1705
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:23,160
and hearing graveyard jazz where we made up the entire song,

1706
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,600
it's good to be bad.

1707
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:29,200
Because it's good to be bad.

1708
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,960
This is from like a much lesser work of Henry Selick.

1709
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,760
Like, oh yeah, then there was that other one.

1710
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:35,600
No, that's right.

1711
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,080
Yeah, did you ever see that?

1712
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,560
No, maybe once, maybe once in a sleepover.

1713
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,080
It is not a small room,

1714
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,320
but it's a small area that you can walk

1715
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,200
on the like catwalky kind of thing.

1716
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,840
There's a couple level, little levels,

1717
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:54,160
but it's like five minutes and you've seen it.

1718
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,880
Yeah, yeah.

1719
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,520
And there are no monsters.

1720
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,160
No monsters, nothing else, Halloween,

1721
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,000
I'm sure they wouldn't allow it.

1722
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,440
There's no room for it either.

1723
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:07,080
Did you go by the indoor pool at all?

1724
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,200
Did you see that?

1725
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,920
No, no hotel amenities were seen.

1726
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,160
No, no, this was like,

1727
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:18,160
this one of the actual haunted places on the ship.

1728
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,160
And when I stayed there, I walked by

1729
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,320
and I did a double take because it looked like

1730
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:26,920
there was water on, you know, kind of the reflections.

1731
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:30,640
And I realized they had like theatrical lighting in there

1732
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:34,360
to make it seem like it was a filled pool reflecting.

1733
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,120
But the fact that it's an actual place

1734
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:41,160
where like people have seen ghosts,

1735
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:45,480
it's like, this is a weird choice.

1736
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:46,880
Can you swim in it as well?

1737
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,200
No, no, it's empty.

1738
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,320
It's like not a working pool.

1739
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,640
It's lighting that looks like water.

1740
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:56,160
It's lighting in a historic like ship's pool.

1741
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,240
And that's haunted.

1742
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,080
Yeah.

1743
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:02,880
There is the general haunted nature to the Queen Mary.

1744
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,560
The website for Shacktoberfest calls it notoriously haunted.

1745
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:07,400
Yeah.

1746
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,240
It's like, is it?

1747
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,160
And now I look into it and I suppose so.

1748
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,440
And I guess it sounds Jason,

1749
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,960
like if you stay there, you get a sense of that.

1750
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,000
And there's the tours you can do.

1751
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,400
And now let me do just the brief history lesson.

1752
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,680
And listeners, I'm sure we've referred to this at some point,

1753
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,560
but there was this weird period of time

1754
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:25,400
where Disney owned the Queen Mary,

1755
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,120
just operated it, leased it.

1756
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,840
I'm got, the articles I read only confused me more,

1757
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:31,960
but there was a point in time

1758
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,520
where it was in Disney's best interest

1759
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,840
to put a bunch of money into the Queen Mary.

1760
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:38,960
This is from 88 to 92.

1761
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,560
And this happened because they bought out

1762
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,880
the Rather Corporation so that they could get

1763
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,440
the Disneyland Hotel.

1764
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,040
And thus they ended up with all this other stuff.

1765
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:50,320
So I'm like, well, maybe we can,

1766
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,680
and we talked about this in the Mickey and Friends

1767
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,480
parking garage episode with Weiger.

1768
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,240
They started trying to make Long Beach,

1769
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,440
or I'm sorry, Anaheim jealous of Long Beach.

1770
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,080
Like, well, what if, hey, we got the Queen Mary,

1771
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,360
now maybe we start doing all our stuff over there.

1772
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,280
Maybe Queen Mary's part of a theme park.

1773
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,280
Maybe that's in the middle of our Port Disney thing.

1774
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:11,160
Like that was an idea was to fold it into that.

1775
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:14,280
But in the F, they did like,

1776
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:15,880
they had bigger future plans for it,

1777
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,000
but they kind of, it was kind of on them

1778
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,120
to like immediately start doing something

1779
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,960
and maybe try to turn this thing around.

1780
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,760
Because there's always been like an albatross

1781
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:25,360
kind of nature to the Queen Mary still to this day.

1782
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:28,680
It might just like rot and dissolve into the sea

1783
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,600
at some point in time.

1784
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:35,120
But I didn't realize that in that 80s, 90s stretch,

1785
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,520
there was a bunch of stuff that they did.

1786
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,520
There was a little like 40s show that you could see

1787
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,200
up on the deck where like Disney-esque performers

1788
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,680
do the song Cheek to Cheek.

1789
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:46,320
Yeah, yeah, so there's that kind of thing.

1790
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:49,680
But then they also did, they played into the haunted thing.

1791
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,200
There was something called haunted passages

1792
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:54,880
that maybe went some of the same places that we went

1793
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,600
in the final maze.

1794
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,640
But I saw an article that said this was almost

1795
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,880
haunted mansion-esque little like Disney gags

1796
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,760
that made you feel unsettled.

1797
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:06,200
This sounds okay.

1798
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,760
It's not documented like at all.

1799
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,640
And I think it's, I find it so odd

1800
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,680
that there was a little Disney outpost

1801
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,320
in a different part of the LA Orange County area.

1802
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:20,040
That's never like, the photos of art have never leaked.

1803
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:20,880
I don't think of that.

1804
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,000
There's nothing if you Google.

1805
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,320
Maybe it's in a magazine.

1806
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:28,280
I remember at the time you would get Disney magazines

1807
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:29,520
that would advertise the,

1808
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,440
I was confused by the whole relationship.

1809
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,080
And they were trying to make it all into one thing.

1810
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,680
Because Eisner wanted his second gate.

1811
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:39,080
He wanted a reason to stay longer like Disney World.

1812
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,920
So he's like, well, you like Disneyland, huh?

1813
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,920
Go watch, head to the Queen Mary after.

1814
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:44,880
Yeah, is that close?

1815
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,680
No, not at all.

1816
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,960
The freeway's at least like relatively.

1817
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:49,800
20 minutes now.

1818
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,880
Not at the peak time.

1819
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:53,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1820
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,400
Certain hours a day might take an hour, 20 minutes.

1821
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,880
But yeah, it just depends.

1822
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:57,920
But they did all this stuff.

1823
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,240
They did a little Haunted Mansion experience.

1824
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:03,000
And they also, there was something called Celebrity Tales.

1825
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,880
We were just talking about Lou Costello

1826
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:07,520
and the people who were on board the ship at one time.

1827
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:12,040
So Disney hired look-alike performers who would want,

1828
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:17,000
you would like open a door and there would be WC Fields

1829
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,680
or Clark Gable and they would talk to you

1830
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,120
and talk about how their stay is going.

1831
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,000
There was a whole little sect of,

1832
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,640
how is there still like 1990 era Disney,

1833
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,960
Eisner era Disney we're still finding?

1834
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,320
Yeah, that is what, and that happened.

1835
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,520
Yeah, that existed.

1836
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,120
I don't think anyone took a video of it

1837
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:38,240
or they didn't put it on YouTube.

1838
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:39,080
No, everyone hated it.

1839
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,160
If they did, it was very unpopular.

1840
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:45,080
Imagine being in a tight space with WC Fields.

1841
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,520
Hey, I chickened-y.

1842
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:50,800
So your breath reeks, WC.

1843
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,760
Wow, what's wrong?

1844
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,480
Put a little hair on your chest.

1845
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,720
I'm not asleep yet.

1846
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,240
What do you mean you're going to sleep?

1847
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:01,040
I'm gonna tuck you in.

1848
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,080
Nightly tuck-ins for me.

1849
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,960
Yeah, and you don't have to call to get this one.

1850
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:09,440
I just show up and do it here, my little chickeny.

1851
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,760
I'll be back at 2.30 a.m. too.

1852
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,160
Make sure you're still asleep.

1853
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,520
I'm climbing to bed.

1854
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,280
I'll curl up with you too.

1855
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,160
Rush little baby, don't you cry.

1856
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,360
I gotta get out of here.

1857
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:26,600
When I stayed at Queen Mary, I got the impression,

1858
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:30,400
I saw a couple different people checking in,

1859
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:35,320
and one was an older man, and he was staying five nights.

1860
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:38,800
And he was like, I feel like I heard him say

1861
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,240
he was doing a bunch of tours and going to some museums.

1862
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,560
So he was all in on this shit.

1863
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:45,520
That's why he was there.

1864
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:46,640
That was why he was there.

1865
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:51,520
And then I saw some other people who had had their luggage

1866
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:56,520
and were mostly there because next to the Queen Mary

1867
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,600
is the Long Beach Cruise Terminal.

1868
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:04,560
And sometimes you disembark very early,

1869
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,280
so I think they had gotten into the area.

1870
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,360
They were staying for a night on the Queen Mary

1871
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,000
because it was like $80.

1872
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,240
And then they would go on their cruise ship

1873
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,200
the next morning.

1874
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,360
And then there was that, I remember there was that

1875
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:23,360
other guy you saw with the bowler hat and the dusty jacket,

1876
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,320
and he was half opaque.

1877
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,000
And when he checked in, they said, how many nights?

1878
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,520
And he said, forever.

1879
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:32,320
Forever, my little chickadee.

1880
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,920
He was like a little tramp.

1881
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:36,520
Yeah, he was a little.

1882
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,560
And he said to you, I've got an extra bed to wanna join.

1883
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:46,280
Oh, well, these real estate prices.

1884
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:48,360
I'd be a fool not to take them up on this.

1885
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,600
Jason, with all the old time stars

1886
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:54,400
that you could have been bothered by on the Queen Mary

1887
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,680
when you stayed, who would you want to discuss?

1888
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,880
And you're talking, is it one of the little rascals?

1889
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,960
Is it one of our gang before the little rascals?

1890
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,240
Oh, well, of the ones you mentioned,

1891
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:09,440
I think Cary Grant has a reputation of being most fun.

1892
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,280
Oh, okay.

1893
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:12,920
I don't think he was mentioned, but yes, sure.

1894
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:13,760
You said Cary Grant.

1895
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,160
He was in a picture, he was in a photo,

1896
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,920
but he was not one of the performers, Scottless.

1897
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,200
Oh, okay, nevermind.

1898
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,040
No, you said Mike.

1899
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,480
I didn't say Cary Grant, yeah.

1900
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:26,480
Yeah, WC, I don't know much about what he was really like.

1901
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,640
Gregarius?

1902
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,720
I mean, is that just a character though?

1903
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:32,560
That's a good point.

1904
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,720
It could have been like a Red Skelton.

1905
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:35,840
Never touched this stuff.

1906
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,200
Foster Brooks, I don't know.

1907
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,440
I think he might've been a real drunk,

1908
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:39,280
but I could be wrong.

1909
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,840
Yeah, probably.

1910
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,720
I think he was a real drunk, actually.

1911
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,560
The more I talk it through, I think he was a real drunk.

1912
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,440
He didn't know anyone considered it a character.

1913
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,640
He didn't know he was in movies.

1914
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:49,480
He just started talking like that.

1915
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,080
He wasn't phony like Foster Brooks was.

1916
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,480
Why is it so bright here?

1917
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:55,400
Too many lights around.

1918
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,160
Why they keep saying action?

1919
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,040
The other, oh, also, wait a minute.

1920
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,600
I'm staring right at this and didn't, okay.

1921
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,160
A Howard Hughes impersonator was purchased too.

1922
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,240
Well, now we have the answer for Jason.

1923
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,640
Disney hired a guy to be Howard Hughes?

1924
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,200
Wow, that's insane.

1925
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,680
I know that because that big dome

1926
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:19,240
next to the Queen Mary used to house the Spruce Goose.

1927
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,440
The Spruce Goose.

1928
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:24,800
And that adds a whole other creepy air to this thing

1929
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,400
that I like a lot because that,

1930
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,280
I've always been interested in that.

1931
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:30,520
My dad's pointed that out for as long as we've been

1932
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,280
going to that area.

1933
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,000
The Spruce Goose and Howard Hughes in the future.

1934
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,080
And I've never been that close to the dome.

1935
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,680
And it looks like shit.

1936
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,240
It's falling apart.

1937
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,400
It looks so musty.

1938
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,680
And it's not lit because it's not part of the thing.

1939
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,280
So you're just like, and then off.

1940
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:50,040
Also, eerily in the distance is this scary, dirty dome.

1941
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:50,880
Yes.

1942
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,600
It feels like production value they added.

1943
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:54,800
I know they didn't.

1944
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:55,920
Yeah.

1945
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,560
Yes, it's like ominous.

1946
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:01,320
It's ominous, almost like it's a part of a dead city

1947
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,600
or something because it's so big and so not illuminated.

1948
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:07,080
Like it might start vibrating and erupt.

1949
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:07,920
Yeah.

1950
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,320
Some strange liquid will shoot out the top.

1951
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,160
Right.

1952
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:12,800
Kind of a man-made volcano.

1953
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,800
Well, because it's mostly populated by people

1954
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,680
boarding Carnival Cruise Line ships.

1955
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,480
Yeah, that's what they use it for now, I guess.

1956
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:26,200
I was saying how that for a while they were using it

1957
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,840
as a film location.

1958
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,400
And I have to correct what I told you last night.

1959
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,680
Oh, no.

1960
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:33,080
Unless it was also used for this.

1961
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:36,400
I think actually not Riddler's Lair in Batman Forever.

1962
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,600
But in fact, the Batcave was pretty good.

1963
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,000
And maybe Wayne Manor.

1964
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,560
I think it opened up as this thing of like,

1965
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:47,480
we need to build sets that are bigger than any sound stage

1966
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,560
is going to hold.

1967
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,360
Just for Batman Forever?

1968
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:52,000
I saw other ones.

1969
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,640
I think Stargate shot in there.

1970
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,200
Do I have the list?

1971
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,720
I'm just trying to remember if the Batcave in Batman Forever

1972
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:04,880
is like, I guess it is bigger because you see.

1973
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,800
I think it's bigger than the Burton ones.

1974
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,560
Yeah, because you see you really get

1975
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,560
the good shot of the Batmobile and then the Batwing

1976
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,040
is in there too.

1977
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,360
I think that's CGI though.

1978
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:17,080
But yeah, I guess it is a little bit bigger seeming.

1979
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:20,000
Last actual hero shot in there apparently too.

1980
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,320
Yeah, so it became, this must be kind of pre,

1981
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,400
because now they started doing,

1982
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:27,920
then they built all the stuff in like Playa Vista.

1983
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,680
So now if you want the massive hang

1984
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,480
or you go to even Atlanta or whatever.

1985
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,520
So, but I think that was a,

1986
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:37,160
it was yet another thing in the failed armada

1987
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,880
of stuff that Long Beach was trying to do with this area.

1988
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:43,400
The whole thing is in the bones of some of the mazes

1989
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:46,000
we were saying are in these odd little like,

1990
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,360
what is this little, it looks like the thing in San Diego

1991
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:52,000
or there's a lot of towns that have little seaport village

1992
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
kind of like little quaint cottages and stuff.

1993
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,560
And which makes it cool before you go into some

1994
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:58,400
of these mazes, they're like,

1995
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,960
well they're really cool from the outside.

1996
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:04,080
And that was a whole failed thing called London Town.

1997
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,120
I think it had a couple names, but Disney owned that too.

1998
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:08,920
Disney owned all of that.

1999
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,640
That was a little like storybook land

2000
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,360
that Disney could have like turned

2001
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,000
into a little fantasy land experience

2002
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,160
and then it was never in their financial interest to do it.

2003
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,680
So it's a cool thing about Schachtoberfest.

2004
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:22,080
You're in mazes in the rotting husk

2005
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:25,640
of something that Disney owned over 30 years ago.

2006
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,360
That Eisner had to oversee.

2007
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,200
That's the extra special part.

2008
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,600
He must have been, yeah, he had to walk the ground.

2009
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,680
He'd get an update on like the roof caved in

2010
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:38,240
because too many rats were mating on top of the roof

2011
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,000
of the London village.

2012
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,600
Half the guests of the Long Beach,

2013
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,480
of the Queen Mary have left

2014
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,880
because of the WC Fields performer.

2015
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:46,720
We have to replace him.

2016
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,800
He's too in character, sir.

2017
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,480
And isn't there another outcrop of like,

2018
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:56,080
you know, taffy shops and like restaurants.

2019
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,720
Yes, confusingly, I forget the name of the area.

2020
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,160
This thing called Parker's Lighthouse,

2021
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,800
there's a yard house over there.

2022
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:03,880
There's a Truffles the Bear.

2023
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:07,480
That might be the closest area in the LA area

2024
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:09,480
where you can see our favorite sad bear truffles.

2025
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,560
Yes, I took a picture with that truffles

2026
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,640
and sent it to you.

2027
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:16,720
So that is, you kind of have to take a shuttle bus

2028
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:18,600
from the Queen Mary to get to, it's like,

2029
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,640
Oh, and the tourists. Yeah, those aren't close at all.

2030
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,080
They're not close at all.

2031
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,280
This is, I think, some of the problem with Queen Mary

2032
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:27,600
and this little village is that it's a completely

2033
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:31,840
different area than the aquarium and the Pike Mall,

2034
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,080
which has a Bubba Gump's at it.

2035
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,240
Like there's all that, that's a whole zone.

2036
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:37,080
And then like, all right,

2037
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,360
I'll just pop over the Queen Mary.

2038
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:39,480
No, you won't.

2039
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:40,680
That is a big haul.

2040
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:44,280
I don't think there are direct boats to get you there.

2041
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:47,480
There used to be a freebie tourist bus that would hit

2042
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:52,040
like the aquarium, the yard house area, the Queen Mary,

2043
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:56,920
the lighthouse, and God knows after COVID what it's doing.

2044
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,160
If it's still running.

2045
01:18:58,160 --> 01:18:59,000
I don't know.

2046
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,920
And then that's one of those where you got to step back

2047
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:03,360
and go, Disney almost owned all of that.

2048
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,280
The Port Disney plan would have been everything

2049
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,760
we just described is all Disney.

2050
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,600
What a weird alternate Los Angeles that would be.

2051
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:15,400
Well, right, because then you flash right to Disney Sea.

2052
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,120
Yeah, and it all did grow out of that.

2053
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,720
And the fact that there is the Queen Mary

2054
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:21,120
as Scotiabiner in Disney Sea

2055
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,200
is completely started there, I think.

2056
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,040
Yes.

2057
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:26,080
So it's- We would have had, oh, that is,

2058
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,080
and also what if they'd gotten that done

2059
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,960
before it all fell apart, before Euro Disney,

2060
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,840
because Baxter's part of that, right?

2061
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:37,840
We might have had an even better Disney Sea in this city.

2062
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:40,280
Yeah, and it would have been something weird

2063
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,480
because it would be like you have to choose one day

2064
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,960
to drive 90 minutes between,

2065
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,000
you'd have to have chosen one park.

2066
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,240
It would have been odd of the distance.

2067
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:52,840
Yeah, yes, as opposed, yes, Disney World,

2068
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,600
all the parks are a little far, far apart,

2069
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,640
but they're all on one big sprawling property.

2070
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:01,240
Disneyland, Disney has two parks an hour apart,

2071
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,560
maybe about an hour, depending on-

2072
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:03,400
Depending on traffic.

2073
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:06,720
Probably a fleet of buses.

2074
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:11,120
Probably like the Florida, less than the Florida,

2075
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:14,640
but like just a million gas guzzling buses

2076
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,440
running between the two.

2077
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,480
There is that, if you take the fly away

2078
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,560
from Union Station to LAX,

2079
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,800
there's like a lane that the bus goes in

2080
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,760
that does cut down on some of the time,

2081
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,600
so I wonder if-

2082
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:29,520
If Eisner had established the mouse lanes, then yeah.

2083
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,920
If there was a mouse lane.

2084
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:34,240
Or maybe he would have come up with the boring idea

2085
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,320
before Elon.

2086
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:40,520
He would have built tunnels, Mickey Mouse-shaped tunnels,

2087
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:43,040
it's a big circle, and then ears on top,

2088
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:46,120
and that's a bullet train that shoots under

2089
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:48,360
all those cities in the South Bay,

2090
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:53,000
rattles apartments for miles, destroys, just caves in,

2091
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,440
thousands of people lose their homes

2092
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,720
to the Disney bullet train.

2093
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:57,880
After a few years, yeah,

2094
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:00,160
it just destroys everything in its path.

2095
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,120
Yeah, so he would have had to figure something out,

2096
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:06,600
but just the isolated park, if it was Disney Sea level,

2097
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,160
I mean, it would have been nuts.

2098
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,080
Yeah, yeah.

2099
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:09,920
And also-

2100
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,520
Maybe they would have closed Disneyland.

2101
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,360
I was gonna say-

2102
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:13,840
No point, not as good.

2103
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,360
Well, I was gonna say the opposite too,

2104
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:19,320
is that like Disney Sea is kept up so well.

2105
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,240
Everything is so immaculately taken care of.

2106
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,080
This is important, yes.

2107
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,400
And it is, I would think the elements,

2108
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,480
meaning like the ocean being right there,

2109
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:30,040
would take a little more of a toll on a park.

2110
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:34,680
And the air in California being markedly worse than Japan.

2111
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,520
Yes, all of that together,

2112
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,560
and yeah, the ocean being right there,

2113
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,240
and wind, and et cetera, et cetera.

2114
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:44,120
I could imagine that if they had not kept this up,

2115
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:47,480
what Disney Sea and Long Beach looks like.

2116
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:51,360
Oh yeah, they don't have the unlimited money spigot

2117
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:54,320
of like the world's land company.

2118
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,560
They don't wanna spend, yeah.

2119
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:57,960
So what does it look like?

2120
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,480
What does it look like in the down years,

2121
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:02,360
and the pressler years, like especially?

2122
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:04,000
I mean, it looks like even,

2123
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,760
maybe I like the collapsing version

2124
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,400
even better than the new version.

2125
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,240
Maybe.

2126
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,880
So I would be there all the time.

2127
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:12,520
You know, there's this weird decaying Disney park,

2128
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,720
and they ended up not wanting it anymore,

2129
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,840
so they sold it to Six Flags,

2130
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,720
and then they just like, they just sold it to Best Buy.

2131
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,960
It was the first Best Buy theme park for a while.

2132
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:23,200
Best Buy ports.

2133
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:24,040
Uh-huh.

2134
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:26,880
This is the weirdest part of the city.

2135
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,240
I'd be there every weekend.

2136
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:30,160
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm not saying it would be bad.

2137
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,600
I'm just imagining,

2138
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,360
I was first imagining Tokyo Disney Sea,

2139
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:36,520
and then imagining a decaying Tokyo Disney Sea.

2140
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:37,520
Just the scariest thing.

2141
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,920
Which is scary, yeah.

2142
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:40,160
Well, speaking of decaying,

2143
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,080
let's get into the last thing that we did.

2144
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:42,920
Yeah.

2145
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:45,640
Which now, okay, so I was, we're doing an add-on.

2146
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:48,880
We're gonna do the haunted maze in the Queen Mary itself.

2147
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:52,680
Instead, that was just five red lights in an engine room.

2148
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:53,520
Yeah, which is- It turns out

2149
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:56,280
that it was free, what we really wanted.

2150
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,120
Yes.

2151
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,040
Which, or just with admission.

2152
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,920
Cause, yes, all the mazes up until that point

2153
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:02,080
had been like little pop-ups,

2154
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,680
or part of the Seaport Village thing,

2155
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:05,520
and just like repurposing that area,

2156
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,800
and then there was a clown maze, little circus thing.

2157
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:09,640
Oh yeah, we talked about that, yeah, yeah.

2158
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,760
Fairly small.

2159
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:15,480
But yeah, obviously that's not there all year round.

2160
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:18,360
But yes, this is in the ship,

2161
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,560
which seems like, of course, the most fun thing,

2162
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:24,160
because it's using the actual haunted ship

2163
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:25,120
to make a maze.

2164
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,160
The Grey Ghost is the name of it,

2165
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:28,840
which is something they actually call the ship.

2166
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:30,920
This might be new this year,

2167
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,320
and you're just in, it's not an engine room,

2168
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,600
you're just in like inexplicable bowels.

2169
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,160
I don't know enough of what's on a ship

2170
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,680
to know where the hell we are.

2171
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,840
Right. It's so scary in there.

2172
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:43,400
I don't care who's jumping out or what else is in it.

2173
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:46,680
Just it itself is so creepy.

2174
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:49,160
That's what I was saying when Bug and I were walking,

2175
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:51,560
and I go, I actually think it might be even scarier

2176
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,760
if they didn't have these scare actors in here,

2177
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:58,760
because it's so odd being in a very, very old ship's

2178
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:02,640
like basement or whatever, and it's just very like,

2179
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,520
I, while we walked through it fast,

2180
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,920
and correct me if I'm wrong,

2181
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,920
it almost felt like it was just like concrete,

2182
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:12,720
or stone, and like pipes, and like,

2183
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:14,840
I'm just like, it feels old.

2184
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:17,040
You can feel that you're somewhere

2185
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,840
that has existed for a long time.

2186
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,040
Yeah, yes.

2187
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:21,840
And it's odd, it feels odd in there.

2188
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,800
They are playing music and sound effects as well,

2189
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:29,240
but it's, you can't escape the actual creepy place you're in.

2190
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,360
Yeah, mainly it's just, yeah.

2191
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:34,240
Like if they didn't touch it at all, it'd be something.

2192
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:36,120
It's just a cool place to walk through.

2193
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:38,680
And it goes for a while too,

2194
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:40,560
and you can't quite tell where you are,

2195
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,760
and there are some places where you see like stairs,

2196
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,080
and it's like, you can't go that way.

2197
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,480
But there's a few places where you're like,

2198
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:49,000
I'm not sure which way we're supposed to go.

2199
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:49,840
Yes.

2200
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,960
And then, yeah, and there's scare actors,

2201
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:53,160
and they're jumping out at you.

2202
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,360
Some of the better ones too.

2203
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,600
Some of the bigger scares, I think, the whole night.

2204
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:57,440
Well, yeah.

2205
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,280
I'm glad we saved the last.

2206
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:59,840
For sure the second part, bigger scares.

2207
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,120
Yeah. Absolutely.

2208
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:03,000
So you're walking through, and then we walk through a room,

2209
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
and there's like an old singer with the old time microphone,

2210
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,960
and we kind of like do this like switchback

2211
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:09,960
around her singing.

2212
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:11,760
She's like a ghost singing, and you're like,

2213
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,920
that's creepy or whatever.

2214
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:14,760
And-

2215
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:17,360
They haven't used microphones like that in many decades.

2216
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:20,360
I'm so unnerved to see an old style microphone.

2217
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,320
Why do they do them all flat like that?

2218
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:27,320
Only if big bad voodoo daddy has one, am I okay saying that?

2219
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:30,120
And then, yeah, so then we get to the end.

2220
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:32,880
I'm trying to remember if there's anything else

2221
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,200
noteworthy of that section,

2222
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:37,160
just other than being in the ship like that.

2223
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:40,640
And then all of a sudden, somebody pops out,

2224
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:41,640
and I remember what she was wearing.

2225
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,800
She was wearing like a military outfit,

2226
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,640
and she asks the question of the group,

2227
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:51,640
do you want to exit, or do you want to be recruited?

2228
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:52,760
Yeah, I think so.

2229
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:53,960
Basically. Be recruited.

2230
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:56,200
She goes, do you wanna exit, or do you wanna be recruited?

2231
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,880
She's yelling, and there's music playing,

2232
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:00,480
and I go, well, we wanna be recruited.

2233
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,240
And she goes, all right, this way.

2234
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:05,200
So I guess that maybe they're like, if somebody's scared,

2235
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,080
they just let them out this exit here.

2236
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,840
So we all of a sudden, I think we went upstairs.

2237
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:09,960
Is that right? Mm-hmm.

2238
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,680
And there was no question, no hesitation,

2239
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:13,200
even from Scaredy Scott.

2240
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:14,640
Of course I need to see more.

2241
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:17,400
Yes, so we go upstairs,

2242
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:21,160
and now we're in like a war of some kind.

2243
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:24,200
We've gone from a quiet sort of ship's basement,

2244
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:25,400
or whatever you want to call it,

2245
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,000
whatever it's called, the bowels.

2246
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,560
Let's call it the bowels. Sure.

2247
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,120
And then you go upstairs, and now we are in a war,

2248
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:36,120
and pretty quickly, we see like battle station equipment.

2249
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,000
To me, that's what it looks like.

2250
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,680
Like launch missiles or something.

2251
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:45,040
Yeah, is it just normal ship controls?

2252
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,120
Probably, is it fake?

2253
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,600
I don't know, it doesn't look fake to me.

2254
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:51,520
It looks legitimate, but I'm also walking through it,

2255
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:54,320
and there's a lot of cacophony of noise happening.

2256
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,840
But we all like kind of cheer, I think, at it.

2257
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:58,240
Yeah. We're like, yeah,

2258
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:59,800
there's a plot turn in this.

2259
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,280
We're in a war now?

2260
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:05,760
Yeah, and it's very loud, and it's very chaotic,

2261
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,920
and you're going through this,

2262
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,760
and there's a lot of scares.

2263
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:12,480
At one point, they have an effect where barrels,

2264
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:14,760
there's an area where all these barrels are being stored,

2265
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:16,680
and in the middle, all of a sudden,

2266
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:19,440
the barrels break free and roll,

2267
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:23,080
and hit the chain link fence, and make a loud noise.

2268
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:24,400
And we're like, ah!

2269
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,920
And it's just like everyone's yelling,

2270
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,200
and I think having a good time,

2271
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:29,520
because it's like a thing a minute,

2272
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,840
or a second, I should say, of a scare or this.

2273
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:35,760
People in these little,

2274
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,680
I don't know if they came out of barrels or something,

2275
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:41,880
little tiny spaces, and they'd pop it open and go, ah!

2276
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:43,560
And you'd be like, Jesus Christ.

2277
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:47,560
And it was a really fun sprint

2278
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:50,600
through this area of the ship.

2279
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,360
And I'm trying to think if there's anything else

2280
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:54,560
specifically in that area,

2281
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:57,320
other than just sort of the chaos of it.

2282
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:58,560
And then it just spits you out

2283
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:01,120
by the place where we had a tiki drink,

2284
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,120
and it was like, that's really good.

2285
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:05,640
That's one of my favorite mazes of the year.

2286
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:07,000
Wow. It's not the favorite one.

2287
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:09,680
And then I said, because you were asking me,

2288
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,400
I don't know if this is,

2289
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:12,560
like you were like, is that like,

2290
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,160
the other one's like this?

2291
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:15,200
And I'm like, yeah, basically.

2292
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,600
And then I was like, well, that's about as intense

2293
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,280
as the other ones are.

2294
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,400
You made me feel great.

2295
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,960
I still was thinking that this was some kind of like,

2296
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:27,440
stepped back, not as well done kind of maze situation.

2297
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:30,200
And when you said, no, that's pretty much it,

2298
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:31,960
I felt like, wait, well, I've done it.

2299
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:32,960
I've done it now.

2300
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:35,440
You conquered it, I think.

2301
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,800
I think, dare I say.

2302
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:39,560
I was waiting for it.

2303
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,600
Scott loves haunts.

2304
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,600
Well, you only Scott can declare it.

2305
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,240
So it sounds like he loves haunts.

2306
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,720
I mean, look, it's a lot,

2307
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,520
I could still see myself have it.

2308
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,760
I still hear about things at Knotson Universe.

2309
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:51,960
And we'll assess.

2310
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,320
I haven't done the other ones you have.

2311
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:54,880
We'll talk about other things.

2312
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:57,200
We'll see if things still sound scary to me.

2313
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:00,880
I mean, it's on the table that Scott loves haunts.

2314
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:02,760
One thing is unquestionable, however,

2315
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:05,200
which is Scott loves Shacktoberfests.

2316
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:07,280
Well, at least we know that.

2317
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,040
Now, is this gonna be,

2318
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,800
I mean, unless you decide to go to some haunts,

2319
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,640
we're starting out the month like this.

2320
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:14,680
You did not go to any other haunts with me.

2321
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,960
No, you've done them all already, didn't go.

2322
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:17,800
We'll see.

2323
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,600
I mean, if you have a few surprises or anything.

2324
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:20,440
So it's fun.

2325
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,080
I was thinking about the Horror Nights.

2326
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,760
I did have something else I had to do.

2327
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:27,680
I'm getting closer though, getting closer than this year.

2328
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:30,440
And you know who got me much, much closer than ever before?

2329
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:31,440
Shack. Shack.

2330
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,280
Yep. So, Diesel did it.

2331
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:36,560
This is a big deal on the podcast, I think.

2332
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:37,400
Yeah.

2333
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:38,560
And it's buying the paywall too.

2334
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,880
So only the subscribers will know

2335
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,400
the character development that's happened here.

2336
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:45,160
You have to get the captain's combo.

2337
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:48,040
You have to get the podcast or a captain's combo

2338
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:51,360
with the bravery experience,

2339
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:54,200
the leveled up bravery experience.

2340
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:59,120
And I say, listen to this one.

2341
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:00,840
I mean, we're coming towards the end of it here,

2342
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:04,240
but you know, I demand that in celebration of me

2343
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:06,120
making it through a haunt

2344
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:08,760
and just maybe even getting close to loving haunts,

2345
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:13,480
in my honor, please pour yourself one shot of Captain Morgan

2346
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,320
and another shot that is Captain Morgan,

2347
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:18,040
but also something else in there.

2348
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:19,440
But only take one.

2349
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:20,600
Don't take both.

2350
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:21,600
Do not take both.

2351
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:22,440
Don't take them both.

2352
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:23,440
Throw the other one in the trash.

2353
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:24,280
Yeah.

2354
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:25,800
But make sure to pour them both.

2355
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:27,440
I do think it's very funny.

2356
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:30,760
They rum punch, not usually a beverage shot.

2357
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:34,480
I believe like gradually sipped.

2358
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:37,000
Captain, a shot that's like half Captain Morgan

2359
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,120
and half Grenadine.

2360
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:40,520
You know I love my sweets.

2361
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:42,760
That sounds disgusting to me.

2362
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,280
Might've been.

2363
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:47,680
One of us should have done it to be able to tell for sure

2364
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,840
or try your own at home.

2365
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:50,520
If you bought two captain's combos,

2366
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,640
maybe we could have done it.

2367
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:53,240
I guess what we would recommend is,

2368
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:56,040
well, go get to Shacktoberfest as fast as you can

2369
01:30:56,040 --> 01:31:00,400
and make sure you, or let's say do three captain's combos.

2370
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:01,880
Yeah, that's good.

2371
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:03,920
And then you'll be able to experience all the ways.

2372
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:07,760
Did that give you anything secret in Dead Man's Wharf?

2373
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:10,440
Do you remember that maze?

2374
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:13,240
I have to say my recollection of Dead Man's Wharf

2375
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:16,160
versus Pirate's Cove and what is different

2376
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:18,800
between the two is next to none.

2377
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:22,440
Well, Dead Man's Wharf was less pirate ship based

2378
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:26,040
and more like whatever the Seaport Village's houses were.

2379
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:26,880
Yeah.

2380
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:29,600
So we were outside a little more in like a garden

2381
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:32,240
and the Pirate's Cove felt like we were

2382
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:34,560
walking around a ship more.

2383
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:38,040
But we didn't get any, there was no upgrade for the maze.

2384
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:40,480
And the other one was more just like wandering around

2385
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:43,560
a dirty abandoned taffy shop or something.

2386
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:45,160
Well, no, that's something you would,

2387
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:46,000
you're dreaming of.

2388
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,560
Oh, that's, yeah, that's in my mind palace.

2389
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,600
Yeah, I store vital memories in there.

2390
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:52,640
That's the only time, if we find out

2391
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:56,120
there's one of these haunts has an abandoned taffy maze,

2392
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:58,440
then finally I think we'll get Jason to love haunts.

2393
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:00,200
Oh boy, the evil taffy maker

2394
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,600
who makes taffy out of people.

2395
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:03,440
That's right.

2396
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:04,280
Oh, sure.

2397
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:06,560
But it's delicious, so he's on board.

2398
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,320
Look, if these toy companies keep making stuff,

2399
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:13,520
it won't be too long before we get a Candy Land based haunt.

2400
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:14,360
Oh, interesting. With Gloopy.

2401
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:15,640
What do you mean with like movie,

2402
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:17,480
like a movie of Candy Land or?

2403
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:19,800
Oh, I just meant like a walkthrough maze.

2404
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,840
Oh, but that's not gonna be a scary one.

2405
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,520
Oh, it could be a little scary.

2406
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,080
You know, this Barney movie is apparently terrifying

2407
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,480
or not terrifying at all.

2408
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:28,480
We don't know.

2409
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:29,320
There's some conflicting reports on

2410
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:30,640
if the Barney movie is weird or not.

2411
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:31,520
Yeah.

2412
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,480
The studio's saying it's not weird,

2413
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:36,280
but other places are saying it's weird.

2414
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:37,120
Yeah.

2415
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:37,960
So we'll see.

2416
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:40,720
So you're saying the Candy Land movie is maybe weird

2417
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:41,680
when it comes out?

2418
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:45,680
I mean, yeah, you're terrorized by Gloopy, you know?

2419
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:46,520
Yes.

2420
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:48,000
Haunted by Grandma Nut.

2421
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,200
Well, she comes to you in your dreams every night.

2422
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:53,600
Grandma Nut.

2423
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,980
Grandma Nut, don't mind if I do.

2424
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:58,860
What am I, in a pumpkin patch?

2425
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:02,500
All right, well, you survived

2426
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:05,620
Honkest, The Fright, The Cemetery Gate.

2427
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:08,820
We got Honkest, The Fright merch in our T-Public store.

2428
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:11,740
You can get one more boo-ness episode

2429
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:15,220
on our RIP tier Crypt 3,

2430
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:17,340
where we will soon be talking about Tower of Terror,

2431
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:21,060
the 1997 film with Kristen Dunstan, Steve Gutenberg.

2432
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:21,900
Oh yeah.

2433
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:24,820
And as a Patreon.com slash podcast,

2434
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:26,060
or while you're there and you're here,

2435
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:29,660
just subscribe, again, do the VIP,

2436
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:34,660
do take a VIP slam dunk all the way up to level three.

2437
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:35,740
Yeah.

2438
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:36,580
For sure.

2439
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:37,740
Let me quickly just read,

2440
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:40,380
there was a list of 50 great Shaq endorsements.

2441
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:41,220
Oh, I forgot about this.

2442
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:42,060
Yeah.

2443
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:44,300
50, a sleep apnea mask.

2444
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:46,140
There are 50, there's 50?

2445
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:46,980
50 of them, yeah.

2446
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:48,780
There's enough to make 50.

2447
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:50,020
Yes.

2448
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:53,260
Susta Sugar Substitute,

2449
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:56,460
he was endorsing Apollo Jets, which is like.

2450
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:57,620
You know, I love tricks and treats,

2451
01:33:57,620 --> 01:34:01,020
but I also love treats that don't eat into your calorie count.

2452
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:04,140
He did Radio Shaq for a while.

2453
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:07,940
He was promoting that social media tout for a while.

2454
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:08,780
You remember tout?

2455
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:09,620
I remember tout.

2456
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:11,300
Oh, right, I was resting on a tout about it.

2457
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:12,140
That's right.

2458
01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:14,180
He had Shaq Soda,

2459
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:17,100
which was from the Arizona beverages team.

2460
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:21,020
Oh, I brought Shaq Soda to an event.

2461
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:22,180
It was a social event once,

2462
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:24,900
and no one was happy to see it.

2463
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:25,740
My record.

2464
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:27,540
Mike was vaguely happy.

2465
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:28,860
I hate to open this up.

2466
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:30,020
I hate to open this up real quick,

2467
01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:30,860
but there was an event,

2468
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:33,060
I think it was our Herald team was getting together,

2469
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:35,300
and everyone brought a little dessert or dish.

2470
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:38,620
Jason showed up with, I swear, one can of Shaq Soda.

2471
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:40,940
No, I brought up three cans.

2472
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:41,780
But there's eight of us.

2473
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:45,020
No, no, it was for a while,

2474
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:49,140
7-Eleven was selling roll cakes, Swiss roll cakes.

2475
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:52,300
Everyone had spent at least like 15, $10 on whatever it was,

2476
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:54,060
and it was clear you rolled over to 7-Eleven,

2477
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:55,620
which was right around the corner,

2478
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:57,740
and it was under $5.

2479
01:34:57,740 --> 01:34:58,940
I bought a bunch of Shaq Soda,

2480
01:34:58,940 --> 01:35:00,780
and I brought a roll cake.

2481
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:02,020
Not a bunch of Shaq Soda.

2482
01:35:02,020 --> 01:35:04,020
I thought people would be excited for it.

2483
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:05,500
Does three count as a bunch?

2484
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,700
It was pretty clear you had spent less than everyone.

2485
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:08,900
That's all I remember.

2486
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:11,420
I don't know, that roll cake and those Shaq Sodas

2487
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:12,260
weren't cheap.

2488
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:13,340
It was pretty clear you bought what you would buy

2489
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:15,260
if you were just going to 7-Eleven for yourself,

2490
01:35:15,260 --> 01:35:17,060
and maybe added an extra soda.

2491
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:19,020
Well, I asked, would you rather

2492
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:21,380
I just bought a bottle of Barefoot wine?

2493
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:22,620
Everyone, yes.

2494
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:24,620
Yeah, yeah, that at least would have looked more like

2495
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:25,700
it was communal.

2496
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:27,340
But what are we doing with Barefoot?

2497
01:35:27,340 --> 01:35:28,180
Well, 7-Eleven.

2498
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:30,020
Yeah, 7-Eleven, that's pretty good.

2499
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:31,540
Well, of course, somewhere else.

2500
01:35:31,540 --> 01:35:33,980
Wait a minute, a roll cake that you bought?

2501
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:35,860
Is that a cake from 7-Eleven?

2502
01:35:35,860 --> 01:35:36,700
Well, they were selling cakes for-

2503
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:39,580
It's a little, it's like a slightly bigger Twinkie.

2504
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:40,420
It was not big.

2505
01:35:40,420 --> 01:35:41,820
It was big.

2506
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:42,660
It was not big.

2507
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:45,660
It was big, because I ate it for the next few days.

2508
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:46,500
He ate it.

2509
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:48,380
You brought a cake to a party,

2510
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:50,220
and then kept it and kept feeding it?

2511
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:51,860
And people ate it, and then they were like,

2512
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:54,340
I don't want this here, take it.

2513
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:55,180
The cake was not big.

2514
01:35:55,180 --> 01:35:58,900
They were like that when you ventriloquized them

2515
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:00,620
to say that, hey, remember, you should take the cake.

2516
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:02,380
Hey, yeah, good idea.

2517
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:04,620
We're recording, well, we're recording a couple people-

2518
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:06,700
This was like 10 years ago, by the way.

2519
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:09,340
Mike is still remembering the details of this.

2520
01:36:09,340 --> 01:36:11,460
Look, if you have, it's been said on the show before,

2521
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:13,220
Mike, I think it's been said, right?

2522
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:15,220
Mike remembers every single thing

2523
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:17,420
that Jason has ever done.

2524
01:36:17,420 --> 01:36:21,340
We're recording with people that were there fairly soon.

2525
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:24,340
We'll talk about this multiple times, maybe.

2526
01:36:24,340 --> 01:36:25,180
Okay.

2527
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:26,020
Hey.

2528
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:28,020
It seems like a good place to start.

2529
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:30,820
Hey, if my memory's wrong, I will apologize.

2530
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:36,740
Oh, Jason, Mike, Jason brought 25 cans.

2531
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:38,140
It was a bounty.

2532
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:39,780
We gave them to people on the street,

2533
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:41,300
people in need. It might have been one can.

2534
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:43,140
It might have been one can of Chapssoda.

2535
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:45,620
Two different flavors so everyone could try it,

2536
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:47,740
and it was bad, okay?

2537
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:53,860
And keep in mind also, they're shack sized, so.

2538
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:54,700
Okay, that's fair.

2539
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:55,540
They were large.

2540
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:57,620
Which means they're just a little bit bigger.
