1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,420
Warning, the following podcast takes place under the sea, but you won't find any singing

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:17,000
crabs or crustacean bands here, just soulless ocean life and the unforgiving weather controlling

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,720
bodies of water that exist on the brutal planet earth.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,120
Yeah, it's the living seas on podcast, the ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:52,600
Welcome to podcast the ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three sea base alpha males.

8
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,080
I'm Scott Garner joined by Mike Carlson.

9
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:03,280
Yeah, that is maybe like the most aggressive we could possibly sound if there was like,

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,600
we're tough guys, but we love Epcot.

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,960
That makes a lot of sense to me.

12
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,280
So I really like that.

13
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
Thank you.

14
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,320
It'd be a fair name for one of those gangs or social gathering groups.

15
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,000
I forget what euphemism they were using.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,320
But if that had to be ours, if it isn't one already, it might be one already and we're

17
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,120
really messing with their territory.

18
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:34,120
Jason Sheridan, the third male, CBS Alpha sounds like a marketing department was trying

19
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:40,840
to clean up the image for the term wet blanket or wet noodle.

20
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
So I guess that's right.

21
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,520
I guess that's trying to make wet blankets desirable.

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,920
Yeah, yeah, they get they get like, you know, something people desire, something people

23
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,920
people want.

24
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,920
Well, yeah.

25
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,400
You're upset because you don't like that wet blanket is used as a bad thing because

26
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,560
you love a wet blanket.

27
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,920
You love to sleep soaking wet.

28
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,320
You love to be wet from head to toe constantly.

29
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
Sure.

30
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,320
Yes.

31
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,000
Did OK.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,680
Did I bail on an Airbnb once because all of the bedding was still soaking wet?

33
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,360
Yes, I did.

34
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,240
We have heard that and that was shocking to me.

35
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,160
Some wetness is fun wetness, wetness that you're fond of, but not all.

36
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
All right.

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,240
Clothing, clothing wetness, not blanket and bedding wetness.

38
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,960
Yeah, let's let's that seems to be the boundary.

39
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
Yeah.

40
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,960
OK.

41
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
All right.

42
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
All right.

43
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
I apologize.

44
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:44,600
Are we are we fond of today's wetness brought to you by the Living Seas, an Epcot attraction

45
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,280
that is our topic today.

46
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,320
And we're doing it today because this day that you're listening to it, if you're listening

47
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:59,280
to it on the release, it is January 15th and on January 15th, 1986, this ride opened 35

48
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,240
years ago on this very day, which is a stat that makes me feel very old.

49
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
Oh, my God.

50
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,080
Yeah, we're we're like, there's like a couple of years left for us.

51
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,960
I think like it doesn't.

52
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,760
I think about sorry to take it in an extra dark place.

53
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,520
It's just it's crazy time, time existing and seeing all these videos and going, oh, OK,

54
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,240
that was 30 years ago.

55
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
How old am I?

56
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Oh, shit.

57
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
Yeah.

58
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
Yeah, I know.

59
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,080
It doesn't square with your own age a lot.

60
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,400
I think it's just weird because we were very little when Disneyland had its 35th anniversary,

61
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,920
which is an indelible thing for me at least.

62
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,720
And I'm just seeing 35 a lot.

63
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,840
I couldn't imagine a bigger number.

64
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,080
Yeah, I didn't think I'd make it to 35, much less beyond.

65
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
Sure.

66
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,360
I was I was looking at archival footage and I was looking at the dates on YouTube and

67
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,560
on the website on different websites and I was eating an Airhead and it didn't square

68
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,040
with me because I'm like, I'm eating like a child and I still think of myself like a

69
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,280
child.

70
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,760
But yet this tells me I'm not a child.

71
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,360
I am far from it.

72
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
I.

73
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Yeah.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I love this.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I love the living seas.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,040
I feel like it always caught me off guard.

77
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,760
It's so often the corner of Epcot and it was such a unique experience of like a standing

78
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:29,360
pre-show, a theater pre-show, the hydrolator.

79
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,760
I love the hydrolator.

80
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:36,760
I loved and feared the hydrolator and the sea cabs.

81
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,240
So it was like a sequence of experiences as opposed to I think the Martin's vids on this

82
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
is really good.

83
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,040
He points out that like, oh, the other pavilions had like one key attraction each.

84
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,760
This is like a sequence that you experience and it's very unique.

85
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:59,000
And that also helped them control crowd flow because it does eat a lot of people per hour.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,360
Yeah, it's it's well, here's what I'll say.

87
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,320
We talked a little bit.

88
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,200
We did a Horizons episode a couple of months ago at this point, right?

89
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
That was a couple of months.

90
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,320
That wasn't 35 years ago.

91
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
I don't know.

92
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,400
I mean, it's been a long last few weeks.

93
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,680
So yeah, so we did that and we were sort of talking and I think Scott and I more agreed

94
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,400
that as kid brains, a lot of these Epcot rides sort of blended together.

95
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,480
Like you could have shown me maybe a video now or whenever the first time I started

96
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,520
watching like old retro videos, you could have put in a scene from living seas.

97
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,360
You could have put a scene in from world of motion and my brain would have gone,

98
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,280
oh, that makes sense.

99
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,040
That looks right.

100
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,840
Um, and then we sort of were also talking about how it felt like Epcot was a concept

101
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,040
album, you know, it was a challenging second album and they were sort of, everything

102
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,680
actually felt like it fit together.

103
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,720
You could maybe take out pieces of rides and put them somewhere else and they would

104
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,000
kind of thematically feel similar.

105
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:04,200
So I will say as a kid, the living seas didn't make a huge impression on me.

106
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,000
I don't have such fond memories of the hydrolator.

107
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,160
I love the hydrolator now in my adult years, seeing it.

108
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't get me wrong.

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,600
Don't come for the, come for me with pitchforks yet, but I will say I didn't have such

110
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,200
a nostalgia for it as much as I did for like figment himself and then the nostalgia

111
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,760
of Epcot, which of course I love.

112
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,960
I think part of my nostalgia is I bought it.

113
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,280
I bought that we had to go.

114
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,800
I was like, well, we're not going to the bottom of the sea, but clearly you have to

115
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,840
go down to get to the transit, to get to the aquarium section of this.

116
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,840
Are you accusing me of not buying it as a child?

117
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,800
Well, I don't know.

118
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,760
Do you think you did?

119
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,000
I especially loved that you had to play along.

120
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,240
You had to take a hydrolator to exit, like not the ones with the full windows, but

121
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,640
like they had X you couldn't just now you just, when we were at the current

122
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,320
iteration, you'd walk in and out of the gift shop.

123
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,760
You don't have to take the ride.

124
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,400
No, I, this has nothing to do with me buying it or not as a kid.

125
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,600
I was scared of all this.

126
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,880
I thought this was all real.

127
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,480
I'm just saying as a kid, I just don't have such strong memories of it.

128
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,520
Like other pieces.

129
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,640
I think you also went a little more often than we did.

130
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,040
That's true.

131
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,560
Yeah.

132
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,920
We went every two to three years and then every year for very, very

133
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,880
brief period of time.

134
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,320
Sure.

135
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:24,760
Sure.

136
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,960
So I, I'm just trying to give a picture of exactly where my enjoyment lies.

137
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:30,880
Yeah.

138
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,920
There's, I feel like I'm, I was sort of neither here nor there.

139
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,920
I, I like it was, wouldn't have been my favorite Epcot thing.

140
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,720
Probably wouldn't have been my least favorite Epcot thing.

141
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,080
There's a strong opinion about this attraction in my household.

142
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,480
And I'm not, I'm not sure if I should get into that now or if we get to that

143
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,440
part of the, of the thing.

144
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,160
I, because if there is anything more introductory to do, actually one thing

145
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,000
I've, we forgot, we're just calling it the living seas today.

146
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And for a long time, this attraction has been the seas with Nemo and friends.

147
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,400
But that's one of those, are we going to call this episode the seas with

148
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,320
Nemo and friends?

149
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,760
I don't think you got to go back to the original title.

150
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,320
Yeah.

151
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,800
And look, to be honest, I didn't know they had changed the name.

152
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,960
I thought that's what they were just calling the ride.

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,720
I didn't know the whole pavilion is now called that.

154
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,320
I just missed that at some point because so much of it is still kind of standing,

155
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,440
especially, I mean, my family too, we were a big coral reef restaurant family.

156
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,120
And I have not been there in years.

157
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,880
I want to go now that I've seen the official like on the Disney website.

158
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,760
It has, it's like a perfect, perfect fossil, like a fly preserved in amber.

159
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,720
It has not aged apparently.

160
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,480
Yeah.

161
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,760
It's very early nineties, doesn't it?

162
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,280
Yeah.

163
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,120
And I think this kind of busy mosaic design style, I think it's coming back.

164
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,680
I think this like minimalist, dark metal, dark wood, Johnny Rockets shit is on its way out.

165
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,680
I look, I hope not.

166
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,560
I hope it lasts forever.

167
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,280
Lindy and I went like seven years ago to that restaurant.

168
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:10,840
Yeah.

169
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,680
And there was a giant rock in the tank and all of a sudden we realized it was a

170
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,920
turtle and it moved and we were delighted.

171
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,040
And that's the magic of the living seas.

172
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,680
That's right.

173
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,200
And then we looked down and we just ate a dead fish off of a plate.

174
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,400
Okay.

175
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,440
That's the, that's the conundrum of the living seas.

176
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,480
That's the paradox of the living seas.

177
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,200
Of course.

178
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,200
Yes.

179
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,200
I some, the, should we say some basics about it before we, and this is personally on

180
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,040
my mind because the last time we did an Epcot attraction was Horizons.

181
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:48,160
Uh, uh, friend question mark of the show, Nick Mundy, uh, listened to the episode,

182
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,960
hadn't heard an episode in a while and then gave me the feedback.

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,160
It's like you're speaking a foreign language.

184
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,920
It's like you were speaking Spanish.

185
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
I didn't know what the hell you were talking about.

186
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,840
So now I've got Mundy just like with a fist in his hand behind me in my head, uh,

187
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,680
telling me to explain what the rides are.

188
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,200
I think we did fairly well.

189
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,400
I don't know.

190
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,080
What do you like?

191
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,040
Hey, is Mundy in line there?

192
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,600
What do you think?

193
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,040
Uh, I think he texted and criticized the episode to me as well.

194
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:18,280
Uh, he'd have to look if he's, if he's like running around town, like doing errands,

195
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,000
like sometimes he will give me a phone call while he's doing that.

196
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,240
And then he was also listening and like, he's at like a grocery store and they're

197
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,880
like saying, Mr.

198
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,000
Mundy, here's your order.

199
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,720
And he's trying, like, you're not going to, you're not going to pick up on what

200
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,440
Horizons is it's too weird.

201
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,480
It's too ethereal.

202
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,840
It's too like, if he was sitting down listening intently, then I would be a

203
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,880
little more concerned.

204
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,840
I'm guessing though.

205
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,080
If we, if we sat him down and said, okay, we'll explain it to you.

206
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,320
It's a ride that offers different visions of what the future might be.

207
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,120
Hopeful visions brought to you by Jenner.

208
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,440
Like how quickly would he just like turn to his phone or leave the room or

209
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,080
punch us in the jaw?

210
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,280
Yeah, he would just, there would be an urge to just put our head in a toilet or

211
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,680
pull our underwear up, uh, hard from our back of our pants.

212
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,120
Well, he wouldn't be able to resist that or throw a dodge ball at our head.

213
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,160
He just, a Dodger ball would sort of like materialize in his hand and he

214
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,480
would whip it at our head.

215
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,280
He's still trying to solve the problem of fire bad.

216
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,040
Uh, so we got a towel.

217
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,680
It's like, no, it's not always bad.

218
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,560
There's different, uh, there's different, it's very useful in some occasions.

219
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,000
Mundy, Mundy is a Frankenstein.

220
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,240
Yeah, that's what that is.

221
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,280
It's a cave man.

222
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,720
I think it's what Jason is calling him.

223
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,680
Jason as usual has taken Scott and I's good natured ribbing up to an 11.

224
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,200
All the way up the hydra later.

225
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,320
Jason wants to look in wrestling, you gotta keep building up the feud, you know?

226
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,120
And Jason wants to build that feud up for when Mundy comes back on the

227
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,520
show and I appreciate that he's working an angle.

228
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,240
That's what he's doing.

229
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,440
Oh, I, I can only hope.

230
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,120
I can only hope he puts me through a table.

231
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,200
He puts me through an announcer's table.

232
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,560
I will double mask if we, if we figured out a way for Mundy to put me through a

233
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,920
table in these trying times.

234
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,080
There was, there was talk at the Orlando live show of, uh, Matt Cardona putting

235
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,000
you through something, but it didn't materialize.

236
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,600
So hopefully that happens at a certain point on one of these shows.

237
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,520
I thought it was supposed to be, I hit him with a chair.

238
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,320
We talked about that, but I talked about scenarios.

239
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,600
Yeah, there were a couple of scenarios and yeah, for sure.

240
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,240
Sure.

241
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,440
One of them was you taking a bump of some kind.

242
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,120
Yeah.

243
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,120
Um, okay.

244
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,440
Mundy will be the one, the untrained, the non-trained wrestler will be the one to

245
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:37,720
hurt you.

246
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,720
That's fine.

247
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,760
Uh, but no back to eat.

248
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,880
He makes a very fair point.

249
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,360
Yes, we should, we should, uh, uh, full on explain.

250
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,440
We should make sure we're still doing that.

251
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,360
It's good to refresh the basics.

252
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,000
It's good to get back to basics.

253
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,480
You know, he's the way he told us to do the podcast and now he has a new note for

254
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,200
us and I want to make good.

255
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,880
The godfather of the podcast.

256
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,640
No, um, one helpful thing godfather of the year.

257
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,200
Um, one helpful thing I think about this attraction is that at the time that it

258
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,080
was built, it was based around what was, what was then the largest saltwater tank

259
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,960
on earth, which is full of aquatic animals.

260
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,320
So it is a lot of attractions based around that.

261
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,160
Um, that, that, so the restaurant you guys are talking about the coral reef

262
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,040
restaurant, that is a restaurant where you had a view of the creatures in the

263
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,680
tank, uh, as you ate, as you ate fish bizarrely.

264
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,680
Uh, but the primary illusion that it's trying to create is not just like an

265
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,640
aquarium here, you're going to go look at the tank.

266
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:46,280
It's that you are actually going to a sea base, a futuristic sea base, which

267
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,120
you're led to believe is underwater.

268
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,160
And, um, so there's various forms of transport that take you all the way, not

269
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,520
just like a couple of feet away, but in theory, like far, far down and far, many

270
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,320
leagues under the sea, if you will, uh, to this fully immersed underwater sea base.

271
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,360
Um, it isn't fully immersed.

272
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,840
That was kind of the intent initially, but now it's just, you know, uh, built

273
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,480
around this, this giant tank and with lots of amazing views of it.

274
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,200
Yes.

275
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:20,080
So it is a basically, uh, uh, there's an omnimover like haunted mansion ride

276
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,480
system, and there's a big aquarium with a restaurant.

277
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,920
That's the simple version.

278
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,520
It's a big, mostly is a big aquarium.

279
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,880
There's people that work in there tending to the fish.

280
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,760
There's a little shows, there's information, their stuff has changed over

281
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,200
the years, but that's sort of the basic, um, as they have, uh, like, uh, fish and

282
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,520
aquatic life that have like been harmed that they're rehabilitating.

283
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:44,800
Yeah.

284
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,360
Which we saw last time we were there.

285
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,320
Uh, big variety, um, the manatees, you got to raise, you got all, all kinds of

286
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,960
cool stuff, which was my takeaway.

287
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,680
Um, being there last year was, well, you just forget how great this is.

288
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,440
Uh, like just, just the base, just like, oh yeah, within this day at Epcot,

289
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,160
that's always cool where you experience a lot of things like, oh, like,

290
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,960
here's the stint of the day where you see just a lot of cool animals.

291
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,520
It's very neat.

292
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,120
Yeah.

293
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,120
And it's, yes, it's obviously years before animal kingdom, but it is like similar

294
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,480
in the same idea where they were like, oh shit, we have to get a ton of people

295
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,280
who know what they're doing to maintain a giant aquarium with a variety of

296
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,200
fish and, and marine life.

297
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,400
Uh, yeah.

298
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,720
If you watch the, there's a national geographic series about animal

299
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,120
kingdom on Disney plus.

300
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,400
And they, they do have to go to the living seas a lot to like, like one of

301
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,760
the manatees is they they're worried it's ill or he, he ate something he shouldn't

302
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,240
have.

303
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:58,880
Um, so sometimes they needed to transport, uh, sea life to, uh, from the living

304
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,200
seas to animal kingdom, cause that's where they have like extra animal care

305
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,680
stuff.

306
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,480
Uh, although there are plenty of marine biologists and, and such working at the

307
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,920
living seas, it's a real like licensed and certified, uh, rescue center and

308
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,720
aquarium.

309
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:15,760
Yeah.

310
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,960
Um, so that is what it is basically still now.

311
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,120
That's what it was.

312
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,120
Plottier aquarium really ultimately.

313
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,080
Most aquariums don't have stories.

314
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,000
That's true.

315
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,360
Yeah.

316
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,120
That's what it does more.

317
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,080
So should we, could we start with it's like what it might've been?

318
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,240
Yeah, that was interesting to me to discover the version that didn't get built.

319
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,880
I, yeah, I knew none of this.

320
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,320
I did not know it either.

321
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,160
It's pretty well documented in the Martins vids.

322
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,480
They don't, they have some cons they have more concept art and like model

323
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,560
pictures than I have seen.

324
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:57,920
Uh, and it sounds like this version would have been insane and all like amazing.

325
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,120
I like what they did fine.

326
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,840
And not, I shouldn't even say that.

327
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,160
I like what they did, but this version, Oh boy.

328
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,280
Do I wish this was...

329
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,880
Well, they pull off, they pull off the educational aspect of it.

330
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,680
It's definitely interesting to go there, but with all the bells and whistles, I

331
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,600
think it would have been a lot more satisfying as a theme park attraction.

332
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,360
Yes.

333
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,920
And basic, like as soon as I heard that Poseidon was involved in the original

334
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,840
version, I was like, Oh shit, what?

335
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,360
Why does Poseidon get cut?

336
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,960
Even like a low grade Poseidon in the current version, I would have been

337
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,360
like still pretty happy with.

338
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,360
But big tease.

339
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,680
I, I, I know some, I started unraveling why does Poseidon get cut.

340
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,640
And the answer is pretty nefarious.

341
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,280
It, uh, it goes and goes and, uh, you'll see, but let's,

342
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,440
let's talk about the fun first.

343
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,000
Yeah.

344
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,160
Um, so I guess the, yeah, the original was very much more like, like, um,

345
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:04,480
simulating that underwater base, like a cool dome underwater, like whatever,

346
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,120
I guess base is really what it is.

347
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:14,360
Um, but it opened with a pre show where you were like challenged by Poseidon,

348
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:21,040
the sea Lord, who were like, just like dare you to like taunt the ocean.

349
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,280
Yeah.

350
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Like he, like you're in the middle of a raging sea storm and he stops it with a

351
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,080
wave of his hand and like start eggs you on.

352
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,960
He's like, only the bravest explorers would explore the sea.

353
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,320
Yeah.

354
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,000
Um, which it's funny cause like you were still going to sea base alpha, which was

355
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,800
very much like a scythe, like more science fiction, like the emphasis on the science

356
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,560
than it is like on the fan science fantasy or something.

357
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,760
If you go on this today, it's extremely clinical by, by theme park standards.

358
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,640
So it's almost in like set probably in the not too distant future.

359
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,000
It's all technology we have, but if it was super policy, you're going into

360
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,440
sea quest, you're going to see quest DSP basically, I think is in set in the

361
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,000
2030s or something.

362
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,800
I don't know if I'm pulling that out of my butt.

363
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,120
Um, so yeah, strange that we would like this definition of the seas involves

364
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,760
that the seas are controlled by a man, by a giant man, by a giant magic man,

365
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,520
which yeah, it does.

366
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,840
It's sort of like the original idea of Epcot was very much like, I mean, they

367
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,400
have like, uh, you know, imagination, which obviously is not necessarily rooted

368
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,320
in science, but a lot of it was science based.

369
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,160
So I'm, I am curious and maybe Scott, you have more information, like what

370
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,160
they're thinking was behind this, but man, it would have been, it would have been

371
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,680
awesome.

372
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,800
I will say that.

373
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,080
Yeah.

374
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,800
And the, the technology was going to be that you sat in this theater, he

375
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:56,480
challenges you and then the theater would rotate 180 degrees to a load, a very

376
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,600
ornate loading station, uh, where you would then board an Omni mover.

377
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,520
Yeah.

378
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:09,560
Like a yellow, like a yellow brick road of coral, like just coral everywhere.

379
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,960
Have we, we have not talked about fake coral a lot on this show.

380
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,320
Hmm.

381
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:15,760
Hmm.

382
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,720
And now is that different than fake rock?

383
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,320
And does it count as fake rock?

384
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,160
I mean, someone listening is going to know the distinction better than us,

385
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,640
but coral didn't, if it counts as fake rock, it didn't really fair great in

386
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,520
the fake rock final four, though I think that the Disney sea, Ariel's grotto

387
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,480
area is really fantastic and you know, probably, you know, didn't make it in

388
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,800
there, but it could have, could have been a squeaker, but I think, I think somebody

389
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,120
will be able to tell us like, Oh, you're missing all these great pieces of fake

390
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,640
coral in the theme parks and maybe eventually one day when we have all this

391
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,320
gathered, we can do a fake coral final four.

392
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,360
Perhaps.

393
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,480
I'd love to gather enough.

394
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,040
Yes.

395
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,600
Let's give coral it's due.

396
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,960
Good fake coral in the, um, the fries electronics in, I forget the city now

397
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,360
it's in San Diego County, um, but they're, yeah, they're really good fake coral game

398
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:09,600
there.

399
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:16,840
And then obviously fake coral on, uh, uh, the Nemo subs in Disneyland, you know,

400
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,280
I think, I think fake coral is in more places.

401
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:20,880
If you look,

402
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,440
Yeah.

403
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,400
Heart is open to it.

404
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,520
If your heart is open to it.

405
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,760
Um, I just want to shout out before we move on from Poseidon than just his line

406
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,640
about if we can part the waves of understanding, I mean, this is my, like

407
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:41,920
this highfalutin Poseidon language and that he is called Poseidon the sea lord.

408
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:47,520
Um, I mean, obviously Poseidon was done to its full theme park extent in islands

409
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,760
of adventure with Poseidon's fury.

410
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,720
Ultimately, I was also trying to remember if Poseidon factors into the

411
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,880
Caesar's palace mall statue show, which is called fall of Atlantis and Poseidon

412
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,320
is referenced, like it's all kind of his shadow looms over the events of fall

413
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,320
of Atlantis, but Poseidon is not here.

414
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,000
He called in sick today.

415
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,760
Let us do his bidding.

416
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,720
What would Poseidon have done?

417
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,240
Yeah.

418
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,920
WWPD.

419
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,440
Um, he, so Poseidon, I mean, I just want more Poseidon in general, if possible.

420
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,600
It's a property anybody can grab because it's, um, it's mythology.

421
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,240
I don't think anyone can own Poseidon.

422
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:31,640
Right.

423
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,200
No one can own me.

424
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,600
So like, yes, like we can have Poseidon on the show regularly too.

425
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,280
Like Poseidon and the sector keeper show up together.

426
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:40,720
Maybe.

427
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,200
Oh, it's my friend Poseidon.

428
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,040
Yes, I am friends with this young ghost boy.

429
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,320
Ah, I don't know why he's like Hercules or something, but in my version, if one of

430
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,040
the three of us had more energy, maybe Poseidon could be with us here today.

431
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,200
Yeah.

432
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,320
I'm very tired though.

433
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,680
You know, I wasn't prepared.

434
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,840
Don't you tired to summon Poseidon?

435
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
I mean, if you, if you force me,

436
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,280
nevermind.

437
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:07,640
Hang on.

438
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,040
I'm going to go take a bath.

439
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,320
Mike's new character, reluctant Poseidon.

440
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,240
Yes, here I am.

441
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,720
I'm here and good to meet you, Jason.

442
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,880
Poseidon who's still stressed out about the impeachment hearings.

443
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,240
I think.

444
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,520
I with a wave of my hand, I could part this team, but only 10 Republicans.

445
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,000
After that, after the attack on still only 10, I just kill her.

446
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,080
I don't, the Trident feels extra heavy to me today.

447
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,320
Oh, why don't they just do the inauguration in their oval office?

448
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,760
Oh, come on.

449
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,440
Why does it have to be outside?

450
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,960
Do it tomorrow.

451
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,720
Well, it's break with tradition.

452
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,760
I love tradition.

453
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,800
I'm 10,000 years old.

454
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,360
I'm sure they'd give you the zoom without a time limit if you just ask.

455
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,680
Oh, I'm trying to get the vaccine, but it is just not available.

456
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,320
The federal government should have done a better job coordinating it nationwide.

457
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,960
Can I not summon with my hand from the sea, just a vile amount of it?

458
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,040
Just fill up a needle.

459
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,240
That's all Poseidon wants.

460
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,200
I guess two. It's going to be a double dose.

461
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,880
Four weeks part.

462
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,160
I'm not Lord of the Vexy, and I'll tell you that.

463
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,560
Yeah, that's a Vaxenus.

464
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,520
That's my brother Vaxenus.

465
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,560
Many do not believe in Vaxenus.

466
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,320
They are fools.

467
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,000
Vaxenus is good.

468
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,320
And we have him now as an IP.

469
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,880
We have to trademark him.

470
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,880
Yeah, yeah.

471
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,440
He'll show up soon.

472
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,680
Anyway, yeah, he parts.

473
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,720
I don't know. There was like a there was a curtain of water potentially.

474
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,920
There's going to happen.

475
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,160
This seemed great.

476
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,800
And it is like it's funny.

477
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,560
This happens to us in attractions sometimes where there's just this phantom

478
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,680
feeling like like there should have been something like why isn't this

479
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,960
our favorite thing from our childhoods?

480
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,040
And I feel like Poseidon is the answer.

481
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,880
Yeah, he's a missing piece, I think, for sure.

482
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,880
And there there are.

483
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,880
Yeah, I think maybe we've talked about this before.

484
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,960
It's like figment looms so large in that.

485
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,760
And obviously the right because he's the star of the right.

486
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,640
He does a lot. But if it's like maybe if they had just positioned some other

487
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,880
new original characters on some of these rides, they could have lasted longer

488
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,320
and been more of a big deal to kids brains.

489
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,280
But then it still retained their sort of educational nature.

490
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,960
Yeah, I'd say even as a kid, though, I kind of liked Epcot days

491
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,360
because I knew it was just a different it was a different vibe.

492
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,960
There was like, you know, I didn't I was a nerdy little child.

493
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,440
I like the educational aspect.

494
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,600
I like the different like, you know, vibes of the pavilions

495
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,200
and the attractions and stuff.

496
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,640
And like, especially like Magic Kingdom, like trying to pack stuff in

497
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,400
or even MGM Studios at its height had quite a bit to try and do in a day.

498
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:05,400
Sure. I just mean like, yeah, for me, which I also loved going to Epcot.

499
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,680
It's just I just my brain isn't that clear on remembering some of these things.

500
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,320
Like, I don't have those childhood memories

501
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,880
that are so strong, like a few of the other places in Epcot.

502
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,360
And then, of course, the Magic Kingdom.

503
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,360
Yeah, what I remember is I was scared all day and got it was all scary.

504
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,960
Giant. What's the architectural to brutalist architecture?

505
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,600
I think is the term. And that makes sense.

506
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,040
All the buildings scared me in a way that I love.

507
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,080
I think about the buildings non style of all the architecture.

508
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,680
But like not only that, it's all like, as I've said, none of none of my friends

509
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,000
are here. I'm probably not going to see Mickey or anybody.

510
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm going to see lots of like upset bearded adults,

511
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,400
whether that be Jules Verne or in this way, it could have been Poseidon,

512
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,520
the most upset, biggest bearded adult constantly.

513
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,880
Scott, little Scott, your friends aren't here for you.

514
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,920
Your friends can't help you now. You dared rattle the sea.

515
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,640
You'll be scared. I didn't do anything. I'm seven.

516
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,800
And you, little Michael, I can tell you don't buy it.

517
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,320
I can tell you don't believe this shit.

518
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,800
I want you to believe it. And throws water at me.

519
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,120
So I draw later. It's good. You saw the bubbles go.

520
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,520
Yeah, you went deep as far as you know.

521
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
What else do you want?

522
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,400
The other thing I think in this takes us into the next area of the thing,

523
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,120
but I also this is another Epcot attraction with like rides through dark

524
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:35,520
corridors. Almost every one of them is a slow moving vehicle through a dark

525
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,960
tunnel. I think that like I can't remember how dark and tunnely world of

526
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,080
motion was, but I bet fairly so. Horizons definitely.

527
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,800
Universe of energy isn't so claustrophobic, but it's extremely dark a lot of the

528
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,760
time. Spaceship Earth very dark.

529
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,000
And then the sea cabs were pretty much like, I mean, I guess you had the glow,

530
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
but aquariums are dark. Water is dark.

531
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,360
Yeah. Yeah.

532
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,920
Again, it's all aesthetically like the same.

533
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,600
It's like one thing bleeds into another.

534
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,960
It's like, which concept album did we say Epcot is like?

535
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,800
I wrote the second half of Abbey Road, maybe like a wizard, Todd Rungren's,

536
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,560
a wizard, a true star kind of bless you.

537
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,000
Yes. Yeah. And you know what I'm saying?

538
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,080
Each one bleeds into the you're not sure where one ends and the next begins.

539
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,320
I don't think. Is there a Kiss album like that for Monday that I could throw in

540
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:33,120
here? How do we frame this kiss concept album?

541
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,200
Yeah, you're right. That's the key to well, I don't know the album, but it looks

542
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,920
like they have an album called Music from the Elder. It's more of it.

543
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,360
Oh, maybe their concept of.

544
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,800
So Monday, if you're listening and the answer is probably no, the Living Seas

545
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,080
are actually Epcot in general is like music from the Elder.

546
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,400
Got it. Perfect. Perfect.

547
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,800
Is it like didn't they all do?

548
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,280
There was a day where each one released a solo album without makeup on.

549
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,120
Am I conflating things with that?

550
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,280
Right. Yeah, they for sure.

551
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,560
The makeup off period in the 80s and maybe this is we'll know if money

552
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,400
listen to it because I probably just got that wrong.

553
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,320
And he'll call and yell at me.

554
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,200
But yeah, there was a very yeah, they had to do some gimmicks.

555
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,120
So I don't know theme park equivalent of solo albums without the makeup.

556
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,000
But what's like is it like ambition?

557
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,760
Is that Islands of Adventure or something like untrodden territory?

558
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,400
Yeah, that's good.

559
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,960
So, yeah, we're we're losing my train of thought.

560
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,520
I'm also just like, by the way, the the the Elder saw

561
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,160
music from the Elder as a character named Morpheus in it.

562
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,920
Wow, really? Yeah, yeah, there's a lot going on.

563
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,800
Maybe I need to check out the and the the the boy that it's just long tracks.

564
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,720
One's called the oath. One's called Escape from the Island.

565
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,200
I mean, this sounds potentially potentially dreadful.

566
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,360
But again, I don't want to lose Monday or any kiss fans.

567
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,480
He's tried to get us way into Kiss for a long time, which I'm not against kiss.

568
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,720
I like some of the songs, but I just I've not gotten the whole thing about kiss.

569
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,560
But obviously, the pageantry and the nonsense we would like.

570
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,000
And the merch, of course. Yeah.

571
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,120
But maybe this is our way.

572
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,120
Maybe this is our way in, is what I'm saying.

573
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,320
I'm scared of the tracks, a world without heroes and Odyssey,

574
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,760
as much as I'd like to meet their Morpheus.

575
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,360
I mean, is it is it all probably white right wing propaganda from Gene Simmons?

576
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,640
Maybe maybe I don't know.

577
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,040
You might not have turned in 81 yet. I don't know.

578
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,480
It's possible. Anyways, the turning.

579
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,040
That's what the theater does.

580
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:43,800
Turns 180 degrees and then you're and then you were in that you end up in the

581
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:49,080
this hypothetical version of the vehicle that would have taken you into the attraction.

582
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,200
As Jason said, it was a more of a or it makes it.

583
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,600
It was an omnimover.

584
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,680
That's what it is today.

585
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,920
It's like the clamshells that take you into the sea base.

586
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:05,560
But they initially envisioned like a much longer ride, more like a 10 minute

587
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,400
ride where you're in clear bubbles.

588
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,800
I think Jim Hill described them as pearls.

589
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,960
You're inside clear pearls and you're going through clear tubes.

590
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,200
So as you're passing through this tank, you are now much more

591
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,960
immersed in like you could be just, you know, a couple inches away from a shark.

592
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,760
Like you have the full beauty of the tank and you're in it and the danger of what if

593
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,000
there was a leak or something?

594
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,000
Yeah. And so, yeah, there was a tank, but then it was like show scenes

595
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,760
plan to and I think there was like a planned maybe like anime.

596
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,120
There's not a picture of it, but I think it was a shark attack planned of some kind.

597
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:48,120
And then you would run into Poseidon again, like there's in the Martins vids,

598
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,520
there's pictures of all the little like scenes from like a big model on a table.

599
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,880
It was kind of hard to see which is which, but all you can tell just like, oh,

600
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,880
you go through a bunch of very detailed show scenes.

601
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,760
It does. It reminds me a little bit of how they did 20,000 Leagues at Tokyo Disney

602
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,520
Sea. But it's not the same ride system.

603
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:13,320
Oh, yeah. Where it's it is not maybe there's sections of it where that are not

604
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,360
fully underwater, but you're using lighting effects and mist and bubbles and stuff

605
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,760
to fake that you are underwater.

606
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,360
Right. I mean, that and 20,000 Leagues has to have fake coral, obviously.

607
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,320
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I would imagine.

608
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,680
Yeah. So I think that was really epic, like the entrance to the what to this base

609
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,760
and the concept art that you look at, it just seemed like so much grander than

610
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,400
than where they are. Yes. Yeah.

611
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:42,960
The I mean, I just love the painterly kind of like paperback book cover almost

612
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,440
of like a lot of the early Epcot concept art and the base itself really looks a lot

613
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:55,400
like C-Lab 2020 in terms of pods with like walkways between it all.

614
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,400
Oh, totally. Which I think that was very, very popular at the time.

615
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:08,080
Very future looking at the time, like sea bases and biospheres.

616
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,800
I think. Right. I don't know when the biosphere one and biosphere two, I think,

617
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:17,920
came a little later. Yeah, I mean, it's it's very start even Star Trek, obviously

618
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:23,120
in space, but it's very the vibe of sort of especially I think the first Star Trek

619
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,760
movie, it's a little bit like 2001 inspired.

620
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,840
I feel like in its I guess partly because like the music and the it all feels a

621
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,680
little unnerving or a lot of unnerving depending on which part of the pre-show

622
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,000
or which part or which art you're looking at.

623
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,240
But there is something kind of odd and eerie about all of it, too.

624
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,440
It's not like, yeah, we're underwater and it's a utopian city.

625
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,880
It's kind of like research is done here

626
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:56,200
with the depths of the sea where anything can happen, anything horrible can happen.

627
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,160
Well, yeah, it feels like the setup for like this is the it's like

628
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:08,400
it's the first third of, I don't know, the abyss or the thing or

629
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,360
especially the abyss because it's underwater.

630
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:15,560
But, you know, or aliens or like as if like this is all right.

631
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:20,880
Settle in here to this place where most of your friends will die.

632
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,920
It really yeah, it's crazy.

633
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,400
Like here, I'm just going to do this right now.

634
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,800
This is the pre-show movie for the actual living seas.

635
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,320
And I'm sure you guys watched it.

636
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,840
It is so friggin scary.

637
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,200
Yeah. Did you did you watch it?

638
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,240
Yeah. Yeah. It's like.

639
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,080
And then rises back to the ocean floor

640
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,320
as a superheated mineral laden fluid

641
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,000
emitting what to us would be lethal concentrations of poisonous chemicals.

642
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,040
Yet, incredibly, a brand new strange

643
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,000
beds in sonic life forms flourish.

644
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,040
I mean, there's like there's like I feel like I hear like stabs in there

645
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,200
of like a violin, like in a horror movie.

646
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,040
Like there's it's it's it's scored in such a way

647
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,640
to freak the fuck out of you.

648
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,360
It's like John Carpenter didn't direct it, but he scored it.

649
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,120
They brought him in just for music, just to make it extra unnerving.

650
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,520
Yes. I think that I think that's by the way, I think that's awesome.

651
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,720
But I am interested at the at the choice because there's not even

652
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,800
there's never a part of it where it's fully resolved in like a major chord.

653
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,720
It's never like, ah, and here's C base alpha.

654
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,880
It's like better music.

655
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,520
It's like happier sounding music when they reveal like the

656
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,720
the schematic of C base alpha, but it never resolves itself.

657
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,760
It never makes you feel like, oh, and now everything's going to be fine.

658
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,880
No, it's very haunting, ethereal and almost pushing experimental.

659
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,680
And it's very funny to think about when you think about the sponsor

660
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,040
United Technologies, now a division of the Raytheon company,

661
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,480
spent 90 million dollars on this pavilion,

662
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,320
like this major corporate sponsor.

663
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,920
And like this is how it starts with this weird like there's no characters.

664
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,400
There's no people right in that video.

665
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,320
Or barely any animals.

666
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,200
It's mostly the sea and storms and nature.

667
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,960
And yeah, I think it's funny.

668
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,840
I liked it as a kid.

669
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,400
I was a little scared.

670
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,040
And I think if something was just slightly different in the tilt of the world,

671
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,600
I would have leaned into like what other movies are kind of scary like that

672
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,160
instead of like get leaned into like MGM studios of like,

673
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,520
where can I get a copy of Singing in the Rain?

674
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,280
There was so much scariness at Epcot because this is I forgot

675
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,000
there was even a movie in this thing.

676
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,200
But of course, it makes me think of the post Maelstrom

677
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:07,360
Norway film, which is very severe and, you know, banging on iron and

678
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:13,440
and the Maelstrom itself, where you dive into a storm

679
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,360
and flaming oil barracks.

680
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,880
Like so much of Epcot was scary and scary in a real world way.

681
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,560
It's not like Alien Encounter scary.

682
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,920
It's not sci fi scary.

683
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,080
It's the world you're in is a scary place.

684
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,160
Yes, Scott.

685
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:38,960
Back back over the falls, you know, it's such a it's such a ball.

686
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,040
It's a ball. See the word. It's such an odd.

687
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,240
It's odd.

688
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,000
But also, like, I think that's what the creative, the imagineering people

689
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,600
were going for. That's the idea.

690
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,720
Yeah, it was not supposed to be a fully friendly place besides Figment.

691
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,040
And I guess it's just still an odd

692
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:04,120
swing, because I mean, I don't really know the history of when Epcot

693
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:09,040
was was struggling or if that was the the calculation at the time

694
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,280
or that had to be like fixed or injected with energy or more like.

695
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,200
It does seem like there was an era where it didn't quite land.

696
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,800
And I like, I don't know, like was did like a ton of adults

697
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:31,760
want to go experience things about like steel and flames and disasters?

698
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,840
Like, was this what people really wanted?

699
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,400
I'm not and I like I'm obsessed with Epcot.

700
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,000
I hope none of this sounds super negative.

701
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,480
But it's just like, I don't know, were people jazzed ever on the Living Seas

702
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,760
movie like that rules?

703
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,120
Well, yeah, that's a good question.

704
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,280
I mean, I'm sure like.

705
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,360
You know, that was a giant aquarium.

706
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,400
It was the biggest aquarium, I think, in the world for a little while.

707
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,760
Right. Like before the Georgia Aquarium.

708
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,080
Yeah, it's a sorry.

709
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,480
Did you have this? Oh, I was going to.

710
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,120
Yeah, I have it. It's a five point seven million gallon tank.

711
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,240
And that's not counting like the filtering tanks or the prep tanks.

712
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,600
And for a long time, it was technically the largest saltwater

713
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,520
aquarium in the world until that Georgia Aquarium opened a few years ago.

714
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,080
Mm hmm. So like a dad would like, I feel like a dad likes to go to the aquarium.

715
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,800
Yeah. In the 80s, 90s, dad will go to the aquarium and take a look at the fish.

716
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,000
So he would like that.

717
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,760
But I don't know if he wanted to watch the scary film strip beforehand.

718
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,600
That's what or like, I mean, you see still, I mean, it's gone now,

719
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,560
but you saw when the maelstroms open, people just like

720
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,520
sprint out of the theater so they did not have to watch the post

721
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,920
ride movie like it.

722
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,040
I because I feel like some of my Epcot obsession is with things

723
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,960
that didn't super resonate with people like it's that's what resonates with me.

724
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,680
Is that it's this extremely expensive theme park

725
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,920
where there's huge swaths of it that I think scared people or even bored people

726
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,920
or just unnerved people.

727
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,040
I think that's I hope I'm not sounding anti-ep.

728
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,520
It's all that stuff that I'm obsessed with.

729
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,520
Yeah, I think I said on the universe of energy when Lindsey and I went on it

730
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,840
like a couple of days before it closed forever, the guy next to us fell asleep on it.

731
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:27,840
Like within 10, I think 10 to 15 minutes, he was asleep on universe of energy.

732
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,000
And that has to happen all day long with that ride for its whole existence.

733
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,000
That was one of the reasons my dad liked that ride.

734
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,880
People like a little break, a little sleepy break ride to get so hot in Florida.

735
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,240
You need to take a rest at some point.

736
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,080
You're not going to get to take a break when Rocket Raccoon is shouting on you

737
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,160
on a roller coaster. That's not going to happen.

738
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,120
You can't take a little nap that way.

739
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:55,640
Yeah. I mean, I think there was different metrics of the different metrics of success back then.

740
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,680
I think as the 80s went along, they were, you know, you start to see the rise

741
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,840
of like the Wall Street era of like, we've got to keep the shareholders happy.

742
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:10,000
But like at least when Epcot started, there was an intent of education,

743
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,320
you know, of let's do something different.

744
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,680
Let's let's play with people's expectations.

745
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,840
Let's entertain edutainment, that sort of thing.

746
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:24,720
And you also saw like all these corporate sponsors seem to like be in line with that.

747
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,120
And I don't I don't know that companies ever fully had tact.

748
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,720
But I feel like I don't know.

749
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,960
I think stuff is more craven nowadays of like, well, we've got to hit the four quadrants

750
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,720
and we've got to get the characters in there and the characters have to appeal to these squad.

751
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,360
You know? Yeah. Yeah.

752
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,840
I mean, it is a joke.

753
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:50,000
Like there's a reason that there was a joke and I guess still remains a joke

754
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,120
that Epcot is boring and it sucks.

755
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,320
And I don't hold that opinion.

756
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,960
But there's a reason that joke exists.

757
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,080
That's in the culture.

758
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,320
I think it's going away.

759
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:04,160
I do think it's in a similar way, though, to an album that's underappreciated

760
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,520
its first 20 years, like your McCartney Ram.

761
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,520
It's your McCartney one and two where people go, what the hell is this?

762
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,840
This isn't as good as the Beatles.

763
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,080
And then 30 years later, you go, oh, I see what he was doing.

764
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,120
This is this a lot of stuff's great.

765
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,800
And now you want everything to be like that.

766
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,560
Yes. Do more stuff like that.

767
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,720
Do more stuff like that.

768
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:26,600
And not like for you, his song with Ryan Tedder,

769
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,800
even though I kind of like the song for you.

770
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,560
He's I don't know what they I don't know what the theme park equivalent of you is.

771
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,120
A revenue manager. Yeah.

772
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,960
Tiki room under new management. Yeah, maybe.

773
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,480
So there was this grand vision of what it was going to be.

774
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,920
And I don't really know what happened when you got to the base.

775
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,400
I think that all might have been sort of similar, but there was certainly a much

776
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,720
more ornate attraction of Fide

777
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,640
intro to this ride.

778
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,200
I guess with that, should we talk about what did end up being there

779
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,160
or what what is what was the experience pre the Nemo infusion?

780
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,360
Yeah. Yes.

781
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,320
I mean, there there was a standing I kind of always forgot about this.

782
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:20,080
There was like a standing kind of slideshow pre show early on.

783
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,480
That was also pretty weird and ethereal.

784
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,560
There was the queue.

785
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:30,600
The queue had a lot of artifacts about see see exploration, see adventuring.

786
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,160
And yeah, and then the like other element

787
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,880
pre hydro later is is that movie, Mike,

788
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,360
that you played a little snippet of, which was like a sit down theater.

789
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,960
Right. Scary movie.

790
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,440
Terrifying movie. Terrifying movie.

791
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,160
And it I mean, it is it is very much set up like, yeah,

792
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,520
like a movie you would have seen in school.

793
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:59,560
But it has it has the score of a horror film.

794
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,400
It's so similar in tone to the thing I keep bringing up,

795
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,560
the weird Philadelphia 1776 movie

796
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,080
that was so that was very frightening.

797
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,640
And yet my mom made my class watch it.

798
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,920
And that had to be said, Mrs.

799
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,120
Gardner provided this film.

800
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,160
Any chance to watch a bit, Scott?

801
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,440
I would have been sending your mother a thank you note.

802
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,640
Probably. I. That's true.

803
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,560
I'm forgetting. Yeah.

804
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,760
Aspect. Yeah. It gave people a chance to nap.

805
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,280
Just as the Living Seas movie give dads a chance to nap.

806
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,320
And let's not forget this added benefit of Epcot.

807
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,760
If you took a trip to Disney World during the school year

808
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,720
and you had to make up some bullshit that it was educational,

809
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,320
you're in the bag with Epcot, baby.

810
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,440
You do a little summary of your days at Epcot. Done.

811
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,720
That is a good point. Yeah, I had thought of that.

812
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:57,160
You could justify like if you paid attention, you can learn something.

813
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,960
I mean, obviously, the greater lesson here is that humans can mess up

814
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,040
the earth all they want, but the earth will win.

815
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:09,400
I mean, that's the message of this film strip itself is that like the sea will win.

816
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,720
The sea is going to get all of us and there's nothing we can do about it.

817
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,160
No, he runs. The sea runs the show, baby.

818
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,400
Now, please enter the sea.

819
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,640
You've been reminded that the sea will kill you.

820
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,240
It will kill you.

821
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,160
It will kill your great, great, great, great, great grandchildren

822
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,960
at a certain point to reset the earth after all of you monsters fucked it up.

823
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,680
But anyway, here's a fun omnivore.

824
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,840
And we're going to kill you right now if you like aren't careful on a boat or something.

825
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,640
Yep. We're being reminded of that right now.

826
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,280
January twenty twenty one with the revival of sea shanty.

827
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,120
Tick tock.

828
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,280
Everyone's doing a collaborative sea shanty singing very well.

829
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,160
Or why?

830
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:59,000
This is one of the thrilling people to start singing sea shanties on tick tock.

831
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,200
And then there's this duet feature where then you can sing along

832
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,200
and then people it's like picture and picture and picture and everyone's singing along.

833
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:11,680
I saw someone online positing that like, oh, we we've been distancing

834
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,240
ourselves from each other.

835
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,800
And this this was a way this is like songs that were simple

836
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,520
and could be sung without accompaniment.

837
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,880
And so like it's a way to keep connected.

838
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,000
This the revival.

839
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,080
Everyone's in the sea shanties all of a sudden.

840
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,520
I didn't understand the Ratatouille musical stuff,

841
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,360
but I'm here for old sea shanties coming back.

842
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,600
No, I also zoned out when anything, the Ratatouille musical showed up.

843
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,880
I say, all right, I know it.

844
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,000
I'm sure everyone seemed like they're having a blast.

845
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,400
Godspeed. God bless.

846
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,480
I'm not mad at it or anything. I just was like, OK.

847
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,520
What you just said, Jason, about ticked, I think that's that maybe sums up my feelings.

848
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,800
Everyone seems like they're having a blast.

849
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,960
You guys, you have fun.

850
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,280
Not for me. Beware if I showed up.

851
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,160
I got the dad pass now.

852
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:57,040
I'm not going to learn about any app until my son is on one.

853
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,760
And then I can make fun of whatever he's doing on it.

854
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,400
And we can have a combative relationship about the app until then.

855
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,800
No apps for me.

856
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,800
That's a good point. You are a dad now.

857
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,360
So we're going to have to start.

858
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,880
Maybe it's just because you didn't grow up in the northeast of America.

859
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,680
We're going to have to get you into some tall ships soon.

860
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,640
We're going to have to start getting you into some nautical history stuff.

861
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,920
It's time. Oh, no.

862
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,080
I guess today is the day talking about the seas.

863
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,920
Well, a lot of our a lot of our favorite characters

864
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,800
and personalities love the sea, like, you know, your Popeyes, your Jimmy Puffets.

865
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,120
Yeah, those are my favorite characters.

866
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,720
Well, I'm scared of Popeye.

867
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,040
Popeye is weird.

868
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,160
The movie, the movie scary.

869
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,080
I always try to watch it because I think it'll be interesting.

870
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,600
I watched it for the podcast because I like Popeye Village.

871
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,040
And then I'm still just like, oh, this movie.

872
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,160
Get me away from the sea.

873
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,360
Deciding to be furious at me.

874
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,560
Captain Jack Sparrow also.

875
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,280
Guy on the sea.

876
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,440
No, of course, I'm a Jack Farrow stan.

877
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,320
Ride or die.

878
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,760
And, you know, like whatever's going on with the actor playing him,

879
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,920
that's not for me to know.

880
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,240
I'm concerned about the character.

881
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,440
Yeah, yeah.

882
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,120
I don't know.

883
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,920
I don't know the actor's name who plays him.

884
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,360
I don't know. I just I love Jack Sparrow.

885
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,160
And that's what I love. Yeah.

886
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,160
And of course, his uncle who's in jail or whatever that is.

887
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,560
I don't know that actor either.

888
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,280
Looks a lot like that guy who sings for you.

889
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,240
Yeah.

890
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,760
He's got like a dad that looks like the guy who plays guitar on

891
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,280
satisfaction as well.

892
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,960
Again, I don't know any of these names.

893
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,160
Yeah, I don't either.

894
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,360
OK, so scary movie.

895
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,960
And then and well, then we go to the hydrolators.

896
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,480
Let's talk hydrolators.

897
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,920
Oh, I mean, what's there not to say about the hydrolators?

898
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,200
What's there? It mimics an elevator.

899
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,560
It's the same kind of trick.

900
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,280
Basically, they do with the Haunted Mansion in Florida, where like

901
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,760
you're stationary, but the walls are like sort of going up a little different

902
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,280
because you're you're looking through windows at water and rocks

903
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,120
and those kind of move and stuff.

904
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:12,600
Um, I know, I guess, Jason, you might put this in the category of that.

905
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,160
I bet I bought it, but I bought the illusion.

906
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,400
I don't think I had done a hydrolator since I was a child.

907
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,440
But as far as I knew that was descending, I honestly didn't know

908
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,960
until this research that that was a still room with effects.

909
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,800
I truly didn't know that with like a little rumbling floor and lights

910
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,200
flickering. And did you guys come across the urban legend

911
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,640
about the lawsuit, the fake?

912
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,840
It's it's bullshit.

913
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,840
Yes. So the the apocryphal tail.

914
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:45,640
And it seems like Yesterland kind of

915
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,320
traced it traced it back to like Marty Sklar in an interview.

916
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:56,360
One explanation, he's kind of tossed this out and it was like a joke going around

917
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,600
and then it became the tour guides were telling it.

918
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:03,960
And it's an apocryphal story that a woman tried to sue Disney or a man.

919
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:09,120
It changes every time that, oh, my ear drums pursed

920
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,480
at the pressure drop in the hydrolators.

921
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,560
And then the jury and the judge went to like Disney Imaginators, like, come

922
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,440
look at this. And they open both hydrolated drawers.

923
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,760
And then they immediately threw out the case.

924
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,080
This clearly never this didn't happen.

925
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,120
OK, OK.

926
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,760
So that's just urban legend that they like to to build up.

927
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:36,960
I heard an interview with one of the main imagineers behind this, Tim Delaney,

928
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,120
on the I think he's been on season past, but he's on this podcast

929
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,400
Tomorrow Society show to them.

930
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,760
He peepers on this podcast.

931
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,920
He presented the story as as real, like,

932
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,160
but maybe he's still keeping up the urban legend.

933
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,160
And maybe that's what Marty Scar was doing, too.

934
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,040
But it was that I honestly was listening to the story, and that was where I found out.

935
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,240
Like, oh, wait, it wasn't it didn't move.

936
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,680
I really didn't know that.

937
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,520
Yeah, Tim Delaney is very cool.

938
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,760
I mean, this this interview is great.

939
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,120
Any interview I've heard of him is great.

940
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:08,080
And he's a if people don't know this special about the making of Space

941
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:13,360
Mountain, Paris, where you follow him from imaginary back and forth to Paris

942
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,840
while he puts this attraction together, which is the first launch coaster.

943
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,280
And it's the first coaster with onboard audio.

944
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,840
And it seems like this guy Tim sort of thought of some of that stuff

945
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,840
or was really pushing for it.

946
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,160
Anyway, Tim Delaney, very cool.

947
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,280
And I think he's he's responsible for a lot of the cool stuff in this attraction.

948
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,520
And that concept art, like how amazing the exterior looked when this thing opened.

949
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,160
This was Tim Delaney.

950
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,200
Interesting. I'm interested to know now if he's keeping up the cave, the cave,

951
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,880
Disney cave, as far as lawsuits are concerned.

952
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,240
Maybe. I mean, it's the story that proves

953
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,320
how well the illusion worked, that people bought it.

954
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,520
That woman, that hypothetical woman bought it.

955
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,320
Can I I don't want this to turn into a 30 minute tangent,

956
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,720
but I want to ask you guys something, since we're talking about kayfabe

957
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,720
and whether something is real or bullshit.

958
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,800
Do you guys think that Disney funerals website is real?

959
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,320
Do you think that's a bit do you know what I'm talking about?

960
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,520
This was going around like a week or two ago.

961
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,200
I know something about this, but I don't know maybe enough to comment on it.

962
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:17,000
I tweeted like a reaction or a joke to it, but I it was like about how like

963
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,960
if you're a real like parks, like, well, we figured out a way

964
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,360
to put theme park loops in your coffin and like the characters

965
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:28,440
who we can't say which characters will like kiss you goodbye,

966
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,080
like kiss your coffin as before it's lowered.

967
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,600
And it was like a very janky website.

968
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:38,600
This was going around this like hit regular like kind of. Yeah.

969
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,520
Magical pass magicalpassings.com.

970
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:47,640
I I think it's I'm conflicted because I think

971
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,120
the reasons I think it's real are like regular people

972
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,920
don't know the phrase theme park loops and

973
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,520
no one else, no one in theme park world is as funny as we are.

974
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,720
So like this website is pretty like darkly humorous.

975
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,040
So I like this and going bold again.

976
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,080
I think that is a lukewarm take.

977
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,400
I don't think that's. Yeah.

978
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,800
But this kind of went around like like

979
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,280
comedians were making fun of it on Twitter, too.

980
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,240
And I was just like, I don't I don't know if this is real or fake.

981
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,800
My choice of, by the way, the theme park music would be played in the coffin,

982
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,600
but also played from the gravestone.

983
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,560
So all the dead and mourners would need to hear it

984
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,760
would be the music from the tapestry of nations for eight.

985
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,400
So that that is how I haunt the living.

986
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,000
I I got a I have seen this, but I haven't done enough investigating.

987
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I will give a ruling maybe next time we record.

988
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,960
OK, I'll investigate.

989
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,800
Wait, it says at the bottom.

990
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,240
I'm sorry to not keep the end, but I just saw it.

991
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,960
I had to say this site is satirical and a peri site.

992
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,000
No actual services are performed.

993
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,640
Yeah, there you go.

994
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,080
The end of you magicalpassings.com.

995
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,880
I guess an interesting thought, though.

996
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,680
Wait, it's that how long does this loop play forever?

997
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,360
In theory for a day? Yeah.

998
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:14,000
And if it's fake, so well, got to go with droid rooms from Star Tours.

999
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,160
I'll say this, I'm a little unnerved now because who?

1000
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,000
Who that's who that's funny has entered the arena of theme park.

1001
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I know, I know I have to tip my hat then to.

1002
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:33,200
Whoever made this site, because the specifics were very good,

1003
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,000
but they tipped it by going like we can't post a phone number here.

1004
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,280
We've been harassed when we have posted it before.

1005
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,680
So and I think that was the real clue.

1006
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,680
That's a good bit.

1007
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,560
So shout out to whoever that is.

1008
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,240
Yeah, yeah.

1009
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,560
I just I this seems pretty well done from what I could tell, but not real.

1010
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,760
We've we figured it out.

1011
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,440
Yeah.

1012
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,440
Back to something that can kill you, the briny depths of the sea.

1013
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,880
He he he he he.

1014
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,200
Yeah, hydrolators, they don't move.

1015
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,360
It's a Disney tricky elevator.

1016
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,720
And much like the Haunted Mansion in Florida, where that in that one,

1017
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,400
the ground doesn't move. Yeah.

1018
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,840
And similar or wait, is it similar to the one

1019
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,800
the elevator in Tokyo Disney Sea on Journey?

1020
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,160
I was going to bring that up.

1021
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,640
I think I think that we talked about them.

1022
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,280
Right. Doesn't it?

1023
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,400
Doesn't it move up?

1024
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:26,800
Like, I think it's I think it's actually taking you up,

1025
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,200
even though the ideas that you're moving down to the center of the earth.

1026
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,720
But I don't really know that geography.

1027
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,440
I apologize.

1028
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,400
Someone's yelling, of course, at the podcast.

1029
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,720
Not Monday, it's somebody else.

1030
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,480
I know which way it goes and you don't.

1031
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,080
We'll look at when we do the episode, when Jason goes to Japan.

1032
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,440
Jason, will you go to Japan right after you get the vaccine, please?

1033
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:49,320
I was trying to figure out if I'm going to Japan or I'm going to Europe.

1034
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,960
I keep going to Japan.

1035
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,880
We have a ride to do.

1036
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,240
I know. I guess I guess that's the one I for days.

1037
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,840
Go four days because then we can do an entire year about Japan.

1038
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,200
OK, we can sit in bed.

1039
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,000
We need to do journey. We need to do.

1040
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,880
Oh, my God. We can get so much material out of you going to Japan.

1041
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,600
Oh, I mean, Jaws is just going going.

1042
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,880
I was going to joke because we were talking about roadie.

1043
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,280
Roadie would likely do sacrifice

1044
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,040
going to a theme park to do some cultural experiences.

1045
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:18,960
And I'm the opposite.

1046
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,480
I'll probably end up missing a couple of cultural experiences

1047
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,400
just to ride draws again.

1048
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,840
But yeah, I mean, look, as soon as I can get that vaccine and stuff,

1049
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,480
I'll probably go to Florida as soon as I get the vaccine.

1050
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,920
If we have anyone in the government listening,

1051
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,440
please put Jason on a high priority list.

1052
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:41,320
If you could change Jason's age in the like a computer to like 75,

1053
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,520
that would be helpful.

1054
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,920
Yes, that is mentally.

1055
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,760
Yes, he was my temperament age.

1056
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:50,080
Get him on.

1057
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,280
I'll get him on a plane like next week.

1058
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,920
Yeah, you can get this vaccine going off his interests.

1059
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,920
He's 75. Yes.

1060
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,960
See Shanty's educational theme parks.

1061
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,920
Favorite character is Popeye.

1062
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,720
Tall ships.

1063
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,560
I saw a lot of tall ships as a kid, guys.

1064
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:14,560
That was Jason on a train napping while Mount Fuji goes by,

1065
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,640
and then he wakes up at Universal Studios.

1066
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,000
I got a beautiful is beautiful.

1067
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,920
I OK, we get out of the hydrolators, which didn't actually take anywhere.

1068
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,600
And we get on to the sea cabs.

1069
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:34,640
Now, here with the sea cabs is where we get some some contention going.

1070
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:39,000
So, yeah, as we've said, this this ended up

1071
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,280
what could have been a 10 minute, pretty grand trip into an underwater bubble.

1072
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:49,520
Ended up being sort of a trip through a corridor on Omni movers.

1073
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,960
It's three minutes long.

1074
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,240
It's you know, you do get cool views of the tank and depending,

1075
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:58,080
you know, if you watch old videos of it, you see scuba divers

1076
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,400
and you see cool animals and that's that's all great.

1077
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:06,720
However, so I didn't I didn't really have strong feelings about the sea cabs either way.

1078
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:11,760
But let me do some history of when the first time that my wife, Aaron,

1079
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:19,240
and I discussed Epcot, I she now today, I basically I had to like

1080
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,960
convince her like, oh, actually, this is this whole thing with Epcot

1081
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,480
where it's like it's this early 80s aesthetic and it's really locked in time.

1082
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,960
And there were all these bizarre, you know, insanely long

1083
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,560
route, all the stuff we've been talking about.

1084
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,880
So and I got her on board and she loves Epcot and wears an Epcot shirt all the time.

1085
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,920
We're all big Epcot heads.

1086
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,800
But when I the first time I ever brought it up, like,

1087
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,560
what do you think about Epcot?

1088
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,840
And she's like, oh, is that the place with the sea cabs?

1089
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,280
I was like, oh, that's your main takeaways, the sea cabs.

1090
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,000
And she said, yeah, well, my family went there when I was in high school.

1091
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,240
And we're we like, first of all, we're confused by the map.

1092
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,600
Just like where are the rides?

1093
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,200
Like, you know, can you imagine this is where we get into dad?

1094
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:59,760
And I'll pin this on her father, who's great.

1095
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,520
But like he's looking at the he's, you know, he came from Magic Kingdom.

1096
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,440
We're like, there's a picture of a roller coaster.

1097
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,880
There's another picture of a roller coaster.

1098
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:11,520
Now we're looking at pavilions and the land and wonders of life.

1099
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,040
What are you talking?

1100
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:15,760
And you don't see any like drawings of rides anywhere.

1101
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,240
So like, I don't know, let's take a stab at it.

1102
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,760
Let's go to the living seas.

1103
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,800
You get in an elevator that doesn't go anywhere.

1104
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,880
Then you get on the sea cabs.

1105
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,960
You're like, OK, here we go. We're on a ride.

1106
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,960
The ride is over in three minutes.

1107
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,280
The ride is mostly dark.

1108
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,040
It is called the sea cabs.

1109
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,200
Everyone is like sea cabs.

1110
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,520
And they just grumbled about that name all day.

1111
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,160
This sucks. You want to leave?

1112
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,480
Yeah, let's go back to the Magic Kingdom.

1113
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,360
They went back to the Magic Kingdom and that was it.

1114
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:40,960
They left Epcot Center.

1115
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,000
They were so mad at the sea cabs.

1116
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,520
And that is where it loomed for Aaron's family for a long time.

1117
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:51,960
Yeah, it's like I mean, it's like going, hey, you know, I love the Beatles.

1118
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,680
I'm putting on this new Paul McCartney album, Ram.

1119
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,280
And you go like, let's just flip around.

1120
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,200
Oh, Ram on.

1121
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,120
It's like this like weird sounding ukulele song.

1122
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,880
Huh? Well, never mind.

1123
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,880
Let's go back. Let's go to listen to Let It Be.

1124
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,400
What are we doing here?

1125
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,720
That's maybe kind of the feel.

1126
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,520
That's maybe the feel.

1127
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,880
And now have I told that story and in telling that story, have I

1128
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:15,200
made Aaron into a villain of this podcast?

1129
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,680
Much like Nick Mundy.

1130
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,720
You've made his.

1131
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,280
Have I damned Aaron?

1132
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,800
I swear she figured it out.

1133
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,480
Loves Epcot. We love Epcot.

1134
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,920
We spent so much time at Epcot last time we were there.

1135
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,880
I know. I think that's a good example of like the difficulty

1136
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,520
when theme park designers are like, let's try something different.

1137
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,760
Let's try something new.

1138
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:35,720
I'll say this.

1139
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:39,720
I love the Navi River journey, and I think it's rare.

1140
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:44,200
But that is trying to achieve like serenity, right?

1141
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:48,520
Like it's trying to evoke a feeling of peace and relaxation.

1142
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,680
And in the middle of the hottest theme park in Florida,

1143
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:57,560
with these like giant wait times for the attraction right above us,

1144
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:01,720
that is a bit of a contrast to try and get people to go like, well, now

1145
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,520
try a theme park ride about peace with nature.

1146
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,960
You know, that is a little bit of a hard sell.

1147
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,960
Yeah, but I don't know if it's a hard sell as much.

1148
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,480
First of all, Scott, I want to say you I don't think Aaron's villain,

1149
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,760
you have made her father into a podcast, the right villain, though.

1150
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:16,760
Apparently so. All right.

1151
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,320
I will I will not say his legal name for that reason. Right.

1152
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:26,040
But I think with Navi River Journey, that's still a lot more clear.

1153
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:29,800
It's like if Navi River Journey was like the Living Seas Pavilion,

1154
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,920
there would be like 10 different ways to get in

1155
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:37,920
one one door led you to a place where you would eat the Navi.

1156
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,920
Another door led you to a place where you would go on a ride to see a Navi.

1157
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,280
Another ride that like another door you would like just get to the exit

1158
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,840
of the of the river journey.

1159
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:52,960
Like it's I think it's more in the explanation and the confusion

1160
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:57,880
than it is and the expectation of what something a Disney park might be

1161
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,520
as opposed to the actual ride experience itself.

1162
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,800
It was like Living Seas is an aquarium.

1163
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,520
It's a cool aquarium with a little tiny fun ride.

1164
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:09,960
I think then you know what to expect versus like, hey, we went to like

1165
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,480
we went we went on Pirates of the Caribbean.

1166
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,920
It was like nine minutes. It's awesome.

1167
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,480
It's got so many robots.

1168
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,040
And then you go in here and you go, what the hell is what?

1169
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,600
We were in like a Haunin Mansion ride vehicle for three minutes

1170
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,480
and we saw some fish.

1171
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,040
But what why would we?

1172
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:30,920
There's no, I think the you don't take the mini ships

1173
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:37,880
to the main vessel, which is your transit to the to the final pirate island

1174
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:42,800
where there are six different pirate exhibits that you can break off and experience.

1175
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:48,760
So it's I have to imagine it's confusing because like a lot of those places have.

1176
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,240
Pre like post shows with stuff to do,

1177
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,760
and I know they expanded some of that as it went on.

1178
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,640
And I remember even kind of as a kid being a little unclear,

1179
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,280
I do remember confusion about exactly where a ride started and what

1180
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:07,200
I remember that it's not nearly as clear as, you know,

1181
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,320
going to the Magic Kingdom and just going and here's the line for this thing.

1182
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,600
Right. I would like end up in a pavilion.

1183
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,480
Sorry. Yeah. And then you'd be like, oh, I guess we're the exit of a ride.

1184
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:21,760
To me, that note, the thing that you said, Jason, about like

1185
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,280
there isn't the core attraction.

1186
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,280
It's like a bunch of different experiences.

1187
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,920
That's like not super successful to me here because I think like

1188
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,520
with the other I think I like that in the other Epcot pavilions, there is like

1189
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,680
there's the other stuff that you do, but it is the universe of energy.

1190
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:42,240
The ride it is, you know, like there is this main simulator

1191
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,640
in wonders of life or whatever it is.

1192
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,960
I think it is odd to have a ride that takes you to a place,

1193
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:50,040
but it's really more of a little transportation.

1194
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,320
It's like it's almost like if there was only the

1195
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:58,800
the the the Lieutenant Beck room and then not the rest of or

1196
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,200
then you get off on the ship and you look at the stormtroopers

1197
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,520
and there isn't the rest of Rise of the Resistance.

1198
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:07,080
Yeah. Yeah, it's like it's like you could get on at the pre-show

1199
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,480
to Rise of the Resistance.

1200
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,720
You could just get on to the back Lieutenant Beck ship.

1201
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:16,360
You could also skip that and go into the just the main line for the main ride.

1202
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:20,040
Or you could enter in the back because there's a post show to it

1203
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,080
that you could do like play on a computer.

1204
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,440
And if you watched, if you could watch a very dry film

1205
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:29,280
about how the trade wars came to be.

1206
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,280
It's called the prequels.

1207
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,720
That's what the freak.

1208
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:37,000
Yeah, that's the pre-show of the Star Wars movies.

1209
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,520
Well, now, now let me but let me now let me toss off this.

1210
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,880
Thinking about who they would have been trying to attract

1211
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:49,640
with, you know, come to Epcot, you know, the first 10 years or whatever.

1212
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:54,760
Come to Epcot, spend your money, set aside a day for this or like you get it.

1213
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:58,600
You get it. If you buy the hotel and you want a park ticket, we also give you Epcot.

1214
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:07,080
And the marketing of it's a permanent World's Fair and kids who are growing up in the 50s and 60s.

1215
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,880
Does that square more?

1216
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:14,440
Does that selling make more sense to our parents generation?

1217
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:20,040
Well, because you're saying that, like, since that was sort of a big thing with pavilions

1218
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:24,600
and it was a little bit looser in terms of how you would manage lines and move people

1219
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,760
in and out of things. Yeah.

1220
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,920
Maybe they might be more used to that.

1221
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:33,640
Yeah, that there is like a combination entertainment educational because I think my

1222
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:40,120
I think my my mom and dad who grew up on the East Coast, like my dad went to the New York

1223
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:45,320
World's Fair a number of times and they would watch the Disneyland show every Sunday and they

1224
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:49,400
were just like, oh, we wish we could go to California. But as we have talked about in the

1225
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:53,960
past, that's impossible. Once Disney World opened, they were primed and ready to go.

1226
01:05:55,480 --> 01:06:00,280
And not just to Disney, the Magic Kingdom to eventually to Epcot.

1227
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,920
Well, I think from everything you've said, your parents were really enamored with the

1228
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:08,840
World's Fair and went to the World's Fair. I don't know everything about Aaron's dad,

1229
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,880
but I'd be willing to wager he doesn't give a fuck about the World's Fair.

1230
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,800
And yeah, I was going to say, yeah,

1231
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:22,920
but it might factor in it when people were still getting used to like air travel going down the

1232
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:28,280
coast. You know, I mean, when Disney World opened in the in the contemporary gift shop,

1233
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:32,840
there was still like incense, fresh citrus at home year round. Isn't that unique?

1234
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:41,960
But this is 1997 and he loves planes and roller coasters. He's not a troglodyte.

1235
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:47,880
No, by that point, by like 97, they start to that's when you start to see Epcot change.

1236
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,720
That's when you start to see interventions and more like characters and stuff.

1237
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:55,960
Yeah, I think it's just when because it's like the Disney precedent had been set for

1238
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:01,080
a few decades at that point, probably then people had been trained a certain way to

1239
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:07,160
experience a Disney park. And it was just like confusing because like the thing I think now that

1240
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:14,360
we're older, there is a lot of fun for us because we go to like happen upon something.

1241
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:21,480
Like that is a fun thing to have, like because we like to roam, you like to go notice stuff.

1242
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:27,160
But most people, especially, you know, I'm sure like 10 years ago, even it's like

1243
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:32,600
just give me the list of 10 things. What are the 10 things point me in the direction?

1244
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:38,120
And I bet I bet overall there's a much bigger percentage as we get older and as

1245
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:46,920
the sickness that we we give out that we super spread the pandemic of theme park

1246
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,360
minutiae that we are helping to spread into your population.

1247
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:51,560
Too much about things.

1248
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:56,760
It appears you were exposed by three men who were very excited to tell you that

1249
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:03,080
executive Frank Wells was in the tank with Scoop a Mickey on opening day.

1250
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,440
Does that sound familiar to you?

1251
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:11,800
Yes, that does. Yes. Anytime we go to Epcot, I drag anyone around me and I point, I say,

1252
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,840
that's where Frank Wells was. That's where he was in the tank.

1253
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:19,080
And opening day ceremonies, you know, there were some people in some weird,

1254
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:23,880
flowy Toga things doing a song and dance. It was an Epcot pavilion. They had to have that.

1255
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:32,280
So I think as that as that subculture grows, I think maybe now it would be more acceptable now

1256
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:38,040
for like that type of structure to all of this stuff. But yeah, I'm sure I'm sure plenty of

1257
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:42,280
families had that exact same thing. I bet they missed big, cool things.

1258
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:44,360
Oh, yeah, 100 percent.

1259
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,360
Because they didn't really know where to go.

1260
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:51,080
So I don't totally agree with that assessment. And I had to onboard Erin about Epcot after this,

1261
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:56,920
but I've always had sea calves in my head. Just the disdain with which she said the word sea calves.

1262
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:00,920
It just sour on the whole thing. I guess, I don't know. Now that I think about it,

1263
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:04,920
I think it is kind of a dumb word. I'm gonna say that. I'm sorry if I'm pissing off any sea

1264
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:09,800
calves fans out there. Sea cab is funny because like, if you really, it's like cat, like going,

1265
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:15,000
yeah, we're going to get in the cab now. A cab is such a utilitarian kind of boring sounding word

1266
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:21,080
just purely to get you from one place to another. It's not a limo. It's not a party,

1267
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:25,080
but there's nothing fun is going to happen in the cab. It's just where they go.

1268
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,280
Yes, pure transit.

1269
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,880
Yes. Yeah, transit.

1270
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:30,280
The sea bus. It may as well be called like the sea bus.

1271
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:36,680
Is it? OK, this is probably a reach. Were they trying to connect it to these sea cows

1272
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:40,520
floating in a tank near feet away from the sea calves?

1273
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,200
Sea cows?

1274
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:47,640
Yeah, manatees, sea cows, the gentle giants of the waterways.

1275
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,160
Yeah. Makes sense.

1276
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:55,480
Possible. I think, I mean, I think, I don't know if this was really like a direct homage,

1277
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:59,880
and we'll eventually do a big episode on it. The original Walt Epcot vision,

1278
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:02,760
open it like video he had about it was going to be a real city.

1279
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:08,840
It definitely had like Omnimover, people movers moving people in and out of cities.

1280
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:09,880
Oh, yeah.

1281
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,400
And I don't remember if he was going to maybe he was just going to call that a people mover.

1282
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:18,840
I haven't watched the video in a while. I don't think he was going to call them like air cabs,

1283
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:19,720
but maybe.

1284
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:23,800
I think it had like everything because, right, because like the monorails for were

1285
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:30,360
slightly medium distance, people movers were for shorter distances, and all the cars were

1286
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:33,160
under the city if they had to have truck deliveries and stuff.

1287
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,640
And then the outside, this is like outside.

1288
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:36,680
Outside, yeah.

1289
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:37,480
Anyway, it's crazy.

1290
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:43,960
Outside is a big dome and you can't come in or leave and you're shot if you try to invade.

1291
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:45,080
Yeah.

1292
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:49,560
We should probably do that. We should just watch through on that one, maybe.

1293
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:50,920
Yeah, yeah.

1294
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:51,400
Eventually.

1295
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:52,200
That's a good one.

1296
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:58,600
I hate, you know, talking about bizarre footage and everything,

1297
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:02,520
did anybody watch the Living Seas special, the opening special?

1298
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,080
Yeah, the like the dancing stuff.

1299
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:09,160
No, the John Ritter hosted.

1300
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,680
Oh, I didn't actually.

1301
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,760
Yeah, I only saw snippets of this.

1302
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,840
This is well, I think I did too because I faded in and out of sleep.

1303
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:28,520
Now, this is a like, okay, the opening day, 1986 opening special for the Living Seas on NBC.

1304
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:33,000
This is a thing on paper that I should love.

1305
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,120
I love John Ritter.

1306
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:37,480
I love Olivia Newton John, who is billed as appearing in it.

1307
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:40,920
I love Duran Duran and Simon LeBond is going to be in this special.

1308
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,680
So like, wow, this is a stacked lineup.

1309
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:43,880
This is going to be a blast.

1310
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:47,640
This is the most bummer thing Disney has ever made.

1311
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:51,080
All the stuff you're saying about like, someday the sea will swallow you.

1312
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,640
That's exactly what this is.

1313
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,880
I was the, this is a part where

1314
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:01,880
I mean, John Ritter says something about our fears of the seas are entirely justified.

1315
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,360
I'm like, you're from Three's Company.

1316
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:05,640
You like do Pratt Falls.

1317
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:08,520
Why didn't he bring you in to warn us about the sea?

1318
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:15,560
And then it is one of the strangest things maybe ever in a Disney special, which is like, okay,

1319
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:20,440
so they're showing you like, you know, different iterations of the ocean and stuff,

1320
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:24,120
like including, you know, Walt's been always so obsessed with the sea

1321
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,200
that his first cartoon was about it.

1322
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,480
Steamboat Willie.

1323
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,520
You're like, wait a minute.

1324
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:28,920
Okay.

1325
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,360
Well now hold on.

1326
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:34,440
It's a boat, but that's above a river.

1327
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:40,840
I don't know if, I think that is Mickey avoiding the sea, trying to stay above it.

1328
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:43,400
So that's weird.

1329
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:48,040
But then, you know, like people are still to this day obsessed with nautical stuff.

1330
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:51,800
And then they show clips of the Duran Duran Rio video, which is

1331
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:55,080
just on a yacht and super cool.

1332
01:12:56,120 --> 01:13:01,320
And like, okay, oh, and they're, this is actually a little hip for MTV to be talking about Duran

1333
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:02,680
Duran and Rio.

1334
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:09,480
And now here's a message from Simon Laban, who very soberly describes a real experience he had

1335
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:16,520
where he was part of a yacht race and the yacht capsized and he was trapped inside with six crew

1336
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:19,240
members for 40 minutes and thought he was going to die.

1337
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:20,600
What?

1338
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:21,820
Yeah.

1339
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:23,640
It's wild.

1340
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,480
Ladies and gentlemen, Simon Laban.

1341
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,000
Oh, is he going to sing?

1342
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,560
Is he going to do notorious or something?

1343
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,520
No, no, no.

1344
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:34,600
He very, it is the saddest thing he says at some point.

1345
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,160
Those screams still come back to haunt me.

1346
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:42,280
I also just highlighted the phrase pale blue death.

1347
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:43,980
What?

1348
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:48,680
This had happened to him the year before in 1985.

1349
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:51,080
And again, you think like, what's Duran Duran doing in the 80s?

1350
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,360
Probably living it up.

1351
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:57,480
Just like having sex with all the women being on top of the world.

1352
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:02,600
But no, Simon Laban wanted to be a yacht racer and he was punished by Poseidon.

1353
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:08,280
And now he's at the beginning of it, he says, when the producers asked me to say something

1354
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:11,640
about the seas, I thought long and hard about what I would.

1355
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:15,720
And then it's like a 10 minute version of this near death story.

1356
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:19,240
I'm like, when the producers asked you to do this, you should have said,

1357
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,040
Get the fuck out.

1358
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,480
This sea almost killed me.

1359
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,200
How dare you?

1360
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:23,960
Don't you read the news?

1361
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:26,760
Wow.

1362
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,040
Anyway, it's so weird.

1363
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,760
And that and this story was apparently turned.

1364
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,200
The boat was called Drum.

1365
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:36,280
There's a full documentary about this called Drum, the journey of a lifetime with a Philip

1366
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,480
Glass score.

1367
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,880
You can hear about Simon Laban almost dying.

1368
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:45,160
And then after this in the special, Olivia Newton-John sings a really sad song about dolphins.

1369
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:50,760
And then Laura Branigan, singer of Gloria, I believe, sings the saddest song you've ever

1370
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:51,400
heard.

1371
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:55,400
It's like this is a truly morose special.

1372
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:59,400
So if you want to get bummed out about it, if anybody out there is bummed about things

1373
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:03,000
that are happening lately, and instead you want to be bummed about things in 1986,

1374
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,080
watch this special.

1375
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:05,580
Wow.

1376
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,120
I got I'm sad I missed this now.

1377
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:11,480
I mean, I'm going to be sadder when I see it, but I'm sad I missed it in theory.

1378
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,560
I was I've been saving.

1379
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:17,480
Look, I go to you know, I'm very tired with the baby all the time.

1380
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:23,880
And I was like doing my research late at night and like fading in and out of that half a beer

1381
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:28,440
and I'm watching this special when it's late for me at 830 p.m.

1382
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:31,160
And like, what is he talking about?

1383
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,760
Simon Laban almost.

1384
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:33,260
I.

1385
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,680
Very surreal and grim.

1386
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:39,800
I feel like I had bad dreams about Simon Laban and boats.

1387
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:40,300
Wow.

1388
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:43,900
Man, there's the living seas is just it's misery.

1389
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:52,220
Yeah, the seas will catch us all at some point and the living seas will bum us all out.

1390
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:59,500
I almost I really wish that they had like that the three minute omnimover was something much

1391
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:03,180
more traumatizing than I wish they had gone a little bit harder.

1392
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:05,900
I don't know what it would be with a limited budget, but.

1393
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:07,740
I wish that part.

1394
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:12,060
You hear the moans of everyone who's drowned since the earth began.

1395
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:13,580
And they just like.

1396
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:17,740
They list them Poseidon us yells their name out.

1397
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:21,420
Samuel Frederick, Sir.

1398
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,340
Seven days, thirty four.

1399
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:27,420
I think they should have done that.

1400
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:30,700
I killed him.

1401
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:31,740
I killed them all.

1402
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:34,940
They crossed me and they crossed the sea.

1403
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:40,780
What if I were to tell you, though, for a certain child, the living seas

1404
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:46,860
revealed a kickass discovery, which was a robot named Jason Jason.

1405
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:48,540
I didn't know about this.

1406
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:50,940
There was a robot named Jason here.

1407
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,300
Yeah, that's happier.

1408
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:52,860
That's good.

1409
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:53,980
That's happier.

1410
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:56,300
And I think this they were kind of predicted.

1411
01:16:56,300 --> 01:17:00,700
I don't know if they intended to predict this or it was just something in the air in the 90s

1412
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:08,220
that I feel like there was a lot of TV specials about deep sea exploration, which is what this

1413
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:08,940
robot did.

1414
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:14,140
It was a little robot that would tell you about how we could stay underwater exploring the deeps

1415
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:15,260
for weeks at a time.

1416
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:18,380
But I saw so many specials in school.

1417
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:23,260
I mean, Cameron, maybe James Cameron kickstarted it with the Titanic exploration.

1418
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:29,820
But man, there was so much in the late 80s, early 90s about exploring the deep sea that

1419
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:31,580
that was the real alien.

1420
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:36,060
That was the next final frontier, not space, but the deep sea.

1421
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:40,780
Did you, Jason, did you as a child know Jason?

1422
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:42,140
Did you see Jason?

1423
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:42,780
I did.

1424
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:46,780
I mean, I don't know when he was put in there, but I definitely remember turning a corner

1425
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:49,740
and being like, everyone, everyone, come look, come look at this.

1426
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:52,060
You got to see, get picked, break out the cameras.

1427
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:55,100
There's got to be a picture of you with Jason.

1428
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:59,580
Yeah, I'll have to start digging because I think the Jason sign and robot were around

1429
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:01,180
for a while.

1430
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:06,780
And then and also I even just like the you could climb in the fake suits.

1431
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:10,220
They had the kind of explorer suits.

1432
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:15,420
Jason is an underrepresented original theme park IP also.

1433
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:16,860
Like we don't hear about Jason.

1434
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:19,500
I feel like we haven't seen any toys of Jason.

1435
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:21,260
Yeah, never heard of them.

1436
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:21,500
Yeah.

1437
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:22,780
Rectify this.

1438
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:25,420
Can we make a toy that can we 3D print something?

1439
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:26,940
We I mean, I'm sure we could do it.

1440
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:30,140
I there should have been a park star of Jason.

1441
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:36,780
Yeah, both Jason's Jason shared an and the robot.

1442
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:37,660
Yeah.

1443
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:41,420
So there's also another original theme park character.

1444
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:43,820
Is it Commander Fulton?

1445
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,140
I don't know about Commander.

1446
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:47,020
Yeah, I don't either.

1447
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:51,980
I miss Commander Fulton is the man who's talking to you on the living seas ride.

1448
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:54,780
So he's like, hi, I'm Commander Fulton.

1449
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:57,580
And then like somebody a voice comes in as like Commander Fulton.

1450
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:59,660
They have arrived at sea base alpha.

1451
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:02,780
And we never hear about the commander of the sea cabs.

1452
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:05,260
Yes, he commands the sea cabs.

1453
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:08,780
But I think, yeah, he's in charge of the operation and we never hear anything about him.

1454
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:10,620
I don't know that there's a picture of him.

1455
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:14,460
Maybe I missed it and it exists somewhere, but he's another character.

1456
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:16,620
I think we need to hear more from there.

1457
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:22,460
There's some merge illustrations of the interior of the like center of sea base alpha.

1458
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:24,860
I thought those were interesting because they came out looking.

1459
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:30,060
What they built was almost exactly what this one piece of concept art is.

1460
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:36,060
And the big centerpiece being the tube where the person would be in scuba gear

1461
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:39,340
and then the water would drain and they would come out and go like, hey, everyone.

1462
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:40,780
And then they would.

1463
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:43,900
Oh, that really they'd like unfill it.

1464
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:45,340
And that's really cool.

1465
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:46,540
Yeah, there's there's video of that.

1466
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:47,660
They would unfill it.

1467
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:53,180
And then in the video I watched, the host who had been hosting put scuba gear on

1468
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:55,580
and they get in and fill it back up.

1469
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:56,700
So they like switch.

1470
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:57,740
They come in and out.

1471
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:00,460
And that was very cool.

1472
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:03,180
That feels like a like a David Blaine trick or something.

1473
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:08,540
It's like there's a box that fills up with water over and over again.

1474
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:10,700
But I don't remember that as a kid.

1475
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,700
I just I was reminded of that in a video.

1476
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:15,580
That room is that is very cool.

1477
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:17,180
The base is extremely cool.

1478
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:20,460
It's not like you get nothing after the sea cabs because you get to see

1479
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:22,220
so many great animals.

1480
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:25,020
It is a great reveal when you end up in that room.

1481
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:25,980
That is a really grand room.

1482
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:29,580
And yeah, and there's a ton to do and lots to explore in there.

1483
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:29,900
Yeah.

1484
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:36,300
And there's some in some concept art, there were pictures of it was a little bit more

1485
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:37,260
like Star Trek.

1486
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:41,580
And then some of the outfits and some of the concept art were like there's a I think

1487
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:45,900
there's an episode of Star Trek Next Generation where Commander Riker is fencing in a like a red

1488
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:47,980
like exoskeleton.

1489
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:50,780
Let me make sure that that's right.

1490
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:58,060
And some of the concept art made it look like they would make everybody like wear outfits

1491
01:20:58,060 --> 01:20:58,780
like that.

1492
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:00,540
But I got to find this.

1493
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:01,260
It's pretty Star Trek.

1494
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:03,740
Probably is very Next Generation-y in there.

1495
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:03,980
Okay.

1496
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:05,020
I'd like to apologize.

1497
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:06,380
Riker was not fencing.

1498
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:10,620
He was doing a like a version of like some space martial arts in this outfit that I've

1499
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:11,260
pulled up here.

1500
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:14,300
I really got to watch this show, don't I?

1501
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:15,980
Yeah, no, I think so.

1502
01:21:15,980 --> 01:21:16,140
Yeah.

1503
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:21,900
You know, it's a time if I've gone this far in quarantine and not given this ago.

1504
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,580
There's a lot of nonsense in it.

1505
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:27,980
But yeah, so yeah, there's like outfits like this kind of like almost it's Tron-ish.

1506
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:33,260
It looks almost like football pads, but it's like an approximation of like 80s space.

1507
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,980
With like Chinese symbols on it.

1508
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:38,300
Yeah, I assume it's an alien language.

1509
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:39,580
But oh, sure.

1510
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:39,740
Yeah.

1511
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:40,700
Oh, that's probably correct.

1512
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:41,340
Yeah.

1513
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:41,900
So yeah.

1514
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:45,740
So anyway, there was some concept art I was looking at and I was like, oh man, they were

1515
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:50,700
thinking like a little like they probably ended up just going with your usual Disney-like claw,

1516
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:55,980
like wool space outfits that every, you know, tomorrow land person has to wear.

1517
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:59,340
But they like, it looked like they were maybe thinking of something a little more ambitious

1518
01:21:59,340 --> 01:21:59,820
for a while.

1519
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:01,900
A little Star Trek-y.

1520
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:07,180
There's one original IP that I can bring to the table too.

1521
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:09,740
Do you guys know about Drew?

1522
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:11,260
No.

1523
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:13,020
I know.

1524
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:18,380
According to this is a Twitter user named at Cable, C-A-B-E-L.

1525
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:26,380
Apparently they tested pretty briefly in the Living Seas in 1999 a character named Drew

1526
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:30,860
One and Drew stands for Dolphin Robotic Unit.

1527
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:31,420
Wow.

1528
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:36,700
They swam a robotic dolphin around in that tank.

1529
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:42,060
Who waved to guests, who smiled, who was extremely realistic.

1530
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:43,420
It's really well done.

1531
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:47,980
I don't know why they didn't use it more if they or if it ended up having non-Disney uses.

1532
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:52,220
Did it have like a like a saddle on it or was it wearing clothes?

1533
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:54,060
I believe yes.

1534
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:56,380
So that it could say Drew One on the side.

1535
01:22:56,380 --> 01:22:56,700
Yes.

1536
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:56,940
Okay.

1537
01:22:56,940 --> 01:22:59,260
I saw the concept art of Drew One.

1538
01:22:59,260 --> 01:22:59,820
Yes.

1539
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:00,060
Okay.

1540
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:03,900
Because I was like, there's a dolphin wearing a saddle in this tank.

1541
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:06,540
Like is somebody going to ride that dolphin around?

1542
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:07,580
But I didn't know it was a robot.

1543
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:08,940
It looked obviously it was a drawing.

1544
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:12,220
So nobody wrote it, I guess, but it existed.

1545
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:17,740
And that was made by a company called Edge Innovations that went on to build the Navi

1546
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:20,700
in the tank in Avatar Flight of Passage.

1547
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:27,260
One of the most striking, you know, physical beings anywhere in the parks.

1548
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:36,700
Also made Imatep, my good buddy in Revenge of the Mummy, who I declared cute, I think in a

1549
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:38,220
miniature pony kind of way.

1550
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:42,220
So I'm all about this company.

1551
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:42,940
They did good.

1552
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:43,740
They do great stuff.

1553
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:45,100
Wow, man, a robot dolphin.

1554
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:46,220
That would have been great too.

1555
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:48,620
Yeah, I would never have forgotten that if I was a kid.

1556
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:52,220
I feel like if I was like there's a dolphin with a saddle with his name on it.

1557
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:54,380
There's footage if you Google it.

1558
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:59,900
There's a whole YouTube video, I think, posted by one of the people who produced the robot.

1559
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:05,660
And yeah, I feel like it could have been a mainstay if they had kept it.

1560
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:06,460
I don't know why they didn't.

1561
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:10,300
But we know with like Jaws, obviously robot, water, tough to do.

1562
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:15,500
At this point, is there even a prominent, I mean, they have the Jaws.

1563
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:18,780
It's been working still in Japan and it was working in Orlando.

1564
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:21,740
But I feel like they try to stay away from that still to this day.

1565
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:27,340
Yeah, yeah, I can't imagine they would mix super well.

1566
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:29,340
Yeah, too bad.

1567
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:29,900
Poor Drew.

1568
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:35,020
What else in the exhibit that we want to talk about?

1569
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:42,540
I mean, it's like, well, there's not so many like this landmark show or thing besides Jason, obviously.

1570
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:42,780
Right.

1571
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:45,420
Jason is the number one thing you would have wanted to go see.

1572
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:51,100
Yeah, I mean, we can pivot from robot dolphin to like the real real Adam.

1573
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:57,900
I mean, I don't have the full list of all the things you can see there at times have been dolphins.

1574
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:04,300
Here is a haunting picture of a scuba diver and a dolphin from the pictorial souvenir of Walt Disney World.

1575
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:08,060
This was the Living Seas pages you can see.

1576
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:14,460
I think I would have gotten this book clearly after 1986 when the pavilion opened.

1577
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:18,380
But I think my family was down there in 88 maybe and got this.

1578
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:25,980
And but I got I got a bunch of stuff I was reading about the manatees.

1579
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:32,460
I mean, when we went down, the the gentle giants, the the seafaring mammals,

1580
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:37,820
when we went down them, I think you've you just you describe them so glowingly.

1581
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:42,940
I love I think I spent so much time staring at the manatees when we were there in Florida

1582
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:44,220
when we did the live show.

1583
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:47,820
Did you ever did you think maybe if they could put a little saddle on one of them,

1584
01:25:47,820 --> 01:25:49,180
you could ride them around?

1585
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:52,060
I mean, I would love it. They're very strong. They're very large.

1586
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:54,540
They can grow upwards of twelve hundred pounds.

1587
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:57,340
They're very they're not aggressive.

1588
01:25:57,980 --> 01:26:01,500
I saw something online just today.

1589
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:07,340
A manatee's body is so soft that if the animal crashes into a swimmer,

1590
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:10,220
it's like being bumped by a giant pillow.

1591
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:10,700
What?

1592
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:13,340
Yes, this is your dream animal.

1593
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:14,940
It's great.

1594
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:18,300
And then pillow animal, a pillow animal.

1595
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:20,140
Wow.

1596
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:25,100
They cannot bite you because of the way their snouts are shaped.

1597
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:26,540
They're not aggressive.

1598
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:32,060
And of course, the kings, the current manatees are still there.

1599
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:36,060
Last I saw a post in twenty twenty, I think the ones we saw in twenty nineteen,

1600
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:38,220
Lil Joe and Lou.

1601
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:45,980
Uh, Lil Joe has been released into the wild and then rescued multiple times.

1602
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:50,940
Oh, no, Joe, Lil Joe here.

1603
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:55,420
I think this is the South Florida Sun Sentinel, I believe is the name of the paper.

1604
01:26:55,980 --> 01:27:00,140
Lil Joe first became a public figure in nineteen eighty nine when

1605
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:03,500
rescued from the Halifax River near Daytona Beach.

1606
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:06,780
Let's see what else about him.

1607
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:08,300
Captain captivity.

1608
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:12,620
Lil Joe would be bottle fed by President George H.W.

1609
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:19,020
Bush at SeaWorld in Orlando and sent to wow audiences in San Diego, Cincinnati and Tampa.

1610
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:22,620
I'm a bottle bottle fed by George.

1611
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:25,740
Bottle fed him like like George W.

1612
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:26,140
Bush.

1613
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:26,940
Yeah.

1614
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:31,180
How many creatures has George Bush bottle fed?

1615
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:32,780
Chip.

1616
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:33,100
Can we?

1617
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:33,900
Yeah.

1618
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:36,220
And well, Joe.

1619
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:37,020
Maybe Billy.

1620
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:38,700
Little Joe, my favorite son.

1621
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:43,180
Maybe Billy Bush, if he came over like when he was little.

1622
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:43,820
Oh, yeah.

1623
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:44,860
Yes.

1624
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:46,780
Loaded feed Billy.

1625
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:50,460
What else about little Joe?

1626
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:51,660
There's lots of facts.

1627
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:58,220
Manatee caretakers gradually gained confidence that a really big animal like little Joe,

1628
01:27:58,220 --> 01:28:02,700
he peaked at nineteen hundred pounds and ten and a half feet long, could survive on his own.

1629
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:10,140
He was released in the St. John's River in 2011 and recaptured after being found stunned by cold.

1630
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:13,980
Little Joe, this makes me so sad.

1631
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:16,140
Geez, this poor pillow.

1632
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:23,660
They did a short rehab, released him again, lost track of him and worried he died.

1633
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:28,380
But then in 2012, they found him again.

1634
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:32,460
This is sad, but kind of funny.

1635
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:37,340
Little Joe nearly froze to death and ate a boat cushion during a flirt with freedom a

1636
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:38,620
couple of years ago.

1637
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:40,140
A boat cushion?

1638
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:41,820
A boat cushion, yes.

1639
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:47,100
And they said once they got the undigested boat cushion pieces out of him,

1640
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:49,900
he was back to eating a hundred heads of lettuce a day.

1641
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:57,420
And the article concludes with this very moving statement, quote, he's so big, said Cooper

1642
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:02,380
Lincolnton, twelve of North Carolina, looking through the glass side of Manatee Pool,

1643
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:05,260
twelve feet deep, and quote, peaceful.

1644
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:12,700
So this show, we respect little Joe, all due respect to little Joe.

1645
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:14,940
We stan, would you say we stan him?

1646
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:16,700
We stan Lou and little Joe.

1647
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:23,180
One of them, you know, their fin is a little, little chewed up by boats, of course.

1648
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:29,180
Yeah, that's the thing that really gets them is boats and speedboats and waterways.

1649
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:33,900
Could I request of the audience, I feel like I haven't called for a fan art yet, but could

1650
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:40,620
I get a photo of Jason sleeping on little Joe with a soaking wet blanket on top of him?

1651
01:29:43,660 --> 01:29:46,140
I'll do whatever little Joe asks for me.

1652
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:51,260
One of the Manatees in that TV special, they have to like, yeah, they have to transport him,

1653
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:51,580
I think.

1654
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:59,660
They have to fill a giant flatbed thing with saltwater and lift him with a crane into it

1655
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:03,420
so that he can be cared for at Animal Kingdom and then brought back.

1656
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:05,020
I think that was one of the Manatees.

1657
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:06,620
How old is little Joe?

1658
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:08,940
I'm not quite sure.

1659
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:14,300
There's so much about, and I also lost track of how many times he's been rescued.

1660
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:16,620
He's been released and re-rescued.

1661
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:18,460
Interesting.

1662
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:19,900
He's, you know what's happening?

1663
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,340
He's trying his best.

1664
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:22,460
He is.

1665
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:26,540
Little Joe is trying his best, like so many of the great theme park characters.

1666
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:27,020
Yeah.

1667
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:32,220
He's, maybe he's the best step cop character right now?

1668
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:33,340
Hmm.

1669
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:34,460
Maybe?

1670
01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:35,420
I think that's right.

1671
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:39,660
Maybe he's better than evil figment, than bad figment.

1672
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:39,980
Right.

1673
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:41,340
Dark figment.

1674
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:42,460
Dark figment.

1675
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:43,340
Toilet figment.

1676
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:47,340
Manatees can live 60 to 60.

1677
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:48,860
Wow.

1678
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:49,340
Wow.

1679
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:50,780
Little Joe could be up there.

1680
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:52,780
He's as old as us, probably.

1681
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:54,380
Yeah.

1682
01:30:56,220 --> 01:31:01,900
A manatee in his mid-30s, and I don't know if he's childless or not, but maybe.

1683
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:04,700
A childless manatee in his mid-30s.

1684
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:10,460
The living sea is hosted by one childless manatee in his mid-30s.

1685
01:31:11,660 --> 01:31:13,020
He's as soft as a pillow.

1686
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:14,540
Wow.

1687
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:15,580
Little Joe.

1688
01:31:15,580 --> 01:31:16,940
I love little Joe.

1689
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:17,340
Wow.

1690
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:18,140
I do too now.

1691
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:19,900
I'm so glad you learned about little Joe.

1692
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:22,860
Listen to our voices all lilting now.

1693
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:26,700
Hearing about a pillow makes me so relaxed.

1694
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:30,700
I think only makes love even more.

1695
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:32,220
He's an orphan.

1696
01:31:32,860 --> 01:31:33,660
They found him.

1697
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:34,620
He was orphaned.

1698
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:35,660
He was so little.

1699
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:40,140
And the first two to three years, apparently, the manatee lifespan, that's how they learned

1700
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:41,580
how to exist in the world.

1701
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:44,460
And he just, he didn't get any of it.

1702
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:45,020
Do manatees-

1703
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:46,540
Like so many Disney characters.

1704
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:46,860
Yeah.

1705
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:47,100
Yeah.

1706
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:47,980
Wow.

1707
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:51,100
Do manatees like hugs from humans?

1708
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:56,460
I was reading online.

1709
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:59,500
They're so protected, I don't even think you're supposed to pet them.

1710
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:02,460
But apparently, they will nuzzle up to boats.

1711
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:03,660
They will surface.

1712
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:07,020
So I'm guessing then little kisses are out of the question.

1713
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:11,580
You know, it's kind of, there are limited experience.

1714
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:15,900
You can pay to scuba or snorkel in the living seas.

1715
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:17,340
They still offer those options.

1716
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:21,100
Can you kiss the fish when you scuba dive?

1717
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:28,060
Can I do a chill sesh with Lil Joe?

1718
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:31,660
If you sing a sea shanty on TikTok with him.

1719
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:36,060
If you slip the guy, the scuba guy, a hundred bucks, he'll let you kiss the fish.

1720
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:39,100
It's a little bit of a hack there before you do it.

1721
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:40,300
No, I'm not going to let you do that.

1722
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:42,300
I am going to look the other way.

1723
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:45,980
And if any kissing happens when I'm turned over here, then so be it.

1724
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:48,460
But only little kisses.

1725
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:51,020
I'll hear a big kiss.

1726
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:52,540
Not full on smooch, I'll hear.

1727
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:56,380
Not full on Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd kiss.

1728
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:57,660
Not that.

1729
01:32:58,220 --> 01:32:58,460
Yeah.

1730
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:01,420
Just a little, a little kiss.

1731
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:04,060
I do remember them feeding the manatees when we were there.

1732
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:06,780
I don't remember if children were able to toss in heads of lettuce.

1733
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:11,820
If that was the case, I'm sure I was like eyeing my in.

1734
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:15,340
I was like, OK, after that kid, there's a break.

1735
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:18,460
Maybe I could hop over and toss him a big thing of romaine.

1736
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:22,060
My name is Jason, like the robot used to be here.

1737
01:33:23,660 --> 01:33:25,340
I brought my own romaine from home.

1738
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:31,180
I got the band.

1739
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:33,580
What makes them more special?

1740
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:37,580
OK, I've got object permanence, really good object permanence.

1741
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:41,900
It's 30 heads of lettuce on me, on my person at all times.

1742
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:42,700
My backpack.

1743
01:33:44,220 --> 01:33:47,180
Like a few of like Felix's magic bag full of lettuce.

1744
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:49,260
That's a reference.

1745
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:50,140
I apologize.

1746
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:51,420
Felix the cat.

1747
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:54,860
I don't think I knew Felix had a magic bag.

1748
01:33:54,860 --> 01:33:57,260
Yeah, Felix the cat had a magic bag where he could like,

1749
01:33:57,260 --> 01:33:58,700
it's like Mary Poppins bag.

1750
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:00,460
You could pull whatever you wanted out of it.

1751
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:00,780
Anything.

1752
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:01,980
We're not into TikTok.

1753
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:05,340
People are like Felix the cat's magic bag.

1754
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:12,860
We should try to get the Felix the cat challenge going of like people pulling unlimited items out of their bags.

1755
01:34:12,860 --> 01:34:13,900
Oh, that's good.

1756
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:15,180
Yeah, that's pretty good.

1757
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:18,620
I think that would be the new trend among today's units.

1758
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:20,140
It's called sea shanties.

1759
01:34:20,140 --> 01:34:20,620
You're out.

1760
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:22,540
It's called Felixing.

1761
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:26,300
It's got sea shanties on the run.

1762
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:27,900
Watch out Poseidon.

1763
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:29,580
Felixing is the new trend.

1764
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:31,580
Wow.

1765
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:33,820
Geez.

1766
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:34,700
Oh, my God.

1767
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:35,180
Okay.

1768
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:38,220
Well, Lil Joe the best IP in here.

1769
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:45,180
I mean, I guess we could talk about the Nemo overlay, which, you know,

1770
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:46,700
we don't have to spend a lot of time on it.

1771
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:47,740
Really is like the same.

1772
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:48,700
All right.

1773
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:53,180
So what used to be the sea cabs, it was all closed for a long time.

1774
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:54,860
That's the big thing that happened.

1775
01:34:54,860 --> 01:35:01,020
In what Wikipedia blames on September 11th, the hydrolators in the sea cabs were shut down

1776
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:03,100
and you could just walk into the thing.

1777
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:07,180
Not sure why those correlate, but I guess they're cutting, you know, budget

1778
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:08,140
because nobody's traveling.

1779
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:15,580
So it was kind of an underwhelming version of the living seas for a long time

1780
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:19,740
until they installed Turtle Talk with Crush.

1781
01:35:19,740 --> 01:35:22,300
This is the first place to have Turtle Talk with Crush,

1782
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:25,980
which is at California Adventure and a number of other parks.

1783
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:29,740
And that sort of not only infused new life, but it sort of pointed the way that,

1784
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:31,900
oh, maybe we got to get more Nemo in here.

1785
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:35,340
So now it is a fully Nemo-ified experience.

1786
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:42,380
And that mainly manifests in the sea cabs where you see Nemo and friends.

1787
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:46,700
And it's roughly the same as what happens in the submarine voyage, correct?

1788
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:48,380
Yeah, I don't know.

1789
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:51,740
I had convinced myself that the submarine voyage came first.

1790
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:52,380
It did not.

1791
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:55,420
The seas with Nemo came first.

1792
01:35:56,380 --> 01:36:03,580
And I think the reason I had convinced myself that was because my first reaction,

1793
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:08,220
the first time I did the Nemo Omnibover was, well, this looks a little cheap.

1794
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:11,820
This kind of looks not great.

1795
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:14,060
So I like the fake dune and the queue.

1796
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:21,100
But yeah, I don't, I'm not the biggest fan of the Nemo stuff in here.

1797
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:24,540
I can, I sort of, I remember seeing that movie opening weekend and going like,

1798
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:25,900
I can take her.

1799
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:26,700
I didn't.

1800
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:27,820
I like a lot of movies.

1801
01:36:27,820 --> 01:36:28,140
I didn't.

1802
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:28,620
Oh really?

1803
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:29,500
That was fine.

1804
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:30,540
Nemo's on your list?

1805
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:32,060
Nemo's on my list.

1806
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:34,460
I think Finding Dory is the better movie.

1807
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:35,900
Really?

1808
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:37,820
Yeah, I don't know.

1809
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:39,980
I think just the escape movie.

1810
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:44,220
Some of those Pixar movies where they just do the sequel as a genre movie.

1811
01:36:44,860 --> 01:36:46,940
I think they have a little more fun.

1812
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:49,500
Cars, yeah, they maybe got a little better with that.

1813
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:52,060
Yeah, Cars 2 is insane.

1814
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:52,460
Absolutely insane.

1815
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:54,140
Cars 2 is insane, yeah.

1816
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:55,500
I've never seen it, honestly.

1817
01:36:57,260 --> 01:36:59,900
Doesn't it open with a car getting tortured by another car?

1818
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:04,300
Yeah, it's a spy movie and it's crazy.

1819
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:06,780
It's like only Mater's a spy now.

1820
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:07,900
Wow.

1821
01:37:07,900 --> 01:37:08,460
Oh yikes.

1822
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:09,580
Yes.

1823
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:18,220
I know, I like Finding Nemo and I like that there is some Finding Nemo aesthetics,

1824
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:20,380
not only here but in other places.

1825
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:23,100
I like the seagulls, the mind, mind, mind.

1826
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:26,300
I like that they're at Disneyland, I like that they're outside.

1827
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:34,540
The mural they put in sort of takes away from the brutalist original Epcot feel,

1828
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:36,700
but I like them on the rocks.

1829
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:42,060
I like the Nemo music and I like that Nemo music shows up in various attractions.

1830
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:48,540
I do think that in general they are doing Nemo dirty in the parks because you got

1831
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:51,500
submarines which I feel like people are mixed on.

1832
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:52,380
I'm mixed on it.

1833
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:55,580
As we've discussed, I'm mixed on the sea caps.

1834
01:37:56,780 --> 01:38:02,860
There is a simulator at Disney Sea that is fine, but by the Disney Sea standards,

1835
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:05,820
it wasn't in my top 10.

1836
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:07,100
I don't think it would be in a lot of people's.

1837
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:11,580
There's a crushed coaster in Paris which is...

1838
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:13,340
Actually, I didn't get to do it.

1839
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:13,900
It looks cool.

1840
01:38:14,540 --> 01:38:18,620
But there isn't an exceptional Nemo attraction, I don't believe.

1841
01:38:18,620 --> 01:38:19,120
No.

1842
01:38:20,780 --> 01:38:23,420
I think timing-wise, Nemo...

1843
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:31,980
Because of when the movie came out and because of what needed to be renovated and what was on

1844
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:36,940
the chopping block potentially, Nemo then got saddled with these things.

1845
01:38:36,940 --> 01:38:42,220
Literally, all Nemo was doing is propping up stuff that wasn't that popular or there

1846
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:43,820
was a problem with the system.

1847
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:47,500
It's expensive to run the subs if no one's going to go on them.

1848
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:49,980
All right, we'll throw Nemo on there.

1849
01:38:50,620 --> 01:38:53,100
Nemo is like a stopgap.

1850
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:58,300
It's like to extend the life of something for another decade maybe or two decades.

1851
01:38:58,940 --> 01:38:59,900
It's timing.

1852
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:01,820
I think a lot of us just do the timing.

1853
01:39:01,820 --> 01:39:08,860
Turtle Talk with Crush is the most fully realized cool experience that utilizes that

1854
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:09,980
movie and those characters.

1855
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:12,540
But yeah, Nemo...

1856
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:17,020
I'm trying to think of this another example of a movie that is just like,

1857
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:22,780
its popularity is just being used to not have to spend more money essentially.

1858
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:28,380
Like to bulldoze something and bring up a new ride, which will eventually happen at

1859
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:29,660
least to the subs in Disneyland.

1860
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:32,380
A little bit of Frozen, Frozen somewhat.

1861
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:32,940
Yeah.

1862
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:35,580
I mean, I don't think Frozen Ever After is quite that, but like...

1863
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:37,900
No, I love Frozen Ever After though.

1864
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:38,140
So...

1865
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:39,820
Yeah, I do too.

1866
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:41,260
Does everyone?

1867
01:39:41,260 --> 01:39:42,380
We'll find out.

1868
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:43,740
We will find out soon.

1869
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:50,540
And Guardians of the Galaxy obviously is a re-theme, but they did a great job with it.

1870
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:54,300
It's just there's nothing I can think of that's such a popular movie.

1871
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:56,300
Finding Nemo is so popular.

1872
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:57,580
At least the first one was.

1873
01:39:57,580 --> 01:39:57,660
Yeah.

1874
01:39:57,660 --> 01:39:59,100
There's no rides that...

1875
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:04,860
Nemo is all of these rides that are a version of putting a book under a broken leg of a chair.

1876
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:05,900
Yes.

1877
01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:07,100
Yes.

1878
01:40:07,660 --> 01:40:09,660
And it's timing, I think.

1879
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:10,780
You know what?

1880
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:15,100
I'm not happy that Nemo took the Hydra later, but the other thing that we haven't really

1881
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:22,140
talked about that I loved as a kid, this sign and the constant splashing water I thought

1882
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:23,020
was the coolest.

1883
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:23,580
The mural.

1884
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:24,060
Good call.

1885
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:28,860
The splashing water, the sign, and this kind of looks like shit.

1886
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:30,380
I like it.

1887
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:32,140
It's a little 2000-y.

1888
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:33,340
It's a little gross.

1889
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:37,180
It's not bad, but it doesn't have the vibe of the first one.

1890
01:40:37,180 --> 01:40:41,740
I don't mind the abstract depiction of the characters of the manatees and the fishes

1891
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:42,300
and everything.

1892
01:40:43,660 --> 01:40:50,780
They blend okay with that mural, but the logo, especially when the living seas is just such...

1893
01:40:52,220 --> 01:40:58,060
That's just that beautiful Epcot font and beautiful unfriendly steel just getting to

1894
01:40:58,060 --> 01:40:58,940
shine in the sun.

1895
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:06,540
Which they have slowly been putting back in the pavilion if you see in these pictures.

1896
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:09,740
It's not the same font if I'm going to be picky.

1897
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:11,980
It's more rounded, but I like this font.

1898
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:12,940
I do like it a lot.

1899
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:18,940
This does feel like a revised, reimagined version of the original vibe.

1900
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:23,420
And we should point out that the little areas inside are called modules.

1901
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:25,020
I like that.

1902
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:26,860
Which I'm a big fan of.

1903
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:31,020
That one last one you showed was like module 1B, which was the manatees.

1904
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:32,940
Yeah.

1905
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:36,620
Again, if we were less lazy, we could be joined by the module keeper.

1906
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:40,700
But we're at the end of the episode almost.

1907
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:44,940
We'll have to talk modules in depth later, I think.

1908
01:41:47,180 --> 01:41:51,740
Can I talk about something that was missing from the sign that you just showed, Jason,

1909
01:41:51,740 --> 01:41:55,900
but it was there when the attraction opened, and that is the nod to the sponsor, United

1910
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:56,700
Technologies.

1911
01:41:58,460 --> 01:41:58,780
Okay.

1912
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:00,380
So you alluded to this a little bit.

1913
01:42:00,860 --> 01:42:05,740
United Technologies now a part of Raytheon, which might imply what kind of company they

1914
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:05,980
are.

1915
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:11,500
But this is what I alluded to a while back, and I sort of pulled this from a Jim Hill

1916
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:12,140
article.

1917
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:15,820
That when this attraction was proposed, they wanted to do all this fantastic stuff.

1918
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:16,700
They wanted Poseidon.

1919
01:42:16,700 --> 01:42:17,980
They wanted a curtain of water.

1920
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:22,300
They wanted it to be the base to be entirely underwater, and you travel in pearls.

1921
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:25,340
It was going to be a lot more grand.

1922
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:33,660
But the bill was being footed by United Technologies, and they put a lot of money into

1923
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:33,740
it.

1924
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:37,100
This was an extremely expensive $90 million at the time.

1925
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:39,900
They spent a lot of money.

1926
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:43,340
They did not spend money, but they were like, well, within that, I don't know, all the

1927
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:46,140
other stuff, do we need all the fantastical, all the frills and everything?

1928
01:42:46,140 --> 01:42:47,900
Can't we just show off our suits?

1929
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:51,820
Like, we have these diving suits, and we have those now, and we kind of want people to be

1930
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:54,060
interested in them, so put the suits in there.

1931
01:42:55,020 --> 01:43:00,620
So that's sort of why it ends up being clinical at times.

1932
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:05,660
You actually, Jim Hill describes some of the attraction as dry and academic, and I don't

1933
01:43:05,660 --> 01:43:06,300
disagree with that.

1934
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:07,340
Some of it certainly.

1935
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:08,140
Yeah.

1936
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:16,300
So I'm like, all right, well, what is this weird company that would pay for it, but then

1937
01:43:16,300 --> 01:43:18,780
not want to do any of the cool stuff?

1938
01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:20,700
Like, you're going to reject Poseidon?

1939
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:23,340
You're that limited in your imagination?

1940
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:26,220
What is the deal with United Technologies?

1941
01:43:26,220 --> 01:43:33,340
And the big thing that I found is that, okay, so United Technologies made Otis elevators.

1942
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:33,900
That's fine.

1943
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:35,180
I got no beef with Otis.

1944
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:41,500
They made helicopters such as Blackhawks, and they made engines for military jets.

1945
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:46,460
So they really are like a military parts company.

1946
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:53,100
In the early 90s, when this attraction had only been open for a little while, United

1947
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:59,020
Technologies pleaded guilty to four felonies and agreed to pay $6 million in penalties

1948
01:43:59,020 --> 01:44:03,900
to the US government in connection with the Pentagon influence peddling scandal.

1949
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:09,500
What happened was they were trying to get the inside line.

1950
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:14,860
They wanted to build this engine for the government, an F-404, and they were trying to

1951
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:20,540
figure out how to do it cheaper than their competition, General Electric, sponsors of

1952
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:22,700
Horizons across the way.

1953
01:44:22,700 --> 01:44:26,700
So two Epcot sponsors are trying to build jet engines.

1954
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:28,220
They're competing against each other.

1955
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:33,740
They go to a guy named Melvin Paisley, who is the Assistant Secretary of the Navy under

1956
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:39,260
Reagan, and he had quit the Pentagon, and now he knows all of this info.

1957
01:44:39,260 --> 01:44:45,020
He knows how much things cost, and he accepted money from United Technologies to help them

1958
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:48,220
underbid so that they could get this military contract.

1959
01:44:48,220 --> 01:44:50,060
This all got found out.

1960
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:52,060
United Technologies had to pay $6 million.

1961
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:54,780
Melvin Paisley went to prison for four years.

1962
01:44:54,780 --> 01:44:57,820
There were 58 convictions as part of this scandal.

1963
01:44:57,820 --> 01:45:00,620
The entire thing was called Operation Ill Wind.

1964
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:10,220
This was a massive, massive corruption and fraud and bribery investigation that also

1965
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:14,700
embroiled, among the other companies embroiled in the scandal, General Electric, as I mentioned,

1966
01:45:14,700 --> 01:45:20,860
sponsors of Horizons, and Sperry Univac, sponsors of the Astuter Computer Review and SmartOne.

1967
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:28,540
The people who paid for Horizons, Carousel of Progress, SmartOne, and the Living Seas

1968
01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:33,660
were all committing fraud to try to get military contracts.

1969
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:44,620
When you realize that Epcot is this showcase of awful companies, hellish companies trying to help

1970
01:45:44,620 --> 01:45:45,660
bombs drop.

1971
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:46,960
Oh boy.

1972
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:49,900
Man, yeah, that is wild.

1973
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:51,900
And they don't want Poseidon?

1974
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:57,660
And they, yes, but mainly, okay, all that, building the weapons and everything, or building

1975
01:45:57,660 --> 01:46:03,180
the engines to drop bombs, that's one thing, but depriving us of Poseidon, this like, is it

1976
01:46:03,180 --> 01:46:05,900
fair to call it edging, would you?

1977
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:10,380
Where they give us, excuse me, they're getting something, yeah, they're getting close to

1978
01:46:10,380 --> 01:46:13,900
something good, but then not all the way with it, like Poseidon would be.

1979
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:15,260
Yeah.

1980
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:23,340
The other thing, so the engine that they wanted to build, so they did end up building engines for

1981
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:29,740
the specific plane Hornet Fighters, which were heavily used in Operation Desert Storm

1982
01:46:29,740 --> 01:46:33,740
and the subsequent Iraq War, so thank you United Technologies.

1983
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:43,580
Hornet Fighters were the basis of the characters Bravo and Echo from Disney's planes,

1984
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:44,300
here they are.

1985
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:51,180
Voiced by Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards in a nod to Top Gun.

1986
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:52,700
And isn't that cute?

1987
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:56,940
There they are, cute little planes, the Trump bombs on Iraq.

1988
01:46:58,940 --> 01:46:59,820
Jesus Christ.

1989
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:05,500
Yeah, it's really, it really speaks to like my brain where you're like talking about how

1990
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:08,380
horrible the companies are, and I was like, but what about Poseidon?

1991
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:11,660
That's still, look, that's still where I am.

1992
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:12,780
Absolutely.

1993
01:47:14,780 --> 01:47:20,380
Look, of course, I accept that especially Epcot Center, which I've spent so much of my life

1994
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:27,340
thinking about, was full of evil military contract companies, but if you're going to do that,

1995
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:29,260
then give us cool stuff too.

1996
01:47:29,260 --> 01:47:34,620
General Electric did bad stuff, but then they took us to Mesa Verde and they showed us a kid

1997
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:41,260
upside down and an animatronic seal, and they financed Sherman Brothers songs and stuff.

1998
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:44,860
So you got to give us some good with the evil.

1999
01:47:44,860 --> 01:47:46,460
That's what I demand.

2000
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:46,700
Right.

2001
01:47:46,700 --> 01:47:51,020
It's an equal and it's an equal split cosmically.

2002
01:47:51,020 --> 01:47:52,060
Yes, yes.

2003
01:47:52,060 --> 01:47:52,620
All the way.

2004
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:53,100
Yeah.

2005
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:55,900
50-50 good and evil and then you'll be fine.

2006
01:47:55,900 --> 01:47:56,540
That's right.

2007
01:47:57,260 --> 01:48:04,060
Do we think that like the National Geographic Society, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography,

2008
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:10,620
all these other oceanographic groups were also pushing like, hey, maybe not the fantasy.

2009
01:48:10,620 --> 01:48:15,820
We have a lot of marine biology to do and rescue stuff.

2010
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:21,660
I saw that it was literally like the company was like, here's 90 million bucks.

2011
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:22,460
That's what you get.

2012
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:25,260
And they were like, well, we can't make Poseidon $90 million.

2013
01:48:25,260 --> 01:48:26,140
Oh, I see.

2014
01:48:26,140 --> 01:48:26,780
Okay.

2015
01:48:26,780 --> 01:48:27,100
Yeah.

2016
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:31,260
It got cut way back just because of budget-wise that this is how much they were willing to spend.

2017
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:33,340
And then unfortunately, yeah.

2018
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:37,180
Look, I always say if you're not going to do Poseidon right, don't do them at all.

2019
01:48:38,060 --> 01:48:38,300
Yeah.

2020
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:39,260
So that's really the word.

2021
01:48:39,260 --> 01:48:39,740
Poseidon.

2022
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:44,460
Because Poseidon wouldn't have been bothering the researchers, I don't think.

2023
01:48:45,740 --> 01:48:51,900
Unless there was going to be an animatronic blowing big jets of bubbles and messing up

2024
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:54,060
ecosystems and hurting animals.

2025
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:56,620
Hey, four eyes, what are you doing over there?

2026
01:48:57,660 --> 01:48:59,580
You're telling lies.

2027
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:03,900
The tides happen because of me, not the stupid moon.

2028
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:08,940
Little Joe couldn't cut it in the wild, could you?

2029
01:49:08,940 --> 01:49:11,980
Came back home to mommy, huh, little Joe?

2030
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:13,580
He's taunting little Joe.

2031
01:49:13,580 --> 01:49:15,820
That's a real heel turn if I've ever heard one.

2032
01:49:15,820 --> 01:49:17,100
Poseidon's a bastard.

2033
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:17,820
That's what I'm saying.

2034
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:18,320
Oh, no.

2035
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:21,580
Yeah, he's a power player.

2036
01:49:21,580 --> 01:49:22,140
He's a jerk.

2037
01:49:23,740 --> 01:49:25,100
Yeah, so it's good that he's not there.

2038
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:27,100
Yeah, thank God.

2039
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:28,860
And then we're just left with little Joe.

2040
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:30,700
I mean, yeah, look, there's been ups and downs.

2041
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:33,980
We don't have Poseidon, but we have little Joe.

2042
01:49:33,980 --> 01:49:38,540
You made me realize the warmth at the heart of this attraction.

2043
01:49:38,540 --> 01:49:41,980
And I'm just glad he has a place to stay safe.

2044
01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:43,180
It was all worth it.

2045
01:49:43,180 --> 01:49:47,820
United Technologies, the sea cabs, every bit of it.

2046
01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:49,340
I wouldn't take one bit of it back.

2047
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:52,940
Yeah, so little Joe, I think they need to put little Joe out front a little more.

2048
01:49:52,940 --> 01:49:54,940
I think they need to do some cartoon versions of him.

2049
01:49:54,940 --> 01:49:58,780
Like we did a Patreon episode with Earl the Squirrel,

2050
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:02,700
which is a character universal that sort of was a realistic looking robot.

2051
01:50:02,700 --> 01:50:03,740
But then they made him a cartoon.

2052
01:50:03,740 --> 01:50:07,180
Let's have a cartoon of little Joe.

2053
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:08,620
You know, let's do that.

2054
01:50:08,620 --> 01:50:10,060
And let's go all the way.

2055
01:50:10,060 --> 01:50:15,340
Well, I like to see in Avengers of fairly unpopular aquatic animals,

2056
01:50:16,140 --> 01:50:19,420
like there could be little Joe.

2057
01:50:19,420 --> 01:50:23,900
There's the shrimp mascot from Bubba Gump.

2058
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:25,820
I know he has a name, but I don't.

2059
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:27,180
I'm disappointed in myself.

2060
01:50:27,180 --> 01:50:28,140
I don't know it offhand.

2061
01:50:28,140 --> 01:50:29,100
Does anyone know?

2062
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:30,460
We should know that.

2063
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:34,140
Somebody just brought him up to me and I was like, yeah, why don't I know his name?

2064
01:50:34,140 --> 01:50:36,220
Seems like the kind of thing we would know.

2065
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:37,740
The dirty shrimp man.

2066
01:50:37,740 --> 01:50:39,820
Yeah, everyone knows he's dirty.

2067
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:45,340
Yeah, I might put you know, there was a cartoon of Free Willy where he talked.

2068
01:50:45,980 --> 01:50:49,900
Maybe we could put talking Free Willy in the aquatic Avengers.

2069
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:51,980
Oh, what's the Aqua Avengers?

2070
01:50:51,980 --> 01:50:52,460
There we go.

2071
01:50:52,460 --> 01:50:53,340
That's good.

2072
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:56,540
What's the talking dolphin from SeaQuest's name?

2073
01:50:57,420 --> 01:50:58,300
Oh, I don't remember.

2074
01:50:58,300 --> 01:51:00,380
Oh, yeah, I don't think I ever knew that.

2075
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:02,620
But Drew can be in there.

2076
01:51:02,620 --> 01:51:03,580
Drew's going in.

2077
01:51:03,580 --> 01:51:04,940
Drew can be in there.

2078
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:08,220
Oh, Darfin, Darfin, Darwin.

2079
01:51:09,340 --> 01:51:10,540
I like Darvin, though, too.

2080
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:14,220
Wait, Darwin is the no Darwin's not the Bubba Gump.

2081
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:14,620
Darwin.

2082
01:51:14,620 --> 01:51:15,820
No, no, Darwin's the Sequa.

2083
01:51:15,820 --> 01:51:19,260
Darwin was an intelligent dolphin capable of capable of communication.

2084
01:51:19,260 --> 01:51:23,100
He was a close friend of Captain Nathan Bridger and Lucas Wall.

2085
01:51:23,820 --> 01:51:24,700
Wall is it?

2086
01:51:24,700 --> 01:51:25,020
I don't know.

2087
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:26,060
Can't pronounce his last name.

2088
01:51:26,060 --> 01:51:26,620
I apologize.

2089
01:51:26,620 --> 01:51:27,500
Yeah, sequence fans.

2090
01:51:29,740 --> 01:51:31,340
Is this our plus up?

2091
01:51:31,340 --> 01:51:33,900
We've gotten some requests for plus it up.

2092
01:51:35,420 --> 01:51:36,700
Oh, to bring back plus it up.

2093
01:51:36,700 --> 01:51:37,420
Sure.

2094
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:39,100
Yeah, I mean, pushing little Joe.

2095
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:40,540
Yeah, pushing little Joe.

2096
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:43,580
Little Joe, like enticing people to come in.

2097
01:51:43,580 --> 01:51:45,980
Little Joe dancing around out front like a Bubba Gump.

2098
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:53,340
Sad to say the Fish Police will not be joining as many of them have been stripped of their shields

2099
01:51:53,340 --> 01:51:59,740
and guns for their maybe coordination for the Capitol riot events.

2100
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:03,020
The capital of Atlantis.

2101
01:52:03,020 --> 01:52:03,740
Yeah, yeah.

2102
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:09,420
Yes, the capital of Atlantis, where all those all those like the deep sea fish

2103
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:12,060
that have never seen the sun try to open the core.

2104
01:52:13,180 --> 01:52:14,220
They open the coral.

2105
01:52:14,780 --> 01:52:16,140
They open the coral.

2106
01:52:16,140 --> 01:52:18,700
Yeah, they rotate it to theater gates.

2107
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:18,940
No.

2108
01:52:19,740 --> 01:52:27,100
Yeah, they've been stripped of their shields, which have big starfish on the front

2109
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:29,980
and their guns that shoot little bones.

2110
01:52:30,620 --> 01:52:30,940
Yes.

2111
01:52:33,980 --> 01:52:38,140
My plus up is I would like to return to a more terrifying living sea.

2112
01:52:39,740 --> 01:52:40,540
That's good.

2113
01:52:40,540 --> 01:52:47,740
You can keep the Nemo and friends on there, but like let's make that like let's bring the score

2114
01:52:47,740 --> 01:52:52,700
back that's really going to be haunting and let's let like the Nemo friends remind you like

2115
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:55,740
if we get a hold of you, we will kill you.

2116
01:52:55,740 --> 01:52:59,260
Like they'll like we that's more dangerous fish here.

2117
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:00,540
Don't fuck with us.

2118
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:08,540
Would you like it if I don't know if trickery is involved in your dark vision or could be,

2119
01:53:08,540 --> 01:53:14,140
but would you like if kids and families lined up for turtle talk with crush

2120
01:53:14,140 --> 01:53:17,340
and then when they entered the theater, it's like a psych moment.

2121
01:53:17,340 --> 01:53:21,820
And instead you have to watch all of drum the journey of a lifetime

2122
01:53:21,820 --> 01:53:25,660
and learn about Simon LeBond's brush with pale blue death.

2123
01:53:27,340 --> 01:53:29,100
I think, okay, wait, I like that.

2124
01:53:29,660 --> 01:53:30,540
I like that.

2125
01:53:30,540 --> 01:53:35,900
How about it's yeah, it's advertised at a turtle talk, but it's like the same turtle talk technology,

2126
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:38,380
but it's Simon LeBond from Duran Duran.

2127
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:41,580
So it's a teenager playing him from behind a screen.

2128
01:53:42,220 --> 01:53:45,820
And then he like asks people questions and then he ties everything back to the

2129
01:53:45,820 --> 01:53:49,180
yachting accidents to try to warn people.

2130
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:52,700
So like a child five years old, like, does anyone have a question for Simon?

2131
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:58,700
Yes, you there in the striped shirt and like, I well, are you who are you?

2132
01:53:58,700 --> 01:53:59,100
What?

2133
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:01,500
Well, it all goes back to my yachting accident.

2134
01:54:02,940 --> 01:54:06,300
And then everything is about the yachting accident and that gives everybody,

2135
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:08,540
you know, they understand how dangerous the sea is.

2136
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:13,660
Eventually a mom is like, oh, hey, so, you know, I love hungry like the wolf.

2137
01:54:13,660 --> 01:54:15,020
One of my favorite songs growing up.

2138
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:16,540
How did you come up with that?

2139
01:54:16,540 --> 01:54:22,620
Well, it's I don't remember anymore because I'm my brain is fogged by visions of pale blue death.

2140
01:54:24,300 --> 01:54:26,860
I don't really speak of my music anymore.

2141
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:29,900
Yeah, I think that's good, Jason.

2142
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:31,980
Respect is earned in many ways.

2143
01:54:31,980 --> 01:54:36,140
Sometimes it's earned by the heartwarming story like little Joe.

2144
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:43,260
Sometimes it's earned by learning about respect for the sea by

2145
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:46,300
seeing the mighty power of it in your yachting accident.

2146
01:54:46,620 --> 01:54:50,060
You know, and I'll do that like Simon Le Bon would have done it.

2147
01:54:50,060 --> 01:54:50,540
He said it.

2148
01:54:51,660 --> 01:54:53,820
Respect is earned in a myriad of ways.

2149
01:54:54,620 --> 01:55:01,500
Sometimes by just seeing this beautiful big pillow animal and his many trials and tribulations

2150
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:08,540
and other times by getting getting my ass handed to me in a yachting accident.

2151
01:55:10,540 --> 01:55:13,260
Can we drop Philip Glass score in there?

2152
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:14,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2153
01:55:14,140 --> 01:55:16,460
Throw that in a ton of glass.

2154
01:55:17,020 --> 01:55:20,140
In that case, I think that's a beautiful note to go out on.

2155
01:55:20,140 --> 01:55:20,460
I agree.

2156
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:21,820
Unless there's any objections.

2157
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:28,780
I think you survived pale blue podcast the ride just narrowly.

2158
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:31,500
A trip under the sea.

2159
01:55:33,180 --> 01:55:36,700
Boy, oh boy, we met new friends, met new enemies.

2160
01:55:37,900 --> 01:55:44,300
And that was something for more journeys of a lifetime with us.

2161
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:47,740
Be sure to follow us on all the social medias.

2162
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:49,340
Send us your gripes.

2163
01:55:49,340 --> 01:55:52,780
We're still collecting gripes, which you can send us.

2164
01:55:52,780 --> 01:55:56,380
If you look up the tweet where we posted it, gripes aren't really in a clear place.

2165
01:55:56,380 --> 01:55:57,180
You'll figure it out.

2166
01:55:58,060 --> 01:56:00,060
But there is one clear place.

2167
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:01,980
Put in the description for this episode.

2168
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:03,420
It was in the last description.

2169
01:56:05,020 --> 01:56:05,820
Thanks, Jason.

2170
01:56:05,820 --> 01:56:06,220
Good.

2171
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:06,720
Yeah.

2172
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:11,980
Those of you who just emailed your gripes, tis tis, gotta listen.

2173
01:56:12,860 --> 01:56:15,340
Rule number one, you go to the spreadsheet.

2174
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:18,540
And rule number two, you have to say, yeah, I got a gripe.

2175
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:19,180
All right.

2176
01:56:19,180 --> 01:56:20,060
A lot of people did.

2177
01:56:20,060 --> 01:56:23,500
We'll read gripes that don't, but we'll give them a little tisk tisk as we do.

2178
01:56:24,140 --> 01:56:29,580
A more clear web address is patreon.com slash podcast the ride, home to podcast the ride.

2179
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:33,900
The second gate where you get three bonus episodes every month.

2180
01:56:33,900 --> 01:56:37,660
Go there right now to learn about Six Flags roller coaster cuts.

2181
01:56:37,660 --> 01:56:44,300
The failed hair salon for children started by Six Flags, which very quickly went underwater.

2182
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:48,140
Very good.

2183
01:56:48,140 --> 01:56:48,460
Yeah.

2184
01:56:48,460 --> 01:56:49,340
Oh boy.

2185
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:50,540
Tied it all up.

2186
01:56:50,540 --> 01:56:54,460
Well, I just, yeah, like, just remember, like, the sea is not your friend.

2187
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:57,420
You know, but where is the sea?

2188
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:58,380
Don't go out there.

2189
01:56:58,380 --> 01:57:02,380
Don't end this episode and start thinking you're friends with the sea, but where it all costs.

2190
01:57:02,380 --> 01:57:04,220
The side and sand will strike you.

2191
01:57:04,220 --> 01:57:06,060
Be very careful of the sea.

2192
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:12,380
It is memorable and varied, but it does not use butters like sauces and spices to enhance

2193
01:57:12,380 --> 01:57:18,060
its delicately flavored seafood entrees, which is how the pictorial souvenir of Walt Disney

2194
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:24,460
World describes the offerings of the coral reef restaurant to presumably children buying this book.

2195
01:57:25,340 --> 01:57:27,100
Jesus Christ.

2196
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:29,500
Okay.

2197
01:57:30,060 --> 01:57:31,820
Well, thanks, book.

2198
01:57:31,820 --> 01:57:33,020
That was nice.

2199
01:57:33,020 --> 01:57:35,020
Thanks for ending the show on a weird notebook.

2200
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:37,340
Okay.

2201
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:39,260
Bye bye.

2202
01:57:39,260 --> 01:57:39,580
Bye.
