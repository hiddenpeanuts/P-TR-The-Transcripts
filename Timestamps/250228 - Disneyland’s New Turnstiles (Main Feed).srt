1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Warning! The following podcasts may contain

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
pleasant little welcome chimes,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
shoe sole material investigation,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
a long diversion about Vivian Vance's jewelry,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and clear door talk.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
All that plus, we stroll through the new Disneyland turnstiles

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
on today's podcast, The Ride!

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, where we know something

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
that never goes out of style is going in and out of turnstiles.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't know why the man Jason Mraz popped into my mind,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
but it felt like a rhyme, a Mraz rhyme or something.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You were reading some of his poetry.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I don't know why.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't even begin to know why that's the case.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not familiar enough with the Mraz body of work.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm not really either.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't think to know that.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I don't know why I said that. I'm not either.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Listener, if you know, or if Jason Sheridan knows,

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
are you Mraz, him being a fellow Jason,

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
are you familiar enough with the body of work?

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not, but I will say Disneyland is a place

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
you can see fireworks from the freeway.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Is that something from Jason Mraz?

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Isn't that a line?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Isn't that a Mraz line?

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Again, I'm not the person to add.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I think you are the Mraz expert here.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
He sings the remedy.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I know that it's about not worrying your life away.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Besides that, I don't know.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The remedy is the experience.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Is that what he says?

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's a dangerous liaison.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Look at this.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This is the most music knowledge he's had so far

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
on this whole podcast.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Well, that was in the college zone.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That was when your music aperture opened up,

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
the 10 months of new music.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's right.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Mraz is right in the zone there.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But the one song, I think.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yeah.

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The remedy, yeah.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Well, that's the one.

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Although he had a bigger one, obviously.

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, he had the hats.

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We were all like, oh, whoa, what are those hats?

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He did have the hats.

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes, well, but not to distract too much,

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
because I do want to get into today's topic,

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
which is the Disneyland.

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
If you know this, and maybe you don't know this

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
if you're not on the West Coast,

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
but the Disneyland has been redoing its entrance plaza.

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's been redoing.

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Is that even the right term, entrance plaza?

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That might be like what's between the sets.

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The gate, the literal gates.

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And we have the second gate,

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
but we don't do a lot of talking about the actual gates,

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
which are really the first part of your theme park experience.

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Right.

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And they're brand new at Disneyland.

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
They opened earlier this year.

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
They cost $4.8 million,

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and it's 38 new entry gates,

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
so it's a whole new experience as you enter, though.

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I feel like we haven't done enough gate talk on the show in general.

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We've talked about Universal, which gives, like,

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
they do the, like, put your little finger on the dirty little circle

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
or dirty little oval,

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and rub your dirty germs all over.

78
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Everybody that's been there is, like, during the day's germs.

79
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Step one, yeah, put your finger on.

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But we haven't really talked enough about, you know,

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
all the different things.

82
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Magic Bands, Entryway, and Disney World,

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
which, like, that is kind of supposedly in Disneyland yet,

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
but I haven't tried it. I haven't bought one.

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You can use a newer one there.

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You know, when we were down at Universal Orlando in 2023,

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
they had some of this facial recognition.

88
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh, yes, and that's an aspect of this,

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and I don't know if that's up and running yet,

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
but I think there will be a facial recognition component.

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I think currently they're having cast members on their phones

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
scan you in, and then automatic gates open.

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's part of the new...

94
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's not the, like, metal poles,

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
whatever you want to call it, that spin around.

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's now these plastic gates.

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And I think currently cast members are helping with this,

98
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
but I think the idea is that eventually it'll just be a self-serve thing

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and that they'll monitor that via scanning your face.

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And so Universal's been doing that for a little while then.

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
They were testing it, at least I think it was at Islands.

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So we don't know if they've instituted the facial recognition.

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah, I don't know for sure.

104
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
They were testing it at Islands for sure.

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It was live testing when we were there,

106
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and I gotta say, I wasn't really a fan of the fingerprints.

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm certainly not a fan of the facial recognition.

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I was wondering where you were gonna go with it.

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It kind of gives me the creeps, you know?

110
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
How long do they hold that data?

111
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Forever.

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We're just giving all our data away to all these companies.

113
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
They did have our face already,

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
because they would take the picture for many years.

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's true.

116
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So you would see the picture in there.

117
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And I think we discovered on some fine print recently

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
that they have the picture, I think, for like seven years,

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and then they have to upload it.

120
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
There was a time limit on when you have to refresh that picture.

121
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And it's more frequent with kids.

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yes.

123
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Kids have to update their photos more often

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
because of the rate that kids would change and grow at, obviously.

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What is everyone's favorite way to get into a theme park?

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Mine is Magic Band.

127
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's my favorite way.

128
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
There's something class...

129
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hello?

130
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Whoa.

131
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What?

132
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hey, boys.

133
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What's going on here?

134
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Griffin?

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Griffin Newman?

136
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Griffin's here all of a sudden.

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Griffin, what's up?

138
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Wait, wait, what the hell?

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We didn't even know you were in town.

140
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What's going on?

141
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Are we doing a main feed episode?

142
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, this is a Disneyland turnstiles.

143
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah, we're just doing a...

144
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
New turnstiles is a main feed episode, huh?

145
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How's that going?

146
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
How are you feeling about this?

147
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
How's this going?

148
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I introduced a question I felt pretty good about,

149
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
but other than that, I think it's fine.

150
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I was kind of excited to answer that

151
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
because I kind of like just the good old-fashioned...

152
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What's your favorite way to enter a park?

153
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah, huh?

154
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah.

155
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Right, yeah.

156
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
For a main feed episode!

157
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yes, yeah.

158
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Why not?

159
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What are we doing here?

160
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What the fuck's the problem with that?

161
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Why not?

162
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's our podcast.

163
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This topic is feces!

164
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's feces?

165
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Feces?

166
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's got mold on it!

167
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What do you mean?

168
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That means it's old, I guess,

169
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
but it's kind of a new topic because it just happened.

170
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
These are new games.

171
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You're doing a five-minute sidebar conversation

172
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and you're overpouring it!

173
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You don't do a main feed episode!

174
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I mean, you don't understand what this podcast is.

175
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We mine a lot out of a little.

176
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's what we've always done.

177
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
How is this any different than what we always do?

178
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This is our...

179
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You come in here, you tell us how to run our podcast.

180
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm shutting this down!

181
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's almost like you flew into a town.

182
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You didn't know anything about the operations going on here.

183
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You started demanding things.

184
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Wait, yeah, wait a minute.

185
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What did you just say?

186
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What did you yell just now?

187
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm shutting this down!

188
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You're shutting it down?

189
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Where do you get out?

190
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're shutting down our podcast?

191
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You don't have the right to do that.

192
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What gives you the right to do that?

193
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Excuse me.

194
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
One year ago, 2024, year of our Lord,

195
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Griffin Newman does whatever he wants,

196
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
wins a Club 3 poll.

197
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That's right.

198
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We have a very productive three-hour-plus pitching session

199
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
on Untitled Jason Sheridan animated project.

200
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We've been pitching around.

201
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
We worked up a big deck.

202
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's been an exhaustive amount of pitching.

203
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There's a bidding war going on for it, too.

204
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The town is going crazy.

205
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But at the end of the episode, before my title and my power seeded,

206
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I slammed a bottle of Jon Taffer's brown butter bourbon onto the table

207
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and decreed that Taffer 1 must happen, main feed, before the end of 2024.

208
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Now, some things went awry.

209
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Sure.

210
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Life got in the way.

211
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
A lot of life got in the way.

212
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We all had a crazy 2024.

213
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's got you at another child.

214
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I left for a while.

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
My podcast co-host had two more children.

216
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Two of those.

217
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
My God, my condolences to him.

218
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Which basically amounts to me having one child.

219
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I think law of averages.

220
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
There's enough spillage on that at scale.

221
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
One is kind of yours.

222
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Engagements?

223
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Mm-hmm.

224
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Marriage?

225
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What do you mean?

226
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Time for marriage.

227
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Are you upset about it?

228
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Are you simply mad about this?

229
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm thrilled for Jason.

230
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm thrilled for my good friend.

231
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But the point is, it got away from us.

232
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yeah.

233
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh, shit, I forgot.

234
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I forgot.

235
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm telling you what gives you the right.

236
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Of course you have the right.

237
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Everything in the world gives you the right.

238
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's past the calendar year, but it's time to make it happen.

239
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Tap for one.

240
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay.

241
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This is Podcast Rescue.

242
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This year, 6,500 failing podcasts will close their doors for good.

243
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If things don't change soon, Podcast the Ride of Burbank, California will become just another

244
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
statistic.

245
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
In 2017, Mike Carlson, Jason Sheridan, and Scott Gairdner invested their life savings

246
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
into their dream podcast.

247
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's time to make it happen.

248
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's time to make it happen.

249
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's time to make it happen.

250
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's time to make it happen.

251
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's time to make it happen.

252
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's time to make it happen.

253
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's time to make it happen.

254
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's time to make it happen.

255
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:24,600
we'll become just another statistic in 2017, Mike Carlson, Jason Sheridan, and Scott Gairdner

256
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,040
invested their life savings into their dream podcast.

257
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,380
Curious Theme Park fans flock to this trendy audio hotspot.

258
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:38,800
But today, Podcast the Ride has become a fractured mess of tangents, dry micro-topics, and barely

259
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,780
any theme park content at all.

260
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,000
You and your f***ing Madam need to get the f*** out of here.

261
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,120
People just don't know about Madam yet.

262
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
Counterpoint.

263
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
Oh, yeah, you f***ing up saying that.

264
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,120
Don't even say that.

265
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,120
Now, Podcast The Riot is over $300,000 in debt.

266
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,120
With nowhere else to turn, the Good Boys have agreed to bust open the books,

267
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,120
pull back the main feed, and do a topic the whole audience can agree on.

268
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
Bar Rescue.

269
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,120
Podcasts are a science, and no one understands podcast science like Griffin Newman.

270
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,120
I don't embrace excuses, I embrace solutions.

271
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,120
Griffin is renowned to all the Good Boys for having a more successful Patreon than theirs.

272
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,120
You've already served this story five times!

273
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
It's got bacteria on it!

274
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,120
This is Taffer One.

275
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,120
Wow. Oh my god. You seized your power. It's happening.

276
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,120
Disneyland's new turnstiles are out the door.

277
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,120
They are trash now, and we are now in the long disgust.

278
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:49,120
Bar Rescue, aka the Taffer Soad, aka Taffer One.

279
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,120
My god. The main branding that you, Griffin, brought to the table.

280
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,120
Wow. I mean, I'm freaked out. I'm pretty jostled.

281
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,120
I came with page after page of notes about the turnstiles.

282
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,120
We didn't even get to say that they're actually tap styles.

283
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,120
We didn't even get that term out there.

284
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,120
But I guess now we're talking about different styles of taps in bars that Jon Taffer rescues.

285
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
Tap styles is what we're talking about.

286
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
This episode's become all about tap styles.

287
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:24,120
Now some listeners, and perhaps these people overlap with the folks who think I should never be on this podcast.

288
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,120
I'm going to say they exactly do, yes. It seems like the type.

289
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:35,120
Have long seemed to stand in opposition to the very idea of Taffer warranting an episode, let alone one that I am forcing through.

290
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:43,120
People are coping with, some people, certain people, certain very vocal people are coping with a lot right now.

291
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,120
Not only is it you, they also maybe were like, I was kind of excited about turnstiles.

292
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,120
And now you've barged in.

293
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:56,120
They were hoping Taffer Club 3, no guest, 15 minute mini-soad.

294
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:03,120
Instead, you are getting main feed as you declare that to happen using the established Club 3 power.

295
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,120
And keep this in mind, if you are a Club 3 member and a Club 3 guest at the same time,

296
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,120
you, much like Daniel Day Lewis Lincoln, is clothed in immense power.

297
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
I don't know if that's the exact quote.

298
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,120
I always go for clothed in immense power.

299
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,120
Yes, he's very, no, no, no.

300
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,120
No.

301
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,120
We're on the world stage now, no, no, no, no.

302
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
I'm Abraham Lincoln.

303
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,120
Only he knows, only he figured out the real voice.

304
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,120
Now I want to settle something, because I understand this is sensitive time.

305
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
Yeah, yeah.

306
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,120
A lot of talking about Taffer is talking about facing our own depression, right?

307
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,120
I think John Taffer, more than anything, is a depression warrior.

308
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,120
I think Bar Rescue is a show about depression.

309
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,120
And so I'm just going to give some hard truths right now to the audience.

310
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,120
People who are locked in and excited for turnstiles going, oh, finally, theme park content.

311
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,120
They're getting back into the theme park minutia.

312
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,120
And now it's being interrupted by Taffer on main feed with my least favorite recurring guest.

313
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,120
I got bad news for you.

314
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
You need to adjust to the marketplace.

315
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,120
This is no longer a theme park podcast.

316
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,120
It hasn't been a theme park podcast in a long time.

317
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,120
You have to rebrand, much like Corporate Bar needed to let go of its pirate dreams.

318
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Look at their clientele.

319
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
Look at the clientele of the show.

320
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,120
They don't even want, they aren't even theme park people anymore.

321
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,120
You have to adapt to the times.

322
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,120
Look at the neighborhood.

323
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Surrounding Forever Dog Studios, 20 bars.

324
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
Right there.

325
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,120
The Universal Studios is closed, sure, but only one measly theme park.

326
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
20 bars.

327
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,120
Universal Bar and Grill is right there.

328
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,120
This podcast needs to adapt to relate to bars.

329
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:47,120
Each bar a dirtier or flipping concepts than the last.

330
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,120
Do you think if you dropped John Taffer off the back of a plane with a parachute and landed him onto this block.

331
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,120
If we did it, actually physically?

332
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,120
If you hired someone to be like kidnap John Taffer, swat his home.

333
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,120
I don't want any part of this, wink wink.

334
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,120
I want enough deniability that I bought the plane.

335
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Multiple Trank Darts, Elephant Grade.

336
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,120
Yes, sure.

337
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,120
It takes a lot to bring him down.

338
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
Get him in a cargo ship, drop him off with a parachute.

339
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,120
He lands on this block.

340
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:22,120
Do you think he ejaculates immediately seeing the amount of bar rescuing he could do with the 15 steps?

341
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Here in the Lankersham area.

342
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
Right?

343
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,120
Yeah, there are some bars and the bars do seem in dire need of rescuing, yes.

344
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,120
I also think another observation he would make is they do the show, they all live in Burbank.

345
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,120
Burbank is a college town.

346
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,120
Look how many colleges.

347
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:45,120
You've got Accidental, you've got Glendale Community, LA City College or something is right there.

348
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
Woodbury University.

349
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,120
And they aren't servicing Woodbury University whatsoever.

350
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,120
Talking about theme parks kind of sometimes.

351
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,120
Boys, I know the theme park podcast dream has been nice.

352
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,120
But it's just that it's a dream and it's time to wake up.

353
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,120
This needs to be a podcast about underage drinking.

354
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,120
Look at your surroundings.

355
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,120
It's easy for you to come in here and say that.

356
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,120
But I promised my dead husband that I would start a theme park podcast and that I would keep it about.

357
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,120
And I'd keep his belongings around here in memory of him.

358
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,120
Let me ask you a question.

359
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,120
You think your dead husband would be happy to see you being a big success?

360
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,120
That is what he always said he wanted for me.

361
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,120
Let me ask you another question.

362
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,120
Did your husband ever go to college and have some beers when he shouldn't?

363
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,120
Yes, of course, that's how I met him.

364
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,120
We were both in a bar at 15.

365
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
I think he'd be smiling.

366
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,120
I think he'd be looking down on us and smiling if he saw what this podcast could become.

367
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Okay, okay.

368
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,120
I'm going to work with you.

369
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
I want to believe you.

370
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
I'm going to work with you on this.

371
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,120
We're going to do an episode about Jon Taffer.

372
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
God damn it.

373
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:58,120
One week later, Scott reinstated podcast the ride has since been canceled.

374
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,120
Six weeks later, the podcast was canceled.

375
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,120
Jon saddled it with an unusable premise.

376
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:13,120
The full-length New Turnstiles episode becomes the only podcast to get negative listeners.

377
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,120
Kettle One pulled their sponsorship.

378
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,120
They realized it was doing nothing for them.

379
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
Kettle One's been keeping this pod afloat for years.

380
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
People don't know that.

381
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,120
Jon's major suggestion was to light the logo from underneath.

382
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,120
It draws the eye.

383
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,120
That's something they're doing now.

384
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,120
Get with the times.

385
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
It's the 2010s.

386
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,120
This podcast needs a butt funnel.

387
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,120
You need to encourage listeners to touch each other.

388
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,120
There are so many odd, weird little elements.

389
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,120
All those phrases.

390
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,120
All is like draw the eye and stuff.

391
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,120
Come and go over the years, I think.

392
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,120
I went back and watched the very first one.

393
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,120
There was so much talk about hidden cameras, I feel like, in 2000.

394
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,120
In the episode of Bar Rescue?

395
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,120
Was that the premise then?

396
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,120
That we're putting hidden cameras around so he can do the recon?

397
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:16,120
At some point, it clearly became they have the most produced reality show cameras in the world.

398
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,120
In the bar for five hours.

399
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,120
We are not hidden anymore.

400
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
I think that's all.

401
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,120
Believe it or not, I think some of this might be constructed.

402
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,120
I think some of this might be cake fabe.

403
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,120
I'll say this.

404
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:40,120
My favorite cave fabe moment is in a more recent episode for a bar called Sacktown in Sacramento.

405
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
Sacktown?

406
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
Yes.

407
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,120
Maybe we should call this podcast.

408
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,120
I hear that kind of thing is doing really well these days.

409
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,120
I'm open to it.

410
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,120
This isn't like Old Town Sacramento.

411
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,120
It's very touristy area.

412
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
How many colleges?

413
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,120
A lot of colleges surround us.

414
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,120
This is immediate income!

415
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,120
Women!

416
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,120
Well, okay, now here's the thing though.

417
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:14,120
It's a touristy area, but it's a guy who's an ex-cop and funneled all his money into making a massive sports bar

418
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,120
filled with signed jerseys and memorabilia.

419
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,120
And it is not doing well.

420
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,120
Because he keeps insisting, you don't know, this is a sports town.

421
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,120
Taffer's like, it's not.

422
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,120
But the funniest moment is...

423
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,120
Wait, does he mean all of Sacramento isn't a sports there?

424
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:38,120
In terms of like versus like a Chicago with a million sports bars.

425
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,120
That's strange though.

426
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,120
People like sports in sports towns.

427
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,120
He's going to judge the entire city that no one likes sports in all of Sacramento.

428
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:52,120
So this is a real touristy area and there's a lot, they say there's a lot of farm to table restaurants popping up.

429
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,120
Come on.

430
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,120
So this is all his thing, but I haven't even gotten to.

431
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:08,120
The recon is they go in with all the people and Taffer does it himself with his guest, T-Pain.

432
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,120
Oh, I have seen this episode.

433
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:18,120
Taffer and T-Pain put on plain black baseball caps, walk in and walk right by the owner who goes like,

434
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:23,120
Welcome to our very usually quiet bar.

435
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,120
And then later in the episode, they're confronting him.

436
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,120
He's like, I didn't even see him come in.

437
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,120
And Taffer and T-Pain are pretty recognizable.

438
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
Taffer is a giant.

439
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
He's a giant.

440
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,120
Even if you don't know who he is, you would notice when the giant walks in.

441
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,120
I'm going to go one step beyond this.

442
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,120
He is the single most physically distinctive man alive.

443
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,120
Part of this episode is going to be drilling down into why all four of us felt compelled to do this episode.

444
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,120
Yeah.

445
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
I think we're going to have to break down because this is a bar rescue episode.

446
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,120
This is a John Taffer episode.

447
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,120
Why are we fascinating with this man?

448
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,120
Part of it is no one in history has ever looked like him.

449
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,120
Yeah.

450
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:09,120
If Shredder created Toka Rezar and put John Taffer next to the two of them, he would look right.

451
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,120
They would be three scary guys that could beat up the Ninja Turtles.

452
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,120
Can you imagine a NECA ultimate Taffer?

453
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,120
Yes, I could.

454
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
Oh, geez.

455
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,120
Now that would get me.

456
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
I'd be in the NECA game all of a sudden.

457
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,120
All the different variations.

458
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,120
Casual Taffer.

459
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,120
Chef Boyardee.

460
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
Color Scheme Taffer.

461
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,120
Yeah.

462
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:36,120
On the Taffer's Tavern website, John Taffer and his furry friend with just a casual dress shirt and one of his dogs.

463
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,120
I'm a nice guy too.

464
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,120
I have furry friends.

465
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,120
I don't scream at him.

466
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
He'd run away.

467
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,120
With his rescue pup, Bentley.

468
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
That's nice.

469
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:51,120
I'm just imagining John Taffer singing the Sarah McLachlan part in the SPCA commercial.

470
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,120
In the arms of an angel.

471
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,120
They're dying.

472
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,120
They're dying every day.

473
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:07,120
You are right that it's one of the immediate things I think that locked me into the Taffer universe the first time I stumbled across Bar Rescue is like,

474
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:14,120
is this show actually pretending in the first five minutes of the episode that everyone is surprised when he walks through the door?

475
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,120
Despite there being like fucking sitcom lights, like 20 cameras.

476
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,120
Angles.

477
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,120
Coverage.

478
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,120
Movement.

479
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,120
Camera movements.

480
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,120
Not like zooms.

481
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,120
Going into the back rooms.

482
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,120
A camera went into the kitchen already.

483
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
Tracks.

484
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
A camera's in the accountants office.

485
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,120
Right.

486
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,120
And as you said that he can walk in with a hat and be like, oh, I'll have chicken fingers, please.

487
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:40,120
And you're just like, even if you don't know what John Taffer looks like, in a world where you're pretending these people haven't all signed NDAs.

488
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,120
And they contacted him too.

489
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,120
Of course.

490
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,120
They begged him to come.

491
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,120
Still, if that guy walks into a bar, every single person turns around and goes, how does someone look like that?

492
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
A giant man walked in.

493
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
A giant, unique man walked in.

494
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,120
He even says a word.

495
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,120
Yeah.

496
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,120
Can I say my Taffer resemblance?

497
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,120
I might have said this on the show before.

498
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,120
And by the way, I want to back up a little and talk about our history with Taffer.

499
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,120
I think that might be important to stay in case people are really like, what's going on?

500
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,120
Why is this episode started?

501
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,120
And now it's about the guy from Bar Rescue.

502
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,120
And that's for the best.

503
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,120
No one's making you listen.

504
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,120
If you want to hang out and enjoy it.

505
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,120
Those customers didn't pay.

506
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,120
You didn't get them upgraded.

507
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
You didn't get them behind the second gate.

508
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,120
They're freeloaders.

509
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:34,120
I've always thought that John Taffer looks like, if you look up, not the cartoon character, but look up Governor Ratcliff Disneyland.

510
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,120
Oh, yes.

511
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,120
The villains from Pocahontas.

512
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
Specifically the walk around.

513
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
Specifically the walk around.

514
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:51,120
And if you imagine him without pigtails and colonial garb, without his big purple hat, just put the walk around Ratcliff in modern clothes and big billowy clothes.

515
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,120
I think that and you got to get rid of his mustache proper.

516
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,120
But then you leave kind of the unshaven nature.

517
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,120
And he's got the big lips.

518
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,120
He's got the big angry pouty lips.

519
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,120
Can you see it?

520
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
Yeah.

521
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,120
He's a little bit like Taffer.

522
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,120
I'm going to throw another one out.

523
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:19,120
I think he kind of looks like the handsome ogre played, voiced by Jon Hamm and Shrek forever after.

524
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,120
If you guys want to Google Jon Hamm.

525
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:30,120
Now in the universe of Shrek, this is supposed to be the hunkiest ogre imaginable.

526
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,120
Hunky ogre.

527
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
There's a little bit of a...

528
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
Brogan?

529
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,120
The name is Brogan.

530
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
Brogan.

531
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
Right?

532
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,120
There's a little bit of a thing.

533
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,120
Yeah, yeah.

534
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,120
Just kind of the most face and head you've ever seen.

535
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,120
But also like skull, neck and shoulders all being one.

536
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,120
Yeah.

537
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:55,120
There's a, oh my God, there's a side character in the first Despicable Me that Aaron said that he looks like.

538
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
And this is going to drive me crazy.

539
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,120
Who is it?

540
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,120
I put in an accountant.

541
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,120
I don't think it's someone with a mundane job.

542
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,120
Is it a lawyer?

543
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,120
No.

544
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
Yes.

545
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
Wait.

546
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
I think so.

547
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
What is this character's name?

548
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
Oh, it's in the TV tropes.

549
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,120
Oh, God.

550
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
Here, this guy.

551
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,120
Does anyone know who this is?

552
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
Oh, no.

553
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
There's some Taffer resemblance.

554
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
Yeah.

555
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
Yeah.

556
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
I don't know Despicable Me well enough.

557
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
Anyway.

558
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,120
So first things first.

559
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,120
Which animated character does Jon Taffer resemble the most?

560
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,120
I'm glad we're getting past this.

561
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,120
I think I texted this to you guys recently.

562
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:41,120
But the realization that his birthplace is Great Neck, New York, when he is perhaps the owner of the world's greatest neck.

563
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,120
Yeah.

564
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,120
If we're talking greatest as in most, does anyone have more neck?

565
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
Great as in mass.

566
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
Yes.

567
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,120
That's the home of Andy Kaufman, is it not?

568
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
I think that's where Andy...

569
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,120
Oh, wow.

570
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,120
Two of our greatest performance artists.

571
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
Right.

572
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,120
The ability to walk into a room and make people question reality.

573
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,120
Yeah.

574
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,120
Yeah.

575
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120
Kind of a real life Tony Clifton.

576
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
Yeah.

577
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,120
Who was stuck that way.

578
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,120
That's another resemblance.

579
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:13,120
Is he, is Jon Taffer an alter ego of another more like, but not like a, like a nice figure who we've never gotten to meet?

580
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,120
Business man, Tony Clifton.

581
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,120
He's playing the long haul.

582
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,120
There's a nice, meek little guy operating that suit.

583
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
Yeah.

584
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,120
Is Great Neck, that's New York City suburbs, like Long Island area?

585
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
Nassau County, Long Island.

586
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,120
Nassau, okay.

587
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
Yes, North Shore.

588
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
Yes.

589
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,120
All right.

590
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,120
That kind of unlocks a lot of the screaming.

591
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,120
What about the voice?

592
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,120
You get it better now.

593
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,120
So let's talk a little bit about how we got here.

594
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,120
I think it's a voice we've been doing a lot.

595
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:54,120
I want to say that Mike was the first, but I think it was one of those that we, it like spoke to, it like caused us all to like, oh, that is a shared interest we didn't know we have.

596
00:24:54,120 --> 00:25:08,120
I think we've all watched the show and enjoyed the show and enjoyed the explosive presence of this man who comes in and screams at bars until they change their name and then possibly change the name back three weeks later.

597
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,120
So I think this bit was happening for a long time.

598
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,120
There was plenty of shut it down.

599
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:20,120
I know one that really lingered was the thing you're obsessed with, Mike, where he yells about the guy's wife.

600
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,120
Yes.

601
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,120
He tells Harold at the Scottsdale Comedy Club, this is why your first wife left you.

602
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
This is why your first wife.

603
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,120
He goes, I'm going to be, I watch it.

604
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,120
He goes, I'm going to be rough with you.

605
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,120
This is why your first wife left you.

606
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:39,120
I'm sure someone on the Reddit will be able to carbon date the first time it came up in conversation.

607
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:46,120
I feel like I heard you guys all in real time realize that you shared the interest in Taffer.

608
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,120
And I think pretty soon after that, I messaged and said, I too am obsessed with Taffer.

609
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:57,120
It wasn't a I need to do this episode with you as much as a I endorse the idea that this should be a full fledged episode.

610
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,120
Yes, you were supportive of that regardless of participating.

611
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:06,120
I do think there's something here and I think it falls into some of my favorite PTR bits.

612
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:16,120
The ability to like drill down into the couple of conversational verbal go tos of a character and apply that to different subjects.

613
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,120
Right.

614
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,120
Sure. Yeah.

615
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,120
Yeah.

616
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
The sort of Kathy Bates like.

617
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
Oh, boy.

618
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
Late shift thing.

619
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,120
Right.

620
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
Which as well helps me, I think, work out aggression in a way.

621
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
Maybe that's true.

622
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,120
Maybe like us all fairly meek men, maybe like getting to live.

623
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,120
Right.

624
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,120
In a kushnik or a taffer for a little bit like helps like get something, get some of the inner anger gunk out.

625
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,120
Right.

626
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,120
And, you know.

627
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,120
Is it Kathy Bates?

628
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
I don't know.

629
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,120
This is maybe two inside.

630
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,120
The Kathy Bates character from Late Shift.

631
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,120
Is that your favorite character to perform on podcast?

632
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,120
Oh, yeah.

633
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,120
I can.

634
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,120
I feel like I can get lost in that.

635
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,120
Yeah.

636
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,120
Sure.

637
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:58,120
Have you have you dug down in her recently Critics' Choice award winning role of Matlock?

638
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:03,120
Now, Jason, I heard you're exploring CBS's Matlock.

639
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,120
You've been negotiating to watch one episode.

640
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,120
Let me tell you, I didn't know that was her.

641
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,120
I only saw the billboard far away.

642
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,120
And the other night.

643
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,120
You said to yourself, you tap Jane.

644
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,120
You go, who is this fresh face discovery?

645
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,120
I only saw the ads.

646
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,120
And then Jane was like, oh, Kathy Bates just won a big award.

647
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
And I looked it up.

648
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,120
I was like, oh, my God, she's Matlock.

649
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,120
I was just saying, who is going to fill Andy?

650
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,120
I sincerely would say, who is going to fill Andy Griffith's shoes?

651
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,120
Did you say that out loud to Jane?

652
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,120
And then did you say, who's Andy Griffith?

653
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,120
She said, please go back to bed.

654
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
That's the thing you say in the morning.

655
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,120
Who's going to fill Andy Griffith's shoes?

656
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Your sleeping cap flies across the room like, don't wake daddy.

657
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:52,120
You said that in like an alma mater speech at your high school.

658
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,120
Yeah.

659
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,120
I look at you at the student body.

660
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,120
Which one of you is going to fill Andy Griffith's shoes?

661
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,120
We've been waiting 20 long years.

662
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,120
There's a lot of fishing and a lot of cricks to do.

663
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,120
Which of you is going to do it?

664
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
You see a bouchement in theaters.

665
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,120
You go, call me crazy.

666
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
Call me crazy.

667
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
But someday.

668
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,120
I think she's got it.

669
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:15,120
Look, I've clocked a lot of Matlock and diagnosed murder hours

670
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,120
when I was a kid of my grandparents, OK?

671
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,120
Those were the shows they like.

672
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,120
And then later on, they short-lived martial law.

673
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,120
I don't know if that was short-lived.

674
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,120
I think that was maybe by those standards.

675
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,120
I think martial law was a law.

676
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,120
Martial law only lasted eight seasons.

677
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,120
By CBS standards, you're right.

678
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,120
A failure.

679
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
Diagnosis murders 30 years or whatever.

680
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,120
Jason, do you know the hook of this new Kathy Bates Matlock?

681
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,120
Well, I bet she doesn't take any guff.

682
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,120
Mike, do you know where I'm going with this?

683
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,120
I believe I know.

684
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,120
Is she a computer simulation?

685
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,120
Is she AI or something?

686
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,120
It's some clunky ass convoluted explanation of like she was...

687
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,120
I'm going to say this very quickly because I also haven't watched it.

688
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,120
But the day it premiered, and the show seems to be doing very well.

689
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
Yeah, it seems like it.

690
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
She won a Craig's Choice Award.

691
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
She got up.

692
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
She said, this isn't just big for me.

693
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,120
It's big for network broadcast television.

694
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,120
So she and Tim Allen are saving network TV.

695
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
Shifting gears is going wild.

696
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,120
That's what I read.

697
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,120
So Matlock old folksy lawyer, right?

698
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,120
Gentile folksy lawyer.

699
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
Yeah.

700
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,120
They announced Kathy Bates.

701
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,120
Everyone goes, oh, the hook is just gender swap Matlock.

702
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,120
We've been here before.

703
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:34,120
Then the first episode premieres, and I see on Deadline, the shocking twist at end of Matlock premiere broke down.

704
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,120
Oh, my God.

705
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,120
And listeners, skip ahead if you don't want to hear, if you know Matlock spoilers.

706
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,120
We're now halfway through the season.

707
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
Jason, cover your ears.

708
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:45,120
So if people have watched any amount of this show, they know what the twist is at the end of the first episode.

709
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,120
There is a conceit twist from the get-go that was not in the marketing.

710
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,120
Lindsay told me this, and I can't remember it.

711
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,120
I believe the conceit is, oh, Kathy Bates, I'm folksy.

712
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,120
I'm Matlock.

713
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,120
I'm just an old lady.

714
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
I don't know what I'm doing.

715
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:03,120
Then you find out that she had a close relative, maybe a son, who died due to an opioid addiction.

716
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,120
And the law firm that she's working for represented the Sackler analogs in this universe.

717
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,120
And she's like fucking trying to get in from the inside and tear this whole fucking place down.

718
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
Oh, my God.

719
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:22,120
It is Opioid Crisis Revenge Matlock with Kathy Bates using this cover being like, oh, I'm on a CBS procedural.

720
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,120
I'm taking all these fuckers down.

721
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,120
Was she not a lawyer before?

722
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
I don't know.

723
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,120
She's just an angry mom.

724
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,120
But I'm like, there's maybe a little bit of, like, mushnik in the Matlock.

725
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
Do you know what I'm saying?

726
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
Kush, Kushnik?

727
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,120
Kushnik, sorry.

728
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,120
Close enough.

729
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,120
Even I couldn't place it for a second.

730
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
Kushnik.

731
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:49,120
It's very funny you say that because in the first or second episode of the new hit show that I have watched all of, Dr. Odyssey.

732
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,120
Of course.

733
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,120
Spoiler alert listeners.

734
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,120
Dr. Odyssey.

735
00:30:53,120 --> 00:31:01,120
Dr. Odyssey is the show about Joshua Jackson playing a doctor on a very high end cruise ship.

736
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,120
Playing?

737
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,120
He's the head of medicine.

738
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,120
Head of medicine.

739
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,120
But is he really or is he playing one on a cruise ship?

740
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,120
The character in January.

741
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,120
Okay, okay.

742
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,120
All right.

743
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,120
Joshua Jackson is a false doctor on a cruise ship.

744
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,120
He's saying the role of a real doctor.

745
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,120
Okay.

746
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,120
Don Johnson's the captain?

747
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,120
Don Johnson's the captain.

748
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,120
And there's love boat, like, guest star roles.

749
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,120
So, like, Rachel Dratch is on one.

750
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,120
Oh, God, the guy from A Serious Man.

751
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
Michael Starbark?

752
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,120
No, the other one.

753
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,120
Richard Kind?

754
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,120
I keep going.

755
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,120
All right.

756
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,120
How many serious men can you name?

757
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,120
Ed Malamud is on one.

758
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:52,120
But the twist at the end of an episode is Dr. Odyssey reveals he did all this amazing charity work all around the world.

759
00:31:52,120 --> 00:32:02,120
But then he's working at a hospital in Massachusetts where he was patient zero for the novel coronavirus.

760
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,120
What?

761
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:10,120
They spent a lot of months in isolation, like, until they could get it to...

762
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,120
The number one first person to get it?

763
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
He was number one.

764
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,120
He was Dr. Odyssey.

765
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
And is Dr. Odyssey his real name?

766
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,120
No, the name of the ship is the Odyssey.

767
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,120
His real name is Dr. Wuhan?

768
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
I might say he invented the virus himself.

769
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,120
In America, he was patient zero.

770
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,120
So that's the big twist.

771
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,120
Are you still watching Dr. Odyssey?

772
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,120
Well, it's not come back from its midseason break yet.

773
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,120
But you've seen all of it?

774
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,120
I've seen all of it.

775
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
Jason has been down in the dumps recently for that reason.

776
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,120
For that reason alone.

777
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,120
Yeah.

778
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,120
I want to amend an earlier statement, Jason.

779
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,120
Sure.

780
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:53,120
Tim Allen, Kathy Bates, and Jason Sheridan are single-handedly keeping network broadcast television alive.

781
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,120
Very good.

782
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
Yeah.

783
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,120
How many people are going to start...

784
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,120
And I was recommended Dr. Odyssey by this podcast.

785
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,120
And it has been...

786
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,120
I finally understand COVID in a way I never did before.

787
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,120
This is now a podcast about recommending network broadcast television shows.

788
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,120
Recommending things with approximately 200 times our audience.

789
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,120
It has not been a podcast about theme parks and gear.

790
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,120
Let's get some audience on these shows.

791
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,120
If we became a Shifting Gears recap podcast, that's when the money would roll in.

792
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,120
Yes.

793
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,120
And that is when all of America's most important political figures would start appearing on our shows.

794
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,120
They would have to be on our show.

795
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,120
And they'd go like, that's supporting Kath Denning, Sean William Scott.

796
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,120
Like, these aren't like spring chickens, you know.

797
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,120
What?

798
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,120
These aren't fresh new fish.

799
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
They are not fresh new faces.

800
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,120
Spring chickens.

801
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,120
Faces, they're pros.

802
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
Was that also when you saw Kathy...

803
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
Now, who's that on that billboard?

804
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,120
Is that a spring chicken or more of an autumn chicken?

805
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,120
Yeah.

806
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:54,120
Taffer is, just for me, one of the great Podcast the Ride bit run structure guys.

807
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,120
And you'll never devote a full episode to him, but sometimes you'll go into a sidebar of like,

808
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:03,120
imagine Taffer commenting on this subject or this situation.

809
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,120
And it always makes me happy.

810
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:10,120
And part of what makes me happy with it is that, and I'm going to join you guys in this.

811
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,120
The pressure's on now.

812
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:17,120
The four of us at the table, none of us do an even reasonably good Taffer impression.

813
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,120
I think that's fair.

814
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,120
You have fun doing a take on Taffer.

815
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,120
There's a game to how to do a Taffer.

816
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,120
But like, you had James Adomian on here.

817
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,120
He does a great Taffer.

818
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,120
It's a great casual impression.

819
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,120
That very much illustrated what a real one is, yeah.

820
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:35,120
All four of us, I think, are hobbyists in the sport of just yelling in a hoarse voice

821
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,120
and making extreme statements.

822
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,120
What the fuck are you talking about?

823
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,120
It's very well observed.

824
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,120
I understand what great neck is as opposed to just general New York.

825
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,120
This is very regional accurate.

826
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,120
You want to have a perspective on the character.

827
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:55,120
That Dana Carvey, George Bush, he was not necessarily accurate.

828
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,120
Accuracy isn't as funny sometimes.

829
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,120
You pick one or two things and you use that as your touchstone.

830
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,120
You exaggerate.

831
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,120
You blow it out from there.

832
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,120
It's just term and you wind it up and go.

833
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,120
What do you know about impression science?

834
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,120
David gives you shit about every goddamn impression you do.

835
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,120
I'm shutting you down.

836
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,120
Let's compare track records.

837
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:22,120
For me, I have to give my knowledge, at least at the start,

838
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:27,120
I will give it to Mike in his tastemaker role.

839
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,120
Excuse me?

840
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,120
Elaborate, please.

841
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,120
I like what he's saying, whatever it is.

842
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,120
Griffin dropped the bottle at Mike, the tastemaker.

843
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,120
This place has fallen apart.

844
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,120
Secure my water bottle.

845
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,120
He's trying to compliment me.

846
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,120
I am.

847
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:51,120
Sometimes, at least in the past, Mike would get really into something

848
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,120
and talk about it and show it to you.

849
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,120
I remember being over at your apartment.

850
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,120
You're like, have you seen this show?

851
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,120
You found it either on demand or at the time,

852
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:10,120
it was like 80% of Spike TV's programming.

853
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,120
It is addicting.

854
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,120
You made tastemaker for you.

855
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,120
That's what you're saying.

856
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,120
I don't know.

857
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:24,120
I'm just saying, I've looked at a lot of numbers involving a lot of puppets

858
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,120
and polls lately, and I think Mike, the tastemaker,

859
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,120
might be a questionable term.

860
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,120
It's got a big old pin in that one.

861
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,120
Oh, no, that's the entire episode unravels, if that's where we go.

862
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,120
You've got madam sins to answer for yourself.

863
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,120
Pin for later.

864
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,120
All right, I will break it down.

865
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,120
I trust my friend's taste.

866
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,120
We usually often see eye to eye.

867
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:48,120
And so, I agree with him.

868
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,120
Don't let him bully you.

869
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,120
That's what I do on the fucking show.

870
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,120
You're going to tell me to not do the thing that I do?

871
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,120
What does that leave me with?

872
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,120
People love my suggestions.

873
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,120
I've got to say, Scott's going full physical with his performance.

874
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,120
Apologies, I've been banging on the table.

875
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,120
Face red, arms flailing.

876
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,120
I'm trying to surf the levels on that Zoom.

877
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,120
It's a nightmare.

878
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,120
They know what they're getting into.

879
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,120
It's a Tapper episode.

880
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,120
Everyone trying to lean back from the mic.

881
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,120
We needed an engineer.

882
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,120
It's hard not to never having an engineer.

883
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,120
We should have hired an engineer for this episode.

884
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:24,120
This guy's doing Sonic the Hedgehog recordings in here.

885
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,120
What did that?

886
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,120
What the fuck did that mean?

887
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:34,120
That reference was too obscure, even for a currently relevant piece of IP.

888
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,120
I'll explain it later.

889
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,120
We'll put a pin in that, too.

890
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,120
Okay, second pin.

891
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,120
He made a naughty joke he shouldn't have made.

892
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,120
Oh, no.

893
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:49,120
I will say, though, I showed Jane a couple bar rescues last night

894
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,120
because she had never seen the show.

895
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,120
So I showed her what she wanted to see.

896
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,120
I said, oh, there's some in the San Fernando Valley.

897
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,120
There's a couple in Burbank.

898
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:02,120
So we watched some of those, and she got it immediately.

899
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,120
She was immediately on board.

900
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,120
Yeah, she understood the hypnotic.

901
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,120
Did she say who was the tastemaker who showed you the show?

902
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,120
Somebody with incredible taste must have made his taste

903
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,120
the way they would go in front of you.

904
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:21,120
I guess I'll just be the server waiter,

905
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,120
goes like, I'm not taking this, and then storms out.

906
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,120
They're like, I don't need this.

907
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,120
No, I like it.

908
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,120
Yells back at Tapper.

909
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,120
I like the compliments.

910
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:35,120
Do you, Jason and Mike, or Scott and Mike, excuse me,

911
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,120
remember your first exposure to Tapper, how you locked in?

912
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:42,120
Because I'm genuinely struggling to think of when he hit my radio.

913
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,120
I was no big fan.

914
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:49,120
All right, I will give some shine to Mike the tastemaker, I guess.

915
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,120
Thank you.

916
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,120
Because I think it was the thing I just watched a bunch of on a plane once,

917
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,120
and that was kind of all.

918
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,120
I wasn't really watching it regularly.

919
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,120
And I guess it is only post Mike the tastemaker bringing it up

920
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,120
and it becoming a runner that now it became like, well,

921
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:10,120
defaults at lunchtime, maybe I throw on the All Bar Rescue channel on Pluto.

922
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,120
Which is just...

923
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,120
If you don't know about it, Pluto TV has the...

924
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,120
I love every Pluto TV channel.

925
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,120
It doesn't matter what it is, but they have such...

926
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,120
I love blocks.

927
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,120
It's like Nick at Night when I was a child.

928
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:26,120
Cheaters that I can flip between All Cheaters and All Bar Rescue, my God.

929
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,120
What a world we live in.

930
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,120
Two Star Trek channels.

931
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:33,120
I discovered a Pluto channel the other night that is Cheers plus Frasier.

932
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,120
Wow.

933
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,120
And I was scanning what was coming up.

934
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,120
I love Cheers.

935
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,120
And I was like, oh, it's kind of later season episodes.

936
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
I prefer the earlier ones.

937
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,120
Let's see what's coming up for the next couple hours.

938
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,120
Going totally chronological.

939
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,120
Oh, really?

940
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,120
Presumably just does all 11 seasons of Cheers in order in a row,

941
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,120
which begs the question, are they alternating with Frasier days

942
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,120
or is this channel 11 seasons of Cheers in a row

943
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,120
and then like 11 seasons of Frasier and then back to the start?

944
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,120
That's like a full shift of format, essentially.

945
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,120
Right.

946
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,120
Like every week.

947
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,120
Right.

948
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,120
Is it every other week between the two shows running in their entirety?

949
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,120
I also know...

950
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,120
I've enjoyed Cheers when I've seen it, but I'm no expert.

951
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,120
And that's why I'm just going to throw it out.

952
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:22,120
If anybody else has any thoughts on what Taffer would say to the gang from Cheers.

953
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,120
Does anything come to mind is what he might criticize.

954
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,120
I took some notes.

955
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,120
I was doing some digging in some different areas.

956
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,120
I didn't quite make a research fort, but I tried my best.

957
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:36,120
We decided this was not a spacey-esque structured episode

958
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,120
where we're each coming with one piece.

959
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,120
We all were just trying to dig around and see if we found some interesting stuff.

960
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,120
I listened to a couple Taffer podcasts.

961
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,120
I was trying to get some more backstory of his own podcast.

962
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,120
I listened to one episode of each of his...

963
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,120
Multiple podcasts.

964
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,120
He had two podcasts that both ended.

965
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,120
He just signed a deal last week for two new podcasts that will launch later this year.

966
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,120
But he's in between podcasts.

967
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,120
So I listened to episode of both.

968
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,120
I also listened to Taffer on Rob Lowe's Literally podcast.

969
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:09,120
And Taffer on the Idiot podcast.

970
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,120
The former Nerdist.

971
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,120
I listened to some of that as well.

972
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,120
And I think it was in the Rob Lowe episode I actually had the best meet in it,

973
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,120
but I just need to throw this out.

974
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,120
Rob Lowe was asking how he got started.

975
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,120
How he made the transition to TV, rather.

976
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,120
And he said, well, I was friends with a bunch of the people at Paramount

977
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,120
because I used to work with Paramount.

978
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,120
And Rob Lowe said, what do you mean?

979
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,120
And he said, you know, they had restaurants and stuff.

980
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,120
So I would consult on like Bubba Gump.

981
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,120
I was instrumental in Bubba Gump.

982
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,120
Which you guys knew, right?

983
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:41,120
But then him bringing it up as I worked with Paramount for many years.

984
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,120
I was like, Taffer must have fucking consulted on Cheers at some point.

985
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,120
He didn't say it.

986
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,120
And Lowe kind of cut him off.

987
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,120
Once he said Bubba Gump, he was like, Bubba Gump, does Tom Hicks get a piece of that?

988
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,120
Like then he just jumped on to that.

989
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,120
Sure, as we might.

990
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,120
But yeah, you're right.

991
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,120
You remember the corporate family.

992
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,120
Paramount restaurant chains?

993
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:06,120
50-50 shot Taffer consulted on Cheers at some point.

994
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:11,120
Did he have anything to do with the Cheers airport bars with the animatronics that got sued?

995
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,120
I'm just like, we need to follow the trail on this.

996
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,120
He couldn't immediately find any results.

997
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,120
But he didn't say, I worked on Bubba Gump.

998
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,120
He said, I worked with Paramount for years.

999
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,120
Because what other Paramount restaurants exist?

1000
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,120
The Quarks bar in Las Vegas.

1001
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,120
Oh my god.

1002
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,120
But that seems like the kind of shit he would hate.

1003
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,120
You're dressed up like space people.

1004
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,120
You look ridiculous.

1005
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:39,120
I know he's not a Star Trek fan because I listened to his audio book about conflict.

1006
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,120
By the way, I don't want to cut you off.

1007
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,120
We're all bringing so much to the table.

1008
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:51,120
For the runtime, I think it's important to remember that this is Taffer 1.

1009
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,120
Because I think we're all going to get through a tenth of what we're bringing to the table.

1010
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,120
The power of conflict.

1011
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,120
I had no idea the power of conflict was on the table.

1012
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,120
Speak your mind and get the results you want.

1013
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,120
Scott, this is why I texted last night.

1014
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,120
I said, any guidelines for structure?

1015
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,120
You said free for all.

1016
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,120
Everything's on the table.

1017
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,120
We're not attempting to get through all of it.

1018
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,120
But everything was on the table.

1019
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:17,120
He uses the famous Star Trek episode, City on the Edge of Forever, to prove that conflict is good.

1020
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:22,120
And he says, even though I'm not a Trekkie, he explains that he's not a Trekkie.

1021
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:34,120
He uses that episode, very popular, famous original series episode, to prove that a war doesn't happen and then things go bad.

1022
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,120
So it proves that the conflict is good.

1023
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,120
Military conflict is good.

1024
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:42,120
We should be in every war. We're not in enough wars.

1025
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:49,120
Wasn't Roddenberry's whole thing, like, kind of trying to make a sci-fi show with as little conflict as possible?

1026
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,120
Yes, correct.

1027
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,120
That was sort of his, like, life's mission?

1028
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,120
A peaceful future, yes.

1029
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,120
Yeah, the vibe is very polite.

1030
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,120
Yes, there's no money, there's no conflict.

1031
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:03,120
They found it hard to write Next Generation because he put rules on, like, the people cannot have conflict.

1032
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,120
And then he dies and then the show gets a little better.

1033
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,120
Yeah.

1034
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:10,120
Like, the rules loosen a little bit for what the characters can do.

1035
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,120
No one wants peace in the Space Federation!

1036
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:17,120
He also explains that great music has come out of conflict.

1037
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,120
Go on.

1038
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:23,120
Including the Rolling Stones, Fleetwood Mac, and even the Beach Boys!

1039
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,120
He addressed the Beach Boys in his book?

1040
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:30,120
Yes, he talks about how the Beach Boys had conflict and they created wonderful music.

1041
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:34,120
Although, I think the music gets worse the more...

1042
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,120
Their commercial prospects go down as they're fighting more.

1043
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,120
I don't know if that's exact.

1044
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,120
Yeah, I don't know. That's a mixed bag.

1045
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,120
But Fleetwood Mac, for sure. Can't argue that.

1046
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,120
We all know that he started as a drummer, too, right?

1047
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,120
I have. I do know that.

1048
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:52,120
I do have a photo in front of me of him in his band days.

1049
00:44:53,120 --> 00:45:02,120
Here is a black and white photo of kind of a little bit of a retro throwback greaser guy, young John Taffer.

1050
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,120
Like a bowman, a John Bowser bowman.

1051
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:08,120
He is very Bowser from Sha-Na-Na-esque, I would say.

1052
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:14,120
And he, in fact, described this band that he was the drummer of as being a little bit like the stray cats.

1053
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,120
He is after my heart now.

1054
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:21,120
Conflict! What gives the ride thrives on conflict?

1055
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,120
That's why you have one who doesn't like the stray cats and the others...

1056
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,120
I don't know how they feel, but it's fun to fight them at the stray cats.

1057
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:31,120
You've got to get on board. You've got to rock this town tonight!

1058
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,120
Not tomorrow! Not in five years!

1059
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:40,120
I don't embrace excuses about rocking this town. I embrace solutions.

1060
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,120
I embrace the rocking of the town.

1061
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:48,120
That photo, he is looking pretty fit and thin.

1062
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:53,120
It is alarming how much his neck is still twice as wide as his head.

1063
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,120
It's an unbelievable...

1064
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,120
It's very long in this. This shows you that the neck is quite long.

1065
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,120
Right, yes, yes.

1066
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,120
It is pro wrestler neck.

1067
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,120
Yes. It's wild, yeah.

1068
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:07,120
But I'm like, in that photo, it's like he looks kind of beanpole-ish.

1069
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:10,120
Where you're like, the neck is not muscle, it is not fat.

1070
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,120
That is just his basic construction.

1071
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,120
He's sort of built like a popsicle stick man with arms and legs.

1072
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,120
It's what made me good at observing what happens at bars,

1073
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:25,120
because my neck allows me to get up above where other people can see.

1074
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,120
I can see everything that's going wrong.

1075
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,120
I can see all the roaches. I can see the bugs in the bottles.

1076
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,120
Much wants the bottles lit from underneath.

1077
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,120
But I can't install them. I'm too tall.

1078
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,120
Somebody's balls got to go down and do it.

1079
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:46,120
In the early credits, opening credits of Bar Rescue,

1080
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:50,120
which you see the show change a lot over the years,

1081
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:55,120
the narrator in the opening credits is so reserved

1082
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,120
and doesn't really find the full this voice.

1083
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,120
Yes, yeah.

1084
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,120
But they say something.

1085
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:04,120
There's a moment in the credits where it's like the bar science

1086
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:09,120
from the height of the stools to where your eyes first go on the menu.

1087
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:13,120
And I'm like, I do not remember menu eye lines.

1088
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,120
I see it. I don't remember it.

1089
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,120
It's when they have on a menu, they'll have like a little thing in a rectangle

1090
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,120
and they want your eye to go to that to order that

1091
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,120
because that's where they usually make the most money.

1092
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,120
And I don't remember if I learned that from Jon Taffer

1093
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,120
or from one of my other restaurant guys.

1094
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,120
You're never happy with just one type of guy.

1095
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,120
Yeah, Robert Earl. I don't know.

1096
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,120
I mean, I shouldn't say my guys.

1097
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,120
Yeah, they dropped that.

1098
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,120
That was like a subtlety in the early opening

1099
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,120
that just kind of gave way to like just showing people

1100
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,120
having full meltdowns in the beginning for a while.

1101
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,120
They use that.

1102
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,120
Slamming windows.

1103
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:52,120
Yeah, they use that voiceover guy for the Jon Taffer podcast.

1104
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,120
Yes, which I love.

1105
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,120
So he still has an intro that's very bar rescue-ish.

1106
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,120
Is it called No Excuses?

1107
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,120
That was the first one.

1108
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,120
That's the first one.

1109
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,120
And then I think the second one was just called the Jon Taffer podcast.

1110
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:06,120
Yes, and he has like interviews with people like Guy Fieri

1111
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,120
or Guy Fieri and Kristin Chenoweth.

1112
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,120
The one I listened to was,

1113
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:14,120
is live entertainment coming back with Caratop?

1114
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,120
Yes, Caratop's on that.

1115
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,120
It's a lot of COVID era stuff.

1116
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,120
It's a real fucking time capsule in a way that's a little upsetting.

1117
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,120
It is not a great listen.

1118
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,120
I listened to, there's an episode of that show

1119
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,120
that's the first episode of 2020.

1120
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,120
2020 is going to be your year.

1121
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,120
Do not embrace excuses.

1122
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,120
He was talking to the virus.

1123
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,120
He's talking to everybody.

1124
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,120
And it's just Taffer going like,

1125
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,120
I'm telling you, this year, anything you want to do, you can accomplish it.

1126
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,120
On that show in particular, he does a little bit of NPR voice,

1127
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,120
which is very unnerving.

1128
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,120
Yes, he does.

1129
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,120
Yeah, he's like another guy on the podcast.

1130
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,120
He's trying to prove that I have another mode.

1131
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,120
I'm actually smart.

1132
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,120
Very together and very calm.

1133
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,120
2020, I got great feelings about this.

1134
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,120
The economy is in a great place.

1135
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,120
I think divisiveness is down.

1136
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,120
He's got a sidekick on the show.

1137
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,120
Is it Jamie, who he goes like,

1138
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,120
Chase, you know what I'm talking about here?

1139
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,120
Is it Chase?

1140
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,120
It's not.

1141
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,120
Or is it Cory?

1142
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,120
It might be Cory.

1143
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,120
I think it's Cory.

1144
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,120
And he goes, Cory, do you know what I'm talking about here?

1145
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,120
It feels like people have calmed down.

1146
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,120
The era of peak divisiveness is gone.

1147
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,120
We're all starting to get a lot.

1148
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,120
January 2020.

1149
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,120
He goes, people just had Thanksgiving.

1150
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,120
I think families aren't fighting as much.

1151
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,120
I watched the Golden Globes.

1152
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,120
Not too much politics.

1153
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,120
But in this very quiet voice, he's like,

1154
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:29,120
2020, I'm telling you, I think everyone's going to calm down in 2020.

1155
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,120
My good pal, my good friend, the doctor,

1156
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,120
got a great job on a cruise ship called the Odyssey.

1157
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,120
It's going to work out fantastically.

1158
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,120
He just caught a little bug, and then he's getting on that ship.

1159
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,120
Once he works out this cough, it's a billion dollars for this guy.

1160
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,120
I listened to something in the start of 2023, one of those,

1161
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,120
and he is in the same way you're discussing,

1162
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,120
where he's like, everything's going to be good in this year.

1163
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,120
He starts talking about the great success of Taffer's Tavern,

1164
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,120
and how many locations they have,

1165
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,120
and how Las Vegas is coming.

1166
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,120
January 2020, it's unbelievable.

1167
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,120
Las Vegas is coming soon.

1168
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,120
We're rejecting franchise applications.

1169
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,120
We can't handle all these requests.

1170
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:13,120
I looked at, there is an episode that is October 28th, I believe, of 2020

1171
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:18,120
that is the state of businesses with President Donald J. Trump.

1172
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:22,120
I was like, fuck, this feels like maybe the most fruitful thing to dig into,

1173
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,120
and I actually don't think I can listen to 45 minutes of this

1174
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,120
without having a nervous breakdown.

1175
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,120
Trump one week before the 2020 election with Taffer

1176
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,120
explaining how America's coming back.

1177
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:35,120
And it's a lot of like, and I need you to promise, Mr. President,

1178
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,120
because we need you.

1179
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:43,120
We need minimum wage kept low so these lazy people don't get too comfortable.

1180
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:48,120
Well, he addresses his political beliefs while he does it on the podcast,

1181
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,120
but he addresses political beliefs in the power of conflict.

1182
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,120
He explains that he is a fiscal conservative,

1183
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,120
but he's very socially liberal.

1184
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,120
He explains he supports all the different people.

1185
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,120
I grew up in the rock and roll scene.

1186
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,120
You can't be a conservative in rock and roll music.

1187
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:09,120
Not only that, the big formation of the John Taffer legacy

1188
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:14,120
is him becoming the manager of the Troubadour, running the Troubadour for years, right?

1189
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,120
Yes.

1190
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:20,120
And he always likes to underline that was the black flag, dead Kennedys, Adam Anthony.

1191
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,120
We are past the, yeah, the Troubadour famous nightclub in LA,

1192
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,120
been around since the 70s, or really like peaked culturally in the 70s

1193
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:33,120
with like gentle singer-songwriters, like the birthplace of James Taylor.

1194
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,120
He talked about doing an anniversary event where they convinced

1195
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,120
Ronstadt and Jackson Brown to come back,

1196
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:44,120
but Taffer, failed rock drummer, was overseeing all these early punk guys,

1197
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,120
which just feels like the most incompatible vibe,

1198
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,120
even more so than the singer-songwriters.

1199
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,120
Yeah, he came in, not in the early days of Troubadour,

1200
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:58,120
but in the punk era, dead Kennedys and Fear.

1201
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,120
And was the guy to put the foot down and be like,

1202
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:04,120
as he put it, you gotta pay for that steak!

1203
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,120
And he said all the audiences would fight,

1204
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,120
like the Fear fans wanted to crush the ants.

1205
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,120
They wanted to crush the ants.

1206
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,120
Oh, that referring to Adam Ant,

1207
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,120
because New Wave people hate punk people,

1208
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,120
so they'd be fighting night after night.

1209
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:25,120
Taffer talking to Lee Ving, who was the lead singer of Fear, is insane to me.

1210
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:31,120
But it doesn't make sense, I could hear Taffer definitely kicking off of Fear style.

1211
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:36,120
Yeah, he could have been in a punk band too.

1212
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,120
I wonder if he thought about it then.

1213
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,120
Fuck you Reagan!

1214
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:44,120
I'm only fiscally conservative, fuck Ronald Reagan!

1215
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,120
The socially liberal thing feels like it starts there,

1216
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:50,120
where it's like, look, as long as you're bringing them in, I don't care.

1217
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,120
If it's good for business, I don't care.

1218
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,120
You have to imagine he's seeing these bands every night and being like,

1219
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,120
I don't fucking get this shit.

1220
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:59,120
But if they respect me and they sell tickets, I don't care!

1221
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,120
If they aren't being overboard too!

1222
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:06,120
He's name-checking a lot of these.

1223
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,120
He's done a couple interviews of his nature,

1224
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,120
and like, wow, just incredible, groundbreaking punk bands,

1225
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,120
and you were around, and he's like, yes, but you know who was really great?

1226
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:17,120
You know who I really loved? The Knack.

1227
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,120
When those guys, when they kicked into My Sharona,

1228
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,120
the whole building shook.

1229
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:25,120
That bass line, there was magic in that bass line.

1230
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,120
So My Sharona was his favorite.

1231
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,120
Yeah, The Knack's good, but that's just a funny...

1232
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:34,120
Of all the ones to shout out, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's all well and good,

1233
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,120
The Knack.

1234
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,120
My Sharona.

1235
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,120
My Sharona.

1236
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:42,120
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

1237
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,120
What were you going to say, Jason?

1238
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:51,120
I was going to say, was the troubadour before or after another L.A. landmark, Barney's Beanery?

1239
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,120
Well, he started it, I think, I don't know what opened when,

1240
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:59,120
but his first job was bartender at Barney's Beanery,

1241
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:02,120
which is also in West Hollywood.

1242
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,120
It was a Burbank location with the originals in West Hollywood.

1243
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:12,120
This is notable as this bar used to be like this was kind of the end of Route 66.

1244
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,120
Yes.

1245
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,120
Where this bar was.

1246
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:19,120
And then eventually they either opened up other locations or franchised,

1247
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,120
and now they're kind of everywhere.

1248
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,120
But the first location was in Radiator Springs, is that right?

1249
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,120
Barney's oil rig.

1250
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,120
So, but I'm glad we're touching on this history because, yeah,

1251
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:37,120
so bartender at Barney's Beanery, and he must have kicked them off,

1252
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:40,120
he must have done something right because it's still there.

1253
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:44,120
Then you saw the troubadour through a big wave of success,

1254
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:51,120
then moved to a, you ever heard of this, Jason, Philadelphia nightclub, this is Delaware County,

1255
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,120
a nightclub called Pulsations.

1256
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,120
Anybody know about Pulsations?

1257
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,120
I do.

1258
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,120
Delaware County is where I grew up.

1259
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,120
Oh, okay, gotcha.

1260
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,120
Delco, they say.

1261
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,120
Delco, yeah, mayor of Easttown, sat there.

1262
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:12,120
Does Pulsations have a little friend in there, maybe?

1263
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,120
It does.

1264
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,120
Do you know about the little friend?

1265
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,120
Pulsations?

1266
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,120
Well, it's kind of a big friend.

1267
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,120
Mike, do you know about the room?

1268
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,120
I actually don't.

1269
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,120
Oh, Mike.

1270
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:23,120
This is pretty wild that his history, and I'm sure, you know,

1271
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:27,120
not that we have to justify any connection to theme parks

1272
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,120
or the things that we're theoretically supposed to be talking about,

1273
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,120
but we do have a pretty good one here.

1274
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:35,120
Taffer maybe ties back to Cheers Airport Bar and Taffer.

1275
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,120
He might, he might.

1276
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,120
Certainly ties back to a classic friend of PTO.

1277
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:43,120
Yes, yeah, so this nightclub is called Pulsations.

1278
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,120
It was a sci-fi nightclub.

1279
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:52,120
There was a giant spaceship in it, 27 feet in diameter, 70 lighting systems in it.

1280
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:55,120
It would fly over the crowd at an I-beam track.

1281
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,120
People would cry.

1282
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,120
I had listened to three different podcasts where he described it and said,

1283
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,120
people, tears in their eyes.

1284
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,120
They'd try to get on it like Close Encounters.

1285
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,120
I want to live here forever, they'd say.

1286
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,120
They want to abandon their families.

1287
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,120
They didn't know it didn't actually leave.

1288
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,120
It was so realistic.

1289
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,120
They'd leave Terry Garner in the dust.

1290
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:20,120
But the main thing is the door would open, dry ice fog, bright lights would blast,

1291
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:23,120
and out would come a robot.

1292
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:26,120
A robot would come out of the spaceship every night.

1293
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,120
The name of the robot is Pulsar.

1294
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,120
And I will let his quote say it.

1295
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:37,120
It got so popular that they had a clone built for Rocky IV.

1296
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,120
This robot that we've talked about, that one robot.

1297
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,120
Seiko.

1298
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,120
Seiko.

1299
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:47,120
Seiko, he claims Seiko was made, I think he's wrong on that.

1300
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,120
I don't know what's going on.

1301
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:52,120
Taffer does seem to be a fabulous in listening to a bunch of different stories.

1302
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:56,120
I've noticed every time the telling changes 25%.

1303
00:56:56,120 --> 00:57:00,120
I heard three podcasts where he said, and then they rented the robot from us,

1304
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,120
and that's the robot in Rocky IV.

1305
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:08,120
But then if you look it up, it says the story is that Sylvester Stallone's autistic son

1306
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:13,120
encountered a Seiko, and it was helpful for communication,

1307
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,120
and that's why it's in Rocky IV.

1308
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,120
Seiko was a thing.

1309
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:19,120
Here's my take on the story as he's presenting it.

1310
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:25,120
They, too, found a Seiko and purchased one, or commissioned one.

1311
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,120
Seiko was a thing that was being made for multiple applications.

1312
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,120
International Robotics.

1313
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,120
I'm sorry.

1314
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,120
International Robotronics.

1315
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,120
A shop in New York.

1316
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,120
Much cooler name.

1317
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,120
My guess is that he bought a Seiko.

1318
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,120
He didn't create it at a nightclub.

1319
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,120
No.

1320
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:44,120
And then Stallone put Seiko in Rocky IV.

1321
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,120
He's like, must have taken it from me.

1322
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,120
But sometimes he's saying they cloned our robot.

1323
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:51,120
Sometimes he's saying we rented them the robot.

1324
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,120
Yeah.

1325
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,120
Oh, so sometimes he claims that the robot in Rocky IV is.

1326
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,120
I heard two separate podcasts where he said that.

1327
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,120
That's weird.

1328
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,120
This one says it was so popular.

1329
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,120
That's a Philadelphia connection, right?

1330
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,120
That does make sense.

1331
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,120
That adds up.

1332
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,120
Maybe I saw it.

1333
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,120
Now, to refresh my memory, I know we talked about this on the show.

1334
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,120
I think it was in the episode about Smart One.

1335
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:12,120
But what was Seiko had an Epcot connection?

1336
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,120
Am I making that up?

1337
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,120
Or did we?

1338
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,120
Why did we end up talking about Seiko in relationship to.

1339
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,120
Is Seiko in the.

1340
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,120
Yeah.

1341
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,120
The special?

1342
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,120
The special with Danny Thomas?

1343
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,120
Or is it Thomas?

1344
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,120
Danny.

1345
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,120
Danny Kay or Danny Thomas?

1346
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,120
Which Danny?

1347
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,120
Which Danny?

1348
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,120
Don't know.

1349
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,120
I don't remember how we got there.

1350
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,120
We ended up with Monomy Seiko, the single that Seiko had.

1351
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,120
That's right.

1352
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,120
YouTube recommended it to me last night.

1353
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,120
OK, OK.

1354
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,120
I mean, but I.

1355
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:39,120
Anyway, sometimes it's named Seiko.

1356
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,120
Cut out of Rocky IV.

1357
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,120
But Taffer claims.

1358
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,120
Taffer claims.

1359
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,120
Cut out of sex.

1360
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,120
Rocky IV.

1361
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,120
Out of some.

1362
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,120
The final cut or whatever.

1363
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,120
Yeah, yeah.

1364
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,120
But.

1365
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,120
But says Taffer.

1366
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,120
You have the toy?

1367
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,120
I have the toy.

1368
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,120
Oh, I have the Super 7 one.

1369
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,120
Right, yeah.

1370
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,120
Because you remember, Jax had a prototype, but it never got released.

1371
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,120
Oh, right, right, right.

1372
00:58:56,120 --> 00:59:01,120
They were supposed to do a Seiko and a James Brown in their second series of Rocky IV specific

1373
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,120
figures.

1374
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,120
Oh yeah, because this robot also introduced James Brown in concert.

1375
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,120
That's a video I watched last night.

1376
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:11,120
There was an unproduced Rocky IV James Brown action figure that was solicited.

1377
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,120
That's good.

1378
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:15,120
And never, never actually hit the factory line, unfortunately.

1379
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,120
Oh my God.

1380
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:20,120
Anyway, so Seiko, according to Taffer, and there's a video of this.

1381
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,120
You could watch this on YouTube.

1382
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,120
Seiko's name in this version was Pulsar.

1383
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:26,120
And he came out of a big spaceship.

1384
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,120
And so says Jon Taffer.

1385
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,120
Pulsations.

1386
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,120
It was the greatest nightclub in the world.

1387
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,120
And I am honored to be part of that history.

1388
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:36,120
The greatest nightclub in the world ever is where you grew up.

1389
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,120
I'm crying.

1390
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,120
That's right.

1391
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:43,120
Seiko, by the, yeah, just to confirm, it is Danny Kay and also Drew Barrymore.

1392
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,120
That's why.

1393
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,120
Met Seiko at the Epcot opening day special.

1394
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:50,120
So they needed a little extra robot help, even though that's a robot that would not

1395
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,120
stay at Epcot.

1396
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:56,120
So really, if we want, again, we don't have to, but the justification for talking about

1397
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:59,120
him on a Theme Park podcast is that he, you know, he's an older man at this point.

1398
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:08,120
He is probably influenced chain, crap, robot type, touristy garbage stuff that we love.

1399
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,120
Yeah, I think so.

1400
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:14,120
Well, and there's another gigantic reason to talk about him.

1401
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,120
And it is this.

1402
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:20,120
I bet I bet you didn't even know that this guy is an Imagineer.

1403
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,120
Let me prove it.

1404
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,120
Here we go.

1405
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:30,120
I want to thank Disney Imagineering for this incredible Christmas basket and also for making

1406
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:33,120
me an honorary Imagineer.

1407
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,120
Thank you, Disney.

1408
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,120
Done.

1409
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,120
Did you know that?

1410
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:41,120
He is more, I think he's more on topic than a lot of things that we talk about.

1411
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,120
He is an honorary Imagineer.

1412
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:47,120
This is him at his office and he's got a big, he's got a big basket.

1413
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:51,120
It looks like it has an Imagineering shirt in it and mouse ears in it.

1414
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:57,120
And yeah, look, this guy, who, who is, who has the title at Disney to make that call

1415
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,120
for an honorary Imagineer?

1416
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,120
Just Walt.

1417
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,120
Only Walt.

1418
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:05,120
So the robot, maybe the Walt robot now has that power.

1419
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,120
Look at this Frasier.

1420
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,120
Feces.

1421
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,120
Walt's head.

1422
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,120
Disgusting.

1423
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,120
You're not taking care of it.

1424
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,120
It's not going to, it's not going to touch back to his body.

1425
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:18,120
You got Walt next to meat.

1426
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,120
Nothing.

1427
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,120
You're storing old chicken in there.

1428
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,120
The bacteria is getting into Walt's nostrils.

1429
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:27,120
You let his soul escape to hell.

1430
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,120
Feces.

1431
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:32,120
Nothing about this restaurant says Tomorrowland.

1432
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:35,120
It's barely a terrace.

1433
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,120
It's horrible.

1434
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:41,120
Let me, here's, let's, let's keep going with the massive Disney connection.

1435
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:45,120
As if we had to prove any further than that this guy's an honorary Imagineer.

1436
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:49,120
This guy, let's quote him, the man himself.

1437
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:54,120
I'm a Walt Disney World nutcase.

1438
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:58,120
The Neutron ride knocks it out of the bar.

1439
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,120
Here's him riding the Tron light cycles.

1440
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,120
He's a nutcase.

1441
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,120
We haven't even called ourselves that.

1442
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,120
No.

1443
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,120
Here's him in the Millennium Falcon.

1444
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,120
Look at that.

1445
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,120
He goes there all the time.

1446
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,120
He was at the opening.

1447
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:15,120
He was, you know, the, the opening where, with Harrison and Hamill where they,

1448
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,120
where they got the cue wrong.

1449
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:22,120
He's, Harrison banged on the thing all weird that he was at that.

1450
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:26,120
He has photos of that.

1451
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:29,120
So I think there's a lot of credentials he has here.

1452
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:38,120
He also credits, in general, Walt Disney and all of their operations as being one of his primary areas of inspiration.

1453
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:43,120
Walt Disney, Walt Disney had an apartment above Disneyland where he would watch the entrance gates.

1454
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:46,120
The turnstiles, you might, the old style turnstiles.

1455
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,120
They weren't tap styles yet.

1456
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:52,120
Anyway, he could see the facial expressions of people entering and exiting the park.

1457
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:55,120
Disney was the pioneer of reaction management.

1458
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:59,120
He created the human transaction experience.

1459
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,120
What a way.

1460
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:04,120
And then he made transactions twice the price.

1461
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,120
I, I.

1462
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,120
He invented transactions, Walt Disney.

1463
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:10,120
That's what gets him really excited.

1464
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:14,120
The mouse and the big whale and the roller coasters.

1465
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,120
Who cares?

1466
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,120
He invented transactions.

1467
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,120
I had never heard.

1468
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:22,120
I've heard a million times about the Disneyland apartment above the firehouse.

1469
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:28,120
I had never heard it referred to as like rear window style.

1470
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,120
He would watch them and wonder what they were doing.

1471
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:37,120
And note the beautiful, beautiful ladies and hoped that their hubbies were treating them right.

1472
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:42,120
Binoculars in one hand, a can of cold Denison's chili in the other.

1473
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,120
And he's just scooping.

1474
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:49,120
I hope that Taffer buys the apartment above every single bar he's ever rescued.

1475
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:53,120
So I can watch their smiling faces.

1476
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:58,120
He, the reaction management thing, he was getting into it in the Hardwick episode where he was saying,

1477
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:04,120
I believe that he, he grew up with a very emotionally erratic to say the least mother.

1478
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:09,120
And then he said, from a young age, I learned reaction management because I had to keep her happy.

1479
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,120
It wasn't something I even knew I was doing.

1480
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:14,120
And later I realized I have a skill for it.

1481
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:18,120
And then he said to Rob Lowe, we're both in the reaction business.

1482
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,120
And he goes, what do you mean?

1483
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:24,120
He goes, the product we're making, we're not in the business of bars or making movies or TV shows.

1484
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,120
We're in the business of making reactions.

1485
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,120
The product isn't the thing we make.

1486
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:31,120
It's the reaction that people have to the thing.

1487
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:33,120
It's not about making a movie.

1488
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,120
It's about making a reaction.

1489
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:45,120
And then he asks Rob Lowe 20 questions about the scene in Tommy Boy where his shirt gets sucked up the pneumatic.

1490
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,120
He goes, that's the funniest thing I've ever seen in a movie.

1491
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:55,120
How do you do that?

1492
01:04:55,120 --> 01:05:00,120
And to sit there in the theater, oh, the reaction you must have gotten.

1493
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:02,120
Now I heard you were on the Doughboys podcast recently.

1494
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,120
What was the reaction to that like?

1495
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,120
You made quite a reaction there.

1496
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:10,120
Here's another thing I like about Taffer.

1497
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:15,120
I was trying to, I always have struggled to find the language to describe what it is I find so fascinating about him.

1498
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,120
We talk about physical appearance.

1499
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,120
We've been trying to emulate his voice.

1500
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:22,120
The body language, the movement of the man, right, is so unique.

1501
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,120
He moves unlike anyone else.

1502
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:30,120
The way he floats through a space just like chest way out as he's floating.

1503
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,120
Especially for how large he is, right?

1504
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:34,120
Like he's just like physically imposing man.

1505
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:39,120
And then he has this sort of very odd, yes, kind of floatiness to him.

1506
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,120
I think I finally cracked it last night.

1507
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:44,120
He moves like a hand puppet.

1508
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:47,120
And I will explain what I mean by this.

1509
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:50,120
The way that like a puppet can't make micro expressions, right?

1510
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:58,120
Because by design, unless you're putting like significant sort of like mechanics or animatronics or like rigs in there or whatever,

1511
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:04,120
you're basically like a hand puppet where your hand operates the mouth and you can scrunch it a little and try to make it look angry or whatever.

1512
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:11,120
You notice like the muppets, there's a lot of head and neck acting because they need to sell the emotions with the full body.

1513
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:15,120
And also because like a puppeteer only has two hands.

1514
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,120
The main one's the head and the mouth.

1515
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:21,120
And then like they're usually puppeteering one of the arms.

1516
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:24,120
If a character has to use two arms at the same time, you have another person just supplying that.

1517
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:29,120
But very often you have a puppet who has like one of their arms kind of glued to their chest.

1518
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,120
And the other arm is moving really wildly.

1519
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,120
John Taffer's right arm never moves.

1520
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,120
Very often.

1521
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:37,120
Sometimes he'll do the full Kermit like arm flap, right?

1522
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,120
Which requires the second puppeteer.

1523
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:44,120
But very often one arm is like straight by his side or across his chest or pocket.

1524
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:52,120
And he's like doing this where you're just like, man, they're overselling the arm in the head because they have to make this thing look like it's alive.

1525
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:58,120
And the way he's talking to anyone, any reaction shot of him listening to someone's troubles is like, yeah, that's right, isn't it?

1526
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,120
Like he tilts his head all the way down.

1527
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,120
The camera can't see my feet.

1528
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,120
I ain't got to do nothing with those.

1529
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,120
Yes, it's incredible.

1530
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:12,120
But unlike a puppet, he is flexing every single muscle in his face at all times.

1531
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:15,120
Like he's always pulling the most extreme expression.

1532
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:19,120
It looks like his body is exerting the most effort possible.

1533
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:29,120
It's worrisome to some degree how much energy he must be expelling just when he's talking to somebody about the scale that weighs the bottles, the drink bottles.

1534
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:32,120
Even his quiet moments where he's trying to show compassion for people.

1535
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,120
Yeah.

1536
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,120
And he's like, so you gave up.

1537
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,120
You lost your way.

1538
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:42,120
You know, and his whole body is just like a rocket about to take off and his eyebrows are all the way up here.

1539
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:45,120
That's not how a successful marriage works.

1540
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,120
You're a good man.

1541
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,120
I respect you.

1542
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:50,120
He's just I mean, there's a thing he does.

1543
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:53,120
We pegged it early on is that when he's talking, he's explaining something.

1544
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,120
He goes like this.

1545
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:59,120
He takes his arm or he takes his hand and he goes like this and he almost like cups and invisible ball like a basketball.

1546
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,120
He always does this.

1547
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:05,120
And I don't know why, but he's been doing it since the start because it's a good place to pin the puppet arm.

1548
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:08,120
It's what it's kind of natural.

1549
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,120
Right.

1550
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,120
It looks right.

1551
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:13,120
And then you can put the arm somewhere else and move a different person.

1552
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:22,120
He's just what I think what is so engaging about him is just you've never seen a more fully formed specific character like this.

1553
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:32,120
Even like he Joe Pesci and all the Martin Scorsese movies wishes he was this like weird and scary when he's talking to somebody like you've just this.

1554
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,120
He would you would be almost too much with him in a movie.

1555
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,120
Well, here's another thing.

1556
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,120
You're making me realize it.

1557
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:42,120
All of us are dirty, dirty sketch comedy monsters.

1558
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,120
Right.

1559
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,120
We come from the sketch comedy filth.

1560
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,120
Sure.

1561
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,120
And this is just like an area.

1562
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,120
Right.

1563
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:51,120
This is an immediately fully realized sketch comedy character.

1564
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,120
It's unreal.

1565
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,120
You can drop him into any scenario.

1566
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,120
He's got a look.

1567
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,120
He's got a voice.

1568
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,120
He's got five games.

1569
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,120
It's not just one.

1570
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,120
Right.

1571
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,120
Yes.

1572
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,120
And they all work and they have some games.

1573
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,120
Right.

1574
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:04,120
Where you're like it's that feeling of watching Matt Foley for the first time.

1575
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,120
Yes.

1576
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,120
You're like holy shit.

1577
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,120
Wow.

1578
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,120
He is Chris Farley.

1579
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,120
Not Chris Farley like vibe whatsoever.

1580
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,120
Right.

1581
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,120
But amount of physicality and presence.

1582
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:19,120
I think of Matt Foley as kind of being like the pinnacle of like sketch comedy characterization.

1583
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,120
Right.

1584
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:25,120
He lost in the online poll to Stefan on the NBSNL.

1585
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,120
What are you talking about?

1586
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,120
There was they did a whole brackets.

1587
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,120
Yes.

1588
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,120
They had all these different voting and he lost.

1589
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:35,120
He was a final two with Stefan and Matt Foley.

1590
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:38,120
Let's say that's recently pious.

1591
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:42,120
The original Matt Foley sketch which is the one they did at Second City for years and

1592
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:46,120
years and years that Odin Kirk wrote that was so honed at that point that it was just

1593
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:49,120
like a perfect diamond cut thing.

1594
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,120
Right.

1595
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,120
Is for my money the best thing SNL ever put on there.

1596
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,120
Might be number one best.

1597
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:57,120
I think it's just like the tightest most perfectly executed especially with the live element

1598
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:01,120
where you're like the one they got was by all accounts the best it was ever performed.

1599
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,120
It's lightning in a bottle.

1600
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,120
Yeah.

1601
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:08,120
When I rewatch it I'm like huh were the other ones not as good and you watch them and they're

1602
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,120
all good.

1603
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,120
Right.

1604
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:13,120
Like there's no like oh fuck they tried it again and it fell.

1605
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,120
No they never did.

1606
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,120
But I know what you mean.

1607
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,120
That's true.

1608
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,120
Because they all are kind of the same.

1609
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,120
Right.

1610
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:23,120
Like one is A plus plus and then the rest are all like B plus.

1611
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,120
Totally.

1612
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,120
Yeah.

1613
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:29,120
And they'll do other moves and they're funny ones in there but I always think of like oh

1614
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,120
Spade flipping it to him.

1615
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,120
What do you want to do when you grow up.

1616
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,120
I want to live in a van down by the river.

1617
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:33,120
I don't remember if he says it or the apple.

1618
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:39,120
You're like that's the kind of joke you think you get to the fifth time you do the character

1619
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:42,120
and they got there in the first one.

1620
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,120
Right.

1621
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:46,120
Taffer enters at a first Matt Foley sketch level.

1622
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,120
Oh true.

1623
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,120
With catchphrases.

1624
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:53,120
You watch the first episode anytime I've shown Taffer to someone they immediately go like

1625
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,120
holy shit he's like this all the time.

1626
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:00,120
And then you go but clearly you must be showing me the best episode he can't be this good

1627
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,120
all the time.

1628
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:05,120
Taffer is like what if every Matt Foley sketch was the first Matt Foley sketch.

1629
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,120
Wow.

1630
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,120
Yeah it is.

1631
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:11,120
It is a pretty fully formed that first episode.

1632
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:12,120
Yeah.

1633
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:13,120
It's like all the pieces.

1634
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,120
How is it different.

1635
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:15,120
Is it less aggressive in general.

1636
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,120
It's a little less of aggressive.

1637
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,120
The narrator is less aggressive.

1638
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,120
They are explaining the concept of the show.

1639
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:25,120
A little.

1640
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:29,120
And then new stuff comes along later on.

1641
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:34,120
I feel like it gets much slicker and I feel like there's more sponsorship.

1642
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,120
It's not as good anymore.

1643
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,120
I hate to bring that in.

1644
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,120
Newer ones are just there's something missing.

1645
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,120
So I.

1646
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:49,120
Bar Rescue is one of the things that I use as a very depressive person to sort of gauge

1647
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,120
how my mental health is doing.

1648
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:55,120
Where if I find I've been in a three day hole of watching Bar Rescue and Paramount Plus

1649
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:58,120
I'm like oh I'm going through something.

1650
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:02,120
But if you're doing a three hour podcast episode about it you're having the time of

1651
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,120
your life.

1652
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,120
And if I'm watching it's productive.

1653
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,120
It's for research.

1654
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:09,120
But I'm like there's something I find very comforted in watching Bar Rescue.

1655
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,120
This goes back to my read on being a show about depression where basically the through

1656
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:17,120
line of every episode is that like the people running the bar are really depressed and have

1657
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:20,120
sort of like stopped giving a shit to some degree or another.

1658
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:23,120
Or like can't find the will to like do the hard work anymore.

1659
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:27,120
Although sometimes they're like I'm pulling my tits out and they love it.

1660
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,120
They love to pull their tits out.

1661
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,120
This is true.

1662
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,120
They hate when that's robbed from them.

1663
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:34,120
I would argue though there is perhaps a core sadness.

1664
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,120
Maybe some depression in there somewhere.

1665
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,120
I think there's usually some level of sadness.

1666
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:41,120
Depression and also no education or no training.

1667
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,120
Yes.

1668
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:46,120
About how a restaurant works or how a how to tend bar.

1669
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:48,120
That's a good delineation.

1670
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:51,120
It's the sort of like be fun to own a restaurant or bar.

1671
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:54,120
Like almost every Bar Rescue starts with that energy.

1672
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,120
Yeah.

1673
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,120
The next story for the place is I thought it'd be fun.

1674
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,120
I thought it'd be easy.

1675
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,120
I got in a business with two people.

1676
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,120
You know I didn't know them that well.

1677
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,120
We were friendly enough at the time.

1678
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,120
Or I knew them too well.

1679
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:10,120
There's always you always like not always maybe on every episode but like the one eye

1680
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:13,120
the Scottsdale that's the that's in my mind the gold standard.

1681
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:19,120
But it's every like so many episodes have these just sad tragedies just immediately.

1682
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:24,120
And it's like Harold this guy is going to he's a stand up comic and he's just so sad.

1683
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:29,120
And this guy sunk a hundred and other guys sunk one hundred and eighty thousand dollars

1684
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:33,120
into this comedy club and was like Harold's the face of it.

1685
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:37,120
And then this guy's just kind of a meek guy and John's yelling at him about like you're

1686
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,120
emboldening him.

1687
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,120
You're not helping.

1688
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,120
And he's like yeah no I guess so.

1689
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:44,120
And then like Harold's sister is there and she's crying.

1690
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:50,120
Like there's immediately these like epic like family dramas unfold on these episodes.

1691
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:55,120
By the way why of course Paramount was like we should have him do Marriage Rescue a show

1692
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:59,120
that makes perfect sense on paper because you're like that is the core of the thing

1693
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:03,120
of him yelling at depressed people and being like stop lying.

1694
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,120
Right.

1695
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:06,120
But it is not as fun to see him in Puerto Rico.

1696
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,120
No no.

1697
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,120
With like one couple.

1698
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:13,120
And the other problem with that show which I'd never watched before is like he basically

1699
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:17,120
does one check in every 10 minutes and then he's like I'm sending you out on a challenge.

1700
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:20,120
And then they go like boogie boarding and he's not with them.

1701
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:23,120
And he needs to be over the guy's shoulder.

1702
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,120
Kiss your wife.

1703
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,120
Give her compliments.

1704
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,120
You don't stand up on boogie boards.

1705
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,120
You're laid down on them.

1706
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:33,120
And you don't stand up in conversation either.

1707
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,120
Point out the sunset.

1708
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:41,120
OK this is a thing I think that comes into the show kind of later still pretty early

1709
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:46,120
but where it's like there's family dynamics or there's there's husband and wife dynamics

1710
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:53,120
and they bring in a counselor or a therapist and for show purposes it gets wrapped up in

1711
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:58,120
five minutes when that sort of counseling takes ages and ages.

1712
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,120
Not when it's me.

1713
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,120
Not when it's me.

1714
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,120
Three days.

1715
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,120
I know a marriage expert and if not I do it myself.

1716
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:08,120
That's the thing about marriage expert that it seems to be the selling point seems to

1717
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:12,120
be like I'm a bar expert but I'm also a marriage expert.

1718
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,120
You know why?

1719
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,120
Because I'm in a marriage.

1720
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,120
Plenty.

1721
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:19,120
Marriage rescue he does not outsource to anyone.

1722
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,120
Any greater authority than him.

1723
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,120
He is the guy.

1724
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,120
He's not around a lot.

1725
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,120
All the hard conversations funnel through him.

1726
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:30,120
The one I watched was the last episode they ever did because it did one season in 2019.

1727
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,120
A short season.

1728
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,120
It was a short season.

1729
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,120
Quickly this wasn't working.

1730
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:38,120
Any chance of it coming back was probably killed immediately by the pandemic of like

1731
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:39,120
yeah right.

1732
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:42,120
This whole thing is like luxury getaway whatever.

1733
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,120
But the one I watched was two couples.

1734
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,120
One of them is two stand up comedians.

1735
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:50,120
Always fertile territory for Taffer to take down a yuckster.

1736
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,120
But the other one.

1737
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,120
You're hiding in your bits.

1738
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:56,120
Is a guy who's become addicted to DMs on social media.

1739
01:15:56,120 --> 01:16:00,120
And the whole thing is has he crossed the line into the physical though?

1740
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:05,120
And they keep asking him have you and then he with like the biggest treasure cat grin

1741
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:10,120
is like I have never since I met you stuck my dick in another woman.

1742
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,120
And he's grinning ear to ear.

1743
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,120
And Taffer's like you're a lion.

1744
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:15,120
You're a lion in my face.

1745
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,120
I got a test.

1746
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:19,120
I have a challenge that's going to settle this once and for all.

1747
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,120
And you're like holy shit.

1748
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,120
What does Taffer have up his sleeve?

1749
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,120
A lie detector test.

1750
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:25,120
He just bends in a polygraph test right.

1751
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,120
Three questions.

1752
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:28,120
Are you in Puerto Rico right now?

1753
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,120
Yes.

1754
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,120
Do you DM women on social media?

1755
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,120
He says no.

1756
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:36,120
A thing he has previously already admitted to in the one episode.

1757
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:41,120
And then question three is has it crossed into a physical realm with any of those women

1758
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:44,120
or maybe have you cheated on your wife ever?

1759
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,120
And he says no.

1760
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:49,120
And the woman holds the printout and she goes you lied about the cheating question.

1761
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,120
And he goes I didn't.

1762
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,120
I didn't.

1763
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,120
And he's smiling.

1764
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,120
And Taffer goes you're a lion.

1765
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:55,120
You're a lion.

1766
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,120
He refuses to admit it.

1767
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,120
The segment just ends.

1768
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:04,120
Then they go to another challenge where they're like fucking like on RVs or whatever.

1769
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:07,120
Like painting rocks or whatever.

1770
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:12,120
It's entirely, it's marriage is being solved through amenities that are just at the resort.

1771
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:13,120
Correct.

1772
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:14,120
You're having a lot of trouble.

1773
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:15,120
You aren't communicating.

1774
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,120
You know what you got to do?

1775
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:18,120
You got to make your own pizza.

1776
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:19,120
Yes.

1777
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,120
But then he's not there for the pizza.

1778
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:21,120
No he doesn't do that.

1779
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:25,120
He'll say that in voiceover and then you'll just see someone else be like hello I'm a pizza expert.

1780
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,120
I got a nice lunch scheduled.

1781
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:30,120
I'm going to the way better resort that didn't give us a deal up the coast.

1782
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:35,120
Pizza is a popular food introduced in Italy and perfected in America.

1783
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:38,120
Using a very hot oven.

1784
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:47,120
I guess they have this segment that is like they have to renew their vows and decide whether or not the marriage is rescued or whether they're giving up on it.

1785
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:58,120
And the woman like gives like reads this tearful written speech about like I am willing to accept you back and forgive you for the mistakes and for cheating on me.

1786
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:03,120
And then he just goes like thank you for for your tolerance or something like that.

1787
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:08,120
He the whole episode never admits that he has cheated on her even though he clearly has.

1788
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:10,120
He denies it the entire time.

1789
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:15,120
And then when she says I forgive you he goes I accept and I'm like and very good.

1790
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:18,120
Well that was ends like marriage rescue.

1791
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,120
Cool.

1792
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:22,120
Look as long as it happens within the three days it goes enough for me.

1793
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:24,120
But like yes.

1794
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:32,120
So what I was going to say here is I'll go down these like three day rabbit holes of depression watching the show where I think I'm like I feel something in Taffer being like.

1795
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,120
Snap out of it.

1796
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,120
You gotta get to work.

1797
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:38,120
You end up with an angel and devil on your shoulder.

1798
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,120
Devil is loud Taffer.

1799
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:42,120
Angel is slightly quieter podcast Taffer.

1800
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:44,120
It eventually like gets me out of my funk.

1801
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,120
There's something cathartic to it.

1802
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,120
Right.

1803
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,120
I continue to do these.

1804
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:50,120
I fall into these Taffer holes a couple of times a year.

1805
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,120
I have not.

1806
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:56,120
I don't think I had watched a single episode post pandemic because a lot of TV shows.

1807
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:58,120
Produced post pandemic you mean.

1808
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:59,120
Yeah.

1809
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,120
Yes.

1810
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,120
I'll go on Paramount Plus.

1811
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,120
I'll scale the mountain.

1812
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:05,120
I'll watch any of my favorite episodes from the first like six seasons.

1813
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,120
Stephen Colbert is up here too.

1814
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,120
And the South Park kids.

1815
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:09,120
Come on.

1816
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,120
And Dorothy Explorer.

1817
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,120
This I want to interject.

1818
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,120
This is a little confusing.

1819
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,120
On Paramount Plus.

1820
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,120
First season is like 10 episodes.

1821
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,120
Yes.

1822
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,120
Ninth season is like 40 episodes.

1823
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:24,120
Yeah they ran way up.

1824
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,120
Way up.

1825
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:29,120
Because I was like there's gotta be 13 seasons at this point.

1826
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:34,120
I was like Paramount only has nine and I'm like oh the later ones are crazy.

1827
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:39,120
I saw an announcement that like they just announced it was renewed for season 10 this week.

1828
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,120
That is the official number.

1829
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:42,120
The announcement was like after that.

1830
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:44,120
They may already be out by this.

1831
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,120
This month whenever we're putting this episode out.

1832
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:49,120
Season 10 is about to launch.

1833
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:52,120
So get ready for three days of depression.

1834
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:57,120
The Taffer seasons do tend to average 40 episodes.

1835
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,120
Which means there are favorites I can go back to over and over again.

1836
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:02,120
But I also constantly like oh I don't think I've seen this one.

1837
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:04,120
Like digging through the old ones.

1838
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:09,120
Most reality shows or I'll just even say shows that reflect reality in any way during the pandemic.

1839
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:12,120
I was like I don't want to watch pandemic episodes of anything.

1840
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:16,120
I don't want to watch television with people wearing masks and talking about working through this.

1841
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:21,120
And I was like I could see this being fertile for bar rescue and being like the bars need me more than ever.

1842
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,120
But I didn't want to watch them.

1843
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:25,120
And so I've just never wanted to venture into the post pandemic episodes.

1844
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:28,120
Last night I was like I should watch a nine.

1845
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,120
If we're going to talk Taffer one.

1846
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:33,120
I should watch at least one nine just to sample the current batch.

1847
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,120
This is one you got to do a nine.

1848
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,120
Watch a nine.

1849
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,120
For one. Watch one nine.

1850
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,120
For Taffer nine.

1851
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:43,120
I'll watch all of one.

1852
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,120
I'm excited for Taffer nine.

1853
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,120
Let me call it.

1854
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:48,120
Taffer nine is going to be good.

1855
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:52,120
By the way are you asserting that you are always on them?

1856
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:53,120
Maybe.

1857
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:56,120
Do you ever do episodes about theme parks ever again?

1858
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:59,120
Am I going to be the Evan Susser of Taffer?

1859
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,120
Oh yeah yeah.

1860
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:02,120
It's the yearly Taffer check in.

1861
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,120
Well so we've lost.

1862
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,120
You no longer talk about theme park attractions.

1863
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:08,120
Weiger does not seem interested in doing so.

1864
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:10,120
We're losing a lot of the big ones.

1865
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,120
I'll say this.

1866
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:14,120
Eva doesn't really do theme park.

1867
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:20,120
Look every time I come on here I say there is a pure theme park topic.

1868
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:23,120
There were like three years of kicking this down the curb.

1869
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,120
That's going to happen.

1870
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:28,120
That means a lot to multiple members of this crew.

1871
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:31,120
A childhood favorite of mine and a big one.

1872
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,120
So I watched this episode of nine.

1873
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:38,120
The thing I knew and I feel like we've been texting about this without seemingly any of us watching it seriously.

1874
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:42,120
Is that nine is the season where he starts not being in every episode.

1875
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:43,120
Oh shit.

1876
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:47,120
It's like a Hot Ones thing too where they do Hot Ones now where it's not the guy.

1877
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,120
Right.

1878
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:51,120
Which I'm like if Taffer's gone from this.

1879
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,120
What's the point?

1880
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,120
The format's whatever.

1881
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,120
Right.

1882
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,120
Right.

1883
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,120
Like the format is sturdy.

1884
01:21:56,120 --> 01:22:02,120
But like what I'm here for is Taffer and a lot of his regular rotation of experts are just now going in without him.

1885
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:04,120
And you have to look on Paramount Plus.

1886
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:06,120
Obviously if he's in the thumbnail he's in it.

1887
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:11,120
But the description will either say John Sends or John Visits.

1888
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,120
Right.

1889
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,120
That's a trick.

1890
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:19,120
That's like putting a pretty lady in the thumbnail and then I watch it because I want to see a pretty lady.

1891
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,120
But then it was a lie and there was no.

1892
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,120
At least they tend to be honest you're saying.

1893
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,120
Yes.

1894
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:26,120
I watched the last one of season nine.

1895
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:28,120
The most recent episode at the time of our recording.

1896
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:34,120
And he now seemingly is only in a third of the episode.

1897
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:36,120
So his workload is lessened.

1898
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:39,120
And I hadn't watched a couple of years and I don't think it's advanced stage.

1899
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:42,120
But I was just like the anger seems a little forced.

1900
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,120
He's still doing the thing.

1901
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,120
Yeah.

1902
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,120
And it doesn't feel like oh no he's slowed down.

1903
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:49,120
Yeah.

1904
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,120
In a way that makes me sad for like the passage of time.

1905
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,120
Yeah.

1906
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:55,120
It just felt like he's phoning it in a little bit.

1907
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,120
Yeah.

1908
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,120
That's pretty depressing.

1909
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:04,120
Well I'm like if you're telling me that he doesn't want to do the full season anymore I want it to be because he's like look I only have so much anger left.

1910
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:06,120
I want to give each episode all I can.

1911
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:12,120
Well that's like in our season nine I'll be like you guys I don't want to talk about Frank Marshall.

1912
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,120
And you can just tell I don't have it in me.

1913
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,120
I just don't.

1914
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,120
It just doesn't have the verve.

1915
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:17,120
You're defeated.

1916
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,120
You're dead inside.

1917
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:20,120
I'm sick of I love Lucy guys.

1918
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,120
Gary Morton.

1919
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:23,120
Lucy's second husband.

1920
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,120
You.

1921
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:26,120
Why are you supposed to talk about theme parks were.

1922
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:28,120
Why do you have so many thoughts about Lucy's feelings on her second marriage.

1923
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:30,120
Mike the tastemaker.

1924
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:31,120
That's ridiculous.

1925
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,120
This actually sounds good.

1926
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,120
Yeah.

1927
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:35,120
Because I'll still have my juice.

1928
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,120
Gary Morton talk coming up here.

1929
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,120
You can steamroll all over me.

1930
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:41,120
OK.

1931
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,120
I can't let what happened to Taffer happen to me.

1932
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,120
Yeah.

1933
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,120
Season nine will only be twenty two at that point.

1934
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:47,120
Yeah.

1935
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:49,120
I don't want to talk about it.

1936
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:51,120
Yeah.

1937
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:54,120
It's he says I believe it's in his book.

1938
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:57,120
I'm getting some of my Taffer information confused.

1939
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,120
Maybe the podcast maybe the book I believe it's the conflict book.

1940
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:02,120
But he explains that he had a screaming match with an executive.

1941
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:08,120
Early on in the bar rescue process where they wanted to fake something and he said you can go fuck yourself.

1942
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:10,120
And he said that that was a good thing.

1943
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:14,120
He did that because he put down that he was only going to make these shows authentic.

1944
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,120
Yes.

1945
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,120
It couldn't be fake.

1946
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,120
So it's I agree with you.

1947
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:22,120
I even think around I don't even know if it's like five six whatever whatever episodes I watched.

1948
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:25,120
I feel like he became too self aware perhaps.

1949
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,120
Yes.

1950
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:29,120
Those first few seasons he's just going on instinct.

1951
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:30,120
He doesn't know what he's doing even.

1952
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:35,120
And then he know all the press comes in and people tell him what they like about him.

1953
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:38,120
It's a similar thing we've talked about Leslie Nielsen then people telling him he's funny.

1954
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,120
Right.

1955
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,120
And then he goes on with the fart machine.

1956
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:45,120
I mean I did the fucking my annual rewatch of the naked gun trilogy.

1957
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,120
I think I do without fail every year.

1958
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,120
Sure.

1959
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:49,120
That's a smart move.

1960
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,120
It is stunning.

1961
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,120
Sure.

1962
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:55,120
And it always is this thing of like should I dig into the rest of Leslie Nielsen comedy catalog.

1963
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,120
And none of it.

1964
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:57,120
I know.

1965
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:00,120
I'm like is one of them accidentally a little bit.

1966
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:02,120
Is there just even one sequence.

1967
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,120
I'll find pieces.

1968
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,120
I'll find slivers.

1969
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:06,120
But you're just like there was something there.

1970
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:08,120
Spy Hard with villain Andy Griffith.

1971
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,120
Yeah.

1972
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,120
Is that good at all.

1973
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:12,120
Is Andy Griffith as a villain in a movie any good.

1974
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:14,120
I've seen that but many years ago.

1975
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:15,120
I've never made it through that movie to the end.

1976
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,120
And it always felt unpleasant.

1977
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,120
Something about it was unpleasant.

1978
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:20,120
Jason wants to see that Mr. Magoo.

1979
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,120
Have you made it to that list.

1980
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,120
I haven't no.

1981
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:26,120
Jason do you know the craziest thing about that movie.

1982
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:27,120
What.

1983
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,120
I keep wanting to text you every time you bring up.

1984
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,120
Mr. Magoo.

1985
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,120
Yeah.

1986
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,120
It's only been once right.

1987
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:33,120
Has it come up more than once.

1988
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,120
I don't know.

1989
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:35,120
I feel like I remember it once.

1990
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:36,120
Maybe 22 on Magoo.

1991
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:41,120
I believe that film is directed by Stanley Tong who was one of Jackie Chan's go to directors.

1992
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,120
OK.

1993
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:46,120
It is a movie that on paper you're just like this actually is the right formulation.

1994
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:49,120
Leslie Nielsen is now a surprising comedy star.

1995
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:52,120
He's good at playing oblivious to what's going on around him.

1996
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:53,120
Right.

1997
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:54,120
What's a cartoon character.

1998
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:55,120
Mr. Magoo.

1999
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,120
That's all physical comedy.

2000
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:59,120
Hire someone from the fucking Jackie Chan school.

2001
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,120
Smart.

2002
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:01,120
Whoa.

2003
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:02,120
Yeah.

2004
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:03,120
The movie is like a disaster.

2005
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,120
It is like so immediately inert.

2006
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:09,120
I remember seeing it as a child and like being raring to go and it's got that thing.

2007
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:15,120
I feel like you guys might relate to this where a movie would have an animated opening credit sequence.

2008
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,120
The old Pink Panther trick.

2009
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:17,120
Right.

2010
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:18,120
Yeah.

2011
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:22,120
Really locked in and then the second it cuts to live action you're like immediately not as fun.

2012
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:23,120
Yeah.

2013
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:24,120
Yeah.

2014
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,120
You know.

2015
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,120
Oh so they do a little animated Magoo.

2016
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:31,120
They do a Magoo voiced by Nielsen and he's walking on fucking eye beams and shit and it's funny.

2017
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:34,120
And then it cuts to live action and it's immediately dead.

2018
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:35,120
Geez.

2019
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:39,120
So that's Stanley Tong's only English language film is what this is saying.

2020
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,120
He did like Drunken Master.

2021
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:41,120
Right.

2022
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:43,120
I feel like he did several of the biggest Jackie Chan movies.

2023
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:46,120
There's not even like one sequence that's impressive.

2024
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,120
I have not rewatched.

2025
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,120
OK.

2026
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,120
Well now we need Jason to watch them.

2027
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:52,120
Huh.

2028
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,120
Huh.

2029
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:54,120
Put on the list Jason.

2030
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:58,120
Now that Dr. Odyssey is on hiatus you really should be digging in all that.

2031
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:59,120
Jumping into Magoo.

2032
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,120
Right.

2033
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,120
Jumping into Magoo.

2034
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,120
Magooing it.

2035
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,120
Yes.

2036
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,120
You should be.

2037
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:07,120
You should be walking off the edge of a building without realizing it.

2038
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:10,120
Getting accidentally rescued by like a construction beam that goes by.

2039
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:13,120
A beautiful day outside.

2040
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:14,120
Beautiful windy day.

2041
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:17,120
His big breakthrough was he did Police Story 3 Supercop.

2042
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,120
Wow.

2043
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:19,120
I didn't realize this.

2044
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,120
So he joins Jackie a little later.

2045
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:24,120
Jackie's main 90s collaborator but he does Rumble in the Bronx.

2046
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:27,120
He does Jackie Chan's First Strike which was Police Story 4.

2047
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,120
Like he was.

2048
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:29,120
He was the guy.

2049
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,120
And.

2050
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,120
Hold on.

2051
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:32,120
Hold on.

2052
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,120
Let me check this.

2053
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,120
He did in fact work on the TV show Martial Law.

2054
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,120
Whoa.

2055
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:37,120
It's all tiny.

2056
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,120
How many seasons we got on Martial Law.

2057
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:40,120
That's something.

2058
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:41,120
That's outstanding.

2059
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:42,120
Thirty one.

2060
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:43,120
I'm going to say three.

2061
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,120
Martial.

2062
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,120
You know what.

2063
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,120
I think Jason was right in his original assessment.

2064
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,120
Really.

2065
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:51,120
He invested for two seasons a combined 44 episodes.

2066
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,120
Wow.

2067
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:53,120
Forty four episodes.

2068
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:55,120
That's less than one season of Bar Rescue Net.

2069
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,120
Wow.

2070
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:57,120
Geez.

2071
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,120
I think I just assumed.

2072
01:27:58,120 --> 01:27:59,120
I do too.

2073
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:00,120
If it was CBS in that era.

2074
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:01,120
Well let me take that back.

2075
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:02,120
But Stanley Tong executive producer.

2076
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:04,120
And I guess by that logic Mike is a tastemaker.

2077
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:05,120
Yeah.

2078
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,120
Yeah.

2079
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:07,120
All right.

2080
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,120
If we're reassessing things from an hour ago.

2081
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,120
Or more.

2082
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:13,520
Well Jason remembers when I first introduced the idea of Lucy's second husband gearing

2083
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:14,520
Morton to him.

2084
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,520
He remembers that.

2085
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:16,520
Yeah.

2086
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:17,520
Because I'm a tastemaker.

2087
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,920
Don't push your luck on Morton.

2088
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:21,520
I've still got it in eight season nine yet.

2089
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:25,520
It was during commercials of Bar Rescue.

2090
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:26,520
Oh good.

2091
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:29,520
I got 30 seconds to talk about Gary Morton.

2092
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:30,520
Talk about Gary Morton.

2093
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:35,560
Can I throw out just a very quick tidbit that I'd be remiss if I don't get in here somewhere

2094
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,920
and there's never going to be a clean transition to it.

2095
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:38,920
OK.

2096
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:39,920
Yeah.

2097
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:40,920
Go ahead.

2098
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:42,960
The John Taffer podcast or John Taffer show episode I listened to is the one with Caratop

2099
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:47,160
about his and live entertainment coming back and then doing the rundown of his credits

2100
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:49,960
that was clearly pre-recorded with Corey.

2101
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:50,960
Right.

2102
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:51,960
Yeah.

2103
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:52,960
Caratop not in the room.

2104
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:53,960
He's like this guy.

2105
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:54,960
His credits are unbelievable.

2106
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:55,960
And he's doing the NPR voice.

2107
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:56,960
I mean his credits are unbelievable.

2108
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,240
He's got 20 credits here.

2109
01:28:58,240 --> 01:28:59,600
He lists off the credits.

2110
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,000
Here are three direct quotes and I'm going to verbatim try to even if I can't do the

2111
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:09,400
impression say these credits the way he says them.

2112
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:13,400
Real time with Bill Mahara.

2113
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:17,560
The Jim Gallifan show, which I imagine has to be the Jim Gaffigan show.

2114
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:19,200
Did he have a show called that?

2115
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:20,200
Yep.

2116
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:21,200
OK.

2117
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:25,400
And then he referred to Tashow.

2118
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:32,840
In one rundown of credits, real time with Bill Mahara, the Jim Gallifan show and Tashow.

2119
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:34,200
There's a typo in Tashow.

2120
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,280
They put a period in it.

2121
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,280
It's not supposed to be.

2122
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:37,280
All right.

2123
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,280
I don't know what's.

2124
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:39,280
He fucked up three of them.

2125
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,280
What is?

2126
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:41,280
OK.

2127
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,280
Tashow.

2128
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:43,280
Tashow.

2129
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:45,440
Just picture it in your head.

2130
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:46,440
But also imagine.

2131
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,440
Is it Tash.0?

2132
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:48,440
Yes.

2133
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:49,440
OK.

2134
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,440
Tashow.

2135
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:52,680
But just imagine the him and Sirius MPR voice, right?

2136
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:57,120
It's like him trying to do his best like Terry Gross and trying to imbue these credits with

2137
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,960
the energy of and what big credits they are.

2138
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:00,960
These are.

2139
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:01,960
Of course I know what all these shows are.

2140
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:02,960
He's been on Tashow.

2141
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:05,960
Tashow.

2142
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:10,000
He's selling it as if he's not cold reading these names incorrectly.

2143
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:13,960
Being a Carrot Top show is like seeing a great motion picture like M3 Gann.

2144
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:21,520
Now there's an M3 Gann 20.

2145
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:24,520
Or M3 Gann 20.

2146
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,520
M3 Gallifan.

2147
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:30,800
Gallifan I had to stop and rewind and go, what is he trying to say here?

2148
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,160
And then I went, it must be Gaff again.

2149
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:34,160
Gallifan.

2150
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:38,240
He's been on Jay Lanou.

2151
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:39,240
This is huge.

2152
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:45,360
Does he not watch T like that is such a Bill Maher, especially for him, like that feels

2153
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:47,080
like he would know who that is.

2154
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:51,520
He talked a lot about the Basler and Elvis movie and the Rob Lowe podcast where he was

2155
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,680
talking about it has to be authentic, has to be real.

2156
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:56,240
They told me not to scream.

2157
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:58,520
They said, you're too old, you're too ugly.

2158
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,440
I said, I gotta be me.

2159
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:04,280
And he was saying, it's like in the Elvis movie, they want him to wear that snowman

2160
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:06,280
sweater and sing the Christmas song.

2161
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:07,280
He's Elvis.

2162
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:11,440
I'm like, oh, yes, the famously authentic Basler and Elvis movie,

2163
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:17,560
which he might have been drawn to because he he, I believe, lives in Vegas.

2164
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:20,160
Yes, he's a big Vegas guy.

2165
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:26,200
And he he talked a lot about in twenty twenty one and twenty twenty two.

2166
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:33,560
Like the city's coming back, the city's opening up because Vegas was obviously hit hard in

2167
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,080
twenty twenty.

2168
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:41,800
But they the amount of advertising I feel like I saw from them online.

2169
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:47,600
And then when I was there over the years, I'm just like live entertainment is back.

2170
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,080
That was come breathe the others air.

2171
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:53,160
I mean, he just kept in this podcast saying, and I'm calling it now, April 1st,

2172
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:55,240
twenty twenty, that's the day everything's coming back.

2173
01:31:56,400 --> 01:32:00,040
I'm sorry. It was twenty twenty one because Trump in twenty twenty said by Easter,

2174
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,320
everything's going to be real.

2175
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:01,920
Oh, right.

2176
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:05,720
This was a podcast from the end of twenty twenty or the very beginning of twenty

2177
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:08,440
twenty one. And he's saying, I'm calling it April 1st.

2178
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:09,800
Everything's going to look normal again.

2179
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,760
Live entertainment, road trips, people are ready.

2180
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:13,720
He needed to make it.

2181
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:17,680
He he's let us all down by not doing a Vegas review.

2182
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:20,200
Oh, a bar rescue live.

2183
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:25,320
I mean, he was coming out like going to tell some jokes.

2184
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:28,760
I'm going to sing some songs, going to talk to some bar owners about what they're

2185
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:30,680
doing wrong. It's a chance.

2186
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:34,400
I was one of these podcasts offhandedly referred.

2187
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,960
It must have been the Carrot Top episode offhandedly reference.

2188
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,720
I know I did stand up for a little while.

2189
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,320
No, shit. Oh, man.

2190
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:41,200
Which, of course, he did.

2191
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:44,440
Like, I'm sure that means that he went to four open mics, right?

2192
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:46,880
Maybe he did one bringer show.

2193
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,400
Look at this couple here in the front. Look at these guys.

2194
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:52,280
She doesn't love you anymore.

2195
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:54,400
Why aren't you laughing?

2196
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,400
That was funny.

2197
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:56,680
What do you do for a living?

2198
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:57,720
Nothing.

2199
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,200
Your father would be very disappointed in you.

2200
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:02,200
Don't you think?

2201
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,840
You're a good guy.

2202
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:06,520
I could see that in you. You're a good guy.

2203
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,800
Why aren't you all saying, oh, and clapping for that?

2204
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:11,600
You told us you should be reacting.

2205
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:14,400
You're talking about it feeling a little less authentic at some point.

2206
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:15,040
Sorry, what were you going to say?

2207
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:20,520
I was going to say that in the Sacramento ex-cop opens a sports bar,

2208
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:26,560
which is really kind of like just a place for him to display all this memorabilia.

2209
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:30,640
He has. And it's also probably failing because it's massive.

2210
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:34,360
But at one point in terms of like funny, it ain't real quick.

2211
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:36,920
Because you used to be a police man. You're a hero.

2212
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:39,120
But now this bar is failing.

2213
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:43,680
Like he like so quickly got through like you're a hero, you know?

2214
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:47,760
And we all have so much respect, the whole crew, everybody who's here.

2215
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:50,280
We're all tearing up with respect for what you do.

2216
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:53,120
But you're a failure and a crook.

2217
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:55,480
But he's calling the guy a hero and the guy's just like,

2218
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:58,360
I just want to do my so many jurors.

2219
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:03,400
He's just so mopey and he's losing just so much money.

2220
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:06,320
I mean, some of these, the Pirates one always stands really tall for me.

2221
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:10,440
Oh, yeah. I believe it is nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars in debt.

2222
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:12,760
Yeah. Jesus. Whoa. Wow.

2223
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:13,440
Yeah. Let's do it.

2224
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:17,360
I mean, I think we got to do just kind of a round robin of episodes and bar

2225
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,800
esky classics and Pirates absolutely is what this is.

2226
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,160
This, I think, is his magnum opus.

2227
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:24,120
The name of the bar.

2228
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:26,720
Pirates. What city is Pirates in?

2229
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:27,720
Is it Baltimore?

2230
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:28,680
I think so.

2231
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:29,440
Let me check that.

2232
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:30,160
It's something like that.

2233
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:34,120
But it is. Yeah, it's like it's a pirate themed bar.

2234
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:37,920
There's a bunch of dorks there who want to dress up like pirates.

2235
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:42,120
Like I and it feels like Silver Spring, Maryland.

2236
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:44,560
Silver Spring. It's a very corporate town.

2237
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:46,080
But yes, this is his assessment.

2238
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:48,400
You know, it's these it's these dorks and making them

2239
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,600
dressing up like pirates makes them happy.

2240
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:52,000
No one goes in there.

2241
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:55,640
But like you could say they're they like what they have here.

2242
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:58,840
They aren't running a good version of what that could be whatsoever.

2243
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:01,360
But nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars in debt.

2244
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:05,480
They have only 15 employees who are just people who want to live

2245
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:06,960
like a pirate all day long.

2246
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:11,600
She cites it like she's like, well, of course, Pirate Bar makes sense.

2247
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,360
It's the ultimate fantasy.

2248
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,120
We all wish we could be a pirate.

2249
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:19,960
She's she's what she says is being a pirate is the ultimate Peter Pan syndrome.

2250
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,840
Words that must have warmed your heart.

2251
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,200
Well, yeah, I yeah.

2252
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:26,160
First, once I wrote once I pick myself off the floor,

2253
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:30,840
having flung myself off the couch, I thought, no, it's the opposite.

2254
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:33,760
Peter Pan doesn't get along with the pirate.

2255
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:37,040
Yeah, I think the opposite of the ultimate Peter Pan syndrome.

2256
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,400
A lost boy. Yes.

2257
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,360
The enemy of the pirate.

2258
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:42,240
You've got it fully wrong.

2259
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:45,120
So that might indicate what's wrong with your pirate bar.

2260
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:49,040
But then he oh, by the way, and we should say this episode is the episode.

2261
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:52,000
There's even even though like he

2262
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,240
takes great pains to be like thoughtful and like

2263
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:56,680
because you're dealing with a lot, aren't you?

2264
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:58,640
And your kids and that's that's very hard.

2265
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:01,560
And then it'll still name the episode something so insulting,

2266
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:05,840
like in this case, that the episode is called Yo Ho Ho and a bottle of dumb.

2267
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:10,880
The episode about champs bar in Burbank,

2268
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:14,400
which seems to be very popular and doing very well.

2269
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:19,000
Still, that episode is on Paramount Plus's chumps.

2270
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,960
Geez, geez.

2271
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:26,600
I mean, the thing about the Pirates episode is it's one of the strongest themes

2272
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:30,480
in relation to the level of failure the business has been going through

2273
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:33,280
for the amount of years it's been failing at that level.

2274
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:36,920
And he's basically like, you got to take all the theming out.

2275
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:41,200
And she's like, I want you to fix this and make this more normal.

2276
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:43,720
But my dream is to own a pirate bar.

2277
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:45,920
And he keeps on being like, you got to meet me halfway.

2278
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:47,680
This woman is close to a million dollars in debt.

2279
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:49,880
I forget what she says, but she used to have like

2280
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:53,840
what seemingly was a fairly successful job in like a corporate sphere.

2281
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:56,600
She has a much younger husband named Juciano,

2282
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:59,000
who she installed as the chef with no cooking experience.

2283
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,120
Oh, yeah, he's one of the worst chefs I've ever heard.

2284
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:05,240
Juciano terrible and just curses whenever anyone says anything to him.

2285
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:07,400
He goes, what the shit? Fuck you.

2286
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:09,440
Why do you think it's dog shit?

2287
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:11,480
I think you're dog shit.

2288
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:13,200
She's got a 16 year old daughter.

2289
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:15,960
She's now moved into her parents basement with the daughter

2290
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:19,280
and Juciano and sold her home to keep the pirates bar afloat.

2291
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:21,560
And the whole time, he's like, you got to trust me.

2292
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:23,200
I can tell you're going through a lot.

2293
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,360
All these things where he really wants to be Mr. Compassionate.

2294
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:28,280
And then it's just the greatest bar rescue moment for me

2295
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:31,800
is the redesign of the bar, which so often is like

2296
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:34,960
he turns it into the blandest airport bar possible.

2297
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:39,560
That's usually the idea was his taste is so, so lame.

2298
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:42,000
And then he'll point to one thing and be like, and look,

2299
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:44,400
I still kept your love of football in there.

2300
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:46,360
There's a helmet on the wall.

2301
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:49,800
Like a point to one thing where he's like, I know your dad was important.

2302
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:52,600
So I scribbled your dad's initials under the table.

2303
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:57,080
If you go in the second stall of the women's restroom. Right.

2304
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:01,320
But the bar is always like renamed the drinking place or something.

2305
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,040
The beer pub.

2306
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:08,120
I'm trying to think of it of a more like the here's a more tepid example.

2307
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:10,200
As one is called the poor house. Right.

2308
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:12,280
And it's more like you are.

2309
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:15,480
Yeah. Which makes plenty like, yeah, I got that makes all the sense

2310
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:17,160
in the world for a bar to be called the poor house.

2311
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:18,760
And it's a play on words.

2312
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:21,640
He's so like, that sounds sad. That's miserable.

2313
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:24,000
People put a gun in their mouth when they are poor out.

2314
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:27,440
And then and then that would be people smiling when they see this.

2315
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,800
I'm the like, did they learn?

2316
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:32,680
And that when he changes to the study, right?

2317
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:36,080
Whatever. But they're usually that like so it's like, whatever.

2318
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,840
They aren't as offensive as Pirates Bar is the only one

2319
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:40,960
that feels like it is actually spiteful.

2320
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:41,760
Yeah. Yeah.

2321
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,440
Saying you're in a in a corporate area.

2322
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:47,840
There's so many corporate is corporate offices around.

2323
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:51,840
He drills that corporate people don't want to have lunch at a pirate bar.

2324
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:55,960
People famously love being trapped in offices.

2325
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:56,840
Of course. Yeah.

2326
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:01,040
They go do it as their job and then they want to leave and do it again immediately.

2327
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:05,280
Yeah. It's having to go out for lunch and being outside of the safe,

2328
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:08,080
comforting walls of a cubicle.

2329
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:12,640
Want to walk out in their coat and tie and see a logo with a coat and tie in it.

2330
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:16,880
His logic is very few people live in this town.

2331
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:20,720
This is a town that people commute into for work after five o'clock.

2332
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:22,440
People are gone.

2333
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:25,040
You need to be a happy hour and lunch bar.

2334
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:29,720
In that case, I'm like, OK, this this is a guy speaking like he's an expert

2335
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:33,200
in bar science, that he understands the basic tense of what he's saying.

2336
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:34,240
Makes sense to me.

2337
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:36,160
And the pirate bar does seem like dog shit.

2338
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:38,760
It seems like a terrible, terrible place to be.

2339
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:43,040
It seems less committed than when like a cruise ship does pirate.

2340
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:44,760
Yes. Yeah.

2341
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:46,480
All right. Yeah. An elementary school.

2342
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:48,840
Like I wear pirate costumes today.

2343
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:49,720
It is worse than that.

2344
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:51,120
We're trying to be that theme.

2345
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:54,000
Like, it's not like a bar that has some pirate shit on the wall.

2346
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,840
It is a bar where your servers are like, hey, you know, it is immersive.

2347
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:01,120
They're trying to make it.

2348
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:03,800
There are a bunch of creeps in there.

2349
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:07,000
And it's basically get a bad vibe from who are like,

2350
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,920
I can't exist in the real world.

2351
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:11,280
Have these like emotional breakdowns to tap or where they're like,

2352
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,280
I've tried to exist in the real world.

2353
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:16,840
This is the only place I feel safe if I'm not a pirate.

2354
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:19,360
And his rebranding is corporate.

2355
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:21,160
The bar is called Corporate.

2356
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:27,640
The logo is a man wearing a shirt and the theme of the bar is the office.

2357
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:32,000
It's just like this is designed to corporate place.

2358
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:34,040
You do corporate bar.

2359
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:36,800
And if there's a town with a lot of construction in it,

2360
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:40,240
the people want to end up going to the wrecking ball.

2361
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:46,560
But she's just pacing around and she's like, I hate it.

2362
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:47,520
I'm miserable.

2363
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:49,480
And he's like, you're going to ride this out.

2364
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:52,120
I hear her body is rejecting it.

2365
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:53,800
There's never one that's ever gone.

2366
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:56,440
No. So where you could tell they might not make it through the night

2367
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:57,480
without her taking it. Yeah.

2368
01:40:57,480 --> 01:41:00,120
There's one where he doesn't he like, I forget which one that it was.

2369
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:01,560
There's one where he just leaves.

2370
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:02,960
That's maybe the worst one.

2371
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,600
But this is, yeah, there's not one where there's the

2372
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:10,640
there's the female staff member who they were physically abusive to.

2373
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,360
And they won't take responsibility.

2374
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:13,600
Do you know what I'm talking about?

2375
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:18,160
It's like they have one staff member who gets really drunk

2376
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:20,280
and is starting a fight with a nicer woman.

2377
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:23,520
Yeah. And he keeps on saying, like, you have to fire the woman who hit.

2378
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:24,320
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

2379
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:27,200
And the owners go, she was asking for it. Right.

2380
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,160
And they have my bottles falling down.

2381
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:32,160
I was asking for it last time.

2382
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:35,360
And that's the clangiest bottle I've ever heard.

2383
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,880
But he leaves where he's like, I cannot abide by this.

2384
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:40,280
And then I think the owners went to jail.

2385
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:41,600
Oh, I don't know that.

2386
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:43,240
Oh, that's it. Maybe that's the same episode.

2387
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:43,760
I'm trying to remember.

2388
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,280
There's something people won't do something.

2389
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:45,880
And then he leaves.

2390
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:48,360
There's the Chicago Sports Bar one, the dugout.

2391
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:52,000
Yeah. Where the guy has his special is the hot pussy shot.

2392
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:58,240
And he has an all female staff and taffers like, this is revolting.

2393
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:01,120
How dare you make them say this?

2394
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:04,560
Well, that's in dimples in the dimples episode.

2395
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:05,600
That's the other burbank.

2396
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:07,760
The burbank is a former burbank karaoke bar.

2397
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:08,720
Oh, yes. Yes.

2398
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:11,880
Was known as the first karaoke bar in America.

2399
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:15,440
Just a couple of blocks from Warner Brothers Studios.

2400
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:18,280
Now it's a Whole Foods and apartments.

2401
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:22,680
But when it was your birthday, you would go and they were like,

2402
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:25,720
hey, it's Christian's birthday.

2403
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:29,080
There is a million year old running man running it.

2404
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:30,440
He has no charisma.

2405
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:32,560
Yes, he's really really creepy.

2406
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:36,040
And he's like, got to get the blow job shot.

2407
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:37,960
You got to do the blow job shot.

2408
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:40,840
And that's where he like puts his shot with whipped cream on it

2409
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:42,480
between a woman's leg.

2410
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:45,600
And he tells a man to get down on his knees and he goes,

2411
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:48,880
hey, that's not the first time you're going to hear that tonight.

2412
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:52,760
And everyone's like, I don't really do this.

2413
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:55,080
I don't really want to do this.

2414
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:57,200
And he goes like, I don't care.

2415
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:00,360
Like, you know, like we got to do anyway.

2416
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:03,800
And the bar seems very unsafe.

2417
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:08,360
There's chachkis and mementos and movie memorabilia everywhere.

2418
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:11,760
Yeah. The sound system is awful.

2419
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:17,280
Yeah. And he moves everything into the parking lot.

2420
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:21,640
All the memorabilia puts a little back, gets them a new sign.

2421
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:24,640
And the guy's like, wow.

2422
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:28,000
And eventually, like in the post show, Chris, they're like,

2423
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,960
he did put a lot of it back.

2424
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:32,200
Well, that's a case where it's like,

2425
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:33,760
look, maybe it makes a good television.

2426
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:35,480
You're not changing this guy.

2427
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:38,720
Yeah. Right. Like this bar has existed this long this way.

2428
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:42,240
And this what I have a connection.

2429
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:44,480
I never went to this bar,

2430
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:49,280
but this bar is in walking distance to the Oakwood Apartments,

2431
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,880
which is now called something else.

2432
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:53,360
Yeah, it is a long walk.

2433
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:56,720
But when you have college students who just turned 21

2434
01:43:57,120 --> 01:44:00,720
and want to get hammered, wow, that's an old classic.

2435
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:01,760
Yeah. Wow.

2436
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:04,440
See, this episode does have to do with the podcast.

2437
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:09,480
You have to know what theme parks are doing, other things, other things.

2438
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:13,200
That was the Ithaca or Emerson

2439
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:16,040
bar that people would go to.

2440
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:17,320
No, I never part.

2441
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:19,440
I never seen so nasty.

2442
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:22,760
I would look up pictures and I was like, I don't want to go there.

2443
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:24,360
That seems awful.

2444
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:29,160
Hmm. But people would go there and get their video of karaoke.

2445
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:32,680
The other regular of this bar, Mr.

2446
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:35,560
Belding from. Oh, I remember that fact.

2447
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:37,080
In that episode, is he not?

2448
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:38,760
Am I misremembering? I didn't see him.

2449
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:40,360
I rewatched it. OK.

2450
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:42,400
I would think he would be.

2451
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:45,840
I'm learning a false memory of just hearing for years.

2452
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,640
People be like, there's this funny dive bar.

2453
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:49,720
We go to where Mr. Belding is there every night.

2454
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:51,160
If you want to. Yeah.

2455
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:53,760
And he he was kind of a lush.

2456
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:59,160
And but that is the one where the cook gets so overwhelmed

2457
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:02,240
by the stress stress that they have to call an ambulance.

2458
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:04,160
Yeah. And he's OK.

2459
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:09,600
But you can tell it is like everyone's really weirded out after that.

2460
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:12,600
Even more than the creepy owner.

2461
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:14,240
It is another element.

2462
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:18,840
It is cathartic to see people get yelled at if you feel personally

2463
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:20,480
that they deserve it. Yeah.

2464
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:23,240
Yeah, that's one thing about this is that, well, you know,

2465
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:28,120
sometimes Taffer's tactics can be like upsetting and it's fun to make fun of him.

2466
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:31,240
The other side of it is often pretty wrong, too.

2467
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:35,960
It's like Jews, I disagree with everyone in this all at the same time.

2468
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:38,880
Do you remember like the I think it's a Vegas episode where there's the bar

2469
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:42,760
he re themes into a very immersive zombie bar.

2470
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:44,640
Oh, yeah, that's I haven't seen that one.

2471
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:48,440
And I feel like it used to be like a fucking heavy metal bar or something before that.

2472
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:52,160
But the bartender is like incredibly gross with all women.

2473
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:54,920
Yeah, yeah. And it's like the whole episode is him being like,

2474
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:56,760
you're scaring women away.

2475
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:59,680
You're disrespecting women. My wife.

2476
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:02,840
He would scream that a lot, because that's that's that's Lindsay's go to.

2477
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:04,200
And she's quoting Taffer.

2478
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:06,400
She disrespecting women.

2479
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:10,080
Well, that's that's a big that's it's my favorite thing is when he sends his wife

2480
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:12,800
in to do the call. Yeah, you go do it.

2481
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:16,440
Worst of all, that's my wife.

2482
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:18,120
You said that to my wife.

2483
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:22,200
There is an episode of Marriage Rescue where somebody

2484
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:26,880
in the couple, there's one of them

2485
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:31,960
is really obsessed with social media and her social media brand.

2486
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:35,920
And her partner is doesn't really into it and doesn't want to be part of it.

2487
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:38,920
And his solution is you should be in her videos, which, by the way,

2488
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:41,160
it's a former Harlem Globetrotter.

2489
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:45,760
So he does like basketball spinning like you should be in a basketball

2490
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,960
Instagrams, because you know what?

2491
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:50,920
You know, I've I've been married for a long time.

2492
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:53,160
And when I got a TV show, you know what I did?

2493
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:55,360
I put my wife in it.

2494
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,280
I put her in it.

2495
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:58,040
And that's what you have to do with each other.

2496
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:00,120
You got to be you got to spin a basketball with her.

2497
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:02,880
That's the solution. It's so good.

2498
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:06,720
I feel like this this might have restarted a wave of the Taffer

2499
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:10,000
conversation a year or two ago, but I went to my friend's wedding in Chicago

2500
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:13,200
and I walked out of my hotel and I was waiting for an Uber

2501
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:15,880
and I recognized the signage and I texted you guys.

2502
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:17,320
And I said, do you know what this is?

2503
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:21,440
And it's another one of my top, absolute top tier bar rescue episodes.

2504
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:25,480
I realized I was staying outside the husk of it, which was the the Wonder Bar.

2505
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:26,680
Do you remember this one?

2506
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:29,320
Yeah. This woman, the underground Wonder Bar.

2507
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:31,920
Oh, yeah, yeah. The woman's name had like performance arts.

2508
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:33,960
Yes. She's like an old hippie woman.

2509
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:35,640
And they're like crayons on the tables.

2510
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:39,160
And she basically performs a four hour set of her music every night.

2511
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:42,480
And the bar is clearly like she got it for a song.

2512
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:46,880
She paid five dollars for an 80 year lease in like 1965.

2513
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,080
And they can't kick her out, but it makes no money.

2514
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:52,760
And she's just like, this place, it's it's about love and it's an attitude.

2515
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:55,000
And he's like, but it's not a successful business.

2516
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:59,320
And she's got an adult son who she's now like tasked with managing the bar.

2517
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:03,360
But she he can't break his mom's habits of what she wants it to be.

2518
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:06,240
And he's just like, she's out of touch with the times.

2519
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:08,480
Our customer base is literally dying off.

2520
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:11,240
We have this whole downstairs area we don't use.

2521
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:13,680
And he rethemes it as the ice bar.

2522
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:17,600
He's like, you're going to have the best ice in all of Chicago.

2523
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:21,960
And he always has his weird product sponsorship, a POS system from one of these.

2524
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:23,360
You know, he's always got companies.

2525
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:25,680
His good friends at Blank tender.

2526
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:27,560
Yeah, our tender is the one.

2527
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:30,360
But he's got this ice company

2528
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:33,520
that he's like, you're going to be on a bar in Chicago with square ice.

2529
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:37,000
And the ice comes and Ziploc bags and the bar is made of ice.

2530
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:38,760
The whole thing is ice.

2531
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:41,400
He like watched Batman and Robin the night before, maybe.

2532
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:44,640
And you're just like, this woman is just doesn't give a shit.

2533
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:48,520
She just wants to get on her piano and like singing Age of Aquarius or whatever.

2534
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:52,040
This is going to like disappear immediately.

2535
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:54,680
And one of my favorite batch of ice, it's all done.

2536
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:59,880
One of my favorite corners of like Taffa, Taffanalia, Taffa, Belia, Taffiana,

2537
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:02,720
whatever we want to call it.

2538
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:05,920
And do you guys watch any of the

2539
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:08,480
what are they called back to the bar episodes?

2540
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,360
Yes, I have.

2541
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:11,520
Yeah, there's a Scottsdale episode.

2542
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:15,080
Oh, they do go back to where he like narrates it, which is great to like

2543
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:18,080
these knuckleheads didn't do what I said first time.

2544
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:21,280
Let's see if that changes when we go check in on him again.

2545
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:23,920
His teleprompter reading is there.

2546
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:27,720
Also the ones where like he's hosting it from a giant set

2547
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:29,600
surrounded by a live audience.

2548
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:30,720
That's like a circular bar.

2549
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:31,400
Oh, yeah.

2550
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:35,080
And he's like, we're going to today, we're going to revisit some of our past bars.

2551
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:38,640
And it's him trying to do like genial emcee shit.

2552
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:39,720
It's like a Vegas show.

2553
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:42,200
Yeah, and he does magic like live.

2554
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:47,560
And his DJ, put him in that DJ on camera

2555
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:51,320
in a booth with like headphones and turntables will be the announcer.

2556
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:52,040
Yes, yes.

2557
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:53,520
Which this is another thing that's great about him.

2558
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:56,280
Taffer has lasted so long, like a cockroach,

2559
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:59,760
that he is like the one vestige of the Spike network

2560
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:01,960
that still has that energy.

2561
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:04,520
And even though they've rebranded that channel like four times,

2562
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:05,960
I crushed Mansers.

2563
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:07,680
Right. Mansers is dead.

2564
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:09,880
He's still got the Mansers vibes.

2565
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:11,280
Yeah, yeah. That's the voice.

2566
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:13,560
John Taffer coming live from Las Vegas.

2567
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:15,520
You see him. He looks like one of us.

2568
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:16,960
It's very disorienting.

2569
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:19,800
Wow. Because you're just like, he just looks like a comedy, dude.

2570
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:24,920
You know, but he'll have, you know, he'll play like a clip package

2571
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:27,520
of the worst moments from that episode and be like,

2572
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,360
and we're going to catch up with them now.

2573
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:33,640
And he'll have them live in studio and he'll just kind of castigate them.

2574
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:36,720
But he'll do it in a like, wow, we're old friends kind of way.

2575
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:41,080
Yeah, it's a real like a jump to go like your friends are the pirates people.

2576
01:50:41,240 --> 01:50:42,960
You know, we've been so vicious to them.

2577
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:44,640
Do you know what it reminds me of?

2578
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:47,040
Like, we just lived through months and months and months

2579
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:51,640
of the Democratic Party being like, fascism is knocking at the door.

2580
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,080
This man's an immediate threat to our country.

2581
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:55,560
And I'm like, I agree.

2582
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:57,920
We should figure out some way to stop him from getting elected.

2583
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,800
It seems like you don't want a new Hitler in there.

2584
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:01,040
Probably. He gets elected.

2585
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:02,840
And they're just like, well, of course, we have to find a way

2586
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:03,600
to meet him in the middle.

2587
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:05,600
And I'm like, no, stand by this.

2588
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:08,960
And you pointed out that Biden's Biden goes, hey, welcome home.

2589
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:12,360
Right. I'm like, you don't need to be fucking friendly to this guy.

2590
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:14,320
Your assessment was correct.

2591
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:17,240
Yeah. And I'm like, for as much as Taffer can be an asshole,

2592
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:20,320
like he'll have the Wonderbar woman on and he's just like,

2593
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:21,880
you never change your ways.

2594
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:23,880
And we love her for it, don't we?

2595
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:26,360
And I'm like, her business is like collapsing.

2596
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:28,440
Yeah, I hate I don't like those.

2597
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:30,120
It drives you crazy.

2598
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:34,440
It's weird to watch audience responses.

2599
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:38,360
Weird. It's weird how insincere he is where he's trying to play nice guy.

2600
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:43,000
We're going to do a fashion show at a worst uniforms that we ever saw in a bar.

2601
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,160
That shit.

2602
01:51:44,160 --> 01:51:48,120
We're going to make some women where some really embarrassing scanty stuff.

2603
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:54,280
The insincerity, I think, is why there was only one season of Hungry Investors.

2604
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:55,800
We got a whole other show.

2605
01:51:55,800 --> 01:52:00,720
His other show where him and two of his experts choose between two

2606
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:05,320
restaurants to invest in a very boring shark tank.

2607
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:10,160
Whoever put the shows together, whatever person, people that put the shows together,

2608
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:14,880
I they made him look so impressive.

2609
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:18,480
Even though we know we're smart guys, savvy to the biz,

2610
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:22,440
we I still kind of came away from like the first so many episodes being like,

2611
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:24,760
man, he really gets to the heart of the matter.

2612
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:26,720
Literally from the business.

2613
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:29,800
Well, yeah, nobody understands bar science like John Traver.

2614
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:33,640
It makes sense that people like we he must be so talented.

2615
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:35,560
He can work in any genre, right?

2616
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:36,840
Any type of show, right?

2617
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,120
And he can solve any kind of problem.

2618
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:40,960
We're talking reality drums in every genre.

2619
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,440
Stand up. Yeah, I know.

2620
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:46,720
This is not just a perfectly constructed piece of reality television

2621
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:48,600
that makes him look like a superhero.

2622
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:50,440
This man is a superhero.

2623
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:52,480
This isn't just a Svengali.

2624
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:56,760
This isn't like, you know, some kind of wizard.

2625
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:58,840
This is the Wizard of Oz, but he's a real wizard.

2626
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:00,440
Oh, he's a real wizard. There's no man.

2627
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,880
I'm the size of the wizard. I'm the size of the big head.

2628
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:04,840
I got the magic. I'm the size of the balloon.

2629
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:07,640
The magic is real.

2630
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:16,360
Mike, I feel like you have many times over the years said to me in your way.

2631
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:19,120
Yes. No, I hear from a lot of people.

2632
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:22,240
Very smart.

2633
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:24,960
You'll repeat this thing of like once in a while

2634
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:28,800
who have worked on some of the shows or met him in situations.

2635
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:33,160
Well, we have to talk about somebody because we have a connection to someone.

2636
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:33,880
Oh, right, right.

2637
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:37,080
Who has been a part of this franchise.

2638
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:40,520
We should say that that comment has not been made by this person.

2639
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:42,080
Oh, that's true. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2640
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:43,440
I actually don't know the reaction.

2641
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:47,080
Let me and this might require a little bit of tea, because coincidentally,

2642
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:51,080
this is I knew that we we know somebody who's been on a bar rescue.

2643
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:54,000
But then still, I was trying to find unusual episodes.

2644
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:57,240
And I started watching this one, not even realizing, oh, that's the one.

2645
01:53:57,400 --> 01:53:59,720
Because the episode in and of itself is extremely notable

2646
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:03,720
because it's the one where reality genres all clash.

2647
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:07,400
And we have not just a failing bar, but a haunted bar,

2648
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:10,720
a bar that has a ghost in it and where the owner

2649
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:14,680
will not lock it up by himself because of the ghost.

2650
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:18,080
And I don't have the exact quotes, but I know that it builds to things like

2651
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:19,680
you have to choose.

2652
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:23,080
Is it the is it the boy who wins?

2653
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:25,480
Is it the bar and a ghost?

2654
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:29,120
Hearing him yell about the ghost is so awesome.

2655
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:31,680
And I am afraid of no ghost.

2656
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:35,240
But that makes me feel good.

2657
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:38,520
I never liked the girls.

2658
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:42,080
An invisible man sleeping in your bed.

2659
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:45,240
Oh, you're the bacteria.

2660
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:46,680
Thank you, Brian.

2661
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:47,880
Mike, I'm sorry.

2662
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:49,920
He would be a good ghost in a Ghostbusters movie.

2663
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:52,560
Like it would be translucent, whatever the effect on it.

2664
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:54,360
He's just like a scary ghost.

2665
01:54:54,360 --> 01:54:57,520
Slimer is they imagine what a ghost of me would be like.

2666
01:54:57,520 --> 01:54:58,720
And that's what I thought a slime.

2667
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:00,600
He should have been muncher.

2668
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:04,120
Oh, oh, oh, my God.

2669
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:06,200
Yes. The dream casting.

2670
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:10,120
If muncher had the voice of John Tapper, even if it was much, much, much.

2671
01:55:10,120 --> 01:55:11,360
I'm muncher. I'm munching.

2672
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:13,960
It wasn't words. It was just him going, ah.

2673
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:16,440
And they don't even tell him he's doing it.

2674
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:18,560
They just wake him up in the middle of the night.

2675
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:21,000
See what sounds he naturally makes.

2676
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,440
But then this boy, it has him yelling about the ghost,

2677
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:25,000
but then it also has the tender side.

2678
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,720
And it's like they fix the bar stuff and then like, OK,

2679
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:30,400
now it's time we get rid of this ghost.

2680
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:33,720
You are going to you're going to close this building alone.

2681
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:38,120
And then and he's also working the angle of like haunted attractions

2682
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:41,200
are big in this country. Imagine you're in a haunted bar.

2683
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:42,320
It's going to be huge.

2684
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:45,760
But here's what's funny is that there's a premise laid on top of it,

2685
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:48,360
which is that, you know, he sends people in to do the recon.

2686
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:52,280
And sometimes those people are connected to local industry or whatever.

2687
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:53,120
Sometimes they're experts.

2688
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:56,480
Sometimes they're past bar rescue. Oh, that's right.

2689
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:58,920
Right. And if it is from Taffer's.

2690
01:55:58,920 --> 01:55:59,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2691
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:02,840
But in this case, I met two podcasters.

2692
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:07,360
If they recommend this place on the show on the on their podcast,

2693
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:09,120
it could change everything.

2694
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:13,360
But one negative word would send them plummeting into the toilet.

2695
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:15,320
I hired.

2696
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:18,040
And then it's the other one is Matt Myra.

2697
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:19,720
Because I'll talk about it in the idiot.

2698
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:22,480
Is that why the Nerdist appearance happened? Correct.

2699
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:23,360
Oh, OK. Wow.

2700
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:25,800
It's like Myra was really into bar rescue.

2701
01:56:26,120 --> 01:56:28,840
This is Hardwick has saying like, Myra's been trying to get me

2702
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:30,200
to watch Bar Rescue forever.

2703
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:31,280
Then he was on the episode.

2704
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:32,440
Then I finally watched it.

2705
01:56:32,440 --> 01:56:34,880
And I was like, Matt, we have to get Taffer on the show.

2706
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:38,920
Well, that's because which and then because they have a relationship,

2707
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:41,680
he keeps like zinging him like, right, because like, you know,

2708
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:43,720
because you're in a nightclub now, you're feeling confident.

2709
01:56:43,720 --> 01:56:46,280
You want to be talking to the girls, everybody except for you, man.

2710
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:49,800
And I love he's zinging him so hard. Yeah. Yeah.

2711
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:52,600
But you know, normal guys.

2712
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:55,160
So, Matt, you stay out of this.

2713
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:59,400
But the other one, Jordan Morris from Jordan, Jesse Gold.

2714
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:02,960
Yes. He which I and I saw this at some point

2715
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:05,240
just on the Pluto feed without knowing.

2716
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:06,480
And I just bugged out.

2717
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:08,000
What do you mean you were on it?

2718
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,120
And I know I've talked to him about this a bunch over the years.

2719
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:13,760
But then remembering, oh, my God, and it's the ghost one.

2720
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:19,160
And I thought a bar rescue episode would not be complete without some chip

2721
01:57:19,160 --> 01:57:23,760
in from somebody who was actually on an episode who had the opportunity

2722
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:26,240
to make or break a bar. Yeah.

2723
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:29,520
You know, like, did he say negative words about it

2724
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:33,280
just because there's a ghost in there? Was Jordan so cruel?

2725
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:35,560
I'm not sure. And he sent us a voice memo.

2726
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:37,040
I don't know what's in it.

2727
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:40,440
I haven't listened to it, but you know, experience this together.

2728
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:44,720
We can maybe get some some actual feedback of the kayfabe and the character.

2729
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:47,800
And is he smarter? Whatever it is. Yeah.

2730
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,440
Hey, podcast, the ride occasional guest Jordan Morris here

2731
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:54,760
with a remembrance of my time on Bar Rescue.

2732
01:57:55,520 --> 01:58:00,120
In 2015, I was working with writer and podcaster Matt Myra.

2733
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:04,640
He knew I was a fan of Bar Rescue and he knew a few of the field producers.

2734
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:09,360
He asked me if I wanted to be one of the recon guys in an episode with him.

2735
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:11,680
It was shooting in El Cajon.

2736
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:13,800
And I, of course, jumped at the chance.

2737
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:18,080
The recon segment of the show, of course, happens early in the episode

2738
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:20,240
before John Taffer rescues the bar.

2739
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:25,160
He sends in his friends to order drinks and report back on what's wrong with the bar.

2740
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:29,720
This particular bar was Myers Poor P.O.U.R.

2741
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:33,920
House, a very down the middle SoCal strip mall bar.

2742
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:36,480
They apparently had two problems.

2743
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:41,080
Bartenders that overpoured and a ghost that scared away the owner.

2744
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:45,160
We got told all of this ahead of time, and we were also asked

2745
01:58:45,160 --> 01:58:49,840
if we would be OK ordering kettle one spirits who were sponsoring the episode.

2746
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:52,080
I was just kind of excited to be there.

2747
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:57,960
So I gladly ordered kettle one, which I never had and never have since.

2748
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:02,600
So we we were set up not as just John's friends,

2749
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:08,720
but as podcasters whose recommendation or pan could make or break the bar.

2750
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:11,760
If you've heard of my podcast, Jordan, Jesse Goh,

2751
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:16,400
you know, of course, that we spend most of our time reviewing bars near San Diego.

2752
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:20,280
We had a little like meet and greet with John before we went in.

2753
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:21,440
He was very nice.

2754
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:24,520
And I got to see his famous one sport coat that he owns.

2755
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:28,240
We went in, ordered our kettle one cocktails

2756
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:31,000
and tried to get the bartenders to talk about the ghost.

2757
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:34,240
I remember it was really awkward for a bunch of reasons.

2758
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:39,040
First is that it's really strange being in a bar with harsh TV lighting.

2759
01:59:39,240 --> 01:59:41,400
It was just so bright in there.

2760
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:45,520
Second, the bar was filled with all these locals who were just really excited

2761
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:50,000
to be on camera and were just shouting insane shit all night long.

2762
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:53,400
It was next to this one woman who had clearly just learned the phrase

2763
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:58,360
by Felicia, and she would just yell bye Felicia at anyone who walked by.

2764
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:01,600
So we drank a little bit.

2765
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:04,320
The bartender was doing strong pours.

2766
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:07,080
And since we kind of knew this was an issue going into it,

2767
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:10,440
Matt and I really played up how strong the drinks were because

2768
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:13,000
we wanted Daddy to be proud.

2769
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,760
Speaking of Daddy, it was a real thrill to see John come in

2770
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:19,480
and do the shut it down speech.

2771
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:20,840
He did it in one take.

2772
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:23,520
And that's basically the take you see in the episode.

2773
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:27,880
Also, I was really impressed that he was really watching a feed of the bar

2774
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:31,440
outside in the SUV, something I had assumed was faked,

2775
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:33,520
but is is totally actually happening.

2776
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:38,280
So I walked away from the experience, really impressed with the authenticity

2777
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:42,000
of the timeline they present in the show for that particular segment.

2778
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:45,600
Anyway, I still have not been to the rescued bar.

2779
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:49,960
It was changed to the vaguely academic themed the study.

2780
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:52,840
And according to Google, it's still there.

2781
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:56,320
I was paid nothing for my appearance and do not receive any residuals

2782
02:00:56,640 --> 02:00:58,760
when it is rerun seven times a month.

2783
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:01,600
OK, I hope that was enlightening.

2784
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:05,520
If you'll permit me a plug that might be of interest to the PTR audience.

2785
02:01:05,640 --> 02:01:10,360
I wrote a story for the upcoming comics anthology Godzilla versus L.A.

2786
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:14,120
It is three comic stories about Godzilla visiting L.A.

2787
02:01:14,360 --> 02:01:16,800
and all the money goes to wildfire relief.

2788
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:21,120
My story is from the POV of the Universal Studios Tram Driver.

2789
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:24,760
There's a bunch of theme park in jokes that I think you all will enjoy.

2790
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:27,800
And the art is by the amazing Nicole Goh.

2791
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:30,360
It drops on April 30th.

2792
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:33,280
And you could preorder it at your local comic book store.

2793
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:37,040
That's Godzilla versus L.A. coming on April 30th.

2794
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:39,320
Wow. Thank you, Jordan. Great.

2795
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:41,400
No, that's very good. You're always selling.

2796
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:44,560
Every everything you do is an opportunity to sell.

2797
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:47,720
And that's why Jordan, I'm gifting you this POS system

2798
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,960
so you can track how many people on podcasts are getting

2799
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:54,680
the comic work that you do.

2800
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:59,120
Daddy, I, I, Mike, I need you to correct me on this.

2801
02:01:59,640 --> 02:02:01,240
Are do we?

2802
02:02:01,240 --> 02:02:04,560
My memory is we have a connection to one of these bars.

2803
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:06,640
Very briefly, you and I.

2804
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:10,640
Which bar? Pat's Cocktails in Valley Village, California.

2805
02:02:11,160 --> 02:02:14,200
And my memory is we filmed something in there

2806
02:02:14,840 --> 02:02:20,200
that you wrote a web series you co-wrote that never came out.

2807
02:02:20,680 --> 02:02:23,360
And then I think after we did this,

2808
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:29,040
Pat's Cocktail Bar sticks out in my mind as one of the fixes.

2809
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:33,440
They make a cocktail with a smoke gun.

2810
02:02:33,480 --> 02:02:35,520
I don't know what to call it

2811
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:40,320
other than just a gun that shoots smoke in your like whiskey cocktail.

2812
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:43,560
So we're going to get you this gun and you're going to use this every night.

2813
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:45,120
And that's how you're going to fix it.

2814
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:46,760
What was happening in the scene?

2815
02:02:46,760 --> 02:02:49,240
I don't remember. We were just in this bar.

2816
02:02:49,240 --> 02:02:51,360
Who are we with and where have they been canceled?

2817
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:53,720
No, it was there.

2818
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:56,200
I don't see Owen Benjamin.

2819
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:58,880
It was that scene. Yes, yes, yes.

2820
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:00,280
No, this was something.

2821
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:02,680
We made this for Justin Lin's YouTube channel.

2822
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:04,800
When there were just there was just money.

2823
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:08,560
YouTube handed like millions of dollars out to a ton of different people.

2824
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:12,520
And Justin Lin, the famous director of many fast and few

2825
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:15,360
many fast and furious had

2826
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:18,360
dumped a bunch of money into a project that never showed up.

2827
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:21,360
Second, emerging new Internet media.

2828
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:25,320
Invested a bunch of money into people who are already proven

2829
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:28,520
in the most legitimate sectors of the entertainment industry

2830
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:31,880
to then underpay struggling creatives.

2831
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:34,320
And then the thing was never released.

2832
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:36,080
That doesn't sound like a worry.

2833
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:38,000
I know a lot of people are not paid at all.

2834
02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:43,040
The ultimate underpayment, the ultimate under zero.

2835
02:03:43,320 --> 02:03:46,600
What I remember about the Pats Cocktails episode,

2836
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:51,360
there was barbecue place next door and they cut a hole in the walls.

2837
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:56,120
Like, now people can order the barbecue and then you can you just

2838
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:58,120
everyone makes more money.

2839
02:03:58,120 --> 02:04:00,320
We're going to ruin their business, too.

2840
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:04,000
But what I read about Pats Cocktail Bar after that,

2841
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:09,400
or I think people I knew visited and are like, hey, do you sell that smoke gun?

2842
02:04:09,680 --> 02:04:15,200
And they're like, oh, that's up to working weeks after that was long gone.

2843
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:17,760
I feel like whenever Taffer and Bar Rescue comes up,

2844
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:20,960
this is always one of the main things you hone in on, Mike,

2845
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:25,320
is that like every episode starts with they're overpouring.

2846
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:26,520
They're sloppy.

2847
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:28,560
They're taking too long to make drinks.

2848
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:30,880
And it's like a gin and tonic. Right.

2849
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:32,600
Like, yeah, they don't know how to do it.

2850
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:35,080
Who doesn't know how to do a gin and tonic. Right.

2851
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:37,040
And like, yeah, everything's going wrong.

2852
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:40,000
And then they bring in the world's greatest mixologist, whoever it is.

2853
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:43,080
They happen to be the world's greatest every time.

2854
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:45,280
The winner of the most prestigious award.

2855
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:46,360
She's very cool.

2856
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:49,120
She has a big pompadour curl on her head.

2857
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:54,160
That's something that we're doing now, like the band that was bad on SNL, Carmen.

2858
02:04:55,120 --> 02:04:57,600
We have a Carmen and she's going to fix your bar.

2859
02:04:58,600 --> 02:05:04,040
It's just the leap from they can't make two ingredient cocktails.

2860
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:06,280
Right. The name is the two ingredients.

2861
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:08,320
And it's taking too long.

2862
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:10,040
They're doing it poorly and they're losing money.

2863
02:05:10,040 --> 02:05:12,680
And they come in and they're like, here's the concept.

2864
02:05:12,920 --> 02:05:14,920
The drink is inside a skull.

2865
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:16,440
It's on fire.

2866
02:05:16,440 --> 02:05:18,680
You need to shake it with some flair.

2867
02:05:18,680 --> 02:05:20,320
You know, let's make it a show.

2868
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:21,640
It's complicated to make.

2869
02:05:21,640 --> 02:05:23,560
It costs $40.

2870
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:24,920
Proprietary equipment.

2871
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:27,520
There's cinnamon hair strands at the top.

2872
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:28,680
And you singe.

2873
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:29,880
Don't burn them all the way.

2874
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:32,080
You lightly singe the cinnamon hair.

2875
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:37,640
This this season nine episode I watched was it's like the bar needs a gimmick.

2876
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:41,120
You got to have a gimmick and a challenge to get people in through the door.

2877
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:45,320
So they had a drink called the Bucking Bronco where there's a pepper

2878
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:48,120
and you have to eat the pepper first.

2879
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:52,400
And then the drink has like 10 different types of like chili and hot sauce in it.

2880
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:58,560
But then like a tahini rim and then like a straw that's coated in some other spicy substance.

2881
02:05:58,680 --> 02:06:01,440
I'm like, there are 27 steps to this thing.

2882
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:06,160
And the woman at the beginning of it was making martinis with orange juice.

2883
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:09,400
There's like it's the same way with the kitchen.

2884
02:06:09,400 --> 02:06:13,600
Like there's a guy who cannot figure out how to make mozzarella sticks in a microwave.

2885
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:18,760
And he's like, I want you to cook a full Thanksgiving dinner for every person on that bar.

2886
02:06:18,760 --> 02:06:22,960
You better plate the Caprese successfully because we eat with our eyes

2887
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:24,880
before we eat with our mouths.

2888
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:27,440
You need to slaughter the bison yourself.

2889
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:30,040
Take the table from the table.

2890
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:33,040
Let the littlest kid take the knife and do it.

2891
02:06:34,200 --> 02:06:37,960
In one of the recons, before everything's fixed,

2892
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:43,120
one of the Burbank bars, the expert orders a scotch and soda,

2893
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:49,000
gets it, takes a sip and goes, oh, like he just drank toilet water.

2894
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:54,160
And just hearing Jordan talk about like playing up the reactions, I was like,

2895
02:06:54,520 --> 02:06:58,600
how badly could you fuck up a scotch and soda?

2896
02:06:58,600 --> 02:07:00,800
This is interesting what he's thrown into question.

2897
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:05,280
He through he himself, perhaps, was not authentic,

2898
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:08,240
thinking that this was what the show asked for.

2899
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:13,000
But then found the man himself, John, to be a beacon of authenticity.

2900
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,160
Right. That he nailed it in one take.

2901
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:19,480
That the time I am very surprised that the recon in the van is happening.

2902
02:07:19,480 --> 02:07:21,440
I am, too. Yeah, the fakest.

2903
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:22,840
Like, I'm going in there.

2904
02:07:22,840 --> 02:07:25,440
I assume that he just knocked out all the van scenes.

2905
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:30,240
Like in a separate sound stage, months and months later, always my guess.

2906
02:07:30,240 --> 02:07:34,240
And then I was digging in and it seems to be that the timeline of the show

2907
02:07:34,240 --> 02:07:36,680
as represented is pretty honest and accurate.

2908
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:41,680
But my head always watching the show was like, he must go to one bar,

2909
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:46,520
do those couple of days, leave the renovation, takes a week or two.

2910
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:48,960
Then he goes to another bar.

2911
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:52,000
He circles back to the first bar when that renovation is done.

2912
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,880
Then he circles back to the second bar when that renovation is done.

2913
02:07:55,120 --> 02:07:57,600
But it's like, no, it does sound like each episode happens

2914
02:07:57,600 --> 02:08:00,000
within one five day week, basically.

2915
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,120
And he's actually in the van.

2916
02:08:02,120 --> 02:08:03,760
Right. I'm sure they time it.

2917
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:08,440
So it's like 20, 15 minutes tops him in the van looking at the footage.

2918
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:12,080
Yeah. But the fact that these things are actually happening, like, yeah.

2919
02:08:12,080 --> 02:08:14,160
Yeah. Makes you feel good. It does.

2920
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:17,600
Do you think that one thing Jordan didn't say is whether or not

2921
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:19,160
he made good on the promise?

2922
02:08:19,160 --> 02:08:22,880
Is there an episode of Jordan, Jesse go where real quick,

2923
02:08:22,880 --> 02:08:26,760
I don't want to sidebar too much, but I found myself in El Cajon

2924
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:32,080
where I often am, and I was mortified at my experience

2925
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:35,280
at a little place called the poor and then just like a 15 minute

2926
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:38,120
just absolute tear down of. Yeah.

2927
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:41,720
And and and and forgive me, Jesse, I will let you format.

2928
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:45,600
Well, I was confused at first because I always knew the show

2929
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:49,520
is Jordan get Jordan, Jesse go brought to by kettle one.

2930
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:56,520
Yeah, there's a later season like the sponsorship to it.

2931
02:08:56,520 --> 02:08:57,840
Sorry, I'm all over the place.

2932
02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:00,800
I feel like there's more of that and there's more synergy later.

2933
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:03,160
Don't worry. I got a whole leave on that.

2934
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:07,440
I have a whole PDF take behind about his philosophy from

2935
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:09,400
just for us to read.

2936
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:11,480
Well, for us to apply to our lives.

2937
02:09:11,480 --> 02:09:13,040
Oh, sure. Wow.

2938
02:09:13,040 --> 02:09:15,560
Well, that's what I think it's about when we get together.

2939
02:09:15,560 --> 02:09:18,680
Griffin gifted us a television premise, which is now the subject

2940
02:09:18,680 --> 02:09:20,240
of a massive bidding war. Right.

2941
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:22,680
And you're going to help us.

2942
02:09:22,680 --> 02:09:26,200
So I think we'll learn that making that show, that that conflict

2943
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:29,920
will be crucial and you listen to the one audiobook.

2944
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:34,440
But you didn't even listen to the older book, Raise the Bar

2945
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:38,960
and Action Based Method for Maximum Customer Reaction.

2946
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:41,680
No, I understand. I didn't have a double meaning in that title,

2947
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:42,920
if I'm not mistaken.

2948
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:45,520
I think I don't understand. I think there might be.

2949
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:47,440
I just want to at least say the name of this.

2950
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:49,800
It's called Taffer's Toolkit Takeaways.

2951
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:53,360
So that's where you learn about conflict and how to use conflict

2952
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:56,080
to help in your daily life. Wow.

2953
02:09:56,080 --> 02:09:57,520
But we don't have time to get done.

2954
02:09:57,520 --> 02:09:59,480
There's so I know we do have to start.

2955
02:09:59,480 --> 02:10:02,120
I think maybe one thing to talk about a little bit,

2956
02:10:02,120 --> 02:10:06,040
and we've referred to this a bit, but I this is also something to

2957
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:09,160
you know, that's that's a promise and something we can make good on

2958
02:10:09,160 --> 02:10:14,160
a little better in Taffer, too, is is his own restaurant,

2959
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:16,520
Taffer's Taver. Yeah.

2960
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:21,320
So the ultimate bar scientist has applied this science

2961
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:24,120
to a restaurant chain. Yes.

2962
02:10:24,120 --> 02:10:28,080
And wouldn't you know it, of the three locations that have opened,

2963
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:31,600
two of them have quickly does not seem to be going very well.

2964
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:37,480
Every time it opens in a new city, the food reviewer for that city's paper

2965
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:40,320
tears it apart.

2966
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:44,240
I mean, that's like what a great opportunity to do so.

2967
02:10:44,240 --> 02:10:48,080
You can't blame the one that remains open is in Alpharetta, Georgia.

2968
02:10:48,080 --> 02:10:50,400
It's 40 minutes north of Atlanta.

2969
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:51,520
That one has maintained.

2970
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:55,080
But D.C. closed Watertown, Massachusetts closed

2971
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:58,560
in trying to assess what a problem might be.

2972
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:02,800
Well, the very thing that we're referring to, the drinks in the skulls and such.

2973
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:07,000
I was curious what is on the bar menu at Taffer's Tavern.

2974
02:11:08,040 --> 02:11:11,000
And one that jumped out at me is a drink called Lost at Sea,

2975
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:15,240
a glistening deep sea experience with vodka, tropical orange and ginger flavors

2976
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:18,880
garnished with a mermaid.

2977
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:19,880
What do you mean by that?

2978
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:23,920
Yeah, I have no further information on what the mermaid garnish is.

2979
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:28,080
But this does seem in keeping with like he like I'm going to check in

2980
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:31,680
on these knuckleheads and see what if they kept my system in place.

2981
02:11:32,400 --> 02:11:34,760
Excuse me. Where are the mermaids?

2982
02:11:35,080 --> 02:11:36,120
I don't see.

2983
02:11:36,120 --> 02:11:38,840
I don't see clamshell bras anywhere.

2984
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:42,240
I hand shook those clams.

2985
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:44,960
I took the clams out themselves.

2986
02:11:45,240 --> 02:11:48,000
We were importing the clams from Sicily.

2987
02:11:48,120 --> 02:11:51,360
Why aren't you keeping the mermaids in your drinks?

2988
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:54,320
They could talk. I bred them in a lab.

2989
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:56,480
They were real live mermaids.

2990
02:11:56,480 --> 02:11:59,880
I'm trying to find this article I found yesterday that was him breaking down.

2991
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:03,120
I can't remember if it was right before the pandemic or sort of like right

2992
02:12:03,120 --> 02:12:06,520
at the beginning of vaccination when he was ramping up.

2993
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:08,960
And he was just like, this is ready to overtake everything.

2994
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:11,160
I got some Taffer vaccination things.

2995
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:13,160
But yeah, I forgot.

2996
02:12:13,160 --> 02:12:16,560
But he was basically saying, like, I've just been studying the restaurant

2997
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:20,400
industry, and it just angers me how broken it is.

2998
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:21,920
And I'm ready to fix it all.

2999
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:23,920
And I've recently gone down a similar rabbit hole.

3000
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:28,240
Steve Ells, the creator of Chipotle, has been like,

3001
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:32,400
I've seen my thing go through its whole like rise and fall or Chipotle

3002
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:34,240
to wherever it's landed. Right.

3003
02:12:34,240 --> 02:12:36,920
And I'm ready to revolutionize the industry again.

3004
02:12:37,080 --> 02:12:38,160
And he's like robots.

3005
02:12:38,160 --> 02:12:40,080
People don't want to interact with people.

3006
02:12:40,080 --> 02:12:41,680
It's plant based robots.

3007
02:12:41,680 --> 02:12:43,640
No seeding takeout only.

3008
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:46,560
And he started these restaurants called Colonel that opened in New York

3009
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:49,920
that very quickly closed because people found them unappealing.

3010
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:53,320
And now they keep rebranding and be like, we've heard you.

3011
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:55,280
We're going to make it more warm.

3012
02:12:55,280 --> 02:12:57,520
Warm. You will see a person's face.

3013
02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:00,320
There will be a chair.

3014
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:03,520
I don't understand the greatest nightclub in the world that a robot.

3015
02:13:04,360 --> 02:13:06,560
If it was Seiko, though, I bet it would have worked.

3016
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:08,240
Yeah, Taffer's Tavern.

3017
02:13:08,240 --> 02:13:10,720
I was finding this article sent to you guys and their quotes.

3018
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:11,880
I'm looking forward to pull up here.

3019
02:13:11,880 --> 02:13:17,520
But the model was based on labor costs have become too high.

3020
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:22,560
Taffer is a real big fighter against minimum wage being raised.

3021
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:24,160
Small business, Seiko.

3022
02:13:24,160 --> 02:13:25,760
Yeah, it's all business time, right?

3023
02:13:25,760 --> 02:13:27,800
Labor costs versus material costs.

3024
02:13:27,800 --> 02:13:30,360
It's like the health of the business is the only thing that matters.

3025
02:13:30,360 --> 02:13:31,840
And the numbers have been out of whack.

3026
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:35,760
Places like Applebee's are doing like four entrees for five dollars or whatever.

3027
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:37,520
And he's like, something has to change.

3028
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:41,440
Higher quality food, but less people working.

3029
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:45,920
So the Taffer Tavern model I didn't realize was at least at the beginning

3030
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:49,720
very much conceived of this is a largely robotic kitchen.

3031
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:50,960
Really? Yes.

3032
02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:52,080
Oh, I miss this.

3033
02:13:52,080 --> 02:13:54,400
And the food is sous vide.

3034
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:58,800
Yeah, that is a big high quality food that is prepared

3035
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:02,880
and seasoned by experts sous vide en masse.

3036
02:14:03,640 --> 02:14:06,240
And they were like, so do you need to have some offsite location

3037
02:14:06,240 --> 02:14:08,680
that's making food for all of the franchise locations?

3038
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:10,960
If your thing expands, he's like, no, we use the company

3039
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:14,080
that makes the sandwiches for Starbucks and now they make steaks for us.

3040
02:14:14,680 --> 02:14:18,040
What? And so they make steaks, they vacuum seal them in bags,

3041
02:14:18,040 --> 02:14:20,880
they ship them to Taffer's Tavern, and then a robot cooks it,

3042
02:14:21,640 --> 02:14:23,200
which is dumps it in water.

3043
02:14:23,200 --> 02:14:27,920
Sous vide, as I know it, it is vacuum sealed in a bag.

3044
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:29,840
Yes. Placed in boiling water.

3045
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:32,240
Yes. Then opened and put on the plate. Right.

3046
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:34,080
And he was like, incredible.

3047
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:36,560
It's easier. It's cheaper. It tastes better.

3048
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:39,680
We don't have a 15 year old seasoning on a line.

3049
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:42,520
Now it doesn't take like a day to teach someone to cook.

3050
02:14:42,520 --> 02:14:44,000
It takes them like a minute

3051
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,840
because they don't actually have to do the cooking.

3052
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:47,400
They just oversee the robot.

3053
02:14:47,400 --> 02:14:50,400
And he's saying like, and you won't believe how good this steak tastes.

3054
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:53,440
You won't believe. Review from Washington Post.

3055
02:14:55,800 --> 02:14:59,040
Steak frites in which the flat iron cut had been waterboarded

3056
02:14:59,040 --> 02:15:01,280
to the consistency of guacamole.

3057
02:15:03,120 --> 02:15:04,920
There's almost evocative descriptions

3058
02:15:04,920 --> 02:15:06,840
I've ever read in a restaurant review.

3059
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:09,960
How do you possibly end up doing this after?

3060
02:15:09,960 --> 02:15:13,800
You're the guy. 300 episodes of screaming at people.

3061
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:15,720
You just put it in water.

3062
02:15:15,720 --> 02:15:18,440
Chicken and waffles in which the pre-cooked bird

3063
02:15:18,440 --> 02:15:20,440
was fried in-house to a nice crackle.

3064
02:15:20,440 --> 02:15:23,800
But the base was so gooey and underdone

3065
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:27,080
that the pearl sugar concealed inside the waffle

3066
02:15:27,080 --> 02:15:30,600
cracked against my teeth like grit from a poorly cleaned oyster.

3067
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:34,000
The waffle's the problem? Oh my God.

3068
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:37,240
He'll give Taffer that the chicken was good, but the waffle.

3069
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:40,880
The cost of making waffles is what's bringing this country down.

3070
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:42,840
And Mr. Trump, I need you to assure me

3071
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:44,360
that you'll get the waffle prices there.

3072
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:48,600
Let my robot put a bagged waffle in a tub of water.

3073
02:15:50,080 --> 02:15:53,160
Is there a detail left in that review that you could read

3074
02:15:53,160 --> 02:15:56,720
as if it was Taffer yelling at the person who, like,

3075
02:15:56,720 --> 02:15:58,840
it's Taffer yelling at the cook?

3076
02:15:58,840 --> 02:16:02,760
Scott, let me see if I can scan this review for even one more negative statement.

3077
02:16:02,760 --> 02:16:05,080
That must be all of them, right?

3078
02:16:05,120 --> 02:16:07,720
I'll read that part of me is dazzled by technology

3079
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:09,120
that holds Taffer's tavern together.

3080
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:11,000
And what do I mean for the future of hospitality?

3081
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:14,120
Kitchens that require fewer and less skilled workers.

3082
02:16:14,120 --> 02:16:15,000
Read between the lines there.

3083
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,560
Now, this we can all agree on. Yes.

3084
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:19,080
This is a very good thing. Yes.

3085
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:22,480
Yes, we all agree on that. More POS systems than humans.

3086
02:16:22,480 --> 02:16:25,160
Well, basis owners are better.

3087
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:28,920
The only way I agree is if it's like a kitchen of Seco's.

3088
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:32,160
Yes, yeah. And they are wearing big old...

3089
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:33,880
Wait, here's a point of discussion.

3090
02:16:33,880 --> 02:16:37,360
Giant chef's hats or regular human sized chef's hats

3091
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:39,640
that are very small on Seco's big head? Regular, regular.

3092
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:40,840
OK, got to talk to them.

3093
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:46,160
They have a lot of these in Vegas now where, like, a robot will make your cocktail.

3094
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:51,400
But it looks like a robot arm from an assembly line.

3095
02:16:51,640 --> 02:16:54,640
And it's just grabbing different bottles from the seat.

3096
02:16:54,640 --> 02:16:56,840
So it's not made to look friendly at all.

3097
02:16:56,840 --> 02:16:58,520
And then it's not a robot.

3098
02:16:58,520 --> 02:17:02,120
It looks like it could torture you if you get tangled up in its robot arms.

3099
02:17:02,120 --> 02:17:04,600
It's like, here is your Jack and Coke.

3100
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:06,800
That's what I want. If it says that, I'm happy.

3101
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:08,400
All I need, just talk to me.

3102
02:17:08,400 --> 02:17:11,040
Talk to me and it's not in a human AI voice.

3103
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:13,600
I did like, I hope you are satisfied.

3104
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:15,360
Enjoy getting hammered.

3105
02:17:15,360 --> 02:17:17,840
The only robot you want is the greeter.

3106
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:21,200
Yeah. But going table to table, being like, how is your dinner?

3107
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:23,800
Where you're like, that's fun novelty entertainment shit.

3108
02:17:23,800 --> 02:17:25,080
Have you been here before?

3109
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:28,320
At a pulsation type restaurant. Right.

3110
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:31,640
I mean, this Washington Post review goes in multiple paragraphs of being like,

3111
02:17:31,640 --> 02:17:34,640
I think I've identified the problem with robot restaurants.

3112
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:36,960
Like, this person is like, in theory, I get it.

3113
02:17:36,960 --> 02:17:41,560
But here's what's terrifying about going to a restaurant without humans in it.

3114
02:17:42,280 --> 02:17:45,880
I will read this paragraph in my best worst

3115
02:17:46,520 --> 02:17:51,520
taffer here, the section about the drinks, which should be taffers special.

3116
02:17:51,520 --> 02:17:55,160
Of course, the cocktail list, which would seem to play the taffer strengths

3117
02:17:55,400 --> 02:17:58,880
borrows ideas from the wider world of mixology without apparently

3118
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,120
understanding how to best apply them.

3119
02:18:01,160 --> 02:18:05,840
The tiny pile of wood chips that sits next to the trademark Campfire cocktail,

3120
02:18:06,040 --> 02:18:13,000
basically a fat washed old fashioned is ignited purely for show, not flavor.

3121
02:18:13,360 --> 02:18:18,120
I'm still not sure why my server served charred a jalapeno table side,

3122
02:18:18,320 --> 02:18:23,760
which I was then told to switch around the spiced rum based resurrection.

3123
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:27,840
A drink that looks like it was mixed with water from Splash Mountain.

3124
02:18:28,440 --> 02:18:32,400
So if anyone thinks this podcast doesn't have to do with theme parks, it really does.

3125
02:18:32,760 --> 02:18:35,560
Yeah, you got a problem with the way I make my campfire drinks.

3126
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:37,680
Do you have a better way to make campfire?

3127
02:18:37,680 --> 02:18:40,800
What have you gotten a little set next to your beverage?

3128
02:18:41,920 --> 02:18:44,440
This other article when they were about to open where he was just like,

3129
02:18:44,440 --> 02:18:48,200
and we're turning away applications, too many franchisees want to open one.

3130
02:18:48,360 --> 02:18:49,600
He's like, it's simple.

3131
02:18:49,600 --> 02:18:52,400
We've simplified the cook robots and sous vide.

3132
02:18:52,480 --> 02:18:53,680
And they're like, what about the drinks?

3133
02:18:53,680 --> 02:18:55,920
He's like the most obnoxious drinks of all time.

3134
02:18:56,280 --> 02:18:58,440
Every drink has five glow sticks.

3135
02:18:58,800 --> 02:19:00,840
There are backstories to every drink.

3136
02:19:01,160 --> 02:19:05,280
You have to have read a graphic novel prequel to understand the beverage you're drinking.

3137
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:08,640
And the interviewer straight up asked him, like, doesn't that seem counter

3138
02:19:08,640 --> 02:19:12,360
to the philosophy that you just outlined for the food?

3139
02:19:12,360 --> 02:19:14,320
And he's like, no, it's going to work the same way.

3140
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:16,160
And they're like, how is that possible?

3141
02:19:16,160 --> 02:19:20,080
And he's like, well, obviously there'll be a big component of premixing.

3142
02:19:20,440 --> 02:19:22,400
And I'm like, yeah, but you're also advertising that the drinks

3143
02:19:22,400 --> 02:19:25,200
have 10 novelty toys inside of them.

3144
02:19:25,720 --> 02:19:29,960
The drinks are like magic tricks when a magician has to escape from a straitjacket.

3145
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:35,520
You only have one minute to find the key to rescue your drink from a straitjacket,

3146
02:19:35,520 --> 02:19:38,000
which is going to fall into a little mini tub of fire.

3147
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:38,800
It's simple.

3148
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:41,480
It creates excitement to the night.

3149
02:19:41,480 --> 02:19:43,640
And we're in the reaction industry, of course.

3150
02:19:43,800 --> 02:19:45,680
You're going to react to that in the industry.

3151
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:48,120
Can I actually can I bring it to theme parks a little bit?

3152
02:19:48,120 --> 02:19:50,800
I have a little like I have a little challenge that I think

3153
02:19:51,040 --> 02:19:52,600
just to tie some things together.

3154
02:19:52,600 --> 02:19:55,360
There are, of course, some bars in the world of theme parks

3155
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:58,840
that do kind of have stories, backstories.

3156
02:19:58,880 --> 02:20:02,360
Yes. And there where there is like a canon to it.

3157
02:20:02,360 --> 02:20:04,920
And I just thought I'd propose and anybody jump in there

3158
02:20:06,360 --> 02:20:10,320
how Taffer might go about rescuing certain theme park.

3159
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:11,720
Oh, sure. Yeah.

3160
02:20:11,720 --> 02:20:14,640
Let me start with an obvious one, perhaps Ogas Cantina.

3161
02:20:17,800 --> 02:20:19,680
You're over serving.

3162
02:20:19,680 --> 02:20:21,480
You're over pouring.

3163
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:24,360
You're making people get two drinks at once.

3164
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:29,440
This aliens lay eggs in this tank and the tank is dirty.

3165
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:32,040
The eggs are poisonous.

3166
02:20:32,040 --> 02:20:33,680
There's a frog in there.

3167
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:38,280
There is a frog in the jar and the pipes go straight to the consumers.

3168
02:20:38,440 --> 02:20:42,840
They're dripping mucus and pus into the drinks.

3169
02:20:42,840 --> 02:20:44,960
And where are the aliens serving?

3170
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:47,800
These are dirty human beings working.

3171
02:20:47,880 --> 02:20:51,240
Not enough droids automate.

3172
02:20:51,720 --> 02:20:55,360
You've got one droid here, but his programming don't work.

3173
02:20:55,360 --> 02:20:57,520
He thinks he's a pilot.

3174
02:20:57,520 --> 02:20:59,840
He needs mental health counseling.

3175
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:01,520
You have him playing music.

3176
02:21:01,520 --> 02:21:04,960
He should be doing sous vide.

3177
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:06,360
He's got so many arms.

3178
02:21:06,360 --> 02:21:08,240
He could be making three meals.

3179
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:10,600
Play the music on a tape.

3180
02:21:10,600 --> 02:21:11,640
You don't need a DJ.

3181
02:21:11,640 --> 02:21:13,800
It's the same shit every hour.

3182
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:14,720
Have you heard this thing?

3183
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:18,400
He says he did seemingly create the NFL season pass

3184
02:21:18,400 --> 02:21:21,200
or whatever that fucking business model is that sells

3185
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:24,640
the NFL games to bars, which he's part of the permanent.

3186
02:21:24,640 --> 02:21:27,400
He's part of the NFL Hall of Fame, was part of the board of directors

3187
02:21:27,400 --> 02:21:28,480
at some point or something.

3188
02:21:28,480 --> 02:21:32,320
But basically, as a bar guy was like, we should have some unified program.

3189
02:21:32,560 --> 02:21:34,640
I don't know. Everyone gives him credit for that.

3190
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:38,920
He also keeps saying in interviews, I found that he's the only man

3191
02:21:38,920 --> 02:21:43,120
in America with a patent on a music organizational system

3192
02:21:43,480 --> 02:21:45,960
for public spaces or something like that.

3193
02:21:46,280 --> 02:21:48,200
It's a weirdly convoluted thing.

3194
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:51,360
And only in the Nerdist episode did he kind of get into it

3195
02:21:51,560 --> 02:21:54,920
where he's like, I spent seven years studying the science

3196
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:58,920
of how emotions make people feel with music

3197
02:21:59,080 --> 02:22:01,640
and get them to do different things at bars.

3198
02:22:01,800 --> 02:22:05,240
And I have a system where you can't play the same song the same day,

3199
02:22:05,240 --> 02:22:07,320
but you need to know how to adjust to the crowd.

3200
02:22:07,320 --> 02:22:10,600
And he the one study throughout was I with music

3201
02:22:10,600 --> 02:22:12,760
can do anything I want to a crowd.

3202
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:17,080
I can get gang members out of a bar in three weeks.

3203
02:22:17,080 --> 02:22:20,640
I heard this. He said, I've musically eradicated a bar

3204
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:23,720
from the gang members in three weeks time.

3205
02:22:23,920 --> 02:22:25,160
And then it's like, what do you mean?

3206
02:22:25,160 --> 02:22:28,560
And he goes, two out of every three songs are a female artist.

3207
02:22:29,640 --> 02:22:32,360
That's his only follow up explanation.

3208
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:34,800
But you have a lot to say to Rex.

3209
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:38,960
Do the gang members have to go through the butt funnel?

3210
02:22:39,560 --> 02:22:40,520
Presumably.

3211
02:22:40,520 --> 02:22:42,160
That's a very small entry.

3212
02:22:42,160 --> 02:22:44,680
X, X awaited the dance floor.

3213
02:22:45,080 --> 02:22:48,200
So everyone has to lean in to get to know each other

3214
02:22:48,200 --> 02:22:50,640
a little more with their crawls and bands.

3215
02:22:51,240 --> 02:22:53,960
I've eradicated a bar of storm troopers.

3216
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:57,440
It is a fascinating thing, though, where like Taffer is like,

3217
02:22:57,600 --> 02:22:59,720
the butt funnel is one of my big inventions.

3218
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,280
You need a space that's too hard to walk through.

3219
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:05,840
So people are forced to interact because people go to bars to meet people.

3220
02:23:06,080 --> 02:23:08,360
And you're like, oh, so you basically like have created

3221
02:23:08,360 --> 02:23:10,600
like a tunnel of sexual harassment.

3222
02:23:10,920 --> 02:23:12,840
It's fire hazard.

3223
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:14,480
Yeah, that's why he calls it a butt funnel.

3224
02:23:14,480 --> 02:23:15,440
It's like a core.

3225
02:23:15,440 --> 02:23:19,360
It's like a fucking corridor that forces people to get uncomfortably

3226
02:23:19,360 --> 02:23:21,800
close to each other while very drunk.

3227
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:24,640
This drink with the word pussy in it is disgusting.

3228
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:29,240
This system I've implemented nationwide with butt in it is perfection.

3229
02:23:30,840 --> 02:23:33,280
He's only comfortable with his sexuality, he says.

3230
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:36,200
Oh, I heard that's what you said, too.

3231
02:23:36,200 --> 02:23:38,440
Yeah, you want to control control it.

3232
02:23:38,440 --> 02:23:39,880
Yeah. Oh, go. Oh, go.

3233
02:23:39,880 --> 02:23:41,080
Come here. Come here.

3234
02:23:41,080 --> 02:23:42,640
I went to the stand at the entrance.

3235
02:23:42,640 --> 02:23:44,920
You see where we're at right now.

3236
02:23:44,920 --> 02:23:46,320
All right. Look over there.

3237
02:23:46,320 --> 02:23:48,000
That's the closest bathroom.

3238
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:49,720
That's one block away.

3239
02:23:49,720 --> 02:23:52,280
Why are there no bathrooms in your establishment?

3240
02:23:53,080 --> 02:23:55,000
Why are there no bathrooms here?

3241
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:58,480
And then people have to take dirty bathroom return cards.

3242
02:23:58,720 --> 02:24:01,240
That card's been in the bathroom.

3243
02:24:01,320 --> 02:24:05,240
The median income on Batu is over 25000 credits.

3244
02:24:08,120 --> 02:24:10,000
Why do you call it August Cantina?

3245
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:11,440
It's an ego stroke.

3246
02:24:11,440 --> 02:24:14,760
Your name's not even that you won't even appear in this place.

3247
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:17,520
Look around this area.

3248
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:22,120
Seventy percent of the surrounding businesses are frontier themed.

3249
02:24:22,960 --> 02:24:25,280
You need to appeal to that clientele.

3250
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:29,000
All right. Here we go. Rebranding.

3251
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,200
Three, two, one. The spur.

3252
02:24:32,840 --> 02:24:33,680
There you go.

3253
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:37,200
That is genuinely what Taffer would do is he'd go to Olga's ago.

3254
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:39,560
You have to appeal to the frontier land crowd.

3255
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:43,200
And then it's the one frontier land bar in a Star Wars area.

3256
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:46,040
Take a look at this on the map right around the corner.

3257
02:24:46,200 --> 02:24:49,440
Big you have railroad workers coming in here.

3258
02:24:50,280 --> 02:24:53,400
They want to think about they don't want rails.

3259
02:24:54,800 --> 02:24:57,800
You could call it the sidecar, the caboose.

3260
02:24:58,360 --> 02:24:59,880
We're going to serve the caboose.

3261
02:24:59,880 --> 02:25:02,480
And this girl with the big hair is going to teach you how to make it.

3262
02:25:02,480 --> 02:25:04,040
It's got 25 ingredients.

3263
02:25:04,040 --> 02:25:06,640
This part of town's been through some rough times.

3264
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:08,920
This used to be credit country.

3265
02:25:08,920 --> 02:25:10,720
That industry failed.

3266
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:12,480
People don't know where to go.

3267
02:25:12,480 --> 02:25:16,200
Entire critter bands have been evicted and replaced by cheaper ones

3268
02:25:16,480 --> 02:25:18,240
with less characters in them.

3269
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:21,240
I'm bringing in my expert chef, Dexter Jetster.

3270
02:25:22,360 --> 02:25:24,720
He's going to overhaul the whole menu.

3271
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:31,960
Olga, what you used to have a fire in you.

3272
02:25:31,960 --> 02:25:33,040
I read about you.

3273
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:36,480
You were going to put a dinner theater right behind this bar.

3274
02:25:37,120 --> 02:25:39,480
That never happened.

3275
02:25:39,480 --> 02:25:43,120
Instead, you're addicted to Dexter's death sticks.

3276
02:25:43,120 --> 02:25:45,640
If he should, if he had if he had gotten into the star cruiser,

3277
02:25:45,640 --> 02:25:46,640
it would never closed.

3278
02:25:46,640 --> 02:25:48,680
Yeah. Well, it's that whole thing.

3279
02:25:48,680 --> 02:25:49,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3280
02:25:49,720 --> 02:25:51,600
Yeah. He would have identified right away.

3281
02:25:51,600 --> 02:25:55,000
Yeah. There's pillars in the way people can't see the show.

3282
02:25:58,600 --> 02:26:00,320
I've got an idea for a rebranding.

3283
02:26:00,320 --> 02:26:01,720
Here we go. Three, two, one.

3284
02:26:01,720 --> 02:26:05,040
The Imagineering Office.

3285
02:26:05,160 --> 02:26:07,120
I've sent Jenny Nicholson in.

3286
02:26:07,120 --> 02:26:09,360
She's one of the biggest influencers in this space.

3287
02:26:10,800 --> 02:26:14,840
Just one four hour video could make or break this establishment.

3288
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:17,320
You know, it's a really depressing one.

3289
02:26:17,320 --> 02:26:20,120
There's like a season five episode where he sends

3290
02:26:20,760 --> 02:26:24,080
fucking David Portnoy, Dave Portnoy in Barstool Sports.

3291
02:26:24,080 --> 02:26:26,640
And that way, he's like, you're a bar sir's pizza.

3292
02:26:26,840 --> 02:26:28,200
This is Dave Portnoy.

3293
02:26:28,200 --> 02:26:30,280
He's the most important man in pizza.

3294
02:26:30,520 --> 02:26:32,680
One word from him could make or break your business.

3295
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:36,720
I'm like, oh, this is like classic fucking taffer blow up.

3296
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:39,680
And now you read these articles of like pizzerias

3297
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:43,360
that are clinging on for dear life because like Portnoy

3298
02:26:43,360 --> 02:26:47,320
started a flame war with them and now people like jam their phone

3299
02:26:47,320 --> 02:26:49,480
number all day saying like, Baba booey.

3300
02:26:50,160 --> 02:26:54,080
And you're like, this guy actually is like a force who is able to like.

3301
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:56,280
Oh, in a dark way. Oh, no.

3302
02:26:56,280 --> 02:26:59,440
But also now everyone has to curry favor with him because they're like,

3303
02:26:59,440 --> 02:27:02,400
if he likes us, then the business like goes through the roof.

3304
02:27:02,400 --> 02:27:05,280
Oh, Jesus. It didn't save Pizza Rizzo.

3305
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:08,760
It didn't save. Did Portnoy ever do Pizza Rizzo?

3306
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:11,960
Yeah, I've gotten the Portnoy Pizza Rizzo.

3307
02:27:12,320 --> 02:27:16,960
This year, over one rat themed pizza restaurant will close its doors forever.

3308
02:27:17,320 --> 02:27:21,080
If he's not careful, local pizza maker Rizzo.

3309
02:27:21,560 --> 02:27:26,280
I can't believe it took us this many years to get to Portnoy

3310
02:27:26,280 --> 02:27:31,840
One Bite Pizza Rizzo and Taffer Galactic Star Cruiser Rescue.

3311
02:27:32,320 --> 02:27:33,560
Take a look at these guys.

3312
02:27:33,560 --> 02:27:37,040
These these old men, these two old men,

3313
02:27:37,480 --> 02:27:40,680
they're they're influencers in the theater community.

3314
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:46,440
They if they criticize a live production, it might close its doors forever.

3315
02:27:46,440 --> 02:27:48,240
They make a punny joke about you.

3316
02:27:48,240 --> 02:27:52,040
If they do a single heckle of your restaurant, you're done for.

3317
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:56,120
If Stadler and Wolderf get on Yelp.

3318
02:27:56,120 --> 02:27:59,200
Oh, no, that then.

3319
02:27:59,240 --> 02:28:01,880
If it happened, and maybe then that could be a stand up bit

3320
02:28:02,160 --> 02:28:05,000
worthy of Carrot Top or John Taffer himself.

3321
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:09,400
Well, are we sort of getting to that?

3322
02:28:09,400 --> 02:28:10,960
Has this been ample time?

3323
02:28:10,960 --> 02:28:14,160
One thing I think is funny is that a lot of people woke up

3324
02:28:14,160 --> 02:28:17,800
or whatever that people encountered this episode and went, sorry,

3325
02:28:18,040 --> 02:28:22,080
two and a half hours on the turnstiles.

3326
02:28:22,200 --> 02:28:23,200
Although I think they would.

3327
02:28:23,200 --> 02:28:24,640
I don't know. I don't think they would have been.

3328
02:28:24,640 --> 02:28:26,680
I think they would have gone, let's go.

3329
02:28:26,680 --> 02:28:32,800
I think that's the only note

3330
02:28:32,800 --> 02:28:37,240
I wrote down that I want to hit as a bullet point that I didn't get to to get today.

3331
02:28:37,240 --> 02:28:39,960
And forgive me if this has been covered in a past episode.

3332
02:28:40,960 --> 02:28:43,200
Do we know? Did we know previously

3333
02:28:43,720 --> 02:28:47,160
that he was involved for years with the Rainforest Cafe?

3334
02:28:47,600 --> 02:28:49,240
No, no.

3335
02:28:49,240 --> 02:28:52,120
He threw this out, I think, in the Rob Lowe, because Rob Lowe

3336
02:28:52,120 --> 02:28:55,000
was talking about like the rise and falls of these things where he's like,

3337
02:28:55,160 --> 02:28:57,360
I remember when Hard Rock was actually cool.

3338
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,480
And then now they became this like mainstream thing.

3339
02:29:00,480 --> 02:29:02,480
And he's like, what about Planet Hollywood?

3340
02:29:02,680 --> 02:29:05,160
And Taffer was breaking down the differences in business models

3341
02:29:05,160 --> 02:29:07,000
where he was like Hard Rock when it started

3342
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:09,760
advertised having the best burger in the world.

3343
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:12,280
They actually did have a great burger.

3344
02:29:12,280 --> 02:29:16,080
And then Jimi Hendrix came and he left his guitar because he liked it.

3345
02:29:16,280 --> 02:29:18,240
And that was the first piece of memorabilia they had.

3346
02:29:18,240 --> 02:29:19,960
That's why it happened. That's what he said.

3347
02:29:19,960 --> 02:29:24,640
Wow. Also, Rocky 4 is based on John Taffer's personal life.

3348
02:29:25,080 --> 02:29:29,280
Not just the robot, but the toughness of a great Italian man.

3349
02:29:30,600 --> 02:29:31,920
Yeah, Rocky is me.

3350
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:34,480
Yeah, I met this guy, this failing actor Stallone.

3351
02:29:34,480 --> 02:29:35,760
I said, you know what you should do?

3352
02:29:35,760 --> 02:29:37,600
You should do a story about boxing.

3353
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:40,120
Yeah, but with a heart of gold.

3354
02:29:40,120 --> 02:29:43,160
I texted this to you guys last night that one website says that Taffer,

3355
02:29:43,160 --> 02:29:46,080
the origin of the name is Tavern. Oh, right, right.

3356
02:29:46,080 --> 02:29:50,000
That it's a last name based in the tradition of the Tavern Keeper.

3357
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:53,400
And it's like, I'm going to plant something on on Google

3358
02:29:53,400 --> 02:29:54,960
that maybe people maybe.

3359
02:29:54,960 --> 02:29:58,240
Yeah. But he was saying that was the origin of hard rock.

3360
02:29:58,240 --> 02:30:01,160
And then he was like, and then Robert came in and Planet Hollywood

3361
02:30:01,160 --> 02:30:03,840
was done the opposite way, where it was memorabilia first.

3362
02:30:04,480 --> 02:30:06,400
And then he was like, and then like Rainforest Cafe.

3363
02:30:06,400 --> 02:30:08,920
And he was like, well, I worked with Rainforest Cafe for many years.

3364
02:30:08,920 --> 02:30:10,680
And, you know, it was a silly mob.

3365
02:30:10,680 --> 02:30:11,520
And then he explained it.

3366
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:14,920
This is the other thing I'll say about these podcasts I listen to talking about.

3367
02:30:14,920 --> 02:30:16,440
Is Taffer dumb?

3368
02:30:16,440 --> 02:30:18,840
Does his suggest or his suggestions like stupid?

3369
02:30:18,840 --> 02:30:20,400
Do they not work or whatever?

3370
02:30:20,440 --> 02:30:23,680
I listen to four random podcast episodes and each one of them.

3371
02:30:23,880 --> 02:30:28,440
There was at least one five minute run he went on where I was like,

3372
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:31,360
this is the first time you've actually sounded like you know what you're talking

3373
02:30:31,360 --> 02:30:35,120
about, where he is speaking calmly and getting into like hard data

3374
02:30:35,400 --> 02:30:39,640
and saying concepts I have never heard in over a decade of Bar Rescue.

3375
02:30:40,200 --> 02:30:42,440
Where I'm like, there is something here.

3376
02:30:42,800 --> 02:30:43,720
Yeah. Yeah.

3377
02:30:43,720 --> 02:30:46,680
I was breaking down like the analytics of like, here's what I've learned

3378
02:30:46,680 --> 02:30:49,920
over 40 years of doing this and this and that, and was talking about

3379
02:30:49,920 --> 02:30:53,320
like the margins on drinks in a way where I'm like, I've never heard

3380
02:30:53,320 --> 02:30:55,480
this monologue in an episode.

3381
02:30:55,480 --> 02:30:57,800
And this feels like basic stuff.

3382
02:30:57,800 --> 02:31:01,360
Huh? Well, and there may be something, there may be some disconnect to that,

3383
02:31:01,360 --> 02:31:06,880
like applying like the science that you get of how a Bubba Gumps

3384
02:31:06,880 --> 02:31:11,280
or Rainforest Cafe works to some bar where a guy just wanted to have

3385
02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:13,480
his five sad friends around. Yes.

3386
02:31:13,480 --> 02:31:14,280
That's what I think.

3387
02:31:14,280 --> 02:31:16,800
Where I think it all falls apart is like, we're going to do the stress test.

3388
02:31:16,800 --> 02:31:18,320
We have people at every table.

3389
02:31:18,320 --> 02:31:20,400
They don't want people at every table.

3390
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:23,640
They don't want to be failing, but it's their worst nightmare

3391
02:31:23,640 --> 02:31:26,160
to have a full crowd of people come in.

3392
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:28,560
We cramped 500 people into a clown car.

3393
02:31:29,320 --> 02:31:31,560
If they can't handle this, you should be at business.

3394
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:35,280
But this is my big discovery from like this this bit of a dive,

3395
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:39,440
is that like it sounds like a lot of his resume between the troubadour

3396
02:31:39,760 --> 02:31:44,760
and pulsations and like Bar Rescue was like him having success

3397
02:31:44,800 --> 02:31:48,480
launching bars or clubs and then becoming this high level consultant

3398
02:31:48,480 --> 02:31:51,760
for like these very corporate enterprises that were like,

3399
02:31:51,760 --> 02:31:53,560
how do we make this work? Yeah.

3400
02:31:53,560 --> 02:31:57,560
We know we should have Cheers in an airport or Bubba Gump in a strip mall,

3401
02:31:57,840 --> 02:32:01,080
you know, or like, how do we scale Rainforest Cafe up or whatever?

3402
02:32:01,320 --> 02:32:04,880
And he used like 10 terms I'd never heard before that were kind of interesting

3403
02:32:04,880 --> 02:32:07,760
where he was like, I don't know, he called like an atmosphere packet

3404
02:32:07,760 --> 02:32:09,800
or whatever it was where he was talking about like, well,

3405
02:32:09,800 --> 02:32:11,000
Rainforest had a different model.

3406
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:12,520
It was about this and it was about that.

3407
02:32:12,520 --> 02:32:14,440
And that's how they scaled it up.

3408
02:32:14,440 --> 02:32:16,760
And I was like, all of this is kind of interesting,

3409
02:32:16,760 --> 02:32:20,520
but it also means he's particularly all suited to like a small dive bar

3410
02:32:20,920 --> 02:32:24,320
because the only thing he knows how to turn it into is like something

3411
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:29,120
that could be franchised that is kind of like bland and automated enough

3412
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:30,720
and kind of like refillable.

3413
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:31,920
Mm hmm. I don't know.

3414
02:32:31,920 --> 02:32:34,120
I think the study has has legs.

3415
02:32:34,120 --> 02:32:37,280
I think we're going to be five hundred the studies across the country.

3416
02:32:37,960 --> 02:32:40,080
He's very numbers guy. Yeah.

3417
02:32:40,080 --> 02:32:43,680
So like I'm assuming he has like some sort of I don't even want to call an expert.

3418
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:46,600
Maybe it is an expertise in numbers or something.

3419
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:49,400
He's an aspect. But I would love to hear.

3420
02:32:49,400 --> 02:32:52,240
I've never like he doesn't seem like he overlaps with the Tillman

3421
02:32:52,240 --> 02:32:53,400
for titas of the world.

3422
02:32:53,400 --> 02:32:56,880
No, but yet when he's talking about like turnover at tables

3423
02:32:56,880 --> 02:32:59,880
and trying to like maximize profits and whatever and like this corner

3424
02:32:59,880 --> 02:33:02,840
of the bar should be worth one million dollars a year. Right.

3425
02:33:02,840 --> 02:33:06,920
I'm like, what he's saying makes sense for like Applebee's in Times Square.

3426
02:33:07,080 --> 02:33:08,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3427
02:33:08,560 --> 02:33:11,280
Like perfect sense where I'm like, if I run that,

3428
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:16,280
I call him and go fix my business because it's Applebee's in Times Square.

3429
02:33:16,280 --> 02:33:18,960
You just want this thing to fucking run like a machine.

3430
02:33:18,960 --> 02:33:22,880
It's bad. It's also just the it's it's bad for the world

3431
02:33:22,880 --> 02:33:24,920
to think of everything like that. Yes.

3432
02:33:24,920 --> 02:33:27,640
Yeah, because things are supposed to have character and be odd.

3433
02:33:27,640 --> 02:33:29,640
And like pirates wasn't good.

3434
02:33:29,640 --> 02:33:33,680
But if you applied the logic that wipes pirates of its theme. Right.

3435
02:33:33,880 --> 02:33:38,960
If pirates worked, yes, there would be something actually special about it.

3436
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:40,440
Pirates were 10 percent good.

3437
02:33:40,440 --> 02:33:42,480
It would be our favorite place in America. Right.

3438
02:33:42,480 --> 02:33:44,760
Like the four of us are the target audience.

3439
02:33:44,760 --> 02:33:47,120
Oh, yeah. Even not caring about pirate specific.

3440
02:33:47,120 --> 02:33:48,880
When are the boys going to go to pirates?

3441
02:33:48,880 --> 02:33:49,640
Why haven't they done it?

3442
02:33:49,640 --> 02:33:50,840
Why haven't they got boys?

3443
02:33:50,840 --> 02:33:54,240
If you ever make it to Silver Spring, you've got to do the pirates episode.

3444
02:33:54,240 --> 02:33:58,880
I think Jane said when we were watching, she's like with dimples.

3445
02:33:58,880 --> 02:34:02,520
She's like it had more character before they changed.

3446
02:34:02,560 --> 02:34:04,640
There's the whole thing with it.

3447
02:34:04,680 --> 02:34:09,920
They certainly had to gut it to repair some of the safety issues.

3448
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:14,200
A sound system seemed like it was still from the 1980s, they said.

3449
02:34:14,600 --> 02:34:20,400
But it's like you could have put a little more bric-a-brac in for the charm.

3450
02:34:20,400 --> 02:34:23,320
It didn't all just have to be black vinyl booths.

3451
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:24,600
He doesn't like it.

3452
02:34:24,600 --> 02:34:26,920
He doesn't. The whole thing with pirates, he just didn't like it.

3453
02:34:26,920 --> 02:34:29,840
If anything about him, if anything about that tickled him,

3454
02:34:30,120 --> 02:34:33,240
then he would have been like, because that's an easy theme to kind of do.

3455
02:34:33,400 --> 02:34:36,440
Long John Silver's has been a pirate theme.

3456
02:34:36,440 --> 02:34:39,800
Tell me one example of a successful pirate chain.

3457
02:34:41,040 --> 02:34:43,800
Pirate Disney, I'm sure he would love Pirate's Dinner Adventure.

3458
02:34:43,800 --> 02:34:44,240
He would.

3459
02:34:44,240 --> 02:34:49,440
Oh, and the way the food, the food that they serve and the efficiency

3460
02:34:49,440 --> 02:34:51,600
with which they, I just know it's the sous vide.

3461
02:34:55,960 --> 02:34:56,800
This is the thing, though.

3462
02:34:56,800 --> 02:35:01,200
It's like we're fascinated by Taffer, but a big part of it is that he is so repellent

3463
02:35:01,520 --> 02:35:04,800
and kind of stands as an enemy to the exact type of thing we like.

3464
02:35:04,880 --> 02:35:09,120
Well, he's a representative of everything in culture that, like, it scares us

3465
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:11,440
that I feel like the four of us are always talking about.

3466
02:35:11,440 --> 02:35:14,800
He's a contradiction, though, in some ways, because obviously he appreciates

3467
02:35:15,080 --> 02:35:18,080
imaginary, appreciates Disney and themed shit.

3468
02:35:18,400 --> 02:35:21,640
But he is not able to apply, like to change his thinking

3469
02:35:21,640 --> 02:35:23,560
when it comes to different scenarios.

3470
02:35:23,560 --> 02:35:25,200
He has one single focus.

3471
02:35:25,200 --> 02:35:28,240
So what I'm saying is numbers brain, which is the danger

3472
02:35:28,480 --> 02:35:33,720
of everything fun in this world, is a number brained business moron

3473
02:35:33,920 --> 02:35:37,880
killing all the dumb shit that we love for all the fun in the world.

3474
02:35:37,880 --> 02:35:40,360
Algorithm based entertainment that shouldn't survive.

3475
02:35:40,680 --> 02:35:43,480
He seems to have actual knowledge

3476
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:48,120
and the show is entertaining on like a trashy reality TV level.

3477
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:51,280
And the core of it, I do think, is him like digging into the psychology

3478
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:52,520
of these people. Yeah, yeah.

3479
02:35:52,520 --> 02:35:55,800
And then but then he also does those like

3480
02:35:56,040 --> 02:35:59,960
speaker conventions at a hotel by the airport where it's like

3481
02:36:00,240 --> 02:36:06,160
Condoleezza Rice, General Mathis, John Taffer for small business.

3482
02:36:06,160 --> 02:36:10,240
But I think that's one one of the things that I remember

3483
02:36:10,600 --> 02:36:14,560
of other podcast like I think Matt Christman and someone else

3484
02:36:14,920 --> 02:36:20,280
took mushrooms and then went to like a CPAC thing in Pasadena.

3485
02:36:20,520 --> 02:36:24,520
Yes. Until they were kicked out and they saw like we're sitting in a conference

3486
02:36:25,160 --> 02:36:28,800
like a convention center watching John Taffer talk.

3487
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:30,640
Oh, you're high as balls.

3488
02:36:30,640 --> 02:36:33,160
Oh, yeah. Isn't that that sounds better than anything.

3489
02:36:33,160 --> 02:36:34,960
You can see a Coachella, right?

3490
02:36:34,960 --> 02:36:36,800
Oh, yeah. Festival audience.

3491
02:36:36,800 --> 02:36:38,720
And I was I was fifth row for Taffer.

3492
02:36:38,720 --> 02:36:41,880
Now I'm just imagining Taffer on the Coachella poster.

3493
02:36:41,880 --> 02:36:45,400
Oh, headliner Taffer playing drums.

3494
02:36:45,400 --> 02:36:46,360
Saturday afternoon.

3495
02:36:46,360 --> 02:36:49,240
Oh, does he mean he comes out and just yells at everyone on stage.

3496
02:36:49,720 --> 02:36:51,800
What are you wearing?

3497
02:36:52,240 --> 02:36:54,240
Feathers. That's weird.

3498
02:36:54,880 --> 02:36:56,200
I've got you a new hat.

3499
02:36:56,200 --> 02:36:57,720
It doesn't have any feathers in it.

3500
02:36:57,720 --> 02:36:59,520
And it's better for blocking the sun.

3501
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:05,560
My talk today is called You Do You.

3502
02:37:06,040 --> 02:37:08,320
Everyone write that down.

3503
02:37:08,320 --> 02:37:11,600
Like that lady who just wanted to play her songs and own the building.

3504
02:37:11,880 --> 02:37:14,040
He should have all he should have been like, all right, here's the deal.

3505
02:37:14,320 --> 02:37:17,840
Let's figure out a way where this doesn't sink you financially

3506
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:20,040
and you can play your dumb songs till you die.

3507
02:37:20,080 --> 02:37:23,600
Because the part of like the the thing we joke about of like every bar

3508
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:26,280
gets reverted back to what it was within three weeks

3509
02:37:26,280 --> 02:37:28,360
and then is out of business within four months.

3510
02:37:28,880 --> 02:37:31,840
Is that he goes from one extreme to another where they're like,

3511
02:37:31,840 --> 02:37:33,400
this is why I started the bar.

3512
02:37:33,400 --> 02:37:34,560
This is my emotional story.

3513
02:37:34,560 --> 02:37:35,760
This is why I love it.

3514
02:37:35,760 --> 02:37:38,440
And he's like, throw all of that fucking garbage.

3515
02:37:39,520 --> 02:37:41,760
You need to be worried about making money

3516
02:37:41,960 --> 02:37:46,040
and appealing to the blandest, broadest, like group of people possible.

3517
02:37:46,320 --> 02:37:47,840
And then they revolt against that.

3518
02:37:47,840 --> 02:37:48,560
And you're like, right.

3519
02:37:48,560 --> 02:37:52,760
How do you like split the atom and find a way to make both people happy?

3520
02:37:53,080 --> 02:37:56,880
I feel like there are a couple of episodes I've seen amidst the like 800.

3521
02:37:56,880 --> 02:37:57,280
Right.

3522
02:37:57,280 --> 02:38:00,000
But there's like the one that's like a bar in a trailer.

3523
02:38:00,320 --> 02:38:03,440
And the guy is like they're like safety code violations.

3524
02:38:03,440 --> 02:38:05,440
He does like hillbilly.

3525
02:38:05,440 --> 02:38:08,840
What they call like a hillbilly plumber or some shit,

3526
02:38:09,080 --> 02:38:11,520
where they're like everything's held together with duct tape.

3527
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:13,800
And they're like, this is the charm of the place.

3528
02:38:13,800 --> 02:38:16,080
I'll call violations mold.

3529
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:20,320
And at the end, he like redoes it and is like, I'll make like the Disney

3530
02:38:20,360 --> 02:38:22,760
world version of the character you had before.

3531
02:38:23,080 --> 02:38:26,440
Now, I don't know if that works, because I think the people who go there

3532
02:38:26,440 --> 02:38:31,800
don't want to go see the like in-quote self-parody version of what the bar was

3533
02:38:32,080 --> 02:38:36,040
before. But that was a rare example of him at least trying to keep the thing

3534
02:38:36,040 --> 02:38:37,400
that he liked. Yeah.

3535
02:38:37,400 --> 02:38:40,440
You know, what they've like identified as this is the heart of the place.

3536
02:38:40,440 --> 02:38:43,360
This is why our 10 loyal customers come here.

3537
02:38:43,760 --> 02:38:46,200
And every other place, he's like, the dream has to die.

3538
02:38:46,200 --> 02:38:48,360
You have to shoot it in the head. Yeah.

3539
02:38:48,920 --> 02:38:52,400
Some of that wouldn't work in Philadelphia, because one of the things

3540
02:38:52,840 --> 02:38:57,640
about certain bars in certain neighborhoods, it'll just be a blocker,

3541
02:38:57,640 --> 02:39:00,320
a few blocks of row houses, townhouses.

3542
02:39:00,320 --> 02:39:05,640
Yeah. And the corner house, the bottom floor, the ground floor is a bar.

3543
02:39:05,720 --> 02:39:09,440
Yeah. But that is like basically a wreck through that.

3544
02:39:09,440 --> 02:39:12,800
But do you don't want to try to run that bar like the rain forest cafe?

3545
02:39:12,800 --> 02:39:15,960
I'm afraid you want the same 20 bar flight.

3546
02:39:15,960 --> 02:39:20,280
With Moe's, you basically like he should not try to fix Moe's.

3547
02:39:20,280 --> 02:39:23,440
They're not the most entertaining episodes, but the most effective

3548
02:39:23,440 --> 02:39:27,320
episodes are the ones where he just stumbles onto a poorly run bar.

3549
02:39:27,920 --> 02:39:30,800
Yes. You know, he hasn't tried to change the character.

3550
02:39:30,800 --> 02:39:33,480
Right. Where it's like this bar already has no identity.

3551
02:39:33,560 --> 02:39:35,920
Right. Yeah. And it's just not operating well.

3552
02:39:36,120 --> 02:39:38,160
Yeah. And he's just sort of like, how do I tighten this up?

3553
02:39:38,480 --> 02:39:43,000
It's like because you can't change the core character of things like this.

3554
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:48,280
Like, let's say there was a podcast and maybe the branding of it was kind of

3555
02:39:48,280 --> 02:39:52,440
confusing because it bills itself as a podcast about theme parks.

3556
02:39:52,600 --> 02:39:57,240
But then the character, the heart of it is that all of this other bullshit is

3557
02:39:57,240 --> 02:39:59,120
talked about at extreme length.

3558
02:39:59,360 --> 02:40:04,360
And maybe some corporate person would come in and say, you need to like, you

3559
02:40:04,360 --> 02:40:06,520
should crank this out like an assembly line.

3560
02:40:06,680 --> 02:40:12,360
Right. And you know, to hear talk about a ride and keep the episode to an hour,

3561
02:40:12,360 --> 02:40:13,680
90 minutes or so.

3562
02:40:13,920 --> 02:40:18,480
The last time you were on, there was a gift that didn't come in during the

3563
02:40:18,480 --> 02:40:22,440
episode. I don't know if I said it on the show that the gifts did it ended up

3564
02:40:22,440 --> 02:40:27,320
coming. It became not what it was, not what I suspected, which was a bunch more

3565
02:40:27,320 --> 02:40:30,480
Kingo toys I would never do that for my first son.

3566
02:40:30,480 --> 02:40:32,720
For my second, you sent a bunch of sprites.

3567
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:37,760
You said the exact variety, five of Funko's, five of action figures and five

3568
02:40:37,760 --> 02:40:42,040
key chains of Sprite Sprite is another character from The Eternals.

3569
02:40:42,040 --> 02:40:45,360
Yes. Now I thought Sprite would drive you particularly crazy because Sprite is

3570
02:40:45,360 --> 02:40:48,440
the Peter Pan of The Eternals, the ultimate Peter.

3571
02:40:48,520 --> 02:40:51,320
It's the being a pirate is the ultimate Sprite syndrome.

3572
02:40:51,320 --> 02:40:53,120
She's a little girl who can never grow up.

3573
02:40:53,280 --> 02:40:54,680
This is the creepiest shit.

3574
02:40:54,680 --> 02:40:57,200
And there's like somebody who wants to be with Sprite.

3575
02:40:57,200 --> 02:40:59,680
No, Sprite wants to be with Richard Madden.

3576
02:40:59,680 --> 02:41:04,760
OK, and she has a complex about the fact that Richard Madden will never be with

3577
02:41:04,760 --> 02:41:06,960
her because he doesn't want to look like a pedophile.

3578
02:41:07,800 --> 02:41:11,200
What a wonderful story for a great superhero epic.

3579
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:15,280
And what if he's got this weird kink where he's sexually attracted to women who

3580
02:41:15,280 --> 02:41:19,040
look like adults and thus Sprite is always heartbroken.

3581
02:41:19,080 --> 02:41:20,720
This is how this narrative plays out.

3582
02:41:21,520 --> 02:41:28,440
She sees him kissing Gemma Chan and gets angry and almost becomes bad out of revolt.

3583
02:41:28,600 --> 02:41:29,360
Wow. Yeah.

3584
02:41:29,400 --> 02:41:32,640
So what if there was this this kind of creepy element to the story?

3585
02:41:32,640 --> 02:41:36,200
Yeah. And on top of it, it was the boringest movie ever made.

3586
02:41:36,920 --> 02:41:40,280
So anyway, I but I did want to thank you for that for that gift for my second son.

3587
02:41:40,280 --> 02:41:42,560
And I also it we've been recording a while.

3588
02:41:42,560 --> 02:41:43,960
It's getting a little hot in here.

3589
02:41:43,960 --> 02:41:45,400
Here we go. And I wanted to.

3590
02:41:45,400 --> 02:41:48,040
Oh, look at that. Oh, I happen to be wearing.

3591
02:41:48,080 --> 02:41:52,200
Yeah. Something from Griffin's second round of gifts.

3592
02:41:52,200 --> 02:41:56,480
The website Boxlaunch connected to Boxlaunch.com, connected to the chain of

3593
02:41:56,480 --> 02:41:58,120
mall, mostly mall based stores.

3594
02:41:58,120 --> 02:42:00,920
Oh, yes. It's having a sale on some other items I wanted.

3595
02:42:01,240 --> 02:42:04,000
And I was trying to hit like some some free shipping minimums.

3596
02:42:04,040 --> 02:42:05,880
Yeah, of course. I was like, what else do they have that I maybe want?

3597
02:42:05,880 --> 02:42:09,920
I was just doing, you know, I do that keyword searches for brands.

3598
02:42:09,920 --> 02:42:11,920
I like my favorite IP. Yeah.

3599
02:42:11,920 --> 02:42:14,880
And I was like, do they have any deep discount Eternals merch?

3600
02:42:15,240 --> 02:42:20,080
And what I found is specifically that they sell two different kinds

3601
02:42:20,080 --> 02:42:22,600
of Sprite and Kingo shirts. Sprite.

3602
02:42:22,640 --> 02:42:24,040
And yes, we should say that's the shirt.

3603
02:42:24,040 --> 02:42:25,880
It is Sprite and Kingo together.

3604
02:42:25,880 --> 02:42:26,920
I can't really say.

3605
02:42:26,920 --> 02:42:29,120
Yeah. Only the two characters that I have.

3606
02:42:29,120 --> 02:42:30,360
Oh, great. Great.

3607
02:42:30,360 --> 02:42:32,240
Scott's children with the character. Yes.

3608
02:42:32,240 --> 02:42:35,680
But you have decided that my oldest is a Kingo kid

3609
02:42:35,960 --> 02:42:37,640
and my youngest is a Sprite kid.

3610
02:42:37,640 --> 02:42:38,920
And that's how it will be. Yeah.

3611
02:42:38,920 --> 02:42:43,640
But you were also kind enough to make this a a a pair shirt.

3612
02:42:43,640 --> 02:42:48,120
You got a pretty matching child coordination shirts, coordination

3613
02:42:48,640 --> 02:42:51,600
so that I could have one and so that my son could have one.

3614
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:54,440
So here a photo from earlier today.

3615
02:42:54,440 --> 02:42:55,920
But a different Sprite and Kingo.

3616
02:42:55,920 --> 02:42:59,520
Yes, a totally different shirt, but still with Sprite and with Kingo

3617
02:42:59,520 --> 02:43:02,560
on the same sides, there is one for my oldest son.

3618
02:43:02,560 --> 02:43:04,000
And I am wearing one as well.

3619
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,320
And then there's an entire other one that's like the like

3620
02:43:06,440 --> 02:43:10,440
it's like the magical patterns of goo is a costume shirt.

3621
02:43:10,440 --> 02:43:14,400
They are shirts that represent really uniform.

3622
02:43:14,640 --> 02:43:16,920
Oh, wow. Famous Eternals

3623
02:43:17,520 --> 02:43:20,160
fucking space garbage that's on their uniforms.

3624
02:43:20,160 --> 02:43:23,720
So there's a you can be Sprite and Kingo. Wow.

3625
02:43:24,040 --> 02:43:27,440
I don't think that my oldest even knows that there is more that there

3626
02:43:27,440 --> 02:43:30,280
is there are more Kingo shirts available.

3627
02:43:30,960 --> 02:43:35,680
But yeah, we will get to go out and be the envy of all the dads and kids in town.

3628
02:43:35,920 --> 02:43:37,560
I forgot I did.

3629
02:43:37,560 --> 02:43:39,120
I forget if I ruined it.

3630
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:42,880
But when you said I didn't know about it, but when you said

3631
02:43:42,880 --> 02:43:47,720
there's a new package coming, I pulled up all the eternal action figures.

3632
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:52,440
And I was like, I in my head, I may have texted him.

3633
02:43:52,440 --> 02:43:56,160
I was like, I will bet a hundred dollars that he picked Sprite.

3634
02:43:56,160 --> 02:43:57,120
You got it right.

3635
02:43:57,120 --> 02:44:01,640
Yeah, which is the only way I was possibly previously familiar with Sprite.

3636
02:44:02,560 --> 02:44:03,880
But now I am. Thank you.

3637
02:44:03,880 --> 02:44:06,360
Mike and I did some back and forth because I was like,

3638
02:44:06,360 --> 02:44:08,080
is Fastos the second funniest?

3639
02:44:08,080 --> 02:44:12,560
But Fastos doesn't come in the the pocket pop keychain form factor.

3640
02:44:12,560 --> 02:44:14,560
That was a big, big role.

3641
02:44:14,560 --> 02:44:17,760
It has to be a character that fits into these pre-established patterns

3642
02:44:17,760 --> 02:44:18,680
with the Kingo.

3643
02:44:18,680 --> 02:44:22,520
And then I was like, I could do Crow, the evil deviant.

3644
02:44:23,120 --> 02:44:26,440
But Mike agreed that it might be too scary for your children.

3645
02:44:26,480 --> 02:44:27,200
You don't want that.

3646
02:44:27,200 --> 02:44:28,200
Yeah, no, no.

3647
02:44:28,200 --> 02:44:33,000
I want a story that everybody can get behind, like a eternal girl

3648
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,080
who wants to have sex with a man.

3649
02:44:35,080 --> 02:44:37,120
Something great for my baby.

3650
02:44:37,120 --> 02:44:39,480
Yeah, to be a lot more appropriate.

3651
02:44:39,480 --> 02:44:41,480
Start the world thinking about.

3652
02:44:41,480 --> 02:44:45,440
And I also I believe to make this a mega episode,

3653
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:48,040
I don't think that's the final reveal.

3654
02:44:48,360 --> 02:44:51,160
Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, if here's the thing,

3655
02:44:52,280 --> 02:44:54,840
Griffin, I have your Galactic Star Cruiser toy right here.

3656
02:44:54,840 --> 02:44:56,000
Amazing. You mean yours?

3657
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,080
Wait, not Galactic Star Cruiser. Yeah.

3658
02:44:58,080 --> 02:44:59,200
Yeah. Yes.

3659
02:44:59,200 --> 02:45:00,800
Yes. You got the names wrong.

3660
02:45:00,800 --> 02:45:02,280
Star Speeder is right here.

3661
02:45:02,280 --> 02:45:03,640
It's so much bigger than I thought it was.

3662
02:45:03,640 --> 02:45:04,640
It's giant.

3663
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:05,640
About three feet tall.

3664
02:45:05,640 --> 02:45:07,240
How are you going to transport that?

3665
02:45:07,240 --> 02:45:10,840
I brought extra empty luggage from D23 to get this back home.

3666
02:45:10,840 --> 02:45:12,600
And I'm still going to have to do some adjusting.

3667
02:45:12,600 --> 02:45:14,480
You listener, you this is so huge.

3668
02:45:14,480 --> 02:45:17,480
And it's also what I think now what's happened is that it's like

3669
02:45:17,480 --> 02:45:19,800
you put it perfectly in a place where I can't see Jason.

3670
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:20,840
Right. It's massive.

3671
02:45:20,840 --> 02:45:22,120
More than blocks Jason.

3672
02:45:22,120 --> 02:45:23,040
And there's a whole discussion

3673
02:45:23,040 --> 02:45:26,440
that's going to have to happen off the air because we I have pulled

3674
02:45:26,440 --> 02:45:29,080
the carded Rex out of the box

3675
02:45:29,880 --> 02:45:33,400
because it was we were going to try to just put it on eBay

3676
02:45:33,400 --> 02:45:34,800
and recoup some of the cost.

3677
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:36,760
But then it's a carded and a loose.

3678
02:45:36,760 --> 02:45:38,640
There's a loose Rex in there, which is the same one.

3679
02:45:38,640 --> 02:45:40,240
But this is a carded Rex.

3680
02:45:40,240 --> 02:45:42,880
And we have to have a whole debate off the air of what we're going to do

3681
02:45:42,880 --> 02:45:45,400
about this. Maybe nothing.

3682
02:45:45,400 --> 02:45:49,280
But I also want to say that I have gotten everyone a gift.

3683
02:45:49,280 --> 02:45:50,960
What? Same gift.

3684
02:45:50,960 --> 02:45:54,080
And maybe Griffin has this already and it's sort of redundant.

3685
02:45:54,080 --> 02:45:56,240
But I just wanted to make sure that there was a character

3686
02:45:56,280 --> 02:45:59,280
you could put in to the Starspeeder immediately.

3687
02:45:59,360 --> 02:46:00,720
OK, where are we going?

3688
02:46:00,720 --> 02:46:03,800
Sitting on this for about a year, maybe a year.

3689
02:46:03,800 --> 02:46:05,720
This actually just lined up perfectly.

3690
02:46:05,720 --> 02:46:09,800
I have a guess what I am going to give everyone a Miles Quaradge

3691
02:46:10,080 --> 02:46:11,440
Oh, my God.

3692
02:46:11,440 --> 02:46:13,240
From Avatar. Wow.

3693
02:46:13,240 --> 02:46:14,440
Everyone got them.

3694
02:46:14,440 --> 02:46:17,760
They were on a nice discount on Best Buy dot com.

3695
02:46:17,760 --> 02:46:19,920
OK, I got to stand that.

3696
02:46:19,920 --> 02:46:21,800
You can hand one to Griffin.

3697
02:46:21,800 --> 02:46:25,240
And of course, you see, he comes with his trademark cup of coffee. Right.

3698
02:46:25,240 --> 02:46:28,240
And he fits. I already he's already in my this perfect scale.

3699
02:46:28,240 --> 02:46:30,480
He's already in my Starspeeder, because the problem is,

3700
02:46:30,800 --> 02:46:33,360
is that you need something in a specific scale because the seat

3701
02:46:33,360 --> 02:46:36,360
there are the exact amount of seats in this toy that there are

3702
02:46:36,360 --> 02:46:38,280
on the actual Star Tours ride.

3703
02:46:38,280 --> 02:46:42,160
But you need toys at this scale with knees that bend.

3704
02:46:42,160 --> 02:46:45,320
Yeah, it's very important because some of the different toys

3705
02:46:45,320 --> 02:46:47,400
I have that are this size don't have bendable knees.

3706
02:46:47,400 --> 02:46:48,720
You can't use reactions.

3707
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:51,560
You've got to go can't unless it's power force to these knees.

3708
02:46:51,560 --> 02:46:52,920
Look at these. Look at these.

3709
02:46:52,920 --> 02:46:54,240
They can't even bend.

3710
02:46:54,240 --> 02:46:55,720
What kind of figure is that?

3711
02:46:55,720 --> 02:46:56,360
Well, I'll say it.

3712
02:46:56,360 --> 02:47:00,240
So Mike and I were very invested in trying to get the Starspeeder

3713
02:47:00,240 --> 02:47:02,760
when they went up very quickly on the Disney store site.

3714
02:47:02,760 --> 02:47:05,560
And I had a fancy one with the script where it plays the ride.

3715
02:47:05,560 --> 02:47:08,080
It was very limited and went like super fast.

3716
02:47:08,080 --> 02:47:11,440
We were waiting on line online for like a fucking hour.

3717
02:47:11,440 --> 02:47:14,680
Yeah. And then I found a hack that I thought would maybe help me get one.

3718
02:47:14,920 --> 02:47:16,960
And it didn't work for me, but it worked for Mike.

3719
02:47:16,960 --> 02:47:18,920
But Mike had also bid on one on eBay.

3720
02:47:18,920 --> 02:47:20,520
So and then this is the extra one he had,

3721
02:47:20,520 --> 02:47:22,720
which he'd been holding for me for a while now.

3722
02:47:22,720 --> 02:47:25,480
I similarly at New York Comic Con at your request.

3723
02:47:25,480 --> 02:47:26,200
Yes, of course.

3724
02:47:26,200 --> 02:47:29,760
Got you an action figure of Kevin Eastman, co-creator of Ninja Turtles.

3725
02:47:29,800 --> 02:47:34,600
So dressed as a garbage man from a deleted scene of the first live action movie,

3726
02:47:34,960 --> 02:47:39,400
but included in here also from New York Comic Con are a pack of blues.

3727
02:47:39,600 --> 02:47:41,080
The mascot of Thrilljoy.

3728
02:47:41,080 --> 02:47:41,960
Oh, wow.

3729
02:47:41,960 --> 02:47:42,960
Well, we haven't even talked about that.

3730
02:47:42,960 --> 02:47:46,120
I met Brian Marriotti, the former CEO of Funko.

3731
02:47:46,120 --> 02:47:47,080
We got Marriotti stuff.

3732
02:47:47,080 --> 02:47:48,480
Mike likes blue.

3733
02:47:48,480 --> 02:47:50,600
Mike thinks blue is cute.

3734
02:47:50,600 --> 02:47:53,000
I think this new mascot character, blue is cute.

3735
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:54,720
But then here's an extra bonus.

3736
02:47:54,720 --> 02:47:59,160
I bought some other bullshit on eBay recently, and because I bought enough of his stuff,

3737
02:47:59,440 --> 02:48:04,800
the eBay seller threw in a mass amount of Batman Forever PVC.

3738
02:48:05,440 --> 02:48:08,200
So I think I have two Kilmers and two Chris O'Donnells in here.

3739
02:48:08,200 --> 02:48:08,720
Oh, wow.

3740
02:48:08,720 --> 02:48:11,320
This is a little a little gift bag for Mike.

3741
02:48:11,480 --> 02:48:15,080
Well, I mean, if they're the same as Batman, I mean, I can I can spread the joy,

3742
02:48:15,080 --> 02:48:17,240
the thrill joy around of.

3743
02:48:17,240 --> 02:48:19,760
Jason, I've been I've been hinting for a long time.

3744
02:48:19,760 --> 02:48:21,640
I have a thing I've been trying to get to you.

3745
02:48:21,640 --> 02:48:24,400
Logistically, it's been a little difficult to make sure.

3746
02:48:24,400 --> 02:48:28,400
And it's not from the dollhouse museum that you said you were stopping at.

3747
02:48:28,400 --> 02:48:29,920
It's not which I did stop at.

3748
02:48:29,920 --> 02:48:33,200
OK, I woke up this morning in Santa Barbara, made a quick stop at the dollhouse,

3749
02:48:33,200 --> 02:48:34,320
the Teddy Bear and Doll Museum.

3750
02:48:34,320 --> 02:48:35,360
That's pretty excellent.

3751
02:48:35,360 --> 02:48:39,760
Wow. A big discovery I found there, Mike, that I think I need to put on your radar

3752
02:48:39,760 --> 02:48:42,240
if I can take the pin out of puppets from. Oh, right.

3753
02:48:42,960 --> 02:48:44,040
Oh, my God.

3754
02:48:44,040 --> 02:48:47,120
You know, we are at almost three hours as you know, we're approaching three hours.

3755
02:48:47,280 --> 02:48:51,120
Sherry Lewis doll, the doll of the woman, Sherry.

3756
02:48:51,120 --> 02:48:55,920
Correct. Mass produced was on a shelf with Buffalo Bob from Howdy Doody,

3757
02:48:55,920 --> 02:48:59,720
who I know was not strictly the puppeteer of Howdy Doody.

3758
02:48:59,960 --> 02:49:04,640
But I am now like, is there a entire sub universe

3759
02:49:04,880 --> 02:49:08,560
of merchandise of the people behind the ventriloquist?

3760
02:49:08,560 --> 02:49:14,040
Because it was above ventriloquist shelf, which had it did not have a Knucklehead

3761
02:49:14,040 --> 02:49:16,920
Smith, sadly, but it did have a Charlie McCarthy.

3762
02:49:17,040 --> 02:49:19,400
OK, it had a he was more and more snared.

3763
02:49:19,520 --> 02:49:21,080
Why would they not make a Jerry Mahoney?

3764
02:49:21,080 --> 02:49:23,480
That's a reference people are making all the time.

3765
02:49:23,480 --> 02:49:24,440
I did have a German.

3766
02:49:24,440 --> 02:49:26,480
I was like, where's the Hector Bergdahl?

3767
02:49:26,480 --> 02:49:27,320
Where's the Hector Bergdahl?

3768
02:49:27,320 --> 02:49:30,600
But I just I now know there's a Buffalo Bob and a Sherry Lewis.

3769
02:49:30,640 --> 02:49:32,080
Interesting. What does it look like?

3770
02:49:32,080 --> 02:49:34,840
Doll that says Little Sherry.

3771
02:49:34,840 --> 02:49:36,640
Is she like a baby?

3772
02:49:36,640 --> 02:49:41,160
It's just a little Sherry, the same size as a really got to find little Sherry.

3773
02:49:41,160 --> 02:49:42,280
Little Sherry.

3774
02:49:42,280 --> 02:49:44,120
I actually have a topic next month.

3775
02:49:44,120 --> 02:49:46,160
I had to introduce a little Sherry.

3776
02:49:46,160 --> 02:49:48,080
Enjoy your five percent, little Sherry.

3777
02:49:48,080 --> 02:49:48,720
No, madam.

3778
02:49:48,720 --> 02:49:52,160
Fine. No, I actually have packed a peanut butter and jelly,

3779
02:49:52,160 --> 02:49:55,240
knowing this would happen today, and I am looking forward to eating it

3780
02:49:55,240 --> 02:49:58,080
because I am running it as the let's do it.

3781
02:49:58,080 --> 02:49:59,080
So, Jason, let's wrap it up.

3782
02:49:59,080 --> 02:50:00,880
Wait, Griffin's a guest.

3783
02:50:00,880 --> 02:50:02,040
What do you got? Final reveal.

3784
02:50:02,040 --> 02:50:04,920
OK, so I think it was a year or two ago.

3785
02:50:05,280 --> 02:50:09,080
It was after I'd done the first Kingo drop of the mass amounts of

3786
02:50:10,040 --> 02:50:13,280
where Mike bought you a creepy,

3787
02:50:13,280 --> 02:50:17,400
stylized Japanese toy of director rock and tour.

3788
02:50:17,600 --> 02:50:20,440
Kevin Smith, a posket, I believe it was called.

3789
02:50:20,440 --> 02:50:21,240
Yep. Yeah.

3790
02:50:21,240 --> 02:50:24,080
And on my key invoked me to say, now Griffin has a tendency,

3791
02:50:24,080 --> 02:50:27,720
our friend Griffin, to sometimes buy multiples of an item.

3792
02:50:27,760 --> 02:50:30,640
Oh, no. Perhaps this will encourage him to buy multiples.

3793
02:50:31,160 --> 02:50:33,080
And I originally that was my plan.

3794
02:50:33,080 --> 02:50:34,520
Going to buy several of these at discount.

3795
02:50:34,520 --> 02:50:36,480
OK, and just bombard you with Kevin Smith.

3796
02:50:37,440 --> 02:50:40,640
And then I was like, is there a more meaningful thing I can do here?

3797
02:50:40,960 --> 02:50:43,640
And it took a little while logistically to make happen.

3798
02:50:43,840 --> 02:50:47,880
But especially you've had a year or two of high highs and low lows.

3799
02:50:47,880 --> 02:50:49,440
Yeah. I owe you multiple.

3800
02:50:49,440 --> 02:50:51,920
I've been feeling like it's been building of like,

3801
02:50:51,920 --> 02:50:53,840
I need to give you something meaningful,

3802
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:56,600
both in commiseration and celebration and everything.

3803
02:50:56,920 --> 02:51:01,200
So this is a cute posket signed by Kevin Smith.

3804
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:04,320
Oh, my God. Now, here is the funny part of this.

3805
02:51:04,760 --> 02:51:08,880
We I kept trying to get in person interactions with him.

3806
02:51:08,880 --> 02:51:11,520
He was supposed to do the podcast in studio a couple of times.

3807
02:51:11,760 --> 02:51:14,600
Then one time I was out here and I saw him, but I forgot to pack it.

3808
02:51:14,800 --> 02:51:17,360
It kept not lining up at the last second.

3809
02:51:17,640 --> 02:51:21,280
And then we did George Lucas talk show at his theater in New Jersey.

3810
02:51:21,680 --> 02:51:24,120
And as I was changing out of the Watto costume

3811
02:51:24,120 --> 02:51:26,680
and I knew he was going to run off quickly, I was like,

3812
02:51:26,680 --> 02:51:28,280
I forgot to get him to sign this.

3813
02:51:28,280 --> 02:51:31,480
Patrick, can you go give this to him and get him to sign it?

3814
02:51:31,680 --> 02:51:33,880
And he went sure. And he brought it back.

3815
02:51:33,880 --> 02:51:35,160
And so it is signed.

3816
02:51:35,160 --> 02:51:38,200
I heart you, Kevin Smith.

3817
02:51:38,200 --> 02:51:40,200
I saw. I love it.

3818
02:51:40,200 --> 02:51:41,680
Which I didn't say it's for me.

3819
02:51:41,680 --> 02:51:42,680
I didn't say it's for you.

3820
02:51:42,680 --> 02:51:44,240
But I think the message translates.

3821
02:51:44,240 --> 02:51:47,040
We all heart you, Kevin Smith, most of all. Right.

3822
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:48,960
Wow. That's really beautiful.

3823
02:51:48,960 --> 02:51:52,040
Yeah. Well, Jason, let Kevin Smith's love of you,

3824
02:51:52,040 --> 02:51:55,000
his heart of you, resonate

3825
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:56,600
and power you through stuff.

3826
02:51:56,600 --> 02:51:58,200
That's beautiful. My God.

3827
02:51:58,200 --> 02:52:01,440
Now I just need to get him to sign 10 more of them.

3828
02:52:01,520 --> 02:52:03,000
Oh, where are those?

3829
02:52:04,400 --> 02:52:06,640
Wow. Geez, a massive.

3830
02:52:06,640 --> 02:52:08,440
There's never been more on the table.

3831
02:52:08,440 --> 02:52:10,000
I mean, this is a gigantic box.

3832
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:11,280
Yeah. What are you going to do with this?

3833
02:52:11,280 --> 02:52:13,120
I don't know. I really want you guys to see it,

3834
02:52:13,120 --> 02:52:15,360
but we can't do that on the air.

3835
02:52:15,360 --> 02:52:17,600
Oh, the I want you to see what looks because you guys

3836
02:52:17,600 --> 02:52:18,640
have not come over and seen the.

3837
02:52:18,640 --> 02:52:20,480
No, no, no, we haven't.

3838
02:52:20,480 --> 02:52:21,840
We haven't been invited.

3839
02:52:21,840 --> 02:52:23,880
Well, that's our speeder party. That's true.

3840
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:27,040
Yeah. No, the scale is massive.

3841
02:52:27,040 --> 02:52:29,080
We'll post photos of it.

3842
02:52:29,080 --> 02:52:32,480
But Griffin, the greatest gift that you gave us

3843
02:52:32,480 --> 02:52:35,680
was coming in here, veering us off topic

3844
02:52:35,680 --> 02:52:38,960
in an original Star Tours kind of way and sending us

3845
02:52:38,960 --> 02:52:42,480
on a much more entertaining adventure full of twists

3846
02:52:42,480 --> 02:52:45,400
and turns through the world of Taffer one.

3847
02:52:45,400 --> 02:52:48,040
An adventure that's just beginning.

3848
02:52:48,040 --> 02:52:49,720
I mean, we've already referred to nine,

3849
02:52:49,720 --> 02:52:52,160
which is the amount of the original Star Wars.

3850
02:52:52,160 --> 02:52:55,240
Yeah. So we'll at least get to nine, you know,

3851
02:52:55,240 --> 02:52:57,760
and then we'll end up with our Rogue Ones and our solos.

3852
02:52:58,400 --> 02:53:00,520
Taffer side stories. Yeah, yeah.

3853
02:53:00,520 --> 02:53:01,280
I'm looking forward to all of it.

3854
02:53:01,280 --> 02:53:03,640
But I guess for now, my God, Griffin Newman,

3855
02:53:03,640 --> 02:53:05,960
you survived podcast The Ride.

3856
02:53:05,960 --> 02:53:07,640
What a time. Exit to the gift shop.

3857
02:53:07,640 --> 02:53:09,960
Any energy left in which to plug anything?

3858
02:53:09,960 --> 02:53:11,160
Blank check.

3859
02:53:11,160 --> 02:53:13,480
Podcasts, Griffin and David were doing a miniseries

3860
02:53:13,480 --> 02:53:15,480
on Steven Spielberg right now.

3861
02:53:15,480 --> 02:53:17,960
Followed up by a miniseries on the work of Jon Taffer.

3862
02:53:17,960 --> 02:53:18,960
You're also doing it.

3863
02:53:18,960 --> 02:53:20,280
You're going through episode by episode.

3864
02:53:20,280 --> 02:53:23,280
Yes, I'm treating him as an auteur of bars.

3865
02:53:23,280 --> 02:53:26,120
We're shifting our format a little bit.

3866
02:53:26,200 --> 02:53:29,120
We have an episode in the planning stages.

3867
02:53:29,120 --> 02:53:32,200
In theory, that would be a PTR-BC crossover

3868
02:53:33,640 --> 02:53:35,440
that hopefully will happen soon.

3869
02:53:35,440 --> 02:53:37,840
We've got to figure out some of the logistics of it.

3870
02:53:37,840 --> 02:53:40,680
Also, years ago on this podcast,

3871
02:53:40,680 --> 02:53:43,720
I mentioned that there was a movie I got cast in,

3872
02:53:43,720 --> 02:53:47,320
largely because the director was a listener of this show.

3873
02:53:47,320 --> 02:53:48,360
Yeah, indeed.

3874
02:53:48,360 --> 02:53:51,160
The great Michael Taberski, who then I went to,

3875
02:53:51,160 --> 02:53:55,080
it premiered at a film festival in Europe last fall.

3876
02:53:55,080 --> 02:53:57,040
So then we went to Disneyland Paris together

3877
02:53:57,040 --> 02:53:59,520
and had this very nice full circle,

3878
02:53:59,520 --> 02:54:02,400
we're getting to go to a theme park together moment.

3879
02:54:02,400 --> 02:54:06,840
Anyway, this movie got released on VOD

3880
02:54:06,840 --> 02:54:08,960
very suddenly without much advanced warning.

3881
02:54:08,960 --> 02:54:09,800
Oh, sure.

3882
02:54:09,800 --> 02:54:11,200
That sounds like how things go, yes.

3883
02:54:11,200 --> 02:54:12,360
Very much the state of the industry,

3884
02:54:12,360 --> 02:54:14,200
but we're trying to do ketchup, promoting it now.

3885
02:54:14,200 --> 02:54:16,560
So it's called Turn Me On.

3886
02:54:16,560 --> 02:54:18,360
It's Bell Powley and Nick Robinson are the leads,

3887
02:54:18,360 --> 02:54:20,120
but a bunch of comedy people like Darcy Carden

3888
02:54:20,120 --> 02:54:21,640
and Patty Harrison are also up in it.

3889
02:54:21,640 --> 02:54:23,800
Julie Shiplett, who's a great standup.

3890
02:54:23,800 --> 02:54:28,400
And it's like a dystopian sci-fi relationship satire thing.

3891
02:54:28,400 --> 02:54:29,240
Oh, wow.

3892
02:54:29,240 --> 02:54:30,080
It's rentable in most places.

3893
02:54:30,080 --> 02:54:32,160
And half the length of this episode?

3894
02:54:32,160 --> 02:54:33,920
It's, yeah, just half.

3895
02:54:33,920 --> 02:54:34,760
Okay.

3896
02:54:34,760 --> 02:54:35,600
I think it's pretty close to 90.

3897
02:54:35,600 --> 02:54:36,720
It'll go down, it'll go down a smooth level,

3898
02:54:36,720 --> 02:54:37,560
less challenging work.

3899
02:54:37,560 --> 02:54:41,360
We don't like things if they're not three hours.

3900
02:54:41,360 --> 02:54:44,680
Three hours and a threatened part one of nine.

3901
02:54:44,680 --> 02:54:45,520
Okay.

3902
02:54:45,520 --> 02:54:48,320
Well, it's really, it's, I mean,

3903
02:54:48,320 --> 02:54:50,440
it's less our Star Wars and more our Avatar,

3904
02:54:50,440 --> 02:54:52,440
with the run times, with the,

3905
02:54:52,440 --> 02:54:55,280
now it's just on us to release them, you know,

3906
02:54:55,280 --> 02:54:58,440
with a better pace than, you know,

3907
02:54:58,440 --> 02:55:00,360
to not have the amount of time between

3908
02:55:00,360 --> 02:55:01,680
Fire and Ash. Fire and Ash.

3909
02:55:01,680 --> 02:55:02,680
Yeah, yeah. Fire and Ash.

3910
02:55:02,680 --> 02:55:06,040
Yeah, God, we really gotta put a pin in Pelak.

3911
02:55:06,040 --> 02:55:07,160
Pelak the Wind Traitor.

3912
02:55:07,160 --> 02:55:08,000
Oh, my God.

3913
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,040
We don't have time. We gotta get out the door.

3914
02:55:10,040 --> 02:55:13,600

the right, I found the guy who suggested it,

3920
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:26,320
Jordan Kegel.

3921
02:55:26,320 --> 02:55:27,400
There you go, Jordan.

3922
02:55:27,400 --> 02:55:28,720
Two years later.

3923
02:55:28,720 --> 02:55:30,800
Are you happy now?

3924
02:55:30,800 --> 02:55:31,640
You better be.
