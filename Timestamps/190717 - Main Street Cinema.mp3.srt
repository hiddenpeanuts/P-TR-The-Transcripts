1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,720
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate, presented today in dazzling color.

3
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,720
Come in and see comedy, adventure, pathos, comedy again.

4
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,720
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Jason Sheridan and Mike Carlson.

5
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,720
We are in color, today's attraction is not.

6
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,720
Oh wait, yeah, I guess they aren't in color.

7
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,720
The thing that I said is not applicable.

8
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,720
Some of the shorts things were in color, right?

9
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,720
They were, but decolorized for this attraction. I believe all black and white.

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,720
Is that right? They changed it back to black and white to make it fit better?

11
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,720
I think everything, I was in there a couple months ago and I thought they were all black and white.

12
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,720
I could be wrong, but I feel like what I read online was like this is in color, but it's in black and white in this attraction.

13
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,720
Well, you immediately have a question about the attraction we're doing today.

14
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,720
Something we don't know, but that is the Main Street Cinema, a mainstay since opening day.

15
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,720
Opening day, and if you're listening to this, the day that it comes out, hey check the date on your calendar or on your phone.

16
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,720
It's July 17th, that is Disney opening day.

17
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,720
Disneyland opened 64 years ago today, which is why we wanted to do something from opening day.

18
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,720
And this was an opening day attraction on Main Street.

19
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,720
But you know what, it's recently relevant.

20
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:51,720
It has been in the news, it has been an absolute firestorm, impossible to avoid the controversy.

21
00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:00,720
This location, it's one of the only things on Main Street that is not a shop.

22
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:11,720
And in June, well, let me read how it was said on our good friends WDW News Today.

23
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,720
Here's how they put it.

24
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,720
They seemingly held out as long as they could.

25
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,720
While Walt Disney World's Main Street Cinema was converted into a store all the way back in 1998,

26
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,720
it seemed like Disneyland would never pull the trigger on the conversion of their 1955 staple.

27
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,720
Well under the Bob Chapek administration, you never say never.

28
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
That's right, it happened.

29
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,720
Disneyland's Main Street Cinema is a shop.

30
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,720
Yeah, it's a shop. My boy's a shop.

31
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,720
My dearest Rebecca, war is hell. I fear I shall never gaze upon your face again.

32
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,720
The picture of show has become a shoppery.

33
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:02,720
My six beloved screens remain, but also some plushes are being sold in front of them.

34
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,720
Some generic, like the pictures.

35
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,720
Mickey and his American flag, thick sweatshirt is now set up in front of one of the old movies.

36
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,720
Some really, really generic shit, like from what I saw in the pictures.

37
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Like the stuff they sell at the exits or in Florida they sell in the airport store of like, oh fuck, I forgot to get so and so something.

38
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,720
Big jacket that says Disneyland on it.

39
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
Big jacket, Disneyland, 2019 baby.

40
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
Stuff that could be counterfeit.

41
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
Stuff that could be counterfeited.

42
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:44,720
So this, in June last month, the Main Street Cinema became a store, which I was like, yeah, didn't this happen already?

43
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
And I guess that's what I was thinking of, was Disney World.

44
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Disney World.

45
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
It's been a store for a while, but they still play the movies inside.

46
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,720
And it happened here, and people, the internet got really, really mad, and then they undid it.

47
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,720
So like a week later, it is now not a store.

48
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
For now, yeah.

49
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
For now.

50
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:14,720
Yeah, people, they tend to make changes, if the public outcry happens, they tend to make more changes quicker here in Disneyland, because there's so many locals.

51
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:22,720
This is though, this is an example of this weird theme park Twitter, where everybody has a different take.

52
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
I mean, this is also just Twitter.

53
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
Everybody has a different take.

54
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Everybody rushes to judge everything, but then everyone is looking for like their own unique take.

55
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:38,720
So people were like, wow, Disney bowed to the pressure of the fans with their outcry about, oh, don't turn this into a shop.

56
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,720
Then there's some people going, you think Disney listens to any of us?

57
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
No way.

58
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
They're just testing stuff out.

59
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
It must not have been a success.

60
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,720
That's the only reason they removed stuff.

61
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,720
So there's be like, some people, they don't even think the outcry is why.

62
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,720
Yeah.

63
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,720
They just like maybe weren't moving merchandise and that's why they got pulled.

64
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
Who knows?

65
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:04,720
They did swing the other way because now there are benches inside so you can sit and watch the movies before there just used to be a slightly elevated platform.

66
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,720
Which I'm sure everyone is upset on Twitter will go and do.

67
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:19,720
Everyone will do our beloved activity of sitting and watching each and every of the six films playing simultaneously.

68
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
I don't.

69
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Who cares?

70
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
This is one where I'm like, who cares?

71
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,720
I guess I'm happy they aren't selling merch now, but was I mad?

72
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
No.

73
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
Does it change my life?

74
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
I mean, I like it.

75
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,720
I'm prone to go in for a few minutes, but I won't.

76
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
Absolutely.

77
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,720
This is the way a human being should be.

78
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Yeah, I am more.

79
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:44,720
I am the one probably in most outings to Disney and various groups to go like, yeah, we go Main Street.

80
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
So yeah, I'd watch Lincoln.

81
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
Mm hmm.

82
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,720
Yeah, because Lincoln is the other parallel, but Lincoln is still like a much bigger deal.

83
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,720
Yeah.

84
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
Bigger show.

85
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
I do.

86
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,720
If I'm being honest, how many times in my hundred and forty trips to Disneyland have I been in here?

87
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
It's probably two.

88
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
Yeah.

89
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,720
It's probably two, maybe three or four.

90
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,720
Honestly, it can't be more than that.

91
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:14,720
So as much as I was like, I will acknowledge that my first is nothing sacred.

92
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,720
They're selling clothes in the Main Street cinema.

93
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,720
Then you're like, well, they sell it in literally every other place on Main Street.

94
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
Every five feet, yeah.

95
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,720
And this isn't even a thing I go into ever.

96
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
Like what?

97
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:34,720
And then I looked at it and then I was trying to figure out a way to still be mad, even though I had like sort of made myself feel less mad.

98
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,720
And then I came upon the, well, it looks like crap.

99
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,720
The way they have all these things displayed looks bad.

100
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Oh sure.

101
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:49,720
If it was all Steamboat Willie themed and they were checking you out on an iPad, if it was less, it was more thoughtfully done.

102
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,720
I bet I would have less of a reaction to it.

103
00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:00,720
Like maybe you take the plush and you put them and they're like all along the screen and you can pick one out and you buy it that way.

104
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
There's got to be a fun way.

105
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
It comes in a little popcorn curtain.

106
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,720
Yeah, we should crack this now.

107
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
What if they sold popcorn in there?

108
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
That'd be good too.

109
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
Sure.

110
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,720
We're already plussing up trying to help Mr. JPEG with his problem.

111
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,720
Okay, there has to be some stuff that is not just a generic like big, big dog type jackal.

112
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,720
This is what they seem to have in their big mouth.

113
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,720
I remember when the Florida one changed.

114
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,720
I remember like, oh, this is a store now.

115
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
Like, but the movie's still playing.

116
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
This is weird.

117
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,720
Like it was weird.

118
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Sure.

119
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,720
And I think, but as a kid in the late 90s, you didn't have YouTube.

120
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,720
Like I watched all this, all the shorts yesterday and today on YouTube because they're all there.

121
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:54,720
Many of them, they are uploaded by the Disney Animation account in like restored, like decent resolution.

122
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Yeah.

123
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,720
Although not with the not uncut in Steamboat Willie's case.

124
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,720
It's the edited Steamboat Willie.

125
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
What happened?

126
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,720
Oh, do you know about the cut?

127
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Okay.

128
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,720
It was a mother pig and like a dozen suckling pigs.

129
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Mickey picks her up and like shakes them off.

130
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,720
I don't know why.

131
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,720
Well, I do know why because these early Mickey shorts are all just Mickey fucking with other animals.

132
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Yes, all animal abuse.

133
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,720
The animal who can squeak and talk a little bit is torturing the ones who cannot.

134
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
Yeah.

135
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,720
Or squeak in a different way than him.

136
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
Mickey comes off real bad in all these shorts.

137
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,720
Yeah, Mickey does not come off great.

138
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,720
So he just shakes them off and then, I don't know, bounces around on the pig.

139
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
It's very straight.

140
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
It is straight.

141
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,720
I'm not actually, I'm not mad they cut it out.

142
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,720
But it was like a weird, it was the weirdest thing in a sequence of extra weird things.

143
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
Yeah.

144
00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:01,720
Like you said, goat eating a ukulele and music notes and then you wind its tail and it plays Turkey in the Straw.

145
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,720
That was the height of comedy in 1928.

146
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,720
Like no one topped that.

147
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
The height of music.

148
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
No one topped that for years.

149
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Yeah.

150
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
Yeah.

151
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,720
I mean, it is a very like sort of mind bending metaphysical thing to happen.

152
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,720
You eat sheet music and then play music from your stomach.

153
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Oh yeah.

154
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
It's crazy.

155
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Like the interesting stuff.

156
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,720
There's tons of interesting stuff in these early ones.

157
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Like more interesting than a lot of animation now.

158
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,720
Yeah.

159
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,720
Like I posted a while back on my Twitter a scene from the movie Storks where a bird sings, How Do You Like Me Now?

160
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,720
That song that was in every commercial and movie trailer for a while.

161
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
Are you saying that's a good thing?

162
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Like literally happens in the movie.

163
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
Or a bad thing?

164
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
No, I'm saying that's dog shit.

165
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,720
Oh, okay.

166
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,720
But like, yeah, there is lots of fun, interesting stuff in these Mickey shorts.

167
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
What was the movie I just saw?

168
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,720
There's a new Alec Baldwin animated movie.

169
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
Not a boss.

170
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
Not in the boss baby universe.

171
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
I saw the trailer for this.

172
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
What is it?

173
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
Do you guys know offhand?

174
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
Is it the spies movie?

175
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Will Smith one?

176
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
No.

177
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
Wait.

178
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
It's a blue sky.

179
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
Disney owns blue sky now.

180
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
Oh, so this is a Disney film that I'm talking about?

181
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
Technically, yes.

182
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,720
I'm just finding something called Totally Spies.

183
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
Man, I don't know.

184
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,720
Maybe it's not that.

185
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
No, Totally Spies, that was a TV show.

186
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
I can't figure out what this is.

187
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,720
But yeah, when you think about the weird sorry state of animation today.

188
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
But then there's plenty of into that video game Cuphead.

189
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
Cuphead, yes.

190
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,720
Cuphead, yeah.

191
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
Oh yeah, that's great.

192
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,720
Crazy Fleischer, early Disney kind of influence.

193
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,720
And like, that's awesome.

194
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,720
Feels very like the hand drawn, got that cool squashed.

195
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Oh, what I'm talking about is Arctic Dogs.

196
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,720
No, this to me is the nadir of I have no idea what you were just talking about.

197
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,720
I saw this trailer before Toy Story 4.

198
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:05,720
The we were just talking with with Paul Rust about like the when it's a really generic actor so they can advert like what that Robin Williams being a Robin Williams s characters.

199
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,720
The genius given way to some boring actor.

200
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
Yeah, right.

201
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,720
And this is the ultimate the main star of this movie, Jeremy Renner, his voice.

202
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,720
The voice of Jeremy Renner.

203
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,720
Singing star Jeremy Renner.

204
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,720
Oh, the Heaven Don't Have A Name.

205
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
I never I didn't do it.

206
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,720
Why you texted us the other day?

207
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,720
You didn't.

208
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,720
I didn't do it.

209
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
Did you see the covers?

210
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
No, no, I missed.

211
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,720
The listener has to go on this with us real quick here.

212
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
Okay.

213
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,720
While you look that up really fast, Jeremy Renner is the voice of Swifty.

214
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,720
Baby.

215
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:50,720
And then elsewhere, Alec Baldwin and James Franco, just James Franco still these Lemmy more interesting voice.

216
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
What's so great about Franco?

217
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,720
The voice, the famous voice of Frank.

218
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Which Franco Dave?

219
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
James.

220
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Oh, Connors come back to her.

221
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
Yeah.

222
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,720
So if in case you didn't know, Jeremy Renner released a single.

223
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,720
And it's got the song is called Heaven Don't Have A Name.

224
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,720
And that's like the Mr. Show two times by one minus one.

225
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,720
Yeah, right, right.

226
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,720
And here's a little bit of it for you.

227
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
A lot of synth.

228
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,720
You got to like that.

229
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:38,720
Oh, she tastes like lipstick and.

230
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,720
Oh,

231
00:12:42,720 --> 00:13:05,720
no, no, no, no, no.

232
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:17,720
It's like kind of like a fallout boy song.

233
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,720
Yeah.

234
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,720
Now you are the cover songs, though, right?

235
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,720
Did I what?

236
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,720
His cover song.

237
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,720
Oh, no.

238
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,720
Big cover.

239
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,720
I know.

240
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
I don't think I did.

241
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
Okay.

242
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,720
I have to first off, I learned about this from the very funny podcast.

243
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
What a time to be alive.

244
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,720
Check that out.

245
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,720
But I am so glad I get to share this with people who haven't heard that.

246
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
This is the Main Street Cinema episode.

247
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Yeah, Mary and we'll get back to Main Street Cinema.

248
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
The right way.

249
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,720
Yes.

250
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,720
The house.

251
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,720
Hold it closer to the mic.

252
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:04,720
Or don't tell as far away from the mic as you want.

253
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
God.

254
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
Closer.

255
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Mike is pointing every direction to get Jason.

256
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
No, no, no.

257
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,720
That left right.

258
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:25,720
God.

259
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,720
I'm just glad there will be a graphic.

260
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,720
Look at that.

261
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,720
Oh, boy.

262
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,720
Real smoky.

263
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
Ooh, the crow of the later years.

264
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
Okay.

265
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,720
I'm just glad that to know that there will be a next generation of Hollywood vampires.

266
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Unlike regular vampires, Hollywood vampires do die and somebody's going to have to take their place.

267
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,720
I just learned that that name has been around forever.

268
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
The Hollywood vampires.

269
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Did I say this to you before?

270
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,720
I'm not sure.

271
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,720
That they used to call like Ringo and Harry Nilsson and Alice Cooper in the 70s, the Hollywood vampires.

272
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,720
And I was like, well, how does Johnny Depp?

273
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,720
What the what?

274
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Johnny Depp is our George Harrison.

275
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,720
It's like how we call ourselves the Algonquin Roundtable.

276
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
Oh, yeah.

277
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Same thing.

278
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
What are you going to do, Dorothy Parker?

279
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
Sue us.

280
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,720
You're dead.

281
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Oh, boy.

282
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
Jeremy.

283
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,720
Well, hopefully he sings then.

284
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:26,720
So that's culture now that back in the day you turned a goat's tail and turkey in the straw played.

285
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Sounds better.

286
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Turkey in the straw.

287
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,720
It is better to get a star.

288
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:40,720
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

289
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:54,720
I was thinking how I was watching in room TV in Vegas and all the music is, oh, how like, you know, how much music changed from like 1961 to 69 was unrecognizable.

290
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,720
It was not even close to what it was at the beginning of the decade.

291
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:05,720
And now it's 2019 and we're in like year 20 of, oh, like that's that is music now.

292
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,720
There's no there will never be.

293
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,720
We finally landed on what music is and it's chance to the heavens.

294
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:18,720
Rock rock and roll specifically is the OO because we still have old town road going strong.

295
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,720
That's why I like when you think about it in the grave.

296
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,720
Do I want to sit and listen to old town road?

297
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
Maybe not.

298
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
But I like that it's a new thing.

299
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
It is not what it's not that.

300
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,720
That's probably why people were so resistant to it.

301
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,720
Isn't that the deal that the country people are like not on my charts?

302
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
Initially.

303
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,720
Initially, I think.

304
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
Right.

305
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Now everyone likes it.

306
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
I think it's really Ray.

307
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
I like it.

308
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,720
I love when Billy, oh man, Billy Ray, the Billy Ray remix.

309
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,720
I didn't really care about the Diplo remix.

310
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
I have not heard all of these remixes.

311
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
You know, all the songs now.

312
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
I mean, Billy Ray was the big one.

313
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
Yeah, I know that.

314
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
I know that.

315
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
I'm not totally out of it.

316
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,720
Yeah.

317
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,720
We'll cover each mix of old town road its own way.

318
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,720
Boy, now I'm you know what I thought is that we'd go into this episode and be like, oh,

319
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
this old tiny garbage.

320
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:14,720
But I'm now I'm like, I'm really fond of the cinema of 1910s after that little trip.

321
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,720
I mean, the cartoons that they play in there now are visually still very interesting.

322
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
Some fun site gags.

323
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,720
Of course, they didn't come along until the 1970s.

324
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,720
Early on, they played short films like A Dash Through the Clouds.

325
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:38,720
1912 Max Senate drama about biplanes and The Noise of Bombs, a Keystone Cops movie.

326
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,720
And then the one you know, this one is very influential in the history of animation.

327
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Gertie the dinosaur, the Windsor McKay cartoon from 1914, not the first animated movie, but the

328
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,720
the first animated dinosaur, first animated dinosaur.

329
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,720
It was like dinosaur mania back then because they were just starting to be found.

330
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,720
The bones are getting getting dug up and they were in the public consciousness.

331
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Also first character, like character with personality.

332
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:17,720
And supposedly Walt took Windsor McKay, the animators son around the lot and said, really,

333
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,720
your dad, like this should all be owed to your dad.

334
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
Like he kicked open what I do.

335
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
For sure.

336
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
Yeah.

337
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,720
He literally said, yeah, it was a nice thing to say.

338
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
He's not going to.

339
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
And he said, well, can you give me some money?

340
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
Yeah.

341
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,720
No, no, my boy.

342
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,720
I'll put your I'll put the dinosaur in a theme park.

343
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,720
Yes, Gertie the dinosaur represented in Hollywood Studios is an ice cream shack.

344
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,720
I watched all of the Gertie the dinosaur short.

345
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,720
I did not realize the live action elements involve a bunch of rich old men going to dinner

346
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,720
and a dare that Windsor McKay makes with another guy that he can make the dinosaur come to life.

347
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,720
And if he wins, the other guy pays for the nice dinner.

348
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,720
This is the plot of Gertie the dinosaur.

349
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,720
So it's mostly live for the beginning of it.

350
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
It's live action.

351
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,720
And then it's like, all right, Gertie, come out of that cave.

352
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:20,720
And then the the cards in between each animation is like Windsor McKay telling Gertie the dinosaur

353
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
to do stuff.

354
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,720
But it is crazy to think that he did that all by hand.

355
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,720
And there's a sea serpent, too.

356
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,720
There's a thing he eats.

357
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,720
There's there's so much going on.

358
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,720
But for the rest of the short, it's very boring and determinable.

359
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,720
It feels like a lifetime.

360
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,720
I assumed it was some big fun dinosaur adventure.

361
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:49,720
It is. It is. Once the dinosaur shows up and then it even like Windsor rides on the back of the dinosaur, which the animator, the animator is like standing on it.

362
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,720
Yeah, I'm going to watch this. I haven't seen this either.

363
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,720
It's worth looking up.

364
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,720
It does feel very long.

365
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,720
How long is it?

366
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,720
Twelve minutes.

367
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
OK.

368
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,720
So and then, of course, they all shake hands and it's like you did a good job.

369
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,720
And then the other guy takes the check for dinner and pays for it.

370
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
Wow.

371
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:18,720
Well, well, Windsor McKay with Gertie the dinosaur invented an animation technique that is still used in everything to this day, which is that he was like drawing the key frames essentially.

372
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:36,720
Like in a five second piece of character animation, drawing like the big, you know, the start of the sentence and when the person gets really mad and then sinks down and gets sad or like instead of drawing it in order, drawing like the big tent pole frames and then filling in the middles, which is sort of how that's that's how everything works.

373
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,720
Like storyboards, essentially, you know, like let's convey the big emotional moments and then everything else is an in between.

374
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,720
And somebody asked him, why didn't you copyright that technique?

375
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:57,720
And he said, if any maniac out there wants to waste their life doing 60,000 drawings in a week like I do, they can have at it.

376
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,720
That is illicit.

377
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,720
That shows up in the short too.

378
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,720
He's just surrounded by stacks and stacks of drawings and stuff.

379
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
Wow, really?

380
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,720
Also hugely influential in the comic book industry from Little Nemo and Slumberland.

381
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,720
Like that was a crazy early broadsheet comic strip in newspapers.

382
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
What's the comic strip?

383
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
It was a strip.

384
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
Yeah.

385
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
OK.

386
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,720
Because they have Little Nemo falling out of his bed in Islands of Ventures.

387
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
Yes.

388
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
Toon Lagoon.

389
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,720
Toon Lagoon.

390
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
Yeah.

391
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,720
So probably owned by one of those by United Features.

392
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,720
Yeah.

393
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,720
Syndicate or whatever.

394
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,720
Would you believe that I have more material about the other old silent films that were shown on opening day?

395
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,720
I would hope because I shot my shot a little.

396
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
I didn't watch any of the other ones.

397
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,720
Would you believe that I have more information about the 1912 Max Senate drama about biplanes?

398
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,720
I was hoping you would say noise of bombs.

399
00:21:50,720 --> 00:22:01,720
I do well a little bit about noise of bombs, but the Max Senate drama about biplanes is a little interesting because it, you know, in 1912, flight is new.

400
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:20,720
And there so there it's filming real planes and they're filming a real pilot named Philip Parmali, who trained under the Wright brothers, who was the first pilot ever to transport cargo to fly a plane that had stuff to deliver in it.

401
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,720
So Philip Parmali was really the original Baloo and his life was the original tailspin.

402
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
Wow.

403
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:34,720
He also flew the first plane ever to drop a bomb, which I think was on to Mexico.

404
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
So great.

405
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Wow.

406
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
And then he filmed this movie.

407
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,720
So he was an early pilot on film.

408
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,720
And then several weeks later, he died in a plane crash.

409
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,720
Well, he died the way he lived.

410
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
The original Baloo died in a plane crash.

411
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
Not like the real Baloo.

412
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,720
No, he's still alive to this day.

413
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:59,720
And still having heart troubles, but it's that's different than what you still drive a flying a sea plane, though.

414
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:09,720
And OK, I can tell you that Max Senate to Max in an early silent film pioneer Max Senate Studios still standing in Los Angeles.

415
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:19,720
Oh, and fountain just east of sunset, like around the corner from Jay's beautiful Jay's Bar, one of my favorite watering holes in Los Angeles.

416
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,720
You really like Jay's.

417
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,720
I do like Jay's a lot down the street from the historic Vista, another L.A.

418
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:33,720
landmark, Matt Senate Studios is weird kind of triangle shaped building that's just still there and it's still called Max Senate Studios.

419
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,720
Really?

420
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
Just named in his honor.

421
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:43,720
I think it's just soundstages studio space still also still up, but not a studio.

422
00:23:43,720 --> 00:24:04,720
Keystone Studios, which is where if you were driving, if you were leaving like the sunset, Alvarado kind of area and getting on the two freeway going north and you're passing by a jack in the box and a public storage building, the public storage is was the Keystone Cop Studios.

423
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Where they shot the noise of bombs.

424
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,720
Where they shot the noise of bombs.

425
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,720
Yeah, one of the original films at the Main Street Cinema.

426
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,720
I don't know a ton about the noise of bombs.

427
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,720
What I did write down the 12 Keystone Cops movies all told there are only 12.

428
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Wow.

429
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,720
And this was the ninth one, it said.

430
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,720
Oh, an IMDb.

431
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
They would just run down the street.

432
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:34,720
They would just film stuff of like cops and bad guys running down the street like the camera guy would set up real quick and then go like action and just run down the street, interrupting people's lives.

433
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,720
Real traffic.

434
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Yeah, sometimes.

435
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,720
That's why.

436
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,720
Plowed into by a actual fire truck or by Philip Parmaley landing his plane on.

437
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,720
Yeah.

438
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:56,720
I the plot of the noise of bombs is for miscreants get revenge on the police chief by planting bombs in his house.

439
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
Huh?

440
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,720
It's not a good thing to do, probably.

441
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,720
No.

442
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,720
Although I don't know police chiefs can be not so good.

443
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
Maybe.

444
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,720
If it's like the LA confidential police chief kind of had a comment, you know.

445
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
Were these shorts that Walt liked?

446
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
Did you find anything like that?

447
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
Like why these movies?

448
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,720
They must have been.

449
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,720
I mean, a lot of them are historically significant enough that maybe that's why he picked them.

450
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,720
Did he have a crush on what's her name?

451
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Mabel Norman?

452
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
Maybe.

453
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,720
Well, every young gentleman did back in the day.

454
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Jason still does.

455
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,720
Mabel Norman, a very big silent film star of her time.

456
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,720
You have a big poster of Mabel Norman on the wall.

457
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:53,720
I believe one of the few women comedian and women comedic characters like who pulled a big salary back in the day.

458
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,720
Now I'm just pulling stuff I vaguely remember from You Must Remember This episodes.

459
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,720
That's OK.

460
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,720
That's if you want to.

461
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,720
If you really want to hear this.

462
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,720
Where's the place for that?

463
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
I think it's Hollywood Babylon.

464
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,720
Fact checking Hollywood Babylon she shows up in.

465
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
She was a.

466
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:15,720
Yeah, she was like maybe the first big female comedy film star.

467
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,720
I'd never heard of her until having to look in the Main Street Cinema.

468
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:25,720
She was like a railroad tracks damsel in a lot of those kind of movies, but she flipped it.

469
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,720
She then saved the man paving the way for Dudley Do-Right.

470
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:35,720
And she ended up being like a mentor to Charlie Chaplin in early days.

471
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:43,720
She directed the first movie in which The Tramp appeared and she helped him make the transition out of vaudeville because he didn't know how movies worked.

472
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,720
He's like, why is everything shot out of sequence?

473
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,720
This is all confusing.

474
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
Yeah.

475
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
Maybe Norman showed in the ropes.

476
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:56,720
And also she was apparently the first star ever movie to break the fourth wall and do a little aside to camera.

477
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,720
Wow, really?

478
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,720
They information with their eyes or with a look and to show that, you know, movies can know that they're a movie.

479
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,720
And that is why John Krasinski keeps her picture in a locket.

480
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,720
John Krasinski's patron saint.

481
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Wow.

482
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
How about that?

483
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
This is spurring.

484
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:24,720
These are like that's what was interesting to me is that all these movies, these were all were literally shown on opening day in fifty five and they all they are all pretty notable.

485
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
So they're well chosen in that reggae.

486
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
It was not some random movies.

487
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:36,720
And to end to that end, another weird historic first this I just when I just read in the list, like this is totally mundane.

488
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,720
Fatima's dance.

489
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,720
Yeah.

490
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,720
Risqué belly dance sequence performed by Fatima, famous dancer of the time.

491
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,720
What I did not know, this is people call this the first censored movie.

492
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,720
She is due.

493
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:56,720
She is revealing a very mild amount of skin as she does the coochie coochie and the charo dance.

494
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,720
The eventual charo dance.

495
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,720
Yes.

496
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,720
So all the pioneers that they have ever do have paved the way for Krasinski and Charo.

497
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,720
And this was deeply shocking at the time.

498
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,720
It's like a minute of footage of somebody shaking their belly around a little bit, but it was very shocking.

499
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,720
I think there was not a lot of like portrayal of Middle Eastern people or culture in movies.

500
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,720
It was shocking in that regard.

501
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,720
Apparently, like women would go to see this and go, can I be watching this?

502
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,720
Is this OK to watch a scantily clad woman like it like drove people's fancies of flood.

503
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:38,720
And eventually they made another version of it where she turns and suddenly there are big white bars on the screen.

504
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,720
There's like a big fence blocking the no skin that she is showing.

505
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,720
So this is like a precursor to Elvis and like shooting him from above the waist.

506
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,720
Yeah, absolutely.

507
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Yes. The most mild sensuality.

508
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,720
Right.

509
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,720
It's possibly portrayed on film, but it was so shocking at the time.

510
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,720
Wow.

511
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,720
We have to put a digital fence, I guess, not digital.

512
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,720
You know what I'm an obstacle fence.

513
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,720
I'm upset that this isn't still playing in the Main Street cinema.

514
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,720
That's what I'm upset about.

515
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,720
I think I might rather see all this stuff that I agree.

516
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,720
It makes it more weird.

517
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,720
You can watch on TV.

518
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,720
Yeah, surely these are all public domain at this point.

519
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,720
I think many of them are.

520
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,720
Yeah. Oh, the Mabel Norman to directing.

521
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,720
There were women directing and writing silent films, silent like one realers or features even.

522
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,720
It wasn't until talkies that like a woman directing.

523
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
That's obscene.

524
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
Like there were women.

525
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,720
It went backwards.

526
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
Yeah, it went backwards.

527
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,720
Strange.

528
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,720
Because of whatever, because of the studio system, because of money just pouring in and just.

529
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:47,720
That's pretty wild that the first Charlie Chaplin movies were directed by a woman that long.

530
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,720
And that she isn't like that.

531
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,720
I didn't find out about her until the theme park podcast.

532
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,720
Behind a paywall.

533
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
Yeah.

534
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,720
And perhaps neither did you, the listener.

535
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,720
So, hey, I've all of these movies shockingly interesting.

536
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:09,720
I did not find anything interesting about dealing for Daisy in 1915 William S. Hart Western.

537
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:15,720
That isn't I don't know, nothing there or Shifting Sands, a Gloria Swanson melodrama.

538
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Literally Gloria Swanson, though.

539
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,720
That's an interesting.

540
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
So it could be a good star.

541
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,720
Yeah, I just don't have any facts about it.

542
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:34,720
And the other thing that used to play here, Universal's Phantom of the Opera would play sometimes, including a Phantom of the Opera walk around character who would stand in front of the theater.

543
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,720
This was going around Twitter recently.

544
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
I sent this to you guys a week or two ago.

545
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,720
This picture, there's a couple of them and he's scary.

546
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,720
Yeah.

547
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,720
He's scary.

548
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
Like, horror nights level.

549
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,720
This is.

550
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,720
Chukko's scary.

551
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,720
Yeah.

552
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,720
It is Chukko level scary.

553
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
Chukko.

554
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
We have Chukko's coming.

555
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Don't worry.

556
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,720
He'll be here.

557
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,720
Some might say he's already here.

558
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,720
He's coming on to you, Scott.

559
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,720
Stop it.

560
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
Stop it.

561
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,720
But like I think of like a rolly crumpling like keep Disneyland weird.

562
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,720
Like this is weird.

563
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,720
Just like a Phantom of the Opera hanging out on Main Street.

564
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
Yeah.

565
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,720
Like it doesn't make sense now because everything is so on brand and like safe and whatever.

566
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,720
But like it would be fun to just have the Phantom of the Opera like we walking down

567
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,720
Main Street and he's just like hanging out outside.

568
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,720
For sure.

569
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,720
Yeah.

570
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,720
Like that'd be great.

571
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,720
Yeah.

572
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
I don't know.

573
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,720
Do you agree?

574
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Yeah.

575
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
That's a weird like the cool lost Hatbox ghost kind of yeah.

576
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
60s Disneyland kookiness.

577
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
Yeah.

578
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,720
Because like you it says it.

579
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,720
Yeah.

580
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,720
There's a picture here.

581
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,720
Lon Chaney thriller Phantom of the Opera.

582
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,720
And there's just a terrifying man spooking children out front.

583
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
Yeah.

584
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
Like more.

585
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,720
Let's bring him back to that.

586
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,720
There's maybe a point in time where you could see that and then walk two doors down and

587
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,720
see Steve Martin doing magic.

588
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,720
Sure.

589
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,720
And then go buy cigarettes three doors down.

590
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,720
My bras and my rolling papers and bras.

591
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,720
Yeah.

592
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Yeah.

593
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,720
It was certainly strange.

594
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,720
This is an interest.

595
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,720
This is a like I think now everybody if if you're sort of new to Disneyland or don't

596
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,720
know much about it you're probably walking through Main Street and are like what's the

597
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
cliff notes of Main Street.

598
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,720
It's oh yeah this is like an old timey area and it's a bunch of stores.

599
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,720
Yeah.

600
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,720
This the Main Street Cinema does take you back to when it was more of a recreation

601
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,720
of a weird little marketplace and similar to what Knott's Berry Farm had up the road

602
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,720
where it genuinely is a place where you could buy jams or a bunch of stones or whatever

603
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
the hell Knott's sold.

604
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
Yeah.

605
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,720
Well and if you think about when it opened in 55 these would have been period appropriate

606
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,720
I mean period appropriate for Main Street ish time frame but also old movies like if

607
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,720
they were showing Mickey shorts from the 20s or 30s in 55 they're not that old.

608
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:05,720
That's like they were showing like a Little Mermaid is actually it's now is 2030.

609
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,720
It's like shit.

610
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,720
It's like showing that old show Friends Now.

611
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,720
Yeah.

612
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,720
Can you believe people dressed like this.

613
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
Yeah.

614
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
Can you.

615
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,720
That is one of the most popular things on Netflix still.

616
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,720
Not anymore.

617
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,720
We're coming up and they're taking it down right.

618
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Please if you're listening to this sign the petitions we have to make sure Friends stays

619
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
on Netflix.

620
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,720
I thought they were taking the office down.

621
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
I think it's all going.

622
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,720
Or are they taking all the NBC Universal stuff.

623
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,720
I think eventually it all moves.

624
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,720
See So Too baby.

625
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,720
Let's go.

626
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,720
Here we go.

627
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Yeah.

628
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
See So Round Two.

629
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
That's what they're calling it.

630
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,720
The mistake we made the first time is we made new shows.

631
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,720
It is now clear to us.

632
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,720
No one wants a new show anywhere on the earth.

633
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
Single guys back.

634
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Dabney Coleman shows back.

635
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,720
Shaking the fat man.

636
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,720
Yeah.

637
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,720
Whatever that was.

638
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,720
NBC bringing back coach again.

639
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,720
We're coach.

640
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,720
We heard you loud and clear.

641
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,720
I also feel like it was it probably didn't make sense to me.

642
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
It's like we have Mickey and other places in the park.

643
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,720
This is about real like what it was like 30 years ago like to go to the cinema.

644
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,720
That's what I was when I was a boy.

645
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,720
Yeah.

646
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,720
Yeah.

647
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,720
I guess Mickey.

648
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
Yeah.

649
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,720
If he's portraying the early the 19 aughts you have Mickey Mouse yet.

650
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:26,720
Walt is portraying a time before when he was only in this timeline.

651
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,720
Walt Disney is only eight years old.

652
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,720
Right.

653
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,720
So he's does he's not made a bunch of cartoons yet.

654
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,720
He's going to our old pharma.

655
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:41,720
It's also like speaks to the Disney people like I'll always argue when people are like a little shocked that I go.

656
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
Yeah.

657
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,720
I go to Disneyland a lot and they're like I just don't I don't understand it.

658
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:50,720
That's like allude to the fact that it's for children and I'll be like it used to be less for children.

659
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,720
It used to I mean there was still a lot of stuff for children and families to do but it was cool.

660
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,720
It was a hip place for adults to go and there was like stuff.

661
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,720
I guess it was.

662
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,720
They go see the movie on the play.

663
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,720
You drive down.

664
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,720
I'm not saying like it was only in the 50s and 60s.

665
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,720
I like this argument being like but it was cool for adults in the 1960s.

666
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,720
Yeah.

667
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,720
So it's not a problem that I go all the time.

668
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,720
Of course I'm just trying to justify like an alcoholic trying to justify like this argument.

669
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
No no one cares.

670
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,720
I'm just saying though there was more like stuff that I feel like like that.

671
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,720
Well dad will enjoy that.

672
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,720
That's a little something for father.

673
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,720
Well that my mind is much more cynical.

674
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,720
It's people say oh you got to do that a lot.

675
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,720
I was like yeah what dumb bullshit do you like.

676
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,720
Oh well sure.

677
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:45,720
Westworld like what TV garbage game Game of Thrones like yeah all that good stuff.

678
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,720
All that good stuff that everyone complains about.

679
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,720
You get real mad.

680
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,720
I just yeah.

681
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,720
Well that's you know with my like wine centric way of doing things if people think that's crazy.

682
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:04,720
But what you don't want to go like have a bunch of good wine in like a in like a fake canyon and then go on a fun fast ride.

683
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,720
Yeah.

684
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,720
It's a it's easy to justify.

685
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,720
I feel.

686
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,720
Yeah I try to I could try to get where we're preaching to the choir right now.

687
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,720
Well sure.

688
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,720
Yeah.

689
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,720
Yeah.

690
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,720
Anyway these are all excuses you can feed to your friends and family.

691
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,720
We'll do a whole Patreon of excuses to your friends and family.

692
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,720
It was cool once Fatima was there.

693
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
Yeah.

694
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,720
You could see a woman's stomach.

695
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:33,720
And then there's of course the old universal excuse mind your own business fella.

696
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,720
If you go to universal.

697
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,720
Huh.

698
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,720
No just if just at each time.

699
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,720
I see I see.

700
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,720
Like why why.

701
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,720
I thought you had a specific universal argument to make and it was just get out of here.

702
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,720
Well then because it's a little body or it's a little it's for adults.

703
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,720
Yeah.

704
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,720
Still got that chip on its shoulder universal.

705
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,720
You're just saying it's something to say to anyone who's disagreeing with anything that you are doing.

706
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,720
Yeah.

707
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,720
Well why.

708
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,720
Easy.

709
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,720
Easy killer.

710
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,720
Would you shut up.

711
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,720
Next time somebody questions your theme park thing or anything you're doing.

712
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,720
Shut up.

713
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,720
Shut up.

714
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,720
That's pretty good but do you also have another arrow in your quiver.

715
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,720
What is that.

716
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,720
Counterpoint.

717
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,720
You are wrong.

718
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,720
You are wrong yeah.

719
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,720
Always that.

720
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,720
You don't want to go to that well too much.

721
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,720
It gets less special.

722
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,720
No I know I'm just saying remember you have it.

723
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,720
But it was friendly he said in a friendly way.

724
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,720
Yeah right.

725
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,720
Well what else we got.

726
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,720
Hey you talk weirdness.

727
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,720
There is this Tilly the mannequin ticket taker.

728
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,720
From Marceline.

729
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,720
From Marceline.

730
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,720
Walt's hometown.

731
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,720
Yeah.

732
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:48,720
She's wearing a Disneyland name badge and it says her hometown is Marceline Missouri and that's where Walt Disney grew up and that's what Main Street is based on and you know going down this rabbit hole.

733
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:54,720
I think probably on yesterland saw pictures of the real Main Street that it is based on.

734
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,720
It stinks.

735
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,720
It's a bad story.

736
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,720
It's not like pretty like the Disneyland one.

737
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:07,720
Maybe it was once maybe like somebody maybe they've taken off all the awnings and the crests and everything.

738
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,720
Now it's just some boring street.

739
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,720
There's a tool store there.

740
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,720
Nothing's going on.

741
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,720
Why can't you buy tools on Main Street now.

742
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,720
I bet you could.

743
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:22,720
You could probably you could walk out of Disneyland with a saw in 1958.

744
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,720
You go honey I'm going down to the Disneyland to get a saw.

745
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,720
Well can you pick up.

746
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,720
We need a new hose as well.

747
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,720
All right.

748
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,720
Yeah yeah yeah.

749
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
I need a bra.

750
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,720
Can you swing by knots.

751
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,720
Get some jam.

752
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
And stones.

753
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
And stones.

754
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,720
Yeah.

755
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,720
You could pick up any.

756
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,720
It was like a mall.

757
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,720
It was like the ultimate shopping destination.

758
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,720
You can get anything you want.

759
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,720
Yeah I don't I've seen that Main Street but I did not look at it to refresh.

760
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,720
So in my mind it looks like the Disneyland and that's the way it's going to stay.

761
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,720
It's well it's they're portraying the Marceline that never was.

762
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,720
I was looking through because this is closed in Florida.

763
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,720
Yeah well it's art is there.

764
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,720
It's the art of Disney now.

765
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,720
And they closed it in Tokyo too.

766
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,720
There was a cinema as well.

767
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,720
And then you do you know they had a movie theater.

768
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,720
There was a cinema as well.

769
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,720
And then did you see what Hong Kong's is.

770
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,720
No no Hong Kong's is Main Street Cinema.

771
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,720
My journeys with Duffy.

772
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,720
Oh yeah.

773
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,720
Smart is also a store.

774
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,720
Okay.

775
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,720
It is just built.

776
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,720
Because this is 2005 when these things are starting to close.

777
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,720
And then when Hong Kong opened so they did build a new Main Street Cinema.

778
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,720
Yeah so it is Main Street Cinema.

779
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,720
But it says my journeys with Duffy and it's all Duffy merch and stuff.

780
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,720
So it's a very vibrant thing.

781
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:50,720
And if you see the picture on the Hong Kong website is Duffy and his traditional sailor suit and sailor cap and cookie holding some waffles.

782
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,720
That's what she likes.

783
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,720
Because that's what cookie makes waffles.

784
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,720
Yeah.

785
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,720
She likes what Donkey likes.

786
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,720
Yeah.

787
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
So what is journeys with Duffy.

788
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,720
It's a store.

789
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,720
Is not a movie you watch.

790
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,720
That happens in there.

791
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,720
I don't believe so.

792
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,720
Okay.

793
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,720
I believe it's just a Duffy store.

794
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,720
Weird.

795
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,720
So they decided to.

796
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,720
Much of a journey.

797
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,720
Put Duffy.

798
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,720
Yeah not so much of a journey.

799
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,720
But at least Duffy's involved.

800
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,720
And that's good.

801
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
That's what I'll say.

802
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,720
And then I don't believe there's a Main Street Cinema in Shanghai.

803
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,720
I didn't see it.

804
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,720
I don't think they even.

805
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,720
Yeah I don't think so.

806
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,720
I don't think they fucking bothered.

807
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,720
I don't think.

808
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,720
Yeah I think some of the international ones are like do they have the context for.

809
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,720
They've never seen a movie before.

810
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,720
Turn of the century small town America.

811
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,720
Was there not one in Euro.

812
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,720
That's a good question.

813
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,720
I don't know why I didn't come upon that.

814
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,720
I didn't see it.

815
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,720
Yeah I don't.

816
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,720
I didn't see it listed.

817
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,720
Yeah so maybe there just was never one.

818
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:54,720
Should we maybe talk about the basic of this place which is that.

819
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,720
Because if you've never been inside which is very likely.

820
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,720
People might even think that even at this level listening to our Patreon.

821
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,720
People might think that this is just a facade that says movie theater.

822
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,720
I was going to say.

823
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,720
And nothing's happening in there.

824
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,720
I bet 90 percent of people that walk down the street just assume you can't go inside.

825
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,720
I think so or that yeah once you do it is just a store.

826
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:20,720
But in fact yeah you walk past the mannequin ticket taker.

827
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,720
Who does not take your ticket because she's a mannequin.

828
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,720
And you get in and there are six movies playing at all times in a circle.

829
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,720
And they are all playing in these little screen tableaus with like curtains.

830
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,720
And then kind of a one dimensional backs of heads.

831
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,720
Gracie Films logo kind of audience.

832
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,720
And it's a nice little set up.

833
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,720
When I do remember to go in there I go this is a well art directed little room.

834
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,720
It is very charming whether or not you sit and watch the Disney cartoons.

835
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,720
Right.

836
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,720
I like yeah it's a it's a charming little building.

837
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,720
It's dark as everyone points out it's air conditioned.

838
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:07,720
People like that it's a nice little spot to take a little breather because it's there's never anyone in there.

839
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:14,720
Yeah a lot of backup on Main Street if you need a good place to like wait for Main Street traffic to calm down.

840
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,720
Yeah you can do worse.

841
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:22,720
I do wonder like I know that recently they just added it to the attraction list on the app.

842
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:30,720
I wonder if there's any like plus up to it that actually makes it more of a destination because it doesn't.

843
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,720
Benches.

844
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,720
Yeah you said they added benches.

845
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,720
Yeah they added benches.

846
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:48,720
In Florida they never did this here but in Florida in 1994 they showed the Mickey's Big Break which was an original short commission for MGM Studios Disney MGM Studios in 1991.

847
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,720
What was that?

848
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,720
So I watched that.

849
00:42:52,720 --> 00:43:02,720
That is about Mickey and Donald are throwing a football around in the house and they accidentally shatter a picture of Minnie and Donald and they're like we ought to replace this picture.

850
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:09,720
And in lieu of just buying a new frame they dress up like Minnie and Donald to go to a department store to get their photo taken.

851
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,720
Minnie and Daisy they pose as their own girlfriends and wives.

852
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,720
They pose as their own girlfriends and get into hijinks getting dressed.

853
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,720
Lots of appearance Claire Belkow makes an appearance.

854
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:26,720
Mortimer Mouse shows up and tries to get Minnie to leave Mickey for him.

855
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,720
But it is Mickey.

856
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,720
It is Mickey Mortimer Mouse.

857
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,720
Mortimer Mouse.

858
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,720
Describe Mortimer Mouse.

859
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:41,720
He is sort of a grungy looking tall mouse and he says like Mickey leave leave come come with me leave.

860
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:49,720
Minnie leave Mickey and Mickey drops the act and goes oh soak your head fresh boy.

861
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,720
Whoa.

862
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,720
Soak your head fresh boy.

863
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,720
Another Jason comeback at it.

864
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,720
Soak your head fresh boy.

865
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,720
If you want to replace Counterpoint you are wrong.

866
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,720
Soak your head fresh boy.

867
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,720
Soak your head fresh boy.

868
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:07,720
Next time I suggest recording in a live setting you're going to say that you're going to take soak your head fresh boy.

869
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,720
But that is a phrase divorced of any time period that I could associate.

870
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:17,720
Like I could not soak your head and then fresh boy.

871
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:31,720
Like seems like they Frank it like reverse engineered an insult an insult and a behavior to go do that is not foul language that is clean but just sounds like nonsense.

872
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,720
It's a good euphemism.

873
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,720
Yeah.

874
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,720
Yeah.

875
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:42,720
For the for what it's covering for if you were more ribald with it you'd say yeah.

876
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,720
Right.

877
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,720
Go go fuck yourself yourself.

878
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,720
Go drown yourself.

879
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,720
Go drown yourself.

880
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,720
Go drown yourself you creep.

881
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,720
Shit boy eat my shit.

882
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:03,720
And then at the end Minnie and Daisy come back and they're very touched they went through all this trouble but they're like oh we hated that picture.

883
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,720
They never liked that picture anyway.

884
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,720
And then they put a nice picture up.

885
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,720
So it's nice.

886
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,720
It's fun.

887
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,720
It's fun.

888
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,720
And it's very the 90s look of the characters.

889
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:24,720
There's a gag where Mickey calls up goofy and says I need you to take a picture and goofy walks off screen and then comes back on holding a giant frame picture he's like all right I got it.

890
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,720
Where do you want me to.

891
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,720
Gosh where do you want me to take it.

892
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,720
And he's like no take a picture with a camera he's like oh take it.

893
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,720
You said take a picture you mean take a picture like that.

894
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,720
There's some fun fun beats in it fun moments.

895
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:53,720
Is there is there any boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife out there who could successfully pose as their own mate who could who could convince someone they knew that they were.

896
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:58,720
Oh I there has to be honestly somebody has to look close and look like each other.

897
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,720
Yeah I bet they could.

898
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,720
The voice of mannerisms would be the hard part.

899
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,720
Yeah.

900
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:08,720
Yeah I don't think I'm like gonna go nobody's gonna think I'm Aaron.

901
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,720
No.

902
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,720
No.

903
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,720
I walk around saying I'm Aaron.

904
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,720
I bet Rich Little could pose as his own wife.

905
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,720
I think that he's good enough.

906
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,720
He can do it all.

907
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,720
What can he do yeah.

908
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,720
So Rich Little appears on a lot of Patreon episodes.

909
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,720
Coincidentally his wife sounded like I'm Mrs. Little.

910
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:33,720
Mrs. Little sounds like Nixon and it's perfect and he does it all the time.

911
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:38,720
If he needs a call and like make a change to the bank account that's in her name he can do it whenever he wants.

912
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,720
He shouldn't be doing that at all.

913
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,720
I say it's okay.

914
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,720
I authorize this.

915
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,720
If Mrs. Little does it it's not a crime.

916
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,720
It's got to be somebody somewhere.

917
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:58,720
The movies themselves that play currently showing now show.

918
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,720
Yeah.

919
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:04,720
And has it been the same lineup since they made the switch and was that in the 70s or so.

920
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,720
I couldn't find a good answer to that.

921
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,720
Mostly yeah hard to tell.

922
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,720
But I think by and large mostly the same lineup.

923
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,720
These are some of the bigger early Mickey cartoons I think.

924
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,720
Sure yes.

925
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,720
And I it seems like you watched them.

926
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,720
I thought to watch them last night as well.

927
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:26,720
I lined up every TV and screen and laptop in my house.

928
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,720
I surrounded myself with six movies.

929
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,720
Yeah.

930
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,720
Turn from one to the other.

931
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,720
I turned off the lights.

932
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,720
The audio coming from Rex.

933
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,720
Yeah yeah yeah.

934
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:41,720
I played silent movie peony through Rex and then led him around by hand.

935
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,720
Yeah.

936
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,720
Because we're going to watch the dog napper.

937
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,720
Rex you excited.

938
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,720
I got a bad feeling about this.

939
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,720
Well I guess so chronologically plain crazy was the first one right.

940
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,720
The first Mickey cartoon.

941
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,720
First appearance of Mickey.

942
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,720
Which in that regard it's nice to have this thing here as it is a nod to the original.

943
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,720
Yeah.

944
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:06,720
Shorts into the animation history laid by by Walt and Mickey themselves holding hands a

945
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,720
mere mere feet away.

946
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,720
Yeah.

947
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,720
Partner statue episode.

948
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,720
I'm sure coming at some point.

949
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,720
Playing crazy is fun.

950
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:22,720
Mickey gets inspired by lucky Lindy Charles Lindbergh.

951
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,720
He looks at a portrait of lucky Lindy at one point and then tries to ruffle his hair in

952
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,720
a mirror to look like him.

953
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,720
And there's a couple very funny.

954
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,720
I don't know.

955
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,720
There's a funny moment where look Mickey looks like a sleaze bat if you pause it.

956
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,720
Mickey's got ruffled hair and he's smiling real weird.

957
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,720
He was sleazy though in the old days.

958
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,720
Yeah he was more more of a cat.

959
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:47,720
Well in general and in all of these because they all involve him hurting animals and a

960
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,720
lot involve him pulling a gun.

961
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,720
There's a couple of really good moments.

962
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,720
Or a rifle.

963
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:58,720
Yeah well there's a rifle but then he's the specifically in the dog napper he's just got

964
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,720
like a pistol.

965
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,720
He and Donald both.

966
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,720
They're cops.

967
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,720
Yeah.

968
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,720
Yeah.

969
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,720
And they say what does he say it's like like like hands up you viking.

970
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,720
Hands up you viper.

971
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,720
Yeah.

972
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,720
Calls him a viper.

973
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,720
These movies were more serious.

974
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,720
Yeah.

975
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,720
Then everything was more for adults.

976
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,720
Yeah in fact.

977
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,720
OK so plain crazy.

978
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,720
Yeah the Lindbergh.

979
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:27,720
Everyone had Lindbergh fever but I read a quote from of I work so insistent on clarifying.

980
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,720
Yes Lindbergh is the inspiration for the plane stuff.

981
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:39,720
But Mickey Mickey's vibe was done done in the way of Douglas Fairbank senior who he referred

982
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:46,720
to as the superhero of his day Douglas Fairbank senior very handsome looking very confident

983
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,720
yeah adventurer type.

984
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,720
He was like a swashbuckler swashbuckler.

985
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:54,720
Yeah.

986
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,720
The Indiana Jones lineage kind of runs through him.

987
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,720
Yes.

988
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,720
Yeah.

989
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:05,720
And Charles Lindbergh of course a noted racist noted anti-semites.

990
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,720
I don't think I knew that.

991
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,720
Oh yeah.

992
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,720
Very Mike Lindbergh racist.

993
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,720
I didn't know the very racist.

994
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,720
I could have seen older guys of a different time you would assume there'd be something

995
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,720
there.

996
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,720
But no I didn't know about racism.

997
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:27,720
If there is a if there is a person he didn't like of another race he'd say go soak yourself

998
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,720
yourself.

999
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,720
What's your boy.

1000
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,720
Soak your head.

1001
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,720
Soak your head.

1002
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,720
Soak your head.

1003
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,720
Fresh boy.

1004
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,720
So Lindbergh.

1005
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,720
Yeah.

1006
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,720
You know plane.

1007
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,720
I don't I don't need to say things about every movie but plane crazy.

1008
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,720
It does.

1009
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,720
I like that there's POV in it.

1010
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,720
That's pretty nuts that an animated movie in the 20s has like you like you are the plane

1011
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:53,720
and like avoiding obstacles and how the hell do you draw that like like 2D movies have

1012
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:59,720
had to employ 3D technology today to figure out how to get right.

1013
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,720
It was right.

1014
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,720
He's like to emulate the POV of a plane path that early on.

1015
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,720
Yeah.

1016
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,720
It is insane.

1017
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,720
Was the moose one with the shotgun.

1018
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,720
Yeah.

1019
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,720
Is that the one he's like shoots.

1020
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,720
He thinks he shot Pluto.

1021
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,720
Yeah.

1022
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,720
Oh yeah.

1023
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,720
He weeps.

1024
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,720
What if I kill.

1025
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,720
He thinks he kills Pluto.

1026
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:16,720
What if I die.

1027
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,720
It's the same.

1028
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,720
Yeah.

1029
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,720
On the ground with like just like the line for his eyes.

1030
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,720
They use a fake sexy moose to try and lure the moose.

1031
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,720
Yeah.

1032
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,720
Yeah.

1033
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,720
Well the card yeah those cartoons are wild.

1034
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,720
They let it play for a while.

1035
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,720
The moment of Mickey.

1036
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,720
Yeah right.

1037
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,720
It's not like he goes oh no and then like he pops up.

1038
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,720
Yeah.

1039
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,720
What have I done.

1040
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,720
It's really what have I.

1041
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,720
What have I done.

1042
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,720
It's heavy.

1043
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,720
So dognails.

1044
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,720
What have I done.

1045
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,720
It's heavy.

1046
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,720
So dognapper I think was probably the most entertaining of them I thought.

1047
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,720
Yeah.

1048
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,720
Where they're it's just it's an extended like gunfight.

1049
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,400
There's so many like crazy.

1050
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,960
It's like a long action sequence.

1051
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:59,960
Mickey and Donald.

1052
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,960
A car chase.

1053
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,960
Yeah car chase.

1054
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,960
Where they're firing.

1055
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,380
Where Pete and Donald are firing rounds at each other.

1056
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:10,720
Big thick guns and firing big thick bullets.

1057
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,720
It's pretty nuts.

1058
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,720
Pete with his peg leg and a couple of these shorts.

1059
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,720
Oh yeah right.

1060
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:21,960
Oh and that yeah I kind of thought maybe he only had a peg leg if it was a boat situation

1061
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,880
like Steamboat Willie.

1062
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,320
But I guess he always had a peg leg but not in a goofy movie.

1063
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,320
No.

1064
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,320
Correct.

1065
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,320
Or Goof Troop.

1066
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,320
No.

1067
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,400
He was not an oddly in the 90s peg legged man.

1068
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,320
Because today if you unfortunately lose a limb you have an option besides a big peg.

1069
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,200
Unless that's what you want.

1070
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,280
Is there a doctor in America that will prescribe you a giant peg as opposed to a prosthetic

1071
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,760
leg or something else?

1072
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,760
Stand by my guns.

1073
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,360
It's just it's gonna be better for you.

1074
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,360
Those things will break.

1075
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,360
They'll shatter.

1076
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,360
They'll.

1077
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,640
Somebody will think it's a real limb and press on it too hard and it cracks down the middle.

1078
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,040
But a big peg sturdy.

1079
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,040
Tried and true.

1080
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,040
An old peg.

1081
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,160
Just stay away from termites.

1082
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,520
You should be fine.

1083
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:13,240
I've also said that before that I literally a month ago just realized that Pete is a cat.

1084
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,240
Yes.

1085
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,040
That I was stupid and thought he was a dog.

1086
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,040
Yeah.

1087
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,040
Pretty stupid.

1088
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,040
Yeah.

1089
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,040
Go drown yourself.

1090
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,040
Soak no sex.

1091
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,040
Why do I forget it every time?

1092
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,040
We just said it.

1093
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,040
Soak your ass fresh boy.

1094
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,040
Soak your ass.

1095
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,040
Soak my peg fresh boy.

1096
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,040
Soak my peg.

1097
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,040
Soak my peg.

1098
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,040
Soak my peg.

1099
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,040
Soak my peg.

1100
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,040
Soak my peg.

1101
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,040
Soak my peg.

1102
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,040
Soak my peg.

1103
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,040
Soak my peg.

1104
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,040
Soak my peg.

1105
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,040
Soak my peg.

1106
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,560
Soak my peg.

1107
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,560
Yeah.

1108
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,320
I will do all of those things.

1109
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:46,960
Soak my peg suck boy.

1110
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:54,560
And then yeah they so dognapper is about Pete stealing Minnie's dog.

1111
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,560
Yeah.

1112
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,560
Fifi or something.

1113
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,560
Stealing it yeah.

1114
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:02,320
And then and then immediately the chase is on because making down our cops and then they

1115
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:09,680
fire guns and then they corner Pete in a warehouse and then a big blade like a circular log cutting

1116
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,800
blade comes to life and oh just owns Pete for three minutes.

1117
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:21,860
It just follows him and follows him and like it shreds his butt a bunch of times.

1118
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:22,860
It's nuts.

1119
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:27,480
They're like John Woo movies or something like there's so much gunplay and violence

1120
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,000
like and it's all like so well done.

1121
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Yeah artistic.

1122
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,280
And there's it's long shots.

1123
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:40,760
Yeah like the you follow Pete in the blade for right you know like half a football field.

1124
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:45,600
Yeah a lot of yardage in these single these shots.

1125
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,360
Children they were primarily for children.

1126
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,360
Yeah I guess so.

1127
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,960
So I guess the older generation was tougher I suppose.

1128
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,160
I feel like you could not get I'm trying to think of an equivalent I mean I'm sure there's

1129
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:01,440
like I guess the like Toy Story 3 when they're all going to die in an incinerator.

1130
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,800
But most things you know you don't get Pete faced doom like that.

1131
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,800
Yeah.

1132
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,800
On the regular.

1133
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,800
Years ago.

1134
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,800
Mickey.

1135
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,800
We thought he killed his best friend.

1136
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,800
Yeah.

1137
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,640
That'd be like the crux of a Toy Story today.

1138
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,640
Yeah.

1139
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,120
And it just casually happens in the middle of some Mickey cartoon.

1140
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,120
Huh.

1141
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,120
Oh God.

1142
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,120
He turns the gun on himself.

1143
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,120
There's no other way.

1144
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,120
No one must know.

1145
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,120
And he turns to the breaks the fourth wall.

1146
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,120
Don't you tell anyone.

1147
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,120
Or you're next.

1148
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,120
Oh my God.

1149
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,120
You're complicit.

1150
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,120
These secrets die with me.

1151
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,120
Come closer to the screen.

1152
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,120
Swear to me.

1153
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,120
Swear to me you won't tell anyone.

1154
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,120
Cut your finger.

1155
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,120
I want you to rub it on the screen.

1156
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:59,120
I found an article that refers to Charles Lindbergh as one of Hitler's key American

1157
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,120
friends.

1158
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,120
Hey.

1159
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,120
Boy.

1160
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,120
That's not just casual anti-Semitism.

1161
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:10,120
Had a campaign was part of a campaign gave us big speech about America first.

1162
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,120
America should stay out of the war.

1163
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,120
America first.

1164
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,120
I've heard a recent president say that statement too.

1165
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,120
Yes.

1166
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,120
This came up in the election.

1167
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:22,120
This happened in September of 1941 and then we were quickly drawn into the war.

1168
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,120
Exactly.

1169
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,120
You saw it.

1170
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:30,120
If there was some racist pilot he'd be invited to the White House lickety split.

1171
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,120
Oh my God.

1172
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,120
He wouldn't even learn his name.

1173
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,120
He'd just be there.

1174
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:42,120
We should dress Jason up to look like Charles Lindbergh with an old time pilot's outfit.

1175
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,120
And the big scarf.

1176
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:50,120
And just say racist pilot gets doxed on Twitter and see how fast you get invited to the White

1177
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,120
House.

1178
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,120
Oh yeah.

1179
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,120
And getting like a medal of freedom.

1180
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,120
And get the fast food meal.

1181
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,120
Get the fast food feast.

1182
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,120
Yeah.

1183
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,120
He orders for some reason you 200 Big Macs.

1184
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,120
Just because he likes that little the image of it.

1185
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,120
He's a hungry boy.

1186
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,120
Racist pilot.

1187
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,120
Racist Jason is one of the best pilots.

1188
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,120
Sorry Sully you're number two now.

1189
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,120
He's the finest pilot he invented piloting.

1190
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:15,120
He's the first pilot and the best.

1191
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,120
Racist pilot Jason says Hitler a-okay.

1192
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:23,120
And like immediately you get a call from Stephen Miller.

1193
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,120
We'd like to see you here.

1194
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,120
You're a great American.

1195
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,120
Santa Monica's favorite son.

1196
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:36,120
But then yeah that's when you spring out and unleash a big circular saw to cut up Trump's

1197
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,120
pear leg.

1198
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,120
Yeah.

1199
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,120
Yeah.

1200
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,120
Bend the other saw so it bounces around.

1201
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,120
It would make sense.

1202
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:46,120
Chased around the entire White House gets destroyed.

1203
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:50,120
It would make sense if you learned that Trump had two peg legs the way he walks.

1204
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,120
You'd be like oh yeah I can see that.

1205
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:55,120
He is a guy who would insist that peg legs are the best type of leg.

1206
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,120
Yeah.

1207
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:00,120
And he goes and like he goes and speaks to the military and tells you you got to get

1208
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,120
the peg leg let me tell you.

1209
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,120
Steady as well as that.

1210
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,120
Three three peg leg appearances in these.

1211
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,120
Steamboat Willie.

1212
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,120
Oh yeah.

1213
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,120
Traffic troubles.

1214
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,120
Mickey picks him up in his taxi cab.

1215
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,120
Of course Mickey a taxi driver before he was a sea captain.

1216
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,120
Right.

1217
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,120
We learned in the Duffy.

1218
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:21,120
Can you imagine if like in the Duffy origin any of this nonsense happened.

1219
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:24,120
The Duffy origin is just like Mickey goes out to sea and then maybe he gives him a nice

1220
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,120
teddy bear.

1221
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,120
Wasn't like.

1222
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:33,120
He doesn't use a crane to pick Minnie up by her underwear and drop her music notes at

1223
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,120
ukulele.

1224
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,120
Yeah.

1225
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:38,120
There's a lot of play of Minnie's underwear in these early.

1226
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,120
Yeah.

1227
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,120
Yeah.

1228
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:45,120
With the weird little like the little like fluff on like on the leg part.

1229
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,120
The frilly part.

1230
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,120
Yes.

1231
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,120
Yeah.

1232
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,120
Uh huh.

1233
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,120
Strange.

1234
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,120
Very strange.

1235
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,120
And speaking of strange Mickey's polo team.

1236
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,120
Yeah.

1237
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,120
Featuring a cast of thousands.

1238
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,120
The biggest stars of their time.

1239
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,120
Right right right right.

1240
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:06,120
Because Mickey and friends are playing a polo game against all the biggest celebrities

1241
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,120
of the time.

1242
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,120
Yes.

1243
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,120
Like Looney versus everybody else.

1244
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:14,120
Did they did this before like because one of like Looney Tunes this would happen all

1245
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,120
the time too.

1246
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:21,120
Where would you like Humphrey Bogart and it would be like celebs like Peter Laurie.

1247
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,120
Peter Laurie.

1248
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,120
Yes.

1249
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,120
Peter Laurie for sure.

1250
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,120
Yeah.

1251
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,120
This has a very Looney Tunes vibe.

1252
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,120
Maybe it's just the presence of those celebrities.

1253
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:33,120
But yeah with the pop culture references something not very present in Disney cartoons

1254
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,120
otherwise.

1255
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:42,120
But then on top of it in a Mickey and Donald posing as their wives way they all of the

1256
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:46,120
celebrities and Disney characters have horses who are like them.

1257
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,120
That is very funny.

1258
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,120
Yeah.

1259
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,120
I mean Oliver Hardy on top of the thick horse.

1260
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,120
Yeah.

1261
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,120
The thick boy horse.

1262
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:59,120
It's he's pretty cute that thick horse.

1263
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,120
Yeah.

1264
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,120
Yeah.

1265
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:10,120
And then like Harpo Marx rides an ostrich that has big yellow Harpo hair.

1266
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,120
Who else?

1267
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:14,120
Stan Laurel and Charlie Chaplin.

1268
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:18,120
And then the Mickey's team was Mickey Mouse Donald Duck Big Bad Wolf.

1269
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:22,120
And then he's credited just as the goof.

1270
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,120
Yeah.

1271
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:27,120
Well he was his original name was movie stars versus Mickey Mausers.

1272
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:29,120
Those are the teens.

1273
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,120
So what Goofy's original name was like Dippy the goof.

1274
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,120
Yes.

1275
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,120
Dippy dog.

1276
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:37,120
But yeah it was Dippy dog the first and then it was Dippy the goof.

1277
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,120
Was it really Dippy the goof.

1278
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,120
But there were like multiple.

1279
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,120
I like Dippy the goof.

1280
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,120
Maybe we should go back to that.

1281
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:51,120
The referee was also Jack Holt another like western star adventurer like handsome guy.

1282
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,120
Oh yeah.

1283
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,120
Yeah.

1284
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,120
It's all these recognizable names.

1285
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:58,120
Mickey Big Bad Wolf and Laurel and Hardy and this is Jack Holt.

1286
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,120
And you knew who Jack Holt was.

1287
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,120
No I looked I had to look that one up.

1288
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,120
OK.

1289
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,120
But you can I call it Clark Gable.

1290
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:07,120
Clarabel makes out with Clark Gable in the dance.

1291
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:11,120
WC Fields is there and seems irritated of course.

1292
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:14,120
And then the three little pigs are sitting with Shirley Temple.

1293
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:19,120
Oh which is very disturbing because it leads to her like acting like a little pig.

1294
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,120
Yes they all showed their little bottoms.

1295
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,120
Yeah.

1296
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,120
Oh bad news.

1297
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,120
Do not like that.

1298
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:34,120
Although I kind of like that you know besides blowing the houses down you don't really get to see the Big Bad Wolf and his ability to do anything with his mega breath.

1299
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:39,120
And it's kind of fun to think you just walk around and make whatever he wants happen but blowing really hard.

1300
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,120
Yeah.

1301
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:43,120
So it was fun to see it in a different context.

1302
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:50,120
Like if somebody gave him the finger in traffic he could just go and then their car explodes.

1303
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:53,120
Yeah kind of an antihero in this one.

1304
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,120
Kind of helping the team win but still up to mischief.

1305
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:03,120
Yeah yeah it's kind of fun that they're they're letting the villain play and let his villainy is OK since he's with us.

1306
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,120
Yeah.

1307
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,120
Pretty.

1308
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:15,120
Imagine if you were somewhere sitting next to a big cow lady with a bell on her on her chest and she grabbed you and kissed you.

1309
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:19,120
How disturbed you would be.

1310
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:22,120
I'm worried about having this nightmare this evening.

1311
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:26,120
Now the forcible kiss of the cow woman.

1312
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,120
Which sounds like an old play.

1313
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,120
Yeah.

1314
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,120
That's an opera.

1315
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,120
That's a classic.

1316
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,120
So I.

1317
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,120
1889.

1318
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:40,120
I believe Dippy Dog's first appearance is in the book Dippy the Goof.

1319
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:44,120
So he is Dippy the Goof but he is Dippy Dog in the book.

1320
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:52,120
So I guess Dippy the Goof is what they're calling Dippy Dog and that's like a year before then they start calling him Goofy.

1321
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,120
Yeah.

1322
01:02:53,120 --> 01:03:01,120
Also a lot of these a few of these shorts features Donald's voice is the same but he's long faced Donald.

1323
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,120
Yeah.

1324
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,120
Long faced Donald I'm really glad they got rid of.

1325
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,120
He's unpleasant looking.

1326
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,120
Yeah.

1327
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,120
Extremely.

1328
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,120
Yeah.

1329
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,120
Definitely matches his mannerisms more.

1330
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:21,120
And he also says you viper while holding a gun and then Pete like puts his big gun over.

1331
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:25,120
He like makes Donald insert his hand into his gun.

1332
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,120
I'm creeped out.

1333
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:30,120
I'm like I'm going to need to like calm down after this episode.

1334
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:33,120
I'm just describing disturbing tableaus.

1335
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,120
Yeah.

1336
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,120
They're not as disturbing if you just watch it.

1337
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:39,120
No they're saying describing them out loud is really unsettling.

1338
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:51,120
Pete Mickey jumps in a barrel Pete riddles it with bullets and you're like oh my god and then thankfully the barrel falls over and you find out there's a hole in the floor that Mickey has escaped from and comes out the other side.

1339
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,120
Right.

1340
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,120
But for a brief moment.

1341
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:59,120
But you're expecting a corpse to roll out of the barrel that's got like bullet holes in it.

1342
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,120
Yeah.

1343
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:06,120
And then you've got Steamboat Willie historical piece of animation.

1344
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:13,120
It's almost like weird to see it in motion so iconic is the still when I was watching it last night like I was like have I ever watched this?

1345
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:17,120
Just him driving that boat is such you forget it's even from a movie.

1346
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:36,120
And then the rest of it is less iconic such as at the end when he lands he's done a big barnyard symphony on a boat and then Pete shoves him back into the kitchen and he's next to something labeled potato bin and then he has to angrily peel potatoes and then a bird laughs at him.

1347
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:44,120
So he clocks the bird with a huge potato and then smiles to us and that's the end of Steamboat Willie.

1348
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,120
Again animal abuse.

1349
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,120
It's nothing but animal abuse.

1350
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,120
Doesn't go out with the same bang.

1351
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,120
No.

1352
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:56,120
Doesn't have the same resonance as that little whistle that they used before Disney animation.

1353
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,120
Right.

1354
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,120
Piloting and singing the little whistle.

1355
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:04,120
Maybe they should change it up though and switch it to him just with the potatoes at the end or at the start of the animation.

1356
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,120
Oh yeah switch it out him throwing a potato at a bird.

1357
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,120
Yeah.

1358
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,120
That's the start of all the movies now.

1359
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,120
Go soak your head.

1360
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:14,120
Start your fucking bird.

1361
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:19,120
It all started with a mouse angrily peeling potatoes.

1362
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,120
It's fun to see watching these back to back.

1363
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:33,120
It's fun to see the evolution because the 30s I mean they're all have good beats and good moments and stuff but the 30s one you can tell they have it down.

1364
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:38,120
Like this is like within five years or like this is what a Mickey Mouse cartoon is.

1365
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:39,120
Sure.

1366
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:43,120
There's a lot more experimentation a lot weirder stuff I think of the earlier ones.

1367
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:52,120
Yeah and the earlier and then I was I think it's in that Walt Disney biography that you know that one the one that I've read one of the only books I've read in the last 10 years.

1368
01:05:52,120 --> 01:06:00,120
They were talking about Mickey and like early on here is like they're yeah they're testing stuff out and Mickey's personality is crazy.

1369
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:06,120
And then they would like go on to like take parts of Mickey's personality and just give them to like Donald and other characters.

1370
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,120
Yeah.

1371
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:20,120
So Mickey Mickey ends up being like very boring later on because all they were throwing everything at Mickey and then like he was the corporate mascot all of a sudden they're like he can't be firing so many bullets at people.

1372
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:23,120
He can't be like so mean and weird.

1373
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:29,120
Did you read the one with the big yellow font on the cover or the one with Walt standing in the doorway.

1374
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,120
Honestly I was gonna say both.

1375
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:35,120
There's that I feel like he's standing in the doorway and there's yellow font.

1376
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,120
Kind of.

1377
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,120
It's closer to his headshot.

1378
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,120
Yeah that's the one I read.

1379
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:48,120
So that is the one that I think got more press and sold more but I think the other one is the one the family endorses.

1380
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:51,120
There were two biographies that came out within a decade of each other.

1381
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,120
Isn't that bad then?

1382
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,120
Mike broke the family's wishes.

1383
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,120
You're not a true fan.

1384
01:06:56,120 --> 01:07:02,120
I forget which but I mean I feel like they both got good reviews but they came out within five years of each other.

1385
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:08,120
Yeah the biographies I read was not it was like was pretty honest about like all this stuff.

1386
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,120
The communist stuff and.

1387
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,120
Walt liked to throw potatoes at birds.

1388
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:15,120
Yeah yeah and he loved Minnie's underwear.

1389
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:16,120
Like that's all in there.

1390
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,120
Yeah.

1391
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,120
He often kissed cow women.

1392
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:21,120
Yeah yeah.

1393
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,120
Insatiable attraction to female cows.

1394
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:25,120
Right.

1395
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,120
The company did not like that.

1396
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,120
We've mentioned Looney Tunes a couple of times.

1397
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:36,120
I have to say I may have said this before I think Mickey's the better every man like the better cipher but Bugs is the better comedian.

1398
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,120
Sure.

1399
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,120
Bugs Bunny I think is funnier.

1400
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,120
Sure yeah.

1401
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,120
Mickey can be funny.

1402
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:43,120
I feel like especially the newer ones have very funny moments.

1403
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:49,120
Yeah I like in the newer ones that they've gone back to him like being like freaked out and weird and.

1404
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:50,120
Nervous.

1405
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:54,120
Bugs was very much like very in control and cool.

1406
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,120
He is cool.

1407
01:07:55,120 --> 01:08:00,120
Bugs is cool but Mickey was not cool but I like that they're leaning into him being weird and bizarre and awkward now.

1408
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:05,120
Well he has a meal he has like a different job every episode like he's always in over his head and that.

1409
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,120
Leads me to.

1410
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,120
Making sure it's a real fun.

1411
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,120
Yeah.

1412
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:13,120
Those are real good and that and the ride is based on those which is very good.

1413
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,120
Yeah.

1414
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,120
Seems like that'll be good.

1415
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:18,120
Yeah that's exciting that they're going that way.

1416
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:23,120
You know if we're talking about reverting things to the way that they used to be.

1417
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:32,120
I have always been a big fan of when the cartoons start and you know whose cartoon it is because it's their giant face.

1418
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,120
Oh yeah.

1419
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,120
Staring at you.

1420
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,120
Oh yeah.

1421
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,120
Smiling.

1422
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:48,120
Huge huge shading grin at you and there's a like a starburst behind them and I believe I think this was this should have been a fundamental of cinema that never changed.

1423
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:51,120
And I think that today when you see a comedy.

1424
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:56,120
It should have the star of the comedy looking at you in front of a big starburst.

1425
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:01,120
If you go to see a Seth Rogen movie the Seth Rogen movie should start with Seth Rogen's big face.

1426
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:06,120
If you're seeing even a like more tame like a Duplass Brothers.

1427
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,120
Mark Duplass.

1428
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,120
It should be Mark Duplass.

1429
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,120
How else are you going to know who's in the movie?

1430
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,120
Right.

1431
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,120
Am I watching a Mark Duplass caper today?

1432
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,120
Awkwafina's head coming at you.

1433
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:19,120
Huge Awkwafina at the beginning of Crazy Rich Asians.

1434
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,120
Big Gad.

1435
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:23,120
Big old Josh Gad looking at you.

1436
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,120
He's made for it.

1437
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,120
Out of that I will say about Josh Gad.

1438
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:29,120
He always has that Mickey smile naturally.

1439
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,120
Well they're best friends.

1440
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,120
Oh Josh and Mickey are best friends.

1441
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,120
Oh no sorry it was Tony Hale and Mickey are best friends.

1442
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,120
Yes he's best friends with Tony Hale.

1443
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:48,120
Now in that special that we watched it was a Mickey's birthday special and before there's a funny little banter scene with Tony Hale it should be a big picture of Tony Hale smiling at you so you know it's a Tony Hale caper.

1444
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,120
I agree.

1445
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:54,120
And you want it one of all eight members of NCT 127.

1446
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,120
Yes yeah yeah.

1447
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,120
I probably got that wrong.

1448
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,120
Please don't tell me.

1449
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,120
Multiples in there totally fine.

1450
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,120
Yeah.

1451
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,120
Serious movies too.

1452
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,120
Moonlight.

1453
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,120
It's a big.

1454
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,120
Okay across the board.

1455
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,120
Yeah yeah yeah.

1456
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,120
Even if it's a sad movie.

1457
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,120
I want to know who's who's movie it is.

1458
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,120
They used to do that in comic books too.

1459
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:17,120
The little Marvel logo at the top with the price and everything used to have the characters in the little price box.

1460
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,120
Yeah I like that.

1461
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,120
Yeah.

1462
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,120
That was good.

1463
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,120
You would know who was on what team at any given time.

1464
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:25,120
So when we have our TV show three faces.

1465
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,120
Yeah.

1466
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,120
All at once.

1467
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,120
Yeah all at once I think.

1468
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,120
Hi.

1469
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,120
Yeah.

1470
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,120
Hey.

1471
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,120
Like getting squeezed unpleasantly.

1472
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:38,120
Well the face I always think of that I don't like is of course you can't do that on television.

1473
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,120
Oh yeah there's some big scary faces.

1474
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:43,120
Some big scary faces there that turned me off of them but I'm willing to go back.

1475
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:52,120
Are they kind of like were they kind of like not sepia toned but like that sort of colorized Ted Turner color like had that weird color look.

1476
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,120
They were tinted strange.

1477
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,120
Yeah.

1478
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,120
Yeah.

1479
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,120
Yeah.

1480
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,120
And it was all Terry Gilliam rip off.

1481
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,120
Right.

1482
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,120
I didn't realize till way later seeing Monty Python.

1483
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,120
Oh they just took.

1484
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,120
Yes.

1485
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,120
Just straight up.

1486
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,120
Yeah.

1487
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,120
I didn't realize it until like three years ago.

1488
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:10,120
I was like oh yeah.

1489
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:13,120
One thing you shouldn't be able to do on television.

1490
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,120
Steal the work of other artists.

1491
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,120
Yeah.

1492
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,120
I wonder if they ever noticed.

1493
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,120
Yeah.

1494
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,120
Terry Gilliam ever watched you can't do that on television.

1495
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,120
Was he ever up in Canada watching some.

1496
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,120
Perhaps.

1497
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:31,120
Watching TV shows with a budget of a hundred dollars.

1498
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:37,120
It's weird that the sliming is something that maintains your solis from this very unpleasant.

1499
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,120
Yeah.

1500
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,120
Yeah.

1501
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,120
I would run out of the room my mom said.

1502
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,120
Like if it was on I would run.

1503
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,120
Are you scared of Barth?

1504
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,120
I was.

1505
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,120
I don't even know what that is.

1506
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,120
Barth was a dirty chef.

1507
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,120
Oh I do know Barth.

1508
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,120
Yes.

1509
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,120
Yes I do know.

1510
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,120
I hated him.

1511
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,120
I think with a TH I think he was Barth.

1512
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,120
Oh.

1513
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,120
And that's the worst name too.

1514
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,120
It's a really bad name.

1515
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:04,120
This is around the time of or a few years before of What Would You Do.

1516
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,120
No not What Would You Do.

1517
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,120
I loved What Would You Do.

1518
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,120
What was the one on the ranch.

1519
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,120
The kids on the ranch.

1520
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,120
Hey Dude.

1521
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:11,120
Hey Dude.

1522
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,120
That I think came in 89.

1523
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:15,120
We're starting to hit 89 99 anniversaries.

1524
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:19,120
Of course we talked about the anniversary is smooth recently.

1525
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:22,120
But everything from those times starting to come up.

1526
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,120
Sure.

1527
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,120
So you want Hey Dude back.

1528
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,120
I never liked Hey Dude either.

1529
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,120
But I didn't give it a chance.

1530
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:34,120
Aaron and I were just talking about this where that was the one her mom was like no shut this fucking show off.

1531
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,120
I don't think she swore.

1532
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,120
Right.

1533
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:42,120
That was the you wonder like is fun going back to your childhood and thinking like my parents must have hated a lot of stuff.

1534
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:53,120
And that was the one for her was and looking and like Hey Dude is good in my memory because in my memory it's like a gripping Riverdale character drama and secrets unfolding.

1535
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:56,120
I'm sure if you watch it is the cheapest public access.

1536
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,120
Yeah.

1537
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:01,120
I think Salute Your Shorts was probably bought here.

1538
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,120
Mm hmm.

1539
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,120
Yeah.

1540
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,120
I didn't care for either of them from the title on.

1541
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,120
Well sure.

1542
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,120
Yeah.

1543
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:09,120
I bet people I bet that show had a lot of attitude a lot of.

1544
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,120
That does not honor the fly coach.

1545
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,120
Right.

1546
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,120
There's no fly coach for shorts.

1547
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:23,120
Do you think they did they do shorts at half mast if a camper died or if there was a tragedy.

1548
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,120
Or if the morbidly obese camper died.

1549
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:29,120
Or what was bad that happened during the run.

1550
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:33,120
So the original World Trade Center bombing did they make the shorts be at half mast.

1551
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:36,120
You know what I don't know if they dealt with it.

1552
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,120
We'll find out.

1553
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:40,120
I'm not sure that the shorts were a daily event.

1554
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,120
Yeah.

1555
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:45,120
How long did it run Nixon died in like 93 or 94.

1556
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:50,120
Did they honor its memory with the whole Nixon episode.

1557
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:58,120
Hey I might not respect a lot of stuff but hey that guy President you got to give him respect man.

1558
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:59,120
You respect the office.

1559
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:09,120
Well we've talked about all the great media of time from salute your shorts to plain crazy.

1560
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:13,120
What do you think if this place turns merch again are we upset.

1561
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,120
I want to outrage.

1562
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:18,120
I want them to gut it then and make it like cool.

1563
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,120
A cool place to buy things.

1564
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:21,120
That's what I want.

1565
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:26,120
Like just look the racks the haphazard racks in front it looks shit.

1566
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:33,120
So figure out a way to seamlessly integrate buying things into the Main Street cinema and I'm on board.

1567
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,120
I'm I'm easy in this regard.

1568
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:45,120
I think if it's like black and white Mickey if it's like throwback stuff for Steamboat Willie merch and they make it a little more tasteful.

1569
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,120
They could get away with it.

1570
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:52,120
Or yeah if they switch the cartoon if they rotate in like Mickey over the years could be fun.

1571
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:57,120
Like that's interesting that they just had Mickey's like 90th birthday.

1572
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,120
Right.

1573
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:03,120
They should have just done all the Mickey over the years and had a bunch of shorts playing there.

1574
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:12,120
For the 50th anniversary or maybe a different anniversary showed unearthed or opening day footage.

1575
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,120
Oh yes.

1576
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:19,120
Like not the special not the Ronald Reagan hosted special but like somebody's footage.

1577
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,120
In color.

1578
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:25,120
So being able to watch color Disneyland footage from 55.

1579
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,120
That's a pretty good use of it.

1580
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,120
I think they should do more stuff like that.

1581
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,120
Yeah I would agree with that.

1582
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:33,120
Fun stuff maybe once in a while you go in and there's a character hanging out.

1583
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:36,120
Sure like you just have to watch a movie with.

1584
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:39,120
Yeah with the Phantom.

1585
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:43,120
The Phantom's in there sometimes and you can walk watch a movie with them.

1586
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,120
I don't need any movie previews.

1587
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:51,120
Those movie previews are always kind of a drag when they dedicate a screen to that.

1588
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,120
Yeah.

1589
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,120
Yeah.

1590
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:59,120
I think I think changing stuff out making that an interesting place to go for some reason.

1591
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:08,120
Making stuff like reasons you would go back a lot to like little fun stuff like you never really know what's going to be in there maybe or you never know.

1592
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,120
Plung the archives a little more.

1593
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:15,120
They do those Turner Classic movie Disney nights of like some shorts and some live action stuff some history stuff.

1594
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,120
Some nature documentaries like.

1595
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,120
Yeah.

1596
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:26,120
It was totally randomized and you didn't know if they just plugged in all the shorts from 28 to 58 and you didn't know what.

1597
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,120
Oh yeah that'd be great.

1598
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:31,120
Yeah and like one of them was like a ride through of inner space or something.

1599
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,120
Journey through inner space.

1600
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,120
Like some weird old ride thing like stuff like that.

1601
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:38,120
I feel like you could suck 50 people in.

1602
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,120
World's fair footage.

1603
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,120
100 people in an hour.

1604
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:45,120
Legitimately how expensive could it be to make that for somebody to like curate.

1605
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,120
Yeah.

1606
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:49,120
I think every but a new thing every month you know the old Chuck E. Cheese pace.

1607
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,120
Sure.

1608
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,120
Yeah.

1609
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:55,120
Just a little like and it was somebody would freak out over by us if we had that job.

1610
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,120
Oh yeah.

1611
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,120
Yeah.

1612
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,120
Yeah.

1613
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:01,120
Leonard Moulton already does it like as a hobby like he already does.

1614
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,120
Throw Moulton in there.

1615
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:03,120
Yeah.

1616
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,120
Let him do it via satellite.

1617
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,120
Yeah.

1618
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:09,120
He just has to drag drag some clips into boxes or just send an email saying play this now.

1619
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,120
Yeah right.

1620
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:15,120
Legitimately good angle having him curate like Tarantino taking over the new Beverly.

1621
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,120
Yes.

1622
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,120
Moulton.

1623
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,120
We said now Moulton's curating Main Street Cinema.

1624
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,120
Sure.

1625
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:23,120
Have him beam in every day at 5 p.m.

1626
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:26,120
Just like Jimmy Fallon in a dream.

1627
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:27,120
Yes.

1628
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,120
Yeah.

1629
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:32,120
I don't yeah making it sort of a respectable like Disney archive.

1630
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,120
Sure.

1631
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,120
Yeah and that would eat a couple folks.

1632
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,120
Yeah.

1633
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:42,120
I mean they could even like you they go even crazier and like have like legit like interesting

1634
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:45,120
screening things in there and like have you make a reservation.

1635
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:50,120
And we're doing that for a little while at Lincoln like annual pass holders.

1636
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:53,120
I caught they showed a wonderful world of Disney about one of the parks.

1637
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:56,120
It was like Thursdays for a few months.

1638
01:17:56,120 --> 01:18:01,120
Annual pass holders could go to the Lincoln Theater and they would show a wonderful world

1639
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,120
at Disney from the 50s or 60s.

1640
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,120
Sure.

1641
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:05,120
That was neat.

1642
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,120
Yeah.

1643
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:12,120
Or my last suggestion will be show the Oscars in the Main Street Cinema like when we watched

1644
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,120
it we watched the Oscars a couple years ago.

1645
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,120
That was great.

1646
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,120
In Lincoln.

1647
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,120
In the Lincoln Theater.

1648
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,120
Wow.

1649
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,120
Yeah.

1650
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,120
Wow.

1651
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:21,120
Yeah.

1652
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,120
They did that.

1653
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,120
Wow is right.

1654
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,120
Yeah.

1655
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,120
It's an annual pass thing.

1656
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:28,120
That was the last time the Main Street Parade came back forever for the last time.

1657
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,120
The Electro Parade.

1658
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,120
Oh that's right.

1659
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,120
Yeah.

1660
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,120
God constantly.

1661
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,120
They trick us every time.

1662
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,120
Yeah do something interesting in there.

1663
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:40,120
If they let the fan outrage if we can say that's what it was we should teach them.

1664
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:42,120
It should be a teachable moment.

1665
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:45,120
I hope people are going in there now.

1666
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,120
If it's driving more people in there very good.

1667
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,120
Fine.

1668
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:53,120
Well you know that in the last couple weeks there's been a lot of people going and planning

1669
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:57,120
and really determined like doggedly determined.

1670
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:00,120
Okay I'm going to sit and I'm going to watch it.

1671
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,120
They're angry while they do it.

1672
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:04,120
They're like making a point.

1673
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,120
This is great.

1674
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,120
Honestly best thing in the park.

1675
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,120
Yeah.

1676
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:12,120
They make it pictures of them from a lot of dragging people in.

1677
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:15,120
See make it look like it's full.

1678
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,120
I mean that's true.

1679
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,120
Periscoping it.

1680
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,120
Yeah.

1681
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,120
Yeah.

1682
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:25,120
I can't believe we got in here the line outside is so crazy.

1683
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:28,120
They're taking boarding groups just like Galaxy's Edge.

1684
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,120
But two is empty.

1685
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,120
Main Street cinema full.

1686
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:35,120
But you know what if the Disney brass ever tries to take away this beloved attraction

1687
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,120
again you know what we say to them.

1688
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,120
Soak your head.

1689
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,120
Fresh boy.

1690
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,120
Fresh boy.

1691
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,120
Hey JPEC.

1692
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,120
JPEC.

1693
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,120
Soak your head fresh boy.

1694
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:48,120
You survived podcast the ride.

1695
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:49,120
We should sell that on a shirt.

1696
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,120
Yeah we should put that on a shirt.

1697
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,120
Yeah.

1698
01:19:52,120 --> 01:20:02,120
I guess the right check I sat on T public for soak your head fresh boy shirts and if

1699
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:06,120
you if we ever do anything on the show that you don't like hashtag soak your head fresh

1700
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:09,120
boy on on Twitter or Instagram.

1701
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:13,120
But please don't actually soak our heads if you see my god no.

1702
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,120
Please no.

1703
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:18,120
I would fold like a card table start crying.

1704
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:23,120
And if you're a cow lady hands off that bell away from me.

1705
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,120
All right.

1706
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,120
Thanks for listening.
