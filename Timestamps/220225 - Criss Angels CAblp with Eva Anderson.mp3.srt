1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,680
Dog.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,080
All right everyone, looks like we're wrapping up

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,300
our celebuary.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,600
Can I interest you in anything magic themed?

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,600
Okay, how about a restaurant run by a magician

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,400
that isn't magic themed, except sometimes when it is?

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,360
Great, and would you care for that to be an hour

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,680
outside of Las Vegas?

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,600
Excellent choice.

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,840
Okay, Eva Anderson will be right out with a big plate

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,440
of Chris Angel's restaurant, Ka Blip.

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,520
Happy Celebuary, this is Podcast the Ride.

14
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,020
["Podcast the Ride Theme Song"]

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,560
Welcome to the grand finale of Podcast the Ride's

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,440
a month long celebration of celebrity owned restaurants.

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,280
I'm a legitimately sad Scott Gardner

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,360
joined by Jason Sheridan.

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,120
I'm just, I've loved this month, loved it.

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,640
If you love it, set it free.

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,280
Oh, I don't think so.

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,120
Thankfully the confusion will start to override

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,680
the longing and the nostalgia with this episode.

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,800
Oh, this will feel like when you have a really great

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,800
vacation but then there's a bunch of travel hassle

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,280
on the way back and then you're like,

27
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,080
oh good, I'm just glad to be back at home.

28
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,120
Yeah, yeah.

29
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,200
Maybe that's where this goes.

30
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,400
Mike Carlson, hi.

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,680
I'm here, yes.

32
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,040
Look, this has been a wonderful month of saying

33
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,640
different names from the normal names we usually say.

34
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,480
Otherwise I say that.

35
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,720
You're Bob Gurr once.

36
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,240
We haven't said Bob Gurr once this whole month.

37
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,560
We haven't said, I don't know,

38
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,360
oh actually we've said Robert Earl a lot.

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,160
A little bit low on bad boys from Boston.

40
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,640
Not as much Aerosmith as you normally would say.

41
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,920
One or two, but I thought you were going somewhere else

42
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,520
I was gonna say, plenty of weird names today.

43
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,240
Well that's, yes, that's fair.

44
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,720
I haven't talked about the intimacy of any of these places.

45
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,560
So there's all these things.

46
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,200
Well again, maybe today.

47
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,880
This is an intimate setting, I feel.

48
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,240
You might also be, well I don't know,

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,240
listener, you might be looking at the title

50
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,600
of today's episode and it's not something

51
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,400
that you're familiar with.

52
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,640
This is not some in the past situation.

53
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,160
This is playing out in real time

54
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,520
and we get to talk to somebody who has experienced this

55
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,520
in the recent past, who's part of the story.

56
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,320
And hey, another sad thing about after this,

57
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,920
that no longer doing her residency,

58
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,600
closing out the residency,

59
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,400
but let's have one more good one here.

60
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,720
The great Eva Anderson.

61
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,040
Oh guys, I'm so sad, but I'm so happy.

62
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,600
Don't cry, cause it's over.

63
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,920
It's crying.

64
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,240
Laugh, cause it happens?

65
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,320
Absolutely.

66
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,120
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right.

67
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,960
Oh yeah.

68
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,800
No, I don't know about that.

69
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,960
Well, now that's a reference we use all the time.

70
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,120
Oh no, let's drag this one out.

71
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,200
No more, I want this one to never end.

72
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,640
Eva, thank you for joining us.

73
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,480
Oh my God.

74
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,280
And to, I think of all of the,

75
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,840
I think I've said this on many of the celebrity episodes

76
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,720
and about celebrity in general, it's been long in the works.

77
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,880
This one in particular, I would say, this is a,

78
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,200
I don't know, it's been going a while,

79
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,360
it's been building a while, there's a rich backstory here.

80
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,480
I'm so excited, you're talking to us about it.

81
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,680
Talking about Kblip.

82
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,240
Kblip, it's Kblip.

83
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,080
Kblip.

84
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,240
I guess, yeah, it hasn't been said out loud, right?

85
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,080
No, no.

86
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,840
And which kind of answers a question you might have,

87
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,400
listeners, when you look at this title, how do you say it?

88
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,440
And I don't think, remember how we didn't know

89
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,280
for a little bit?

90
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,400
I don't think he had ever clarified.

91
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,160
It's an awful lot of consonants next to each other.

92
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,760
To be fair, we also didn't know how to pronounce

93
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,040
grandpa's belegante before.

94
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,400
And you still didn't say it right.

95
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,240
What was it?

96
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,680
Gentay, I believe.

97
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,320
So embarrassed.

98
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,840
I'll edit it out and I'll make it sound like

99
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,760
I knew what I was talking about.

100
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,320
In May of 2021, we all were introduced to the word Kblip.

101
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,440
When the press release went out,

102
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,440
Chris Angel was opening a restaurant,

103
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,720
magician Chris Angel, called Kblip,

104
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,640
Chris Angel's breakfast, lunch, and pizza.

105
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,480
Of course.

106
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,240
What an intriguing rollout.

107
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,800
You look at some confusing consonants.

108
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,360
What could that possibly stand for?

109
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,840
Maybe if you were a real detective,

110
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,800
you would get that CA is Chris Angel,

111
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,920
but how could you possibly guess the rest?

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,520
When is this phrase ever been?

113
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,880
He invented a new phrase, first of all,

114
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,800
breakfast, lunch, and pizza.

115
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,600
It's kind of interesting in that pizza is not,

116
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,520
you think that we're going through breakfast,

117
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,000
lunch, and dinner, we're going through meal times,

118
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,480
but instead it ends at pizza.

119
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,480
Is pizza like sort of the prestige

120
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,400
as far as that phrase is concerned?

121
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,920
Like the, I don't know how you,

122
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,600
what are the parts of a trick, a magic trick?

123
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,520
The prompt, is it the pledge, the turn, the prestige?

124
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,640
Yeah, I mean, you expect it to be dinner, but it's pizza.

125
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,960
Like it's the turn.

126
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,800
Yeah.

127
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,720
Well, you're forgetting the part of the magic trick

128
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,520
where really loud corn music plays.

129
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,880
So maybe it's that.

130
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,880
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.

131
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,160
Yeah.

132
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,040
Do you recall taking a stab as to what it,

133
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,760
how it would be pronounced before we were educated

134
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,880
that it was Kblip?

135
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,120
Oh, definitely, because we only saw it in print, right?

136
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,120
Until he actually recorded himself saying it,

137
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,280
which was months later.

138
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

139
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,160
It was only announced in print form.

140
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,080
I feel like I would have guessed like Kablp.

141
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,040
Kablp, Kabliple.

142
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,760
Yeah, I think we were trying.

143
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,760
Kablip.

144
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,600
Kablip.

145
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,360
Could be Kable P.

146
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,200
Yeah.

147
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,040
Kable P.

148
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,840
Could be all viable.

149
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,640
But I mean, how to even get into this,

150
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,000
and why the Criss Angel fascination, I suppose.

151
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,600
Like, why was there so much interest

152
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,600
in this odd arbitrary celebrity venture even then?

153
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,720
And I feel like the answer is you've had an ongoing

154
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,360
Criss Angel fascination to some extent.

155
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,640
Right.

156
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,880
But there was a person who got me into Criss Angel initially.

157
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,000
Yes, indeed.

158
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,520
That being Jason Walliner, who happened to be our guest

159
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,560
a few weeks ago for Dive,

160
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,160
back at the beginning of this glorious month of Celebrewery.

161
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,040
Well, while Jason was here with us to talk about Dive,

162
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,640
we took a little time to discuss his ongoing relationship

163
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,880
with Criss Angel.

164
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,200
We take you to that conversation now.

165
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,240
Okay, we're here in the past with Jason Walliner

166
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,240
and Diva Anderson as well.

167
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,760
Eva's taken us on a journey through Kablip,

168
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,120
which Jason, I know you were very versed in,

169
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,960
but just kind of a setup to everything,

170
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,520
because she's credited you as being maybe the person

171
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,960
who brought the wonder and the magic of Criss Angel

172
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,680
to kind of this group of people.

173
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,880
If there's anything you'd like to talk about

174
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,640
in terms of your Criss Angel journey.

175
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,480
Yeah, mine was when he first came on the scene,

176
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,240
we were doing videos in New York with this,

177
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,160
as this group, Human Giant, me and Paul Scheer

178
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,720
and Aziz Ansari and Rob Hubel.

179
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,880
It was even before,

180
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,920
it was before we had an MTV show, before anything,

181
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,040
and those guys were obsessed with Criss Angel

182
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,560
and we flew ourselves to Vegas.

183
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,000
Oh no, maybe we were there doing something

184
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,480
for that show, Best Week Ever,

185
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,160
but we were just running around the strip

186
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,400
with those guys in long wigs

187
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,240
and we filmed something called Illusionators.

188
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,440
That was like a Criss Angel,

189
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,240
it was like a parody of Criss Angel.

190
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,040
Where everybody, was it Paul and Aziz were?

191
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,280
And they had the lisp like him a little bit.

192
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,960
They had the lisp, yeah.

193
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,760
And yeah, this was pre the show, Eva,

194
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,600
this was like one of the first things

195
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,560
you guys did together was Criss Angel.

196
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,960
This was just, yeah, and it was before YouTube

197
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,840
and so it was just, I guess,

198
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,840
to show at like a live show at UCB in 2005 or six or something.

199
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,440
So it was like 15 to 16 years ago.

200
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,280
Jeez, it's been a long journey, I really like to have.

201
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,240
Everything, I feel like 10 years

202
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,680
got added to any amount of time.

203
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,760
Any, like COVID somehow added not two,

204
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,080
but 10 years to any number.

205
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,920
Anyway.

206
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,080
He had that show Mindfreak and then we did that

207
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,600
and then we got a show on MTV, we did a few of those.

208
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,040
And then we had gone to see him in Vegas at some point

209
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,720
and I've never met him.

210
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,880
He met those guys at one point and he was just like,

211
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,040
I think he was like,

212
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,480
Imitations, the sincerest form of flattery.

213
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,480
And then we all kind of fell out of touch.

214
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,760
I fell out of touch and then I was in Vegas,

215
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,000
I guess about five years ago with a group of people

216
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,840
and we were like, we should just go see the Chris Angel show.

217
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,080
I remember being nuts and we saw it

218
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,880
and it was just way more nuts than,

219
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,920
it was a totally different show

220
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,320
and it was completely crazy and really funny.

221
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,360
One of the funniest things I had ever seen.

222
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,400
And then wound up just telling everyone

223
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,920
and making people and going back,

224
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,960
I think I've gone like four times.

225
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,040
And then Eva and I and a few friends,

226
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,840
Tom Sharpling and maybe John Daly, was he there?

227
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,680
Was he there?

228
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,600
He left before the fundraiser.

229
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,640
He wasn't at the fundraiser.

230
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,800
He was at the show that we went back to Vegas to see it

231
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,640
and I got kicked out of that show.

232
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,040
It wasn't because I was like screaming,

233
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,120
laughing the whole time.

234
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,080
It was because there's a segment of the show

235
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,160
and it's kind of hard to talk about without

236
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,560
without being insensitive, but there's a segment.

237
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,880
Very, very tragically, but also currently not tragically,

238
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,880
Chris has a son named Johnny Christopher

239
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,680
that is dealing with having pediatric cancer.

240
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,400
And so that is one of the most important things to Chris

241
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,800
and he's done a lot of charity work with it

242
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,320
and it's very admirable.

243
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,160
There's a part of this show that was,

244
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,040
or still is in the show, Mind Freak,

245
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,040
that is like a 20 minute thing about pediatric cancer,

246
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,160
which obviously is very serious,

247
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,440
but also this segment of the show

248
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,160
is one of the craziest things I've ever seen.

249
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,640
Too included in a magic show with goth vibes

250
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,800
and industrial music and it's a real tonal shift.

251
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,880
It's a real tonal shift.

252
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,480
It gets very serious and very upsetting

253
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,040
when you're in the middle of this really crazy magic show

254
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,200
talking about his story.

255
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,760
But then the trick he was doing,

256
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,800
he doesn't quite do the same thing,

257
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,240
the trick he was doing was that he talks about

258
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,240
what a horrible thing it is and how hard it is for families,

259
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,960
but then the trick was that I think he wheeled out

260
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,880
a hot assistant on stage in a wheelchair

261
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,080
made to look like a kid battling cancer,

262
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,560
so she had a bald cap and a wheelchair

263
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,040
full of stuffed animals and then he made her levitate

264
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,160
and revealed her to be hot and floated and cured her

265
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,880
and floated up underneath her.

266
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,760
And cured her.

267
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,160
Yeah, yeah.

268
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,000
Let's not rush past that person.

269
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,520
He was like, but tonight is about life

270
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,960
and then it just immediately became like a laser dance party

271
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,920
with these like Jabberwocky kind of knockoffs

272
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,240
like doing these flips and him with like a laser

273
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,960
and a mirror making the laser go all over,

274
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,160
playing this like techno music

275
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,480
and it's just like so crazy and such a,

276
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,560
I mean, but also so personal and it just hits

277
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,560
that sweet spot of like very sincere and also very insane.

278
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,000
In a show that also includes,

279
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,600
like my strongest memory of it was there's a runner of,

280
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,120
there's people who have blue paint

281
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,880
kind of coming off of their,

282
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,160
or is it just one character,

283
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,800
is it like a woman who has some blue paint

284
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,240
streaked out of her mouth?

285
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,000
Oh, because she sucked the woman's dick?

286
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,600
She blew the blue man.

287
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,440
Oh, that's right.

288
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,160
That's when we first saw it,

289
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,320
it was just so full of like jokes like that

290
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,640
and he would bring a guy up on stage and be like,

291
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,400
how thick do you think this platform is?

292
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,800
And the guy's like, I don't know, three inches.

293
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,880
And he's like, three inches.

294
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,000
Like just like some dick jokes.

295
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,760
And just really, oh, and then he had this,

296
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,680
oh gosh, there was this like the maestro,

297
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,320
that was a character that's no longer with the show

298
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,120
of this little Latino guy, just really offensive

299
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,960
who was with this heavy woman.

300
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,800
I mean, it was just like, it was a crazy amalgam

301
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,240
of like jokes and serious stuff

302
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
like the childhood cancer segment.

303
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,000
Sorry, punctuated by Jonathan Davis music,

304
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,200
the guy from Korn.

305
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,680
Oh, yeah.

306
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,960
And then a guy on stage like wailing on the guitar,

307
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,640
playing it live, I think.

308
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,400
And so then we went back to see,

309
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,720
cause he was doing, oh, so he was doing this benefit

310
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,720
for his charity, Help, which does stand for

311
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,560
Heal Every Life Possible.

312
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,240
But Tony Orlando, who was the host,

313
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,600
kept saying that it stood for Help Every Living Person.

314
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,600
He just chanted, Help Every Living Person.

315
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,440
It wasn't correct.

316
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,600
And it's like, how do you do that?

317
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,080
And so Chris Angel's always had a kind of a problem

318
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,120
with acronyms.

319
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,960
Yeah.

320
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,760
It's a tough area for him.

321
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,440
And so we saw the regular show

322
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,560
and then we were seeing the benefit

323
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,400
and during the regular show,

324
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,000
we were all drinking and having fun

325
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,960
and just marveling at it.

326
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,360
But then that night he had, after the cancer segment,

327
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,960
he's in the audience, ladies and gentlemen,

328
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,360
Johnny Christopher, and he had brought his son there.

329
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,600
It was like 11 o'clock at night

330
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,360
and the kid was like, three, I think.

331
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,000
And then he holds him up and I was like, wow, that's crazy.

332
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,960
And then he had a guy from the show

333
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,480
walk to the middle of the aisle and start taking photos.

334
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,680
And my kind of drunk brain was like,

335
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,200
oh, I guess we can take photos of this part.

336
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,120
So I pulled out my phone and just started taking photos.

337
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,000
And then five seconds later, a guy was like, you, out.

338
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,520
And they pulled me out of my seat, walked me to the back.

339
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,360
I was like, I'm so sorry.

340
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,280
I was so excited.

341
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,760
And I saw the other guy taking photos

342
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,960
and he's like, delete him.

343
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,200
And I had to go through and I deleted it.

344
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,640
And then another one popped up.

345
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,000
He's like, that one too.

346
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,520
And I had taken in the span of 10 seconds, 65 photos.

347
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,760
And I had to delete everyone.

348
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,360
I was like, can I go back to my seat now?

349
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,560
He's like, no, you're banned.

350
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,000
I was like, no.

351
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,880
Did he do forever?

352
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,720
Did he take a picture?

353
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,560
No, it was only for that night.

354
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,800
I could not go back to the show,

355
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,560
but luckily I was able to go back to the benefit,

356
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,000
which was great, yeah.

357
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,800
It was four hours long.

358
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,760
There were stars in it, right?

359
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Gary Oldman was there.

360
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,960
What?

361
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,800
Oh my God.

362
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,920
Gary Oldman is Chris Angel's best friend.

363
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,960
We all know that, right?

364
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,880
They are best friends.

365
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,040
If you look it up, it's well-documented.

366
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,880
Really?

367
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,120
Wait, Emmanuel Lewis, you said?

368
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,280
Oh.

369
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,880
Gary Oldman.

370
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,960
Oh, okay, yes.

371
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,800
Wait, did somebody say Emmanuel Lewis?

372
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,760
I thought you said, I heard something.

373
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,560
That was a phantom phrase.

374
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,800
I wanted it to be true so badly.

375
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
Scott has Emmanuel Lewis' name ringing in his ears.

376
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,640
I know, I bet you did.

377
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,480
Did somebody say Emmanuel Lewis?

378
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,600
He probably was there.

379
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,080
It was Gary Oldman, Andrew Dice Clay,

380
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,440
Carrot Top, Flavor Flav, Siegfried and Roy,

381
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,560
Jerry Lewis in his last live appearance.

382
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,400
Wow.

383
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,240
Wow.

384
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,200
Ever?

385
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,200
So Rick Thomas, so many, who's that other guy?

386
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,040
Something Brown, this in person.

387
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,080
Yeah, it was a who's who.

388
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,320
Terry Fader?

389
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,160
At one point.

390
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,000
Is Terry Fader there?

391
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,360
I think he did, maybe.

392
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,720
Yeah, he did one bit.

393
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,160
Jerry Lewis said in his small presentation

394
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,400
that he had just completed a movie,

395
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,840
which was his last movie, that he said

396
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,840
was like perfect reviews right now on tomatoes.

397
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,320
And Tom Sharpling was next to me

398
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,240
and he just like opened his phone up, looked it up.

399
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,440
It was like a 15%.

400
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,440
Perfect reviews, perfect 50%.

401
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,360
My shining moment though was,

402
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,680
cause we were way up in the balcony

403
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,640
and you had to bid, you could bid on things from his life

404
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,280
and then that band Imagine Dragons

405
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,240
came out to introduce one of the items

406
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,240
and they were just like, the main guy was like,

407
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,120
childhood cancer is a serious thing

408
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,920
that affects so many families in the United States.

409
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,480
I can't even imagine and I just said, dragons.

410
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,480
And then like the whole section started laughing

411
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,200
and then I was like, man, if he can't imagine dragons,

412
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
we're all in trouble.

413
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,760
Just completely being idiots, jerks.

414
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,160
Do you remember this Jason, that we found out

415
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,920
ahead of time that there was like a,

416
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,040
one of the things you could bid on was to spend the weekend

417
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,400
in Chris Angel's house and like have the whole run

418
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,360
of his like weird goth palace.

419
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,240
Yeah, we tried to get it.

420
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,080
We actually like put all our money together

421
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,240
and then leading up to the moment you got on the phone

422
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,120
with a bunch of people in LA and got them to commit.

423
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,240
Yeah, I think Nathan Fielder was gonna go in.

424
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,080
Yeah, we were gonna.

425
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,320
She was gonna go in.

426
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,680
I just watched that clip recently.

427
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,680
I think you can hear they're like, can we have a bid?

428
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,840
And I think you're the first bid.

429
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,680
Whoa.

430
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,520
Because it went for like what?

431
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,840
Like how many?

432
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,360
Within seconds we were outbid.

433
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,680
Yeah, but I think it went for like at least 25,000,

434
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,120
maybe a lot more than that.

435
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,960
But they're like, okay, a weekend at Chris Angel's mansion

436
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,800
with a private cook and blah, blah, blah.

437
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,200
And they're like, do we have any bids?

438
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,280
And Eva was just like $300.

439
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,480
That's all you got to do between all this.

440
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,680
We had a high, we had a low.

441
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,600
We were starting low.

442
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,440
We were starting.

443
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,280
You don't wanna start with your max.

444
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,200
But some like, someone from Abu Jabi

445
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,200
clearly bought it for like, it's just a ridiculous sum.

446
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,240
One person as opposed to 50 compiled from multiple cities.

447
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,120
That's really insane.

448
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,160
Mike, you were saying you had some, a celebrity presence.

449
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,000
Oh yeah, yeah.

450
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,000
When you saw Chris.

451
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,080
So I saw the Chris Angel show, Mind Freak.

452
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,160
I saw it, I was alone.

453
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,040
I was in the last row.

454
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,800
I was in Vegas alone for a night.

455
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,120
Which I remember, I remember Bugman texting me

456
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,000
and saying, I'm at Disney.

457
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,280
And I go, well, I'm in Vegas.

458
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,360
He goes, on a Thursday, who are you, me?

459
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,520
But I was there like a night before.

460
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,360
There's a wrestling show.

461
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,720
Anyway, so I'm alone and I'm loving the whole show.

462
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,520
And he does the whole rave at the end.

463
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,200
It's a big celebratory thing.

464
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,080
And then he goes, I want to introduce a special guest

465
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,240
who's here.

466
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,400
Ladies and gentlemen, Pitbull.

467
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,680
And Pitbull comes up on stage and they just like,

468
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,360
they just praise each other back and forth

469
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,200
for like seven minutes.

470
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,120
There's no song, he doesn't do anything.

471
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,960
He was just in.

472
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,800
Not part of an illusion?

473
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,640
Nothing.

474
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,460
Nothing.

475
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,400
He's just there to exchange pleasantries for like minutes.

476
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,720
And it's even, I was, everyone around me

477
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,440
could have given a shit about it.

478
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,000
I feel like I was just like looking around

479
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,960
for like strangers, like what?

480
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,440
Do you see Pitbull?

481
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,840
And they're just like, whatever,

482
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,880
we got like comp tickets from the hotel.

483
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,400
And it couldn't have been a better ending to that show.

484
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,960
So he, Chris brings it.

485
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,320
It's spectacle.

486
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,880
He brings his A-game to everything he does.

487
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,440
And we're gonna find out if that is also true

488
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,160
of his restaurant, which I know that you're very versed in,

489
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,280
have not been yet.

490
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,040
But is there anything you'd like to say in advance

491
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,440
about Kblip as we start to dive in?

492
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,640
Is there anything you wanna make sure

493
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,480
that we sufficiently address?

494
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,920
I mean, just are you, or just how excited are you to go?

495
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,960
I'm just so excited to go.

496
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,960
I think, well, I'm trying to wrangle a group

497
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,560
to go in March or April,

498
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,480
cause Chris is unveiling a new show,

499
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,480
a Mystica, it's called, A-M-Y-S-T-I-K-A.

500
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,360
That's a prequel to Mindfreak, which is interesting,

501
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,200
cause Mindfreak does not have a story.

502
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Unless it's about the first child who ever got cancer.

503
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,480
If we're going back to the beginnings of cancer.

504
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,440
The first show that split.

505
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,120
But it will definitely hit Kblip then.

506
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,360
So I know I am so excited.

507
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,080
I'm so excited to hear what you guys say about it.

508
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,080
And yeah, I can't wait.

509
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,080
Fantastic.

510
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,640
All right, well, we're gonna then go back to the future.

511
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,000
Eva's coming back with us.

512
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,160
So you stay, Jason, you survived podcast right again.

513
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,840
Thank you.

514
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
Let's go back to the future.

515
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,200
Okay, thank you, Jason.

516
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,040
Thank you.

517
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,160
No longer the Alec Baldwin of podcast The Ride.

518
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,200
So that fills us in on some of it.

519
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,640
If we can remember what he said back then.

520
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,720
I mean, so, I mean, point being you've seen him,

521
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,600
you've been enamored with his man.

522
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,360
We've all seen, wait, I forget Jason.

523
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,200
I have not seen it.

524
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,040
You have not seen it.

525
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,240
I saw the show and I saw Pitbull.

526
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,400
I, yeah.

527
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Chris Angel, Jason Waller told me about the show

528
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,000
and I drove to Vegas the next morning and saw it.

529
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,200
That's how I saw Chris Angel the first time.

530
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,240
He, we were at the Magic Castle.

531
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,240
He described the show to me.

532
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,840
I got in my car at nine in the morning,

533
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,240
just drove straight to Vegas, saw that show that day.

534
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,000
So I'm sorry, just to confirm,

535
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,320
you were in one magic based environment.

536
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,160
Yeah.

537
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,920
I slept eight hours or so, it was six to eight hours.

538
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,600
Then in the morning, got in your car

539
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,400
and drove to a second magic entertainment based environment.

540
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,960
Yes. Okay.

541
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,320
Then, like two years later,

542
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,800
Chris opens a new show at Planet Hollywood.

543
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,760
The first one was at the Luxor.

544
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,760
Second show was at Planet Hollywood.

545
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,960
He announced- Incredible by the way

546
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,400
that he's also tied to Planet Hollywood

547
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,440
and therefore Earl, all the pieces of celebrity

548
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,280
come together.

549
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,880
Right, or where was the Nitro Grill?

550
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,240
Nitro Grill was at Excalibur.

551
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,400
Excalibur, sorry, yeah.

552
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,440
But she is right there.

553
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,280
Yeah. Yeah.

554
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,120
So I found out I was going to start a job.

555
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,160
I had like two days.

556
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,360
Chris Angel announces that he's opening his new show,

557
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,840
Mind Freak at Planet Hollywood,

558
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,840
that it's a totally new show and it's immersive.

559
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,680
Oh. Right.

560
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,760
I get in my car, I drive to Vegas that morning.

561
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,800
I buy the meet and greet ticket.

562
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,040
I get my picture taken with Chris Angel,

563
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,080
which should be advertising this episode actually.

564
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,800
Yeah, sure, yes, yes, yes, please, yeah.

565
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,960
He hugged me.

566
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,800
Wow.

567
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,080
As I walked away, they said,

568
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,280
okay, that's the last meet and greet

569
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,080
Chris will do for the rest of his life.

570
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,920
I don't know why they said that.

571
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,760
What?

572
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,200
I don't know, it's really weird.

573
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,360
And also the weird thing is that

574
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,120
the picture you took with him, he ages in the picture,

575
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,760
but in real life he stays the same.

576
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,600
Yes.

577
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,360
It's like a Dorian Gray sort of scenario.

578
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,120
The show was not immersive in any way.

579
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,200
It was the exact same show he had been doing previously.

580
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,040
What?

581
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,240
The only thing that was different is that you walked

582
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,720
into the theater under a giant head of Chris Angel's.

583
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,560
Right.

584
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,160
That it was half one makeup, half the other makeup.

585
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,920
Otherwise, same show.

586
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,760
Okay.

587
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,800
Still defeats pediatric cancer at the end.

588
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,640
It's all the same.

589
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,520
And still spins around all fast, like that kind of thing.

590
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,200
Spins fast, upside down.

591
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Did I regret it?

592
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,320
No.

593
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,840
I never regret getting in my car and going.

594
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,440
You met it, was there any discussion?

595
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,480
Were there any particular words exchanged beyond the hug?

596
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,720
Oh, hey, hey.

597
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,000
Hey, yeah.

598
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,160
All right, bye.

599
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,080
That's what a meet and greet is.

600
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
Have you guys ever done one?

601
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,920
That's what it is.

602
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,840
It's hard to get anything in.

603
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,320
Jason and I waited eight hours to meet Bruce Springsteen.

604
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,280
Really?

605
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,160
Was he nice?

606
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah.

607
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,320
Hey, hey, hey.

608
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,160
I was like, how was it going, Bruce?

609
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,160
And he's like, this is weird.

610
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,000
Really?

611
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,680
Oh, that's sweet.

612
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,760
Yeah, I mean, it was an intense opera.

613
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,880
There were so many handlers.

614
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,040
There were so many people.

615
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,320
Couldn't really say much more than, hey, smile, thank you.

616
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,920
And it was at the Grove, too.

617
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,320
So seeing an abandoned 5 a.m. Grove shopping center.

618
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,160
Whoa.

619
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,240
And yeah, it did not go.

620
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,640
The wait was, I think, crazier than we thought.

621
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,520
They made a lot of mistakes

622
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,480
as far as the wait was concerned.

623
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,240
That's weird it wasn't at a concert.

624
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,040
The Grove, home of our future mayor, Rick Caruso.

625
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,880
Yeah.

626
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,080
He's gonna be our mayor.

627
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,360
He's the insane rich man?

628
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,440
He even would have built the Grove.

629
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,280
He's running for mayor.

630
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,120
Oh, okay.

631
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,160
He announced yesterday.

632
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,920
I assume that the plan includes

633
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,840
taking everything in the city.

634
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,600
I mean, like every house and library and post office

635
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,920
and making it look like the Grove, right?

636
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,760
I'm into that, yeah.

637
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,600
Tear down ground.

638
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,440
If that's the case.

639
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,680
Just arbitrary columns everywhere.

640
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Bug main lives above the Grove-ish breakfast club

641
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,720
on Hollywood Vine.

642
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,520
Yes, yeah.

643
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,160
Bug needs to be allowed a window everywhere in the city.

644
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,120
And I vote for him.

645
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,840
So that was 2018 with Chris Angel.

646
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,000
And then I feel like Chris Angel's

647
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,600
kind of faded into the background for a long time.

648
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,200
Personally, like you guys,

649
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,440
I got very interested in David Copperfield and Blue.

650
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,520
Kind of took the baton in terms of,

651
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,280
at least in this little scene of people.

652
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,760
I'd say David Copperfield became the MVP of Magicians.

653
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,040
And I feel like in the grand scopa thing,

654
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,680
like Chris Angel is very much stuck in the world

655
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,080
of like 2006, like the mid 2000s.

656
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,520
And that's what Vegas is perfect for.

657
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,720
You, whenever you were at the height of your powers,

658
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,760
you can just freeze yourself

659
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,760
and then do daily shows in Vegas and make a fortune.

660
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,720
For people who like don't mind that you're stuck in that era.

661
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,040
Yeah, for people who want to go on vacation

662
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,960
and see like the famous person that they remember.

663
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,040
But like, I feel like the difference is,

664
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,440
Chris Angel was famous, like cable TV famous.

665
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,040
And David Copperfield was famous

666
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,120
when there was a lot less television channels

667
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,960
and had like prime time specials watched by millions.

668
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,280
Sure, yeah, yeah.

669
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,960
Chris, David Copperfield dated Claudia Schiffer.

670
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,520
Yes. That's true.

671
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,240
There's an episode of The Americans

672
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,520
about them watching David Copperfield.

673
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,880
Like that's culturally relevant, right?

674
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,520
He's important. Right, right.

675
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,680
Chris Angel, bro. Chris is fun.

676
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,000
Yeah, I don't think we talked with Jason

677
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,840
about Mind Freak too much.

678
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,360
Did you watch the show?

679
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,480
Did any of us watch the show?

680
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,360
Do we have specific memories about his cable show?

681
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,680
I've only seen the clips of like the,

682
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,880
like taking a person and the person,

683
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,240
like he takes like the legs out from under someone

684
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,160
and like they're just their top half.

685
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,160
Am I crazy that that's?

686
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,560
That's probably one of them, yeah.

687
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,480
And there's like a fly, he would like fly quote unquote.

688
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,120
And it was all like, kind of like street magic,

689
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,040
but like more intense and extreme.

690
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,760
But he was never doing like the dangerous David Blaine stunts.

691
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,560
He just was like under the radar,

692
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,800
I feel like in a certain way.

693
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,960
But a certain type of person really loves Chris Angel.

694
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,280
It's his stead, I mean, he's got the Ed Hardy aesthetic

695
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,480
kind of thing going from that time.

696
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,400
That's I think a lot of what you think of is like,

697
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,080
I mean, maybe if people really know,

698
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,000
then you know what the illusions are.

699
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,800
But yeah, what's deafening to me is that style.

700
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,440
And it's that all of his graphics have like

701
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,200
big knots of thorns in him.

702
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,880
And it's, you know, fire transitions

703
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,400
and that he looks like the crow.

704
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,240
Yeah.

705
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,040
That's all the big, you know, if I had to,

706
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,120
if I was, what's the pyramid or something

707
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,520
where I'm trying to say everything but Chris Angel

708
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,200
to a partner is the clue.

709
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,200
Yeah, yeah, thorns, eyeliner, long black hair, crow.

710
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,760
Moxie claw. Strange voice, strange voice.

711
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,600
Lisp.

712
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,320
Jeans with designs on the butt.

713
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,960
Like very like embroidered jeans somehow.

714
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,240
Yeah. Yeah.

715
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,800
But he wants to change my answer.

716
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,400
Now, if I get Chris Angel as a clue on the pyramid,

717
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,120
I should be saying,

718
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,840
diner, family, home cooked meals,

719
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,800
connection with friends,

720
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,560
great place to eat after fun motorbike trip.

721
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,880
That's the thing.

722
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,880
His vibes are so all over the place.

723
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,880
Cause yes, he has raised a lot of money

724
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,680
for pediatric cancer research.

725
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,520
He also has the weird Ed Hardy aesthetic going.

726
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,600
And then he is like, I would say aggressively patriotic.

727
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,200
Like a guy you wouldn't,

728
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,480
I guess it's not surprising someone who carries that aesthetic

729
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,720
like is really like, God bless America patriotic,

730
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,840
but it is still strange to hear it come out of like,

731
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,120
you know, the extreme magicians mouth.

732
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,960
Such a creepy voice.

733
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,800
Yeah.

734
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,120
We take our patriots.

735
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,560
He's a Jersey Shore guy ultimately, right?

736
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,120
His name's Chris Seren Tacos.

737
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,040
His father owned a burger and ice cream restaurant.

738
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,520
And he worked in these from like Jersey.

739
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,240
Yeah.

740
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,400
So that sort of explains some of the blue collar feel.

741
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,160
Yeah. And it's a lot of, I don't know,

742
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,960
like there's a similar vibe.

743
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,520
I don't know if it's all magicians.

744
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,720
Maybe we've talked about this before.

745
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,680
I forgot.

746
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,720
They all have a similar thing of like,

747
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
people told me I couldn't do this.

748
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,320
People always look down on me.

749
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,640
And it's like, I saw Copperfield and Chris Angel

750
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,560
so close together and they both have very similar narratives

751
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,760
in their shows of like,

752
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,400
people said I was a loser and I would never be a magician,

753
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,800
but I proved them wrong.

754
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,920
My dad wanted me to not be a magician and own a restaurant.

755
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,240
I proved him wrong.

756
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,560
Like, what?

757
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,200
I proved I could do a different order.

758
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,480
Never let people tell you you can't do what you want to do.

759
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,200
Like that's the vibe.

760
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,720
All magicians have like chips on their shoulder

761
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,560
a little bit.

762
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,400
Yeah.

763
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,760
He's a Long Island guy.

764
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,120
Oh, sorry. He was born in Long Island.

765
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,720
Not Jersey, Long Island.

766
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,600
He might've probably likely went to Adventureland.

767
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,240
Yeah, he's a Disney guy.

768
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,200
He's a Disneyland fan, I believe.

769
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,440
So yeah, he obviously likes fun.

770
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,520
He likes fun.

771
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,360
You know, tricks.

772
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,200
One fun thing before we get into Kblip,

773
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,240
that in the 2000s at the kind of the height of his powers

774
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,400
around Mind Freak, he filmed an episode of MTV's Cribs.

775
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,280
Did anybody else come across this?

776
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,360
I've seen it in the past, but I didn't rewatch it.

777
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,240
So he has this compound in Vegas called Serenity.

778
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,200
Compound.

779
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,400
Do you have the notes open?

780
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,240
I do, yeah.

781
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,060
My notes?

782
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,200
On the first page,

783
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,480
I'll be...

784
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,320
Oh, I see.

785
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,160
Oh, okay.

786
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,980
Oh, you're giving it.

787
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,820
Oh, let me get it out.

788
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,660
I'm sorry.

789
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,480
You want me to give you a direction?

790
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,320
Oh, yeah.

791
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,160
This is great.

792
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,000
I love this.

793
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,840
At the bottom of the first page,

794
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,680
if you'll be...

795
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,760
Scott, if you'll be Chris.

796
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,620
Yes.

797
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,460
Sorry, Mike, you'll be Ed.

798
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,600
So Chris is introducing his personal chef,

799
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,060
whose name is Ed Bible.

800
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,040
Okay, so I'm saying...

801
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,120
It's the first line is Chris.

802
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

803
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,780
And wait a minute.

804
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,080
Oh, and then it's an Ed Bible line,

805
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,920
and that's the scene.

806
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,760
Okay, okay.

807
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,600
Gotcha.

808
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,060
I know nothing about cooking.

809
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,440
I can't even boil water.

810
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,500
That's why I have the best chef, Chef Ed.

811
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,460
Always preparing, always cooking.

812
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,120
Basically the same meal for me every day.

813
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,660
Grilled chicken, rice, four times a day.

814
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,500
That's it.

815
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,340
That's it.

816
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,160
Oh, you say it.

817
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,000
You say it.

818
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,840
That's it.

819
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,640
So, in his MTV Cribs,

820
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,840
he makes his chef talk about how he makes

821
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,140
grilled chicken and rice four times a day.

822
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,980
And that's...

823
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,800
Four.

824
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,640
That's it.

825
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,460
Four.

826
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,960
That's an odd meal amount.

827
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,040
That was all he was eating up till a point,

828
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,800
at the height of his pre-dad,

829
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,280
when he was not a family man.

830
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,080
He was on TV, was all sexy.

831
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,280
Very slight, slender, yeah, yeah.

832
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,700
There's also a part where he shows this Dolly painting

833
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,640
with Jesus, Dolly-inspired painting,

834
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,440
where he's cut his own hand and dripped blood on it.

835
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,280
Uh.

836
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,900
And made it look like it's Christ's blood,

837
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,800
but it's Chris's blood under the painting, on the floor.

838
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,640
Well, Chris is only one letter away from Christ.

839
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,060
That's actually my blood.

840
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,560
I actually cut my hand and did that.

841
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,560
And I just thought that was a very poetic

842
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,160
and profound piece of art.

843
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,000
Wow.

844
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,600
He's real sexy.

845
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,960
This is probably around the time he was dating

846
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,680
Holly Madison from The Girls Next Door.

847
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,840
After that show ended and she left LA and stuff.

848
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,860
And she talks about him being an insane man,

849
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,360
like being very possessive,

850
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,200
especially as ticket sales started to drop

851
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,100
or the show started to not go well.

852
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,920
I'm guessing the Luxor show.

853
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,920
And then she said he insisted on having one of his bodyguards

854
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,000
travel with her.

855
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,800
And she's like, yeah, I'd just be out to dinner with friends

856
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,120
and they'd be like, who is this?

857
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,880
I'm like, this is Christ Angel's bodyguard.

858
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,480
Which for me raises two questions.

859
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,320
One, why does a magician need bodyguards?

860
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:25,280
And second question, why does he have bodyguards to spare?

861
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,160
Why does he have lenders?

862
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,360
I got enemies everywhere.

863
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,160
Enemies always coming after me.

864
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,440
Other magicians, probably.

865
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,280
Well, other magicians, I mean, it seems like there is a lot.

866
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,200
They can disappear, they know sleight of hand.

867
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,600
They're not as good as me,

868
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,200
but they're better at magic than the bodyguards.

869
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,600
So they gotta watch out.

870
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,120
If Lance Burton gets a drop on me, I'll be ready.

871
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,360
It's a double, he must be using a double.

872
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,960
There's no other answer.

873
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,280
So there was like two years I lost track of him.

874
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,280
And then when pandemic started,

875
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,400
I feel like we were all kind of like looking in on,

876
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,600
like going back and looking in on people.

877
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,760
Cause like Copperfield was posting blue in a mask.

878
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,600
Just a photo.

879
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,720
Who was kind of like quiet.

880
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,480
If we weren't like spoiling it, there was that in the show.

881
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,080
Like there was not a lot of public blue stuff out there.

882
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,880
And then all of a sudden blue is doing little dances.

883
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,720
In a mask?

884
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,400
Did he do this, like did blue do the song about like,

885
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,120
wait, I'm gonna mess up the like, don't go out.

886
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,480
Don't stay, it's a famous song that's about.

887
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,680
Oh, right, right, right.

888
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,200
There was something like that.

889
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,240
There was something like where yeah,

890
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,280
blue was giving us a pandemic message.

891
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

892
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,960
Yeah.

893
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,600
I don't remember specifically.

894
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,840
But pivoted pretty quickly to like,

895
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,720
oh, this is the worst, huh?

896
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,720
Like, oh, when are we gonna open back up?

897
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,400
I feel like today's topic, some like,

898
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,240
when are we getting open?

899
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,320
And when are we getting rid of these masks?

900
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,160
Yeah.

901
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,120
You had a restaurant.

902
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:58,560
April 2020, he's like, I'm sick of being on the island.

903
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,760
What's it called?

904
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,480
Oh, yeah, Musha Kay.

905
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,920
Yeah, he's sick of Musha Kay.

906
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,600
David, when are we gonna open up the businesses, David?

907
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,400
I'm sick of being in your private museum, David.

908
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,240
Let me out of the private museum.

909
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,520
We've already eaten all the monkeys.

910
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,120
We gotta get off of here.

911
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,480
But I checked in on Chris during this time

912
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,920
and I totally missed, he had a second child.

913
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,480
So we already knew about Johnny Christopher

914
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,120
because Johnny Christopher is part of the show.

915
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,000
Right.

916
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,440
Christos Yanni had been born

917
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,720
and was just part of the gang as well.

918
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,560
And so he's like doing little,

919
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,400
he's doing little kind of,

920
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,600
we're doing pandemic things

921
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,560
with Johnny Christopher and Christos Yanni,

922
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,960
same name backwards.

923
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,160
That's very strange.

924
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,200
Yeah, wait, wait.

925
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,920
That's, okay.

926
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,360
Well, this is a whole thing, we'll keep finding this,

927
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,360
I don't wanna spoil all of them,

928
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,880
but in the Chris Angel world,

929
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,400
there's a big recurring thing of reusing names.

930
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,240
Reusing names.

931
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,560
For both products and children.

932
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,360
More than anything, names are finite to Chris

933
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,440
and he comes up with a name

934
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,000
and then he can't come up with any more names for a while.

935
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,600
So that wasn't so, but then May,

936
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,160
so for a full year, he was like,

937
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,520
being a little passive aggressive

938
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,360
with Anthony Fauci on Instagram,

939
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,080
mostly just showing his kids doing stuff.

940
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,720
Well, he was like, I wanna believe in you.

941
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,320
It was like this weird tension

942
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,720
of him seeing Fauci briefly unmasked

943
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,080
and be like, I got kids, my kid needs to be safe.

944
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,240
Wear your mask, Fauci.

945
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,960
So it was like that version of his, a little complicated.

946
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,800
Really analyzing him.

947
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,320
Fauci's with the pitch out at the baseball game

948
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,240
and I thought that was weird.

949
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,160
So I'm not totally on Fauci's side.

950
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,040
That's when he got mad though.

951
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,960
But then May 18th, 2021,

952
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,000
we find out for the first time about KaBlip

953
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,160
because there's a press conference, a press release.

954
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,840
It was only then, this is all within the year?

955
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,920
Yeah, and even according to another piece of media,

956
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,400
I'll explain later.

957
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,440
He discovered, so basically he had been dirt biking

958
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,960
in the Moapa Valley, which is an hour from Vegas

959
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,520
with Johnny Christopher and Christos Yanni.

960
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,280
He found this restaurant called Sugar's,

961
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,440
which was an old dining- Sugar's home plate?

962
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,600
Yeah.

963
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
And he was like, I'm gonna buy this restaurant

964
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,800
and make a restaurant.

965
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,040
What my dad wanted me to do, I'm gonna do it.

966
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,520
I'm gonna make, and it's gonna be breakfast,

967
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,800
lunch and pizza.

968
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,560
So here's one big thing to really hit

969
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,520
about this establishment.

970
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,880
I remember seeing the general idea of it

971
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,840
in the headline about it.

972
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,040
Chris Angel's opening up a restaurant outside of Vegas.

973
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,120
And I thought, I see, makes sense.

974
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,920
Oh, maybe it's like off strip.

975
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,520
Maybe it's in Fremont or even, or it's some odd,

976
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,040
it's a mile away.

977
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,640
There's fun things on the outskirts of Vegas.

978
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,440
Of course, why not?

979
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,280
Makes sense.

980
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,280
Then you learn that it is an hour Northeast of Vegas.

981
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,680
It is not even clay.

982
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,000
It's not just like, oh, it's a little bit of a cab.

983
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,120
It is a massive journey to take.

984
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,040
Here is a visual representation of that journey

985
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,480
from the Koopalip website.

986
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,880
And if you'll also notice, they have a little tagline.

987
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,120
Forget Vegas, I'm in Overton, Nevada,

988
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,960
eating with Chris, cowboys, bikers and aliens.

989
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,440
But that was put over the Google Maps JPEG.

990
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,200
Like there's text under it.

991
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,520
The scale and that.

992
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,880
And according to the website,

993
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,200
how long does it take to get there right now?

994
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,520
It's just a brisk 45 minutes.

995
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,400
It's only 63.2 miles.

996
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,680
45 minutes, okay.

997
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,400
That might figure in later.

998
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,440
That might factor in later that it says 45 minutes.

999
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,160
They've managed to find a way on Google Maps

1000
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,800
that it is from Las Vegas.

1001
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,080
The starting point is somewhere

1002
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,040
that is technically Las Vegas.

1003
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,400
But I looked up from Planet Hollywood

1004
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,520
because he pushes that.

1005
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,800
Come see my freak at Planet Hollywood

1006
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,800
and then come celebrate at Koopalip.

1007
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,720
Only 40, just 45 minutes away.

1008
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,960
But it's at least an hour three from Planet Hollywood.

1009
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,240
So what he specifically recommend, we're adding.

1010
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,480
And that 15 minutes ain't nothing.

1011
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,200
And it is a big old desert drive.

1012
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,360
Do we know the, do you know offhand the name of the park?

1013
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,520
Like it's a big sprawling, the Ring of Fire is that it?

1014
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,120
The Valley of Fire State Park.

1015
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,160
Which is supposed to be a beautiful place.

1016
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,480
Like an amazing natural wonder.

1017
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,960
I've been in there, it's really beautiful.

1018
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,680
But you drive through there

1019
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,040
and you really lose track of time and landmarks.

1020
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,600
And I remember that specifically being

1021
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,040
like a big long meandery drive.

1022
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,160
Which I'm only imagining here I haven't been.

1023
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,000
Yeah.

1024
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,400
So that's, so May 18th he announces Koopalip

1025
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,920
and there's just a ton of negative press.

1026
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,360
Including like the Vice headline is Chris Angel's Koopalip

1027
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,680
the worst restaurant name of all time.

1028
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,280
Which was when they asked a restaurant branding expert

1029
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,280
who was like, yes.

1030
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,320
If I could read a quote from that guy,

1031
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,920
I think he explained it really well.

1032
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,960
He also rationalized, like he was trying to think

1033
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,400
of anything that could take the cake and be worse.

1034
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,600
And he said like, well I have a distaste

1035
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,080
for like Hooters and Twin Peaks.

1036
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,600
Like I find those annoying.

1037
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,320
But they're actually kind of brilliant in a way

1038
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,160
and they say exactly what they are.

1039
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,720
And there's double entendre.

1040
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,320
They communicate exactly what needs to be communicated

1041
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,400
and it's a little cheeky.

1042
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,560
As opposed to Koopalip which like, huh?

1043
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,320
And then what is, and it's a, he also says how like,

1044
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,960
you know, people mispronounce Chipotle for a long time.

1045
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,840
But then there is a real word

1046
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:45,360
and there's like, Koopalip, why make up such a difficult

1047
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,680
word to say, there's no point.

1048
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,680
But then this quote, I think he explained it really well.

1049
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,240
I wouldn't mind it so much if,

1050
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,360
when the meaning of the word were unfurled,

1051
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,240
it was profound and there was an aha moment.

1052
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,640
But that doesn't exist.

1053
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,520
It's simply Chris Angel's breakfast, lunch, and pizza.

1054
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,840
For a brand spirited by a magician,

1055
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,760
oppressed to digi-tear extraordinaire,

1056
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,440
you would expect something magical

1057
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,280
and it's incredibly not.

1058
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,880
There really is something to that.

1059
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,920
You still need explanation at the end almost.

1060
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,360
Like, huh?

1061
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,640
But why is he doing that?

1062
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,000
And that's not what he does.

1063
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,320
And he has a really specific brand and why isn't it that?

1064
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,800
Why isn't it scary?

1065
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,280
Why isn't it anything like, Mine Freak?

1066
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,520
Dine Freak.

1067
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,360
Dine Freak.

1068
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,800
Mine Mind Meat or something.

1069
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,480
And when you see it written out,

1070
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,960
the C and the A are often capitalized,

1071
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,440
but the BLP are lowercase.

1072
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,120
So it's not even, the term is camel case.

1073
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,960
Like when you write a few words without spaces

1074
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,480
or like punctuation and stuff,

1075
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,480
but you capitalize the first letter of each word.

1076
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,720
Like if you're naming a file on a computer.

1077
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,760
It's called camel case?

1078
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,520
It's called camel case, yeah.

1079
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,360
Wow, I didn't know that.

1080
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,080
But then also the logo,

1081
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,800
the A is inside of a backward C,

1082
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,720
which is almost a full circle,

1083
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,000
which is the way Chris Angel writes his name in his shows,

1084
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,600
but it just means it looks like a blip

1085
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,320
with a circle around the A.

1086
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,040
I didn't know that was supposed to be a C.

1087
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,880
Yeah, that's it, yeah.

1088
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,720
And I've been thinking about this.

1089
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,040
I've been looking at this logo more than a normal person.

1090
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,040
But it's almost the anarchy symbol too.

1091
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,480
Yeah, I thought it was that.

1092
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,320
Yes.

1093
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,720
So the other thing that you remind me of

1094
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,440
is you mentioned the drive from playing a Hollywood.

1095
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,440
Wait a minute, okay, sorry to interrupt,

1096
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,160
but you were showing us this.

1097
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,000
It was showing us the magazine.

1098
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,200
It doesn't look like a C.

1099
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,400
It looks like a circle.

1100
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,280
Yeah, a C has a space on the right side.

1101
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,080
It does not read as Ka-blip at all visually.

1102
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,640
It's one of the worst logos I've ever seen.

1103
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,360
And then it still adds his name,

1104
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:48,200
Chris Angel's a blip, breakfast, lunch, and pizza.

1105
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,440
Lots of words, lots of fonts combined.

1106
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,920
The end for in pizza is on the P.

1107
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,760
In the P.

1108
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,960
Inside the P.

1109
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:00,800
And it's in a bright red, it's McDonald's red.

1110
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,840
It feels very McDonald's reminiscent.

1111
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,760
Anyway, you were saying.

1112
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,600
Oh, I was saying, so Planet Hollywood,

1113
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,520
the Planet Hollywood casino,

1114
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,640
you know, so there's a lot of shops.

1115
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,880
It's got a mall or a half a mall in it.

1116
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,560
There's a lot of shops.

1117
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,280
At the start of 2020, before the pandemic,

1118
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,560
you know what they had ample amounts of?

1119
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,400
Their empty storefronts.

1120
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,280
You know what they also have probably had in 2021, 22?

1121
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,560
Empty storefronts.

1122
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,600
You know who is doing a show next door

1123
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,000
or within the same facility?

1124
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,120
Chris Angel.

1125
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,880
And I was like, well, surely Ka-blip

1126
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,880
has just slapped his name on a casino restaurant

1127
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,920
in those many empty storefronts.

1128
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,760
Yeah.

1129
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,360
You would think, absolutely.

1130
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,200
Why not?

1131
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,880
Well, I guess because he fell in love with the Valley

1132
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,840
and with the biking.

1133
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,680
That's right.

1134
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,240
He had good times at Sugar's home plate.

1135
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,040
So he wanted to buy it and destroy it.

1136
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:56,360
I am going to do the greatest magic trap I've ever seen.

1137
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,480
I'm going to turn this functioning restaurant

1138
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,400
into a non-functioning restaurant.

1139
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:08,080
He around, so he announces Ka-blip

1140
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,120
and I'm like, you have my attention.

1141
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,400
We're all like, you have our attention.

1142
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,360
So we all start following him on Instagram at this point

1143
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,680
to be like, what is this?

1144
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,720
So then we start noticing like June 28th,

1145
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,680
he announces that he's also producing coffee.

1146
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,680
The brand of coffee is Java Freak,

1147
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,280
parentheses be the bean.

1148
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,760
That's so much better branding.

1149
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,600
Yeah.

1150
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,240
And then he only has one roast.

1151
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,360
It's the Italian roast, which is named Aluccia.

1152
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,320
And on the front of the bag,

1153
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,000
it also says javafreak.com get the bean.

1154
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,600
So it's beat the bean and get the bean

1155
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,160
are both on the front of the bag

1156
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,760
and also Aluccia Italian roast.

1157
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,120
And Aluccia is also.

1158
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:48,960
Not yet.

1159
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,800
Okay, yeah.

1160
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,640
I'm sorry.

1161
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,480
I don't mean to jump the gun.

1162
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,760
But I will say the branding,

1163
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,920
a lot of the presentation really feels like

1164
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,120
a freshmen marketing student in college

1165
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,240
who has the project due the next day

1166
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,000
and is scrambling to do it all.

1167
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,920
Some of the ugliest logos, branding.

1168
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,360
The ugliest and the videos, the short YouTube,

1169
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,520
so much, so perplexing.

1170
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,080
So much doesn't make sense where it's like,

1171
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,720
you are outside a city that is full of marketing

1172
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,920
and salesmanship and this is so,

1173
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,080
it's not even like someone self,

1174
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,840
this is so odd.

1175
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,400
Yeah, yeah.

1176
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,240
Yeah.

1177
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,760
No, it's all like,

1178
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,880
looks like Angel Fire or like really, really early,

1179
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,880
like before you could have good Photoshop's,

1180
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,400
like it's crazy.

1181
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,240
Yeah.

1182
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,520
It really feels like,

1183
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,080
and I can't think of a better example

1184
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,960
than just like the living with Michael Jackson documentary

1185
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,840
where he's buying, like he's just pointing at things.

1186
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,920
I want this, I want this.

1187
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,040
Like Chris Angel and I'm assuming in the same way,

1188
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,600
like I want that restaurant, buy it for me,

1189
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,680
come up with like, and just like shouts out a bunch

1190
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,800
of things and doesn't think anything through.

1191
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,920
It's like that kind of process of like just buying,

1192
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,280
like I'm doing this now and then people scramble

1193
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,280
and that's why everything looks like shit.

1194
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,440
Everything looks weird, doesn't make any sense.

1195
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,520
Because the same limited group of people

1196
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,520
have to do all of it and it's all things

1197
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,560
they've never tried to do before

1198
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,800
because they're part of a magician's entourage,

1199
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,440
not restaurateurs.

1200
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,880
There's a guy like in charge of his straight jackets

1201
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,560
and all he knows is how to hold Chris Angel up in the air

1202
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,960
just twirl and straight jacket.

1203
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,040
Now he's designing fonts, like he's doing new fonts for this.

1204
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,600
Get me the liquor license.

1205
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,120
Yeah, this is like, you know, to call it back to another,

1206
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,640
the early Imagineers, they were animators

1207
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,000
and now they're being called upon to make robots and stuff.

1208
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,040
So this is the same thing.

1209
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:39,880
Now they're being called up,

1210
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,200
his magic people are being called upon to.

1211
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,680
Well, but there were great results when Disney did it.

1212
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,760
That's true. In this case.

1213
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,680
There was no, there's no Bob Gur in the Chris Angel camp.

1214
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,520
We could do it all.

1215
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,520
Oh, we gotta go back, don't we?

1216
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,560
The old names.

1217
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,320
I'm trying to get us transitioned back into,

1218
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,160
I'm trying to help.

1219
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,360
Actually, this would be a good time then to get into

1220
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,720
because basically July 18th,

1221
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,480
like a week basically before the grand opening,

1222
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,160
he opens like previews, starts previewing the restaurant.

1223
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,480
Right around Disneyland's opening.

1224
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,120
That's kind of an interesting overlap.

1225
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,680
Well, so as there's like kind of,

1226
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,560
you're gonna get some shots of like people

1227
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,120
trying out Kblip three days

1228
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,400
in that window between the grand opening and the previews,

1229
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,560
the website goes alive.

1230
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,840
And I feel like we really have to get into the Kblip website

1231
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,840
because it's just like an embarrassment of riches.

1232
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:39,840
It's, he at all times is asking you to buy into

1233
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:44,080
a lot of mythology and learn a lot.

1234
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,640
This actually just to summon Bar Rescue,

1235
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,920
another recently referenced thing.

1236
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,480
I feel like for maybe a smarter thing

1237
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,320
that Taffer does is try to like say,

1238
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:59,760
you know, you can't like tell this massive story,

1239
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,600
but you can't like,

1240
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,880
there can't be 70 things that you have to learn

1241
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,760
and figure out about the bar before you order the drink.

1242
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,040
If you wanna like acknowledge who you are

1243
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,080
and your history and the story in some slight way,

1244
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:11,920
they're great.

1245
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,240
But like Chris just floods this thing

1246
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,380
with when I was a kid and I loved this

1247
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,820
and I met this guy and you're gonna find out about him,

1248
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,040
but also there's this brand and also,

1249
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,840
and then magic tricks and then there's a lot thrown at you.

1250
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,640
Taffer would have screamed at him if you read it.

1251
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,760
Shut the site down.

1252
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,000
Wait, does anyone wanna read the Italian ice thing?

1253
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Cause I feel like it's all,

1254
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,400
what you're saying is nothing's more personified than.

1255
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1256
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,060
Like page five.

1257
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,320
Go for it if you got it.

1258
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,080
Page five, oh, I have it here.

1259
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,000
Yeah, go for it.

1260
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,040
I've been crazy.

1261
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:41,880
Yeah.

1262
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,700
And this is Chris talking.

1263
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,540
Yeah, it continues on to the next.

1264
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:46,200
I've been crazy about Italian ices since I was a kid.

1265
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,600
And I'm so proud to say that we actually manufactured them

1266
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,960
right off the Las Vegas strip

1267
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,840
on our own manufacturing plant located

1268
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,320
at Chris Angel Studios.

1269
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,880
We have over 100 different delicious flavors created

1270
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,000
by our partner, mastermind, iceologist, Mike Gambusa,

1271
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,180
who has been producing gourmet ices for over two decades.

1272
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,200
Mike Gambusa.

1273
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,640
Wait, and then save room.

1274
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:13,640
Save room, I bet you can't have just one lick.

1275
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,240
Okay, so that comes up at something I grabbed too,

1276
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:21,560
which is that there's this image of Italian ices

1277
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:26,560
on the website a couple times with different copy each time.

1278
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,640
And one says, manufactured in Chris's Mind Foods plant

1279
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,480
in Las Vegas.

1280
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,920
They call it something different,

1281
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,320
Mind Foods and then Chris Angel Studios.

1282
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,200
Yes, a delicious natural alternative to ice cream.

1283
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,120
Bet you can't just have one lick

1284
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,600
of this guilt-free indulgence.

1285
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,520
All right, there's like five things in there.

1286
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,680
One, Italian ice, very popular.

1287
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,400
We're out in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York.

1288
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,040
I have never ever heard it called

1289
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,240
a natural alternative to ice cream.

1290
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,080
No.

1291
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,880
A lot of places.

1292
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,360
It's like a homeopathic medicine.

1293
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,160
No, ice cream isn't natural, you think of it.

1294
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,240
A lot of places do brag about real fruit pieces,

1295
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,000
real fruit juice.

1296
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,640
Even there, that's stretching the term natural.

1297
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,000
Another thing is, one of the most popular presentations

1298
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,800
of Italian ice layered with sauce serve ice cream

1299
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,880
or frozen custard.

1300
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,040
So I don't know, it seems like he's pitching it

1301
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,400
as a health food, but then they're like glowing.

1302
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,880
There's like fluorescent blue and green scoop.

1303
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,160
Jason, are you questioning Mike Gambusa

1304
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,400
who's been in the frozen dessert business for 20 years?

1305
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,400
Mastermind iceologist.

1306
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,160
I do not understand.

1307
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,840
Jesus, I hate the disrespect.

1308
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,320
Jason's showing Mike Gambusa.

1309
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,400
Mike Gambusa, because you gotta respect,

1310
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,920
he's just talking about Mike Gambusa

1311
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,200
like we know who he is.

1312
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,680
And then on this article from View On Magazine,

1313
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,000
which I've been pulling from.

1314
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,840
You have a hard copy,

1315
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,680
you have a physical copy of a magazine with you.

1316
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,240
He mentions pizza extraordinaire Mike Barham,

1317
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,360
which I like because if Mike Gambusa

1318
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,160
is a master iceologist, a pizza extraordinaire is a pizza.

1319
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,000
So he's,

1320
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,840
so he's,

1321
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:05,680
so he's,

1322
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,520
so he's,

1323
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:10,720
so he's implying that he partnered with a pizza

1324
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,080
named Mike Barham.

1325
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,200
I've hired a talking pizza to oversee pizza.

1326
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,680
The pizza preparation.

1327
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:19,520
Here's your order.

1328
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,680
His name is Mike Barham.

1329
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,520
I think you'll find.

1330
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,400
All of my pizzas are named Mike Barham.

1331
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,240
And of course also his brother, Costa Serentacos,

1332
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,400
who opened,

1333
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,240
who's the one who took over the father's restaurant.

1334
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:35,240
So it's almost like Criss Angel's like a reverse guy.

1335
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,360
Like he surrounds himself with smaller guys.

1336
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,160
Like when we talk about the guys.

1337
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,520
The guys and these other restaurants.

1338
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,440
Criss doesn't have a guy above him

1339
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,040
and he's not powerful enough to be like a win or a Trump.

1340
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,160
He's like a hoarder of weird guys.

1341
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,520
I met an iceologist once.

1342
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,200
There's different members of the X-Men whose mutant power

1343
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,440
is to amplify other mutants mutant powers

1344
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,240
and make them stronger.

1345
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,880
And Criss is kind of like that for guys.

1346
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,720
Yeah.

1347
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,440
And it's also, it makes sense with like a Long Island guy.

1348
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:10,120
Like, I know my god of ice guy, Mike Gambusa, he'll do it.

1349
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,720
Like, just call Mike Gambusa and let me call Mike Barham.

1350
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,560
He's gonna.

1351
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,560
I've never met a better pizza than Mike Barham.

1352
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,920
Carlos Italian ice.

1353
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,360
I found Mike Gambusa's places.

1354
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,200
Really?

1355
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,020
There's one in Los Angeles.

1356
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,720
There's one in Staten Island.

1357
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,560
And it's got both.

1358
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,400
I don't know.

1359
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,440
He's probably got more too.

1360
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,960
And it's, oh, now it's not loading anymore.

1361
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,800
This is here.

1362
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,800
Carlos Gourmet Italian ices.

1363
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,640
Like, I love that.

1364
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,680
That's a good logo.

1365
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,520
Yeah.

1366
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,680
So this guy does know, Mike Gambusa does know

1367
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,520
what he's doing.

1368
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,120
Yeah, that's a pretty normal Italian ice.

1369
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,800
But again, I've never heard it called

1370
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,600
like a guilt-free indulgence.

1371
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,160
It's a guilt-free indulgence.

1372
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,440
It's a guilt-free indulgence.

1373
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,880
And also the other thing in here.

1374
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:57,000
Bet you can't have just one lick.

1375
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,480
There's a lot of oddly sexual stuff on this menu.

1376
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,360
The menu's highly sexual.

1377
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,200
Highly sexual.

1378
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,560
Well, the coffee is a little sexual.

1379
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,120
The Italian ice is a little sexual.

1380
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,600
This guy likes to have body fun.

1381
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,600
We're getting back to it.

1382
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,240
We're getting back to the words.

1383
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,800
I'm just reintroducing them.

1384
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,480
Where will seat come into play here?

1385
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,320
I don't know.

1386
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,280
You're gonna want to take a seat at Kblip

1387
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,440
to order any number of breakfast, lunch, and pizza entrees.

1388
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,640
I thought it was weird also the thing you read, Jason,

1389
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,600
that the one I read was,

1390
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,320
I bet you can't have just one lick.

1391
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,960
And then yours was like,

1392
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,600
I bet a single lick won't be enough

1393
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:39,640
to satisfy what you are craving out of the ice array.

1394
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,960
It will not satiate your urges.

1395
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,520
It's like these things appear on the same page.

1396
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,360
Just like, you see the one,

1397
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,640
you keep scrolling down the page,

1398
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,560
you see the same image, but different copy.

1399
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,320
And it's just like, that is like 101,

1400
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,000
like running a restaurant and stuff.

1401
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,360
Make everything consistent.

1402
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,720
No, he's throwing, wait, I'm also, look at this.

1403
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,520
Speaking of the C, here's one with the C.

1404
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:08,040
Wait, why is it a C on the sign?

1405
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:08,880
Yeah, wait.

1406
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,120
Yeah, look, okay, well you're showing me on the,

1407
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,240
what's happening?

1408
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,800
So on the actual restaurant,

1409
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,680
when you go to the place, there is no C,

1410
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,520
but on the website, there's a C.

1411
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,880
And in the place, the circle is meant to stand as a C,

1412
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,840
but there's no opening.

1413
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:27,200
And he's wearing a shirt that has the bad logo on it too.

1414
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,520
Oh, right.

1415
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,920
Wait, so they changed it at some,

1416
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,920
but it's too late, we made the sign.

1417
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,160
We booked the Play On cover, what is it?

1418
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,560
Oh, this is a magazine called View On Magazine.

1419
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,240
It's the official magazine of Moapa Valley.

1420
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,040
So, which he was bragging about,

1421
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,440
he said View On Magazine has never had a person on the cover.

1422
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,120
I'm the first person ever to be on View On Magazine,

1423
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,440
which I did think was a little impressive when I heard it,

1424
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,960
but I didn't know it was Moapa Valley exclusive.

1425
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,000
Oh yeah, it's just stuff going on in the Moapa Valley.

1426
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,120
Okay.

1427
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,080
It's a nice magazine.

1428
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,080
It's got glossy pages.

1429
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,600
So, July 23rd,

1430
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,880
KaBlip opens to the public official.

1431
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:11,720
Oh boy.

1432
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,080
Nine days after its preview starts.

1433
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,120
Yeah.

1434
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,720
It's great, he Instagrams just the,

1435
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,920
he's like an Instagram of the full restaurant.

1436
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,240
He says, every table stall and tummy filled KaBlip,

1437
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,880
eat blip, smiley face drooling.

1438
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,520
Another branding thing we haven't talked about

1439
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,600
is that the Twitter and maybe the Instagram, I don't know,

1440
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,800
but the Twitter at least is eat blip, not KaBlip.

1441
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,640
Okay.

1442
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,080
Which is great, because KaBlip was probably taken,

1443
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,440
he didn't check that before he named it KaBlip.

1444
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,920
So-

1445
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,960
Cable P, like some guy who has a company called Cable P.

1446
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:44,800
We took it already.

1447
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,320
Or he's like, I thought when I misspelled cable

1448
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,760
in my Twitter name, it would be the death of my business.

1449
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,960
Who knew I'd be squatting on valuable land?

1450
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,040
So that's July 27th.

1451
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,320
Two days later, Mike, do you know what happens?

1452
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,160
No, actually I don't.

1453
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,000
Okay, tell him.

1454
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,240
It closes.

1455
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,080
It closes.

1456
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,920
I knew that was coming, I didn't know it was two days later.

1457
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,800
There's an Instagram video where just like the little thing

1458
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,200
is just some pizza, but when you click it,

1459
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,520
the things that just says,

1460
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:21,840
must temporarily close, response beyond expectations.

1461
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:26,840
I also, I remember hearing about this

1462
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,240
from the man we heard earlier, Jason Walliner,

1463
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,560
who I want to quote him the way he broke the news,

1464
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,320
which is KaBlip has shut down, but don't worry,

1465
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,480
it's only because they are so successful.

1466
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,560
Which is how they, wait a minute, are there,

1467
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,920
I don't want to jump ahead, are there multiple closures?

1468
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,840
Not yet, no.

1469
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,680
Okay, okay.

1470
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,680
Because I, wait, I think though that they're weirdly,

1471
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,120
I think there was a brief closure in the preview period

1472
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:02,320
because, now I haven't skipped past the ad on this,

1473
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,720
so forgive me, we'll have it in a couple seconds,

1474
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,840
but he filmed an emergency video,

1475
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,720
important message from Chris.

1476
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,480
He had to rush this to YouTube

1477
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,800
in order for 720 people to see it, we're the 721st.

1478
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,920
Wait, okay, so really quick, he's by his pool,

1479
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,560
it's cloudy weather, he looks kind of stressed,

1480
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,640
and he goes into this.

1481
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,560
I'm expecting to make this video, but I have to make it.

1482
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:28,880
We, unfortunately, are completely sold out

1483
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,640
of our food products, we ordered tons of stuff

1484
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:36,560
from Cisco and US Foods, everything is depleted.

1485
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,760
We are closing today at five o'clock,

1486
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:42,160
we are completely closed tomorrow at KaBlip

1487
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,400
due to the overwhelming response.

1488
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,120
I want to thank you so much Moapa Valley

1489
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,080
for the incredible food love, we really love you,

1490
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,240
we are completely closed.

1491
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:54,280
He's still slipping in that weird branding of food love.

1492
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,320
I hate that, what I hate out,

1493
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,200
if people are too enthusiastic about food,

1494
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,600
I sometimes find it disgusting,

1495
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:07,200
but then condensing it into little, yummy food love,

1496
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,920
or there's a video here, every table stall and tummy filled,

1497
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,920
oh my God, I hate that.

1498
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,920
Thank God, I feel like you guys would love saying tummy,

1499
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,720
though, that's exactly the kind of shit

1500
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:18,920
I'd get upset about.

1501
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:19,760
Yeah, it is.

1502
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,480
My full, full tummy.

1503
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,320
I have a thing about tummy.

1504
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,720
My tumsy-wumsy, got a bit of the wobblies.

1505
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,000
Yeah, Jason just doesn't like it with food,

1506
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,320
he likes saying tummy in relation to other stuff.

1507
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,760
Or it's like, if I'm eating and the TV's on,

1508
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,920
I can't have the Food Network on as I'm eating other food.

1509
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,120
I feel- Really?

1510
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,880
Yeah, I find it unnerving.

1511
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,000
Unnerving? That's an odd one.

1512
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,160
Yeah, I just find it weird, yeah, I don't.

1513
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,040
What if it's the exact same food you're watching

1514
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,040
and eating at the same time? That actually would probably

1515
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,680
be okay. Okay.

1516
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,880
That's like a double, like,

1517
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,880
you're getting an extra sensory experience in that way.

1518
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,720
Yeah.

1519
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,040
So anyway, I think that was actually before,

1520
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:57,880
I think that was in the preview period.

1521
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,880
That was in the 10 days.

1522
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,200
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1523
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,400
That's all they had to do was keep things going.

1524
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,560
And he also, I like what he reveals in there,

1525
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:08,080
which is, we bought so much food from Cisco,

1526
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:11,120
so he outs that they're buying from these, like,

1527
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,000
packaged food companies.

1528
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,080
Again, a taffer no-no.

1529
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,320
It's preview from Cisco!

1530
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,680
He wouldn't be happy,

1531
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:20,320
but they didn't change the plan.

1532
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:23,280
Because then, because that's earlier on the YouTube channel

1533
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,600
than when he has his entire audience all yell at the camera,

1534
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,920
Ka-blet, ka-blet!

1535
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,480
Often if you go see him live,

1536
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,080
he might pull you into promoting whatever he's doing,

1537
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:38,400
or in one case, cheering on a Moapa Valley

1538
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,480
high school football team.

1539
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,760
Like, he's facing the audience, like,

1540
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:45,280
all right, we got a thousand of your best friends here

1541
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,400
who wants to say something to you.

1542
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,960
Go Cougars!

1543
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,520
That's right, congrats on the intermural.

1544
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,600
Scott, congrats on the Moapa Valley Pirates

1545
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:59,320
is actually the most viewed video on the EPLP page.

1546
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,680
How many?

1547
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,080
766 views.

1548
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,120
That's nice.

1549
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,440
Well, like, all the parents watched it.

1550
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,040
I hope they got some free food.

1551
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,200
From somewhere else.

1552
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,840
We're actually out of free food.

1553
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,160
The free food is gone.

1554
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,200
So his statement, when they close,

1555
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,160
is actually very similar to that statement.

1556
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:22,200
We are grateful for the overwhelming support and food love.

1557
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,320
In order to fulfill our promise of delicious food

1558
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,080
and excellence in customer service,

1559
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,840
we need to expand our operation immediately

1560
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,360
in order to meet the unbelievable demand.

1561
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,640
We will reopen in August once we add additional refrigeration,

1562
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:38,120
freezers, more staffing, POS system, and storage.

1563
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,360
That's five things.

1564
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,480
Thank you for your patience and understanding

1565
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,840
as we try to better serve you.

1566
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,080
We will see you in August.

1567
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:49,440
So he says they're gonna close for 20 days.

1568
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,080
That is not, they close for a lot longer than 20 days.

1569
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,040
So they were open for three days.

1570
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:55,880
Yeah.

1571
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:56,720
Yeah.

1572
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,400
At one point he says,

1573
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:04,400
our near-spotless POS system went down a few times.

1574
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,960
It's like, well, it's not near-spotless,

1575
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:06,800
it keeps crashing.

1576
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,080
And also, why are you telling us that?

1577
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,400
Don't say any of this.

1578
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,560
We don't need to know.

1579
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:14,560
We don't need to know you don't have enough refrigeration.

1580
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,880
That's terrifying.

1581
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:19,200
In the deep, deep heat of the Moapa Valley,

1582
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,360
where it's so hot,

1583
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:25,000
there is a bench outside of the restaurant

1584
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,600
that has a little thing on it that says,

1585
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,920
don't sit here if it's too hot.

1586
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,800
They had to warn people about that.

1587
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,280
And yet they've had it be remotely in question

1588
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,600
whether they have enough refrigeration.

1589
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:40,040
Was this all exclusively posted on that YouTube channel?

1590
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:41,040
On his Instagram.

1591
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,400
So on his main personal,

1592
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,080
it's okay, so people would see it.

1593
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,560
I was just like, who even showed up and,

1594
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:47,400
oh, it's closed.

1595
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,680
Like, we gotta get to social media to find out why.

1596
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,080
Here's something that's crazy too,

1597
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,720
is he talks about the great reviews.

1598
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,920
And then, but that's not the case.

1599
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:58,760
Yeah.

1600
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,640
If you look at all the reviews

1601
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,920
from the very short training period,

1602
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,280
here's one,

1603
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:09,560
reminded me of a prison cafeteria scene on CSI,

1604
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,960
right down to steel cages over the lights,

1605
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,760
stainless steel tables, plates, and plastic silverware,

1606
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,080
plus the added aluminum window shades after hours

1607
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,680
to keep the vandals out in downtown Overton.

1608
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,080
So much for local Overton restaurant.

1609
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,480
And the response from owner, thanks for the feedback.

1610
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,760
This is another one, had breakfast,

1611
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,040
no flavor hash browns,

1612
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:33,160
sausage didn't taste like anything I had ever tasted,

1613
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,840
toast without butter on table, no coffee refills,

1614
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,880
different people writing this for me.

1615
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,040
Plastic knife and fork,

1616
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,520
no spoon, metal, or paper plates,

1617
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,200
hot paper cup.

1618
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,600
No spoon.

1619
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,680
Everything seemed like I was on a picnic,

1620
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:47,880
not in a restaurant.

1621
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,120
And then there's this really complicated one

1622
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:54,880
where somebody tries to order,

1623
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,320
cause on the website they have Mike's,

1624
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,240
Mike Gambou's Italian ice.

1625
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:03,520
And they'll add vodka to it and make it a mind freeze.

1626
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,440
So someone tried to order that,

1627
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:06,280
and the waitress was like,

1628
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,320
I can't pour that, I'm underage.

1629
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,360
So she had to go find someone to pour it.

1630
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,040
And then the person said,

1631
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,560
he says you have a hundred flavors.

1632
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,200
And they said, we only have six flavors.

1633
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,400
And she's like, can I have this flavor?

1634
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,040
Like, no, there's only three flavors

1635
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,560
that will make a mind freeze out of

1636
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,600
strawberry, lemon, and chocolate.

1637
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,520
And they asked for another one,

1638
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,720
and they said, Chris likes it that way.

1639
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,000
So they had to get a flavor they didn't like

1640
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,440
when they were promised a hundred.

1641
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,200
And this is like a very, so this is one of the reviews.

1642
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,320
It's so complicated.

1643
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,440
And this is one of the reviews.

1644
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:40,680
So the reviews were like very harsh for the 10 days.

1645
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,520
Which is probably one of the reasons this is going on.

1646
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,680
Yeah, yeah.

1647
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,640
The plastic silverware is crazy.

1648
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,960
There's no justification of that.

1649
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,720
I think that's true of coffee,

1650
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,840
even if you're not taking it to go, it's paper cups.

1651
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,280
This is just chintzy stuff here.

1652
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,480
Also, again, I do wanna point out,

1653
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:01,680
Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino,

1654
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,320
basically center strip.

1655
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,200
Lot of quick service bars,

1656
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,880
walk up windows, seems like the perfect place

1657
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,200
to have a window serving Italian ice

1658
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,800
or Italian ice with vodka dumped on it.

1659
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,240
Not the case.

1660
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,720
Which is very interesting.

1661
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:21,080
So we're just sitting, it's July into August.

1662
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,800
August into mid August.

1663
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,600
Kaploop has not reopened.

1664
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,760
August 28th, 2021, off what you're saying, Jason,

1665
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,520
on Instagram, Chris writes,

1666
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,280
just a picture of a bunch of a hundred flavors

1667
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,000
of Italian ice.

1668
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,680
Our delicious gourmet Italian ice

1669
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,360
is heading to the heart of the strip.

1670
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:40,360
September 1st, new location to be announced.

1671
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,200
Hashtag Kaploop, hashtag eat blip,

1672
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,320
hashtag over a hundred flavors.

1673
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,160
So like, this is interesting.

1674
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,400
Maybe he's not gonna open Kaploop,

1675
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,600
but he is gonna sell the ice.

1676
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,920
Maybe he has a lot of extra ice.

1677
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,600
Maybe there are a hundred flavors.

1678
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,320
Well, that wasn't, so September 2nd,

1679
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,440
Kaploop suddenly reopens.

1680
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,760
Wow.

1681
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:01,600
It's back.

1682
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,680
It's been more than 30 days at this point.

1683
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,360
So just in previews for seven days,

1684
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,840
open for three days, close for more than a month.

1685
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:09,680
Reopens.

1686
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,800
It's like the Spider-Man turn off the dark.

1687
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,040
So just side note, have you guys ever read

1688
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,800
the book, Helter Skelter?

1689
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:16,640
No.

1690
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:17,680
Nobody's read Helter Skelter?

1691
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,520
No.

1692
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:19,520
It's a great book.

1693
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,360
Story of the Manson investigation,

1694
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,120
written by Vince Bugliosi.

1695
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,400
And there's this really amazing part that I love.

1696
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,800
Cause the first 200 pages are basically

1697
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,920
the third person just telling of the murders.

1698
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,400
And then just sort of the very beginning of the cops

1699
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,680
kind of trying to figure out what's happening.

1700
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,560
And then Manson gets arrested,

1701
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,080
where one of the family gets arrested.

1702
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:46,960
And 200 pages then Bugliosi basically says,

1703
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,080
and then the phone rings and I picked it up.

1704
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:53,320
And he reveals, like, this is me.

1705
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,320
I'm the prosecutor.

1706
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,880
The guy's been writing the book the whole time.

1707
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,520
I'm actually part of this.

1708
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,360
And in the book he says, like, in a way,

1709
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,600
I'm a newcomer and intruder.

1710
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,760
The sudden switch from an unseen background narrator

1711
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:06,280
to a very personal account is bound to be a surprise.

1712
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,120
Oh.

1713
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,480
So this is my way of telling your listeners

1714
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,880
that two days later I went to Ka-Bloom.

1715
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,200
Yeah.

1716
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,040
Yeah.

1717
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,040
Eva, Eva.

1718
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:20,840
I got up in the morning like it happens.

1719
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,600
What actually happened was, we had a three day weekend.

1720
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,360
We had plans.

1721
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,640
And my husband said to me,

1722
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,240
Ka-Bloom is gonna close again.

1723
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,680
And I don't wanna live with you if you like,

1724
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,760
never went.

1725
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,080
If you have to like know it's open

1726
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,640
and then you didn't go and it's closed again forever.

1727
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:41,560
He's like, you have to go.

1728
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,640
So I just got out of my car, like always.

1729
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:47,160
You broke plans that in order, because of the sudden,

1730
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,920
you all ended, it was not pre-med it.

1731
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,520
You didn't know like,

1732
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,160
I mean, you probably knew when it was gonna reopen.

1733
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,400
You'll go, but.

1734
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,440
I woke up that morning.

1735
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,560
I did not know I'd be eating at Ka-Bloom that day.

1736
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:57,400
Wow.

1737
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:58,240
Wow.

1738
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,200
It like, it just happened.

1739
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,760
I threw all my stuff in a bag and I drove.

1740
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,440
First I drove to my hotel, dumped my stuff off.

1741
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:07,840
Got in my car.

1742
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,240
I stayed at, we should talk about this another time.

1743
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,760
Resorts World, run by the Mercurial.

1744
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:13,600
The Mercurial.

1745
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,280
The Incaque thing.

1746
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,000
His first outpost in a minute.

1747
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:17,840
I don't think it is.

1748
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,800
I found out there is a Resorts World in Queens.

1749
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:21,640
Really?

1750
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:24,160
That I considered staying at for our New York show.

1751
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:25,840
But it's just too inconvenient.

1752
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,840
Resorts World Vegas, fucking rules.

1753
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,880
I only want to stay there from now on.

1754
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,200
Robot dogs.

1755
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,040
Whoa.

1756
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:32,880
Oh yeah.

1757
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,440
Anyway, drove from the edge, the far edge of Vegas

1758
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:40,120
in no traffic to Ka-Bloom, more than an hour.

1759
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:41,200
Way more than an hour.

1760
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,040
Of course.

1761
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,720
Hour 15 easy.

1762
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,160
Driving a little over the speed limit, sorry.

1763
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,960
And that's the north end of the strip.

1764
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,800
So you are on your way to,

1765
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,400
it's not like you're at like Mandalay Bay

1766
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,280
and had to go through the whole strip to get there.

1767
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,320
I was at the Circus Circus.

1768
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,760
I was at the pepper mill.

1769
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:58,600
You're at the end.

1770
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1771
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,280
There's no more big casinos.

1772
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,120
No traffic.

1773
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:01,960
Jeez.

1774
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:02,800
So far.

1775
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,200
So far.

1776
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,040
He's lying.

1777
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,920
The website is, you click that,

1778
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,760
that's not a Google map link.

1779
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:12,120
It's just like an image he's doctored.

1780
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:12,960
Yeah.

1781
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,000
Hey, you know where I've heard has good diner food

1782
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,640
of this kind of quality?

1783
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,480
The pepper mill.

1784
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:18,320
The pepper mill.

1785
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:23,000
That's one of the best, with the 500 page drink menu,

1786
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,040
it's the best place ever.

1787
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:29,040
And that like, unlike this plate, like looks so rad.

1788
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,960
That is the almost awesome looking

1789
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:34,320
locked in time neon place you've ever seen.

1790
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:37,680
So I parked, I started, we have this text chain.

1791
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:41,040
I just started secretly, like I hadn't warned anybody

1792
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,880
just sending you guys photos from the outside

1793
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,200
and inside of Kablep.

1794
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,600
You know what's funny is that I thought that this,

1795
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,520
I think I thought you were with people.

1796
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,000
I think I thought that you like dragged people

1797
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,360
on a group trip.

1798
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:54,640
Like it's this thing you'll see.

1799
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:57,240
I don't think I realized that it was spur of the moment

1800
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,680
and solo in the deep desert.

1801
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,080
Yeah.

1802
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,000
I just went.

1803
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Did you have a general feeling before you got there,

1804
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,680
how did you feel about Overton and the Moapa Valley?

1805
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,800
I mean, it's really, really empty.

1806
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,080
It's like a way, way.

1807
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,640
I mean, there was only like two or three,

1808
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:14,480
I passed like the school and I passed like a library

1809
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:17,280
and then it's like no stoplight.

1810
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,640
It's like tiny.

1811
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,760
What time was it when you got there?

1812
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,480
I got there for like an early dinner.

1813
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,320
Okay.

1814
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,600
By the time I left, the sun was setting.

1815
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,920
So they weren't serving L anymore, but you could get P.

1816
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,160
I couldn't get B though.

1817
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:30,000
No, B.

1818
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:30,840
No, B instead.

1819
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:31,680
Okay.

1820
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:36,040
So you're stuck either in like pizza, the Patriot burger

1821
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,600
or the Mindfreak burger.

1822
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,840
Exactly.

1823
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:41,360
Although, I mean, that's one thing about this,

1824
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:45,400
but the menu is they are trying to serve

1825
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,760
every type of food.

1826
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:47,600
Right.

1827
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,000
Which also feels like a kind of amateur restaurant thing.

1828
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,080
Like maybe you start with three things and nail them

1829
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:56,160
instead of like 200, because it's everything.

1830
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:59,680
It's burgers and pizza and breakfast and coffee

1831
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,920
and Italian ice and alcoholic Italian ice and fajitas.

1832
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,720
And like things that don't all go together where you,

1833
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,680
it's like separate ingredients have to be gotten

1834
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,760
only for this, fish and chips.

1835
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,440
Like maybe start a little smaller and don't run out.

1836
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:17,680
It feels like what happens sometimes is the family

1837
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:21,800
running the pizza place, buys out the diner next door

1838
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,560
and now they're running both of them.

1839
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,560
He tried to do it from nothing.

1840
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:26,400
Exactly.

1841
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,640
It's very different.

1842
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,720
He could have just kept the diner.

1843
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,480
Like I think he was also keeping some diner stuff

1844
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,280
to try to keep the locals happy,

1845
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:35,680
because breakfast probably is a thing people ate at Sugar's.

1846
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:36,520
Sure.

1847
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,800
But I don't know.

1848
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,480
One thing that seemed to answer one big question

1849
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,360
was that most of the parking lot was taken up

1850
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:47,400
by two giant mobile refrigeration units.

1851
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:51,480
That were clearly solving the refrigeration problem.

1852
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,960
He was not lying about that.

1853
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,480
He needed more refrigerators.

1854
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:55,320
Yeah, yeah.

1855
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,480
I don't think he was lying.

1856
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,640
Right, I'm just saying.

1857
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:58,840
Maybe he should have lied.

1858
01:10:58,840 --> 01:10:59,680
Yeah, that's true.

1859
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,520
Maybe he shouldn't know that.

1860
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,880
You have to say that.

1861
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,760
What did those look like from the outside?

1862
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,400
Just big gray boxes?

1863
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,200
Trailers, like big white trailers

1864
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,400
that you could walk into, it seems like,

1865
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,960
like walk-in freezers, but they were outside

1866
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,600
and they were run by generators.

1867
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,040
So they're loud?

1868
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:15,880
Oh yeah.

1869
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:16,720
Wow.

1870
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,840
And taking up parking spaces.

1871
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:22,040
So you're like, so if there's more than four people there,

1872
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,320
you're out on the road.

1873
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,280
Chris has his own parking space though.

1874
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,120
Reserved.

1875
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:30,320
Reserved with the big A and what apparently is a C.

1876
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,200
So I walk in two days after grand opening.

1877
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,000
It was pretty sparse.

1878
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,720
I got seated in a booth with an infant.

1879
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:42,640
I was sharing a booth with maybe a six week old infant.

1880
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,600
Regardless of that fact, which is crazy,

1881
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,240
why are you sharing a booth?

1882
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,560
Why is it at that point?

1883
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:49,400
I don't know.

1884
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,600
This is the pandemic still.

1885
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,720
I was like facing, it was like a long booth

1886
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,880
and I had my own table,

1887
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,240
but I was like uncomfortably close to an infant.

1888
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:58,080
Does that make sense?

1889
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,360
Yeah, I've noticed this about it

1890
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:03,560
that the tables seem extremely close together.

1891
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:04,720
Everything's really jammed.

1892
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,120
Oh, I should mention the first thing I did

1893
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,240
when I walked in before I sat down

1894
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,680
or right after I got my table,

1895
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:11,480
we haven't talked about the magic room,

1896
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:14,080
but the back of Koepelip is a magic room

1897
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,600
where he, it looks incredible.

1898
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,440
I hate the magic, oh man.

1899
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,720
I'm in the magic room.

1900
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:21,400
What's wrong with the magic room?

1901
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,600
Well, I would say the upper half of a torso

1902
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,960
popping out of the ceiling.

1903
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,160
That's like the, from like chest to head.

1904
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,240
That's like the trick I was talking about earlier.

1905
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,320
Of the torso trick.

1906
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:35,160
Of the Chris Angel that is hanging from the ceiling

1907
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,920
and the eyes move around or looking at you.

1908
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,360
That's when we were talking about the fashion cafe

1909
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,400
and it's like there's animatronics of the models.

1910
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,960
Is it like how there's technically considered,

1911
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,600
you could consider this an animatronic of Chris Angel

1912
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,160
in the restaurant because the eyes just dart around?

1913
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,560
Oh, yeah, maybe so.

1914
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,640
Maybe they have a robot.

1915
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:55,760
We have to, do we, is it a robot?

1916
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:56,600
Do we rule?

1917
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:57,440
Is this a robot?

1918
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,280
I think it is.

1919
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,560
It's like the eyes are moving all the time.

1920
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,120
It was moving when the room was,

1921
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,360
the room was empty except for just a laptop.

1922
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,880
Someone was working out of there

1923
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,520
and the eyes were moving on the robot.

1924
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,920
So they have a private room that somebody's just working in,

1925
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,440
but the regular room,

1926
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,400
we still have to keep everybody in the regular room

1927
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:18,000
and jam you next to a six week old during a pandemic.

1928
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:18,840
Yes.

1929
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:22,400
And he claims that eventually you'll be able to see magic

1930
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,640
shows in the magic room.

1931
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:27,560
But I don't know from who, when, like how.

1932
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,040
It seems like maybe you could have like

1933
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,120
your kid's birthday party there

1934
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,040
and then go back and see magic in the magic room.

1935
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,680
But the magic room is pretty small.

1936
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:34,520
It's pretty small.

1937
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:38,400
The animatronic dummy, Chris Angel,

1938
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,440
has a straight jacket on.

1939
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,520
There's a frame straight jacket on the wall.

1940
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,360
So this restaurant does have themed restaurant jackets.

1941
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,200
Hey.

1942
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,040
Oh yeah.

1943
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:47,880
It's a jacket.

1944
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:48,880
It's in almost all of them.

1945
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:49,720
Yeah.

1946
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,960
Thank you, jackets.

1947
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,320
You really made the month.

1948
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,720
So I sat down, I ordered,

1949
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,000
I want to try a couple of different things.

1950
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:58,840
I got a Caesar salad.

1951
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:03,080
I got some Mindfreak level wings.

1952
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:03,920
I got a pizza.

1953
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:04,740
I got a pea.

1954
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:05,640
I got a margarita pea.

1955
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:06,520
Whoa.

1956
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:09,200
And then I ordered a Mindfreeze.

1957
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:11,200
And my waitress said, I can't pour that.

1958
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,040
I'm underage.

1959
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:12,880
Yes.

1960
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,720
It happened to you.

1961
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:14,720
Wow.

1962
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,360
But she went and found her manager.

1963
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,200
Okay.

1964
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,480
And the manager said, I can make it.

1965
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:22,560
And I said, okay, what flavors?

1966
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,520
And he's like, well, we usually just do these three flavors.

1967
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,640
And I said, can I get a different flavor?

1968
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:27,560
And he said, which flavor do you want?

1969
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:28,920
And I said, which flavors do you have?

1970
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,380
And he said, they also had watermelon and something else.

1971
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:34,040
So they had five flavors, five of a hundred.

1972
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,960
Still only five.

1973
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,960
And I said, I would like a watermelon Mindfreeze.

1974
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:39,040
And he said, I can do that.

1975
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:40,720
And he did it.

1976
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:41,540
Oh.

1977
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:42,380
So they'd solved that problem.

1978
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:43,220
Okay.

1979
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:44,400
Here's the thing though.

1980
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,880
They told me that the Mindfreeze, which was expensive,

1981
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:50,640
came in a collectible Ka-blip cup.

1982
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:54,280
But what they did bring me is a regular, just a Ka-blip,

1983
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,760
just a cup with a Mindfreeze,

1984
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,160
plastic cup with a Mindfreeze in it.

1985
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,320
And then they just handed me this empty.

1986
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:03,000
This is a, just a cup from Chris Angel's Mindfreak

1987
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,100
at Planet Hollywood.

1988
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:04,940
Wow.

1989
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,880
And he's like, sorry, we don't have our cups yet.

1990
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:08,980
You can have this.

1991
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:13,980
They moved a cup from an hour away.

1992
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,080
They've moved a cup from its natural habitat.

1993
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,040
Whoa.

1994
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,040
Oh, that's incredible.

1995
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,880
The food was not great.

1996
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:24,480
The Mindfreeze was incredible.

1997
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,320
Really?

1998
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,140
It was great.

1999
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:26,980
I loved it so much.

2000
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:27,820
It was beautiful.

2001
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:30,240
It came with like a, like a little leaf on it

2002
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,840
and like a little strawberry.

2003
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:34,640
The watermelon ice was just delicious.

2004
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,480
Wow.

2005
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:36,300
I loved it.

2006
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:37,760
Mike Gambusa knows what he's doing.

2007
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,480
Well, I think he does.

2008
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:40,320
Yeah, that was, yeah.

2009
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:41,160
He's a master.

2010
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,000
20 years.

2011
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,840
He's a master.

2012
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,520
20 years of the business.

2013
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,600
You don't earn the name master iceologist

2014
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,040
if you aren't a master of iceology.

2015
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,320
On my way out the door,

2016
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,880
I asked the girl at the ice counter if Mike was there.

2017
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,280
Oh, I also, sorry.

2018
01:15:56,280 --> 01:16:00,480
I saw Costa Serentacos walking around.

2019
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,480
I saw his brother, Chris's brother,

2020
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,200
was running the front of the house.

2021
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,040
Yeah.

2022
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,520
He seemed like he was doing a good job.

2023
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,240
Also like, just to say really quick,

2024
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:11,740
the whole place is covered in like word murals.

2025
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,360
There's one that just is like,

2026
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,600
Ka-blip, worst restaurant name of all time.

2027
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,800
Beatles, worst band name of all time.

2028
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,420
Like really hostile.

2029
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,400
Trying to own the, the kind.

2030
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,400
He's trying to do sort of a,

2031
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:29,760
Tommy Wiseau who he kind of resembles, I would say.

2032
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,440
He's trying to like, no, I know it's a bad movie.

2033
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,280
I meant to do.

2034
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,880
Yes, that was all the plan, you see.

2035
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:38,000
So I asked the girl, first of all, I said,

2036
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,920
hey, that place that opened September 1st on the strip

2037
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,480
where you can get all the ice, where is that?

2038
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:45,120
Cause I'm going back to the strip.

2039
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,080
And she was like, that's not real.

2040
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:51,600
Admit it, these people are, they are honest.

2041
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,440
Well, she just was like, that's not,

2042
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:54,600
she just kind of shook her head.

2043
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,120
And then I asked if Mike Gambusa was around

2044
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,960
and she said, Mike, no, he comes in the morning.

2045
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:02,240
If you come back in the morning, you can meet Mike.

2046
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:03,960
So I'd have to come back for B.

2047
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,560
But, and it would have been really early.

2048
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,760
And I was like, I cannot, now knowing how far it was,

2049
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,960
I was like, I can't, someone else has to do that.

2050
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got it.

2051
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,840
Well, like, Walnut is going to go at some point.

2052
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,080
Walnut can meet Mike.

2053
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,080
But I asked, or someone else has to get breakfast.

2054
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,440
But I asked like, is Mike Gambusa nice?

2055
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:25,120
And she said, Mike Gambusa is so nice.

2056
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,000
Yeah, wow.

2057
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,480
We love this guy now.

2058
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,800
He is nice, he makes ice.

2059
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:32,880
Mike Gambusa.

2060
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:33,960
We gotta go down to the place.

2061
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:35,880
We gotta go get this ice.

2062
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,560
Yeah. In Los Angeles.

2063
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,320
Oh yeah, well, yes, you're right.

2064
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,400
We can have the ice without going all the way

2065
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,240
to Moapa Valley.

2066
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,600
Because they closed the Rita's water,

2067
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:46,280
like water ice right by where Jason lives.

2068
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:47,720
His favorite place in the world.

2069
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,000
Oh.

2070
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,600
Closed. Let's go get his ice.

2071
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:51,800
Let's get Mike's ice.

2072
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,000
Mike's nice ice.

2073
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:57,120
So that was my experience at KaBlip.

2074
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,360
Just a couple more important things that happened

2075
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,000
in the six month period.

2076
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,400
Because Chris Angel had a very crazy 2021.

2077
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,240
Yeah.

2078
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,600
October 23rd, Chris got COVID.

2079
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:13,080
And he put a lot of videos out of himself getting

2080
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:16,360
monoclonal antibodies from a doctor's office.

2081
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:19,520
And he kept naming the doctor's first and last name,

2082
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,000
Dr. Constantine George.

2083
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,960
And Scott, you actually found this.

2084
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,040
It's in the notes, the review you found

2085
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,480
of Dr. Constantine George.

2086
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,120
Oh, I don't remember this now.

2087
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,120
It's on my note, here.

2088
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:29,960
Okay, okay.

2089
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:31,920
Let's see.

2090
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,680
Oh, thank you for the opportunity here.

2091
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:34,520
Oh, that's right.

2092
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:35,640
Yes, I remember this.

2093
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:36,480
Okay.

2094
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,320
What?

2095
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,160
One star.

2096
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:40,920
If I could give this business negative stars, I would.

2097
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,320
Doctor is cold to his patient and staff.

2098
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:46,160
Talks badly about his patients to his staff.

2099
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:47,800
Heard numerous times.

2100
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,400
He doesn't care who he mistreats.

2101
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:52,600
Whether it be a staff member or a paying patient.

2102
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,960
This man has the heart of a dying fish.

2103
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:58,560
And his hands have a similar texture.

2104
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,520
He spends less than five minutes with you.

2105
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,560
He does not address any of your concerns

2106
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,680
and clearly is only in it for the money.

2107
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:07,920
I will report him to the BBB.

2108
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:10,960
This is who is treating Chris Angel's COVID.

2109
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,200
Dr. Constantine.

2110
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,320
It's just the theory.

2111
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,280
That's right.

2112
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:18,320
The theory that if Chris Angel ever puts anything out there,

2113
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,360
if you just Google any proper noun in it,

2114
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:22,560
you'll find the craziest thing you've ever found.

2115
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,840
He doesn't associate with anyone normal,

2116
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,720
even for his medical needs.

2117
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,320
Is the doctor also a magician?

2118
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,360
I hope so.

2119
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:35,200
He also, he is a pediatrician, which I found was weird.

2120
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,600
So I think he might have been

2121
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,480
in his own kid's pediatrician's office,

2122
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:41,760
staying overnight getting antibodies from a guy

2123
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,000
with the hands of a cold dead fish.

2124
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:46,960
That was the trick.

2125
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,080
It was a dead fish.

2126
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:52,200
And then November 5th, he has a baby.

2127
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,880
Chris has another baby.

2128
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,960
And finding that out right after the COVID.

2129
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:56,800
Wait a minute.

2130
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:00,400
And so you were like in the hospital with COVID

2131
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,360
and then had a baby like two weeks later?

2132
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:06,440
And the name's the daughter, Elucia Angelina,

2133
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,040
which you'll remember, Mike.

2134
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,120
What's the name of, what was it?

2135
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:12,960
The coffee.

2136
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,920
The coffee brand.

2137
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:19,800
Coffee brand first, daughter later.

2138
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,280
You could see it the other way.

2139
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:23,840
Yeah, this seems like a common thing.

2140
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,720
I named my wine brand after my daughter,

2141
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:29,120
but not coffee.

2142
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,560
You're not making money off the coffee first.

2143
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,920
And then, oh, you know what else should have that name?

2144
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,840
My child, this human.

2145
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,280
I had a bag of Elucia that I bought at Kblip

2146
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,760
and we were drinking it.

2147
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,560
And then Instagram comes up, name my daughter Elucia.

2148
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,040
I look at the coffee.

2149
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:47,400
I'm like, that's what I was like, he's fucking with me.

2150
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,120
Like he knows I know.

2151
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,680
He knows I have this coffee.

2152
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,280
Like why would he do this to me?

2153
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,400
It felt personal.

2154
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:56,240
Also, just with the level of normal that we're at

2155
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,800
where the beginning of the story is,

2156
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:00,320
I had Elucia that I bought at Kblip

2157
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,000
after I saw Costa Saran tacos.

2158
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,640
But I didn't see Mike Gambusa.

2159
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:10,760
But I didn't get to see master iceologist, Mike Gambusa.

2160
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,240
Who is nice.

2161
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,480
But I hear he was nice.

2162
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:16,120
Just a couple things too, from this View On Magazine,

2163
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,040
which I got at Kblip.

2164
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,760
There was a big pile of free ones.

2165
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:23,320
So this was supposed to coincide with opening week.

2166
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:27,080
And this is where I'm like, he does...

2167
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:29,240
One thing that's interesting about Chris

2168
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:32,800
is that he just says stuff and no one fact checks it.

2169
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,000
So it just says like,

2170
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,400
not only did Angel remodel the existing restaurant,

2171
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:38,880
location in just six weeks,

2172
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,320
he also plans on opening up to 20 more locations

2173
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,680
in the next year.

2174
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:46,640
In areas including Arizona, Nevada, and California,

2175
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:49,280
the restaurant will also feature a youth job program

2176
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,000
and a free meal outreach program

2177
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,560
for underprivileged and pediatric cancer families.

2178
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,640
Angel also wants to manufacture Kblip ice

2179
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,480
dedicated to the Gohmir Italian ice

2180
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,200
made and sold at the restaurant.

2181
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:03,400
And then he goes on and on about that he's also opening...

2182
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:05,360
Wait, where is it?

2183
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,080
Chris Angel's escape camp?

2184
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,400
The escape ranch.

2185
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,440
The escape ranch.

2186
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:11,280
Oh no.

2187
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,040
But I've seen it also called the camp.

2188
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,680
We also don't know the branding.

2189
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:17,000
Is it a ranch or a camp?

2190
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,400
This is a common thing too.

2191
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,040
Jackets are common for this whole month,

2192
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:23,960
but also very common are these big bold proclamations

2193
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,000
about the expansion of the restaurant.

2194
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:26,840
Yeah.

2195
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:30,120
From dive to grandpa's restaurant.

2196
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,960
Both of those were like, we're expanding in the future.

2197
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,480
You watch out, here we go.

2198
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,520
Like this is gonna become a whole thing.

2199
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:37,640
Yeah. And then no.

2200
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:40,000
The escape ranch will be a place where families

2201
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,480
that are going through a difficult time

2202
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,520
can escape for three days and two nights.

2203
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,200
So it's not like an escape room.

2204
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,760
It's not something you escape from.

2205
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:48,040
It's something you escape to.

2206
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:52,040
It's the world, but it sounds horrifying.

2207
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:53,720
It's in the desert by Kaplip.

2208
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:56,280
At this camp, they will enjoy the use of side-by-sides,

2209
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,760
stay in a fifth wheel RV

2210
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,920
and be able to eat completely for free.

2211
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,920
There is no set opening date for the ranch.

2212
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,600
So it's just like a bunch of claims.

2213
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,520
And then what's really funny is that this article

2214
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,320
is like four pages and then in the middle,

2215
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:09,600
there's this big yellow stamp over Chris's face

2216
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,560
that says that Kaplip closed three days after it opened

2217
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,960
and they don't know when it's gonna reopen.

2218
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,000
Editor's note.

2219
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Editor's note.

2220
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,200
So they had gone enough to go to press,

2221
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,320
but just right before they went to press,

2222
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:23,040
they had to stamp this thing on here,

2223
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,560
being like, sorry guys, it's closed.

2224
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,560
So like an editor got like in the middle of the night,

2225
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,800
like a phone rings and it's like, hey, you got it.

2226
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,160
We gotta do something for this story

2227
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:31,000
that's coming out tomorrow.

2228
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,720
Oh shit, what do we do?

2229
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,480
Sometimes I hate working

2230
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,120
at Malapa Valley's V1 magazine.

2231
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:41,560
The news moves so quickly out here.

2232
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,960
We always have to print a sticker retraction

2233
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,960
which picks something over an article.

2234
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,120
Oh my God.

2235
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,880
Kaplip, they have also like a lot of merch for sale.

2236
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:53,720
They don't have jackets,

2237
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:56,560
but they have really like kind of offensive shirts.

2238
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,440
Oh yeah, that's just white text on black.

2239
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,760
It's a shirt.

2240
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:00,800
What they put on the website,

2241
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,000
it doesn't even look like they've ever made one practically.

2242
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,520
It seems like very, you know, like those,

2243
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:06,360
they're not like ours.

2244
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:09,320
You got our team public and they exist.

2245
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:12,080
But I don't think these, have these ever been made?

2246
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:15,360
It's just a rendered, it's a rendered like shirt.

2247
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:18,120
I think there was one hanging on the wall when I was there.

2248
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:19,720
But they didn't look good.

2249
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,200
Everything's like, my favorite,

2250
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,520
there's like different ones that say like,

2251
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,720
don't whine, drink beer, Kaplip or like,

2252
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,760
but my favorite just says Kaplip on the back,

2253
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,600
says Kaplip, breakfast, lunch, pizza on the back.

2254
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:36,200
It says for a good time, call 702-397-8084.

2255
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:38,320
So it's just the phone number for Kaplip

2256
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,000
but like doesn't spell anything.

2257
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:43,160
They just assume like someone will see you wearing the shirt

2258
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,880
and remember the phone number.

2259
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,400
It's long, complicated, nonspecific.

2260
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:49,560
Yeah, yeah, oh my God.

2261
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:52,840
There's a video, they uploaded a couple of,

2262
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:56,320
YouTube has, I think they call them shorts.

2263
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:59,040
And it's clearly trying to be a TikTok competitor.

2264
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,480
But there's one video, it's only a few seconds long

2265
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:05,800
of a waving American flag and it's labeled, Never Forget.

2266
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:09,080
But there's no sound and it's not really,

2267
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:10,720
I couldn't figure out how, see,

2268
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:12,680
I'm assuming it was for 9-11

2269
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:15,520
because there is one comment on it that just reads,

2270
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,560
too bad the government knew it the whole time.

2271
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,000
George Bush just sat and calmly read that book

2272
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,960
to the children while it happened.

2273
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,200
That's the proof?

2274
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:28,320
That he's in, him being stoic for the children

2275
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,600
is the proof that like, I know, I don't need to.

2276
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:31,440
That's the proof that also-

2277
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,960
Because I planned it, I pushed the start button.

2278
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:38,720
Administrators of like channels can delete comments.

2279
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,840
They just left up a 9-11 truth or?

2280
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,400
There was also the point in time,

2281
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:47,160
do you remember Eva how, when everything was going wrong

2282
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,760
and they were closed for a long time,

2283
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:51,760
they're figuring out refrigeration and food,

2284
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,280
but they did install a flagpole and he's like,

2285
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,960
look what just happened, bam.

2286
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:00,760
He's being all braggadocious about that they,

2287
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:04,000
it was so confusing in the photo, in our text,

2288
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,520
I commented like, what is the picture showing?

2289
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:08,280
What is he, and somebody had to explain,

2290
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,200
it's that there's a flagpole now.

2291
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:14,400
Oh, so the tweet is, this happened today, flag.

2292
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,560
Go big, guest or go home,

2293
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,160
hashtag Moapa Valley, eat blip.

2294
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:21,440
I hope to reopen soon with more freezers,

2295
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:25,960
refrigerators, ice cubes, and a talented welcoming staff.

2296
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:27,320
You didn't have ice cubes.

2297
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:30,760
And talented welcoming staff, slam on the goals.

2298
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:33,160
Yeah, that's a big implication.

2299
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:36,640
And then if you slide through, there's a second picture,

2300
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:39,600
which is concept art of the flag.

2301
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,840
It's concept art of what if we had a flag?

2302
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:46,280
It came true, much taller in person though.

2303
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:49,800
So they did best to the concept in one regard.

2304
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,640
Aesthetically, just to say one more,

2305
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,280
I don't know if it was any different in person,

2306
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:57,000
but that way that it where it's just like white walls

2307
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,760
with this mean black text that in some cases

2308
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,160
is what the shirts are also saying.

2309
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:05,920
And then that big McDonald's red

2310
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,920
and tables just kind of jammed together

2311
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,000
and they are like steel and metal.

2312
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,760
I mean, the pictures don't do it justice.

2313
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:15,840
Maybe there's something I'm missing that you get in person.

2314
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:20,040
There's a big mural of Chris with his sons in the desert.

2315
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:23,320
There's also some screens showing Chris magic.

2316
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,040
There's also some mirrors that look like

2317
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,080
they might be two-way mirrors,

2318
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,680
but I don't know what they're for.

2319
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:30,120
Also a theme of the month.

2320
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,400
That's right.

2321
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,000
They don't go to the bathroom.

2322
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:34,920
On the patriotic kick,

2323
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:36,400
I was also sitting by the baby,

2324
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,840
but facing a man wearing a shirt

2325
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,480
that said all rifles matter.

2326
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:42,080
Oh good, oh good.

2327
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,440
I feel like I couldn't find the picture,

2328
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:47,120
but I feel like there was a Yelp comment

2329
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,680
or some sort of where someone said like,

2330
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:50,840
oh, I'd love to come,

2331
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,560
but I don't want to wear a mask everywhere.

2332
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:54,760
And they're like, don't worry.

2333
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:57,120
We're probably a mask free establishment,

2334
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,520
which doesn't seem to be the case

2335
01:27:58,520 --> 01:27:59,680
because there's plenty of footage

2336
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:01,280
of the staff wearing masks.

2337
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,120
Oh yeah.

2338
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:05,280
That might've been the slim period of time

2339
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,520
after vaccines were widely available

2340
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:08,760
where they're like, no masks.

2341
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:10,560
And then there was the Delta search

2342
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,560
and Las Vegas and surrounding areas

2343
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,400
where like, we have a lot of tourists here.

2344
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,320
Everyone put your mask back on.

2345
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,880
They were following protocols at the blip

2346
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:19,800
and all over Vegas.

2347
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,320
I thought it was very good.

2348
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:23,800
Before we get to my final thing,

2349
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,960
Mike, do you want to do a quick quiz of guys?

2350
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:26,800
Oh yeah, please.

2351
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,040
Okay.

2352
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:30,640
Who is Ed Bible?

2353
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:33,640
I know.

2354
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:35,200
Ed Bible was, okay.

2355
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:36,880
Ed Bible was early on.

2356
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,280
Oh shit.

2357
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:39,920
He was right.

2358
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,600
He was the chef, right?

2359
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:42,440
That's right.

2360
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:43,480
Yeah, with the rice and the chicken.

2361
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:45,200
Who's Alucia?

2362
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,320
Alucia is a coffee and a daughter.

2363
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:48,760
Yeah.

2364
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:50,880
Who's Costa Seren Tacos?

2365
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:51,960
Oh shoot.

2366
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:55,160
What aspect of the meal was she in charge of?

2367
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,160
Costa Seren Tacos.

2368
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:58,880
Hmm.

2369
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,120
It's his brother.

2370
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:02,960
Oh, that's right.

2371
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:03,800
No, no.

2372
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:04,640
Damn it.

2373
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:05,480
It's okay, it's okay.

2374
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:06,320
You're doing great, you're doing great.

2375
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,000
It's embarrassing, I wasn't paying attention.

2376
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,080
Who's Mike Gambouza?

2377
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:13,120
Well, the nicest man that makes the nicest ice.

2378
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:14,760
Who's Constantine George?

2379
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,760
Yeah, the doctor who gave him Regeneron.

2380
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,560
Who is Mike Barham?

2381
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:20,880
The pizza guy?

2382
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,280
Yes, slash a pizza.

2383
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:23,120
A pizza man.

2384
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:23,960
A fucking pizza man.

2385
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,080
He's extraordinary.

2386
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:25,920
Wow.

2387
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:26,760
Well, I have a-

2388
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:28,560
By the way, also, just,

2389
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,400
because I was going through the menu,

2390
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,520
and there's, I mean,

2391
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:34,840
there'll be some recurring people from that,

2392
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:37,520
but like, they do so many like,

2393
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,680
so and so's famous this, so and so's that,

2394
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:44,760
and I just wrote down anybody who gets a meal named

2395
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:47,080
after them on the lengthy menu.

2396
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:52,080
Costa, Alucia, Christos Yanni, Sean, JC, JD,

2397
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:57,280
Tommy Boy, Grandma, Yeeyah, Yeeyah, and Mike.

2398
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:01,000
So these are, there's so many guys to learn

2399
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,080
over the course of-

2400
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:03,520
What's Mike's item?

2401
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,360
I'm not sure, I gotta go to the menu.

2402
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:06,200
Wait, what's the grandma?

2403
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,240
Grandma Yeeyah Yeeyah?

2404
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:08,720
Grandma Yeeyah Yeeyah.

2405
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:09,560
I can find out if you give me a minute.

2406
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:10,880
Grandma Yeeyah Yeeyah, Mike?

2407
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:11,720
Come on.

2408
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:13,760
Mike deserves that, I just wanna know who she is.

2409
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:17,360
Okay, Mike is a homemade Parmesan,

2410
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,400
so that might be Mike the Pizza.

2411
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:21,200
Unless it's Gambouza,

2412
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,520
but those are both Mike's, right?

2413
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,360
Yeah.

2414
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,200
I did like that,

2415
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:27,520
because it was Parmesan, side of pasta, two garlic knots,

2416
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,000
and I was like, oh, that's everything you want,

2417
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:29,840
that's pretty smart.

2418
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:30,660
Yeah, yeah.

2419
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:31,500
That's good, yeah.

2420
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:34,240
We also got spaghetti fo' you,

2421
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:35,080
and-

2422
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:37,160
Wait, fo' you, like the Paul McCartney song, fo' you?

2423
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:38,480
Like F-A.

2424
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:39,560
Oh, F-A, okay.

2425
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:41,400
Paul's is F-U-H.

2426
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:44,680
What are some other funny names on the menu?

2427
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:47,880
Let's see, you got the section called

2428
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:50,560
You're Getting Sleepy Appetizers.

2429
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:52,560
You're getting sleepy is crossed out,

2430
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,480
and no, you're getting appetizers,

2431
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,240
in a font that suddenly has syrups,

2432
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:57,560
but is the same color.

2433
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:01,200
You got, there's like a breakfast combo

2434
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,040
that's called Mind Fest.

2435
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,760
The ultimate breakfast combo is called Mind Fest.

2436
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,680
I missed a name, did I say Shawnee?

2437
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,040
I think I might've missed Shawnee.

2438
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,700
I don't know who Shawnee is.

2439
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:14,540
Yeah, there's so many names.

2440
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:16,600
Oh, how many is wife?

2441
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,200
Shawn is either his wife,

2442
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,480
or it's Johnny Christopher's mother.

2443
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:21,840
Okay, oh, I said Shawn, but I'm not Shawnee.

2444
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:22,760
Are those different people?

2445
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:23,840
I can't tell.

2446
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,360
Salads for the Stars,

2447
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,560
and then there's a picture of his star on the Walk of Fame.

2448
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:30,480
There's Sandwiches, Raps, and Rock and Roll.

2449
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:33,680
And Raps is not spelled with a W, it's spelled R.

2450
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:36,960
Which has things like the Rock and Roll Zinger,

2451
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:40,240
and Overton Rap, spelled with an R like a rap song.

2452
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:41,400
Overton Rap.

2453
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:44,200
One of the videos that's like a montage,

2454
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:47,980
it's either Cuplip is Open or Cold Blood Plastic Close.

2455
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:50,900
There's a very quick clip where it flashes

2456
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:52,860
the phrase food god,

2457
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:56,700
and then it's Chris Angel and a guy.

2458
01:31:56,700 --> 01:32:00,100
Food god is the nickname of this guy, Jonathan Chibon.

2459
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,940
Is that how he, do you know who this is Eva?

2460
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:02,780
I don't know, no.

2461
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:05,380
He's in the Kardashian sphere, Jonathan Chibon.

2462
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:06,260
Okay.

2463
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:09,440
Chibon, he shows up in the Kardashian circle.

2464
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:11,620
So it's him and Chris,

2465
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:14,700
and he was clearly making a video with him in some context,

2466
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:17,360
and they're around a big Cuplip pizza,

2467
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:20,600
and they do one of the weirdest things I've ever seen

2468
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,360
when you're picking up a slice of pizza.

2469
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:24,040
They grab them with one hand,

2470
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,520
and they immediately turn them vertical.

2471
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:28,920
Cause they were trying to show the cheese stretching,

2472
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:31,160
but you could tell it's cutting away,

2473
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:34,540
because turning a fresh out of the oven slice

2474
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:38,400
of pizza vertical, you can see it's all just falling off.

2475
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:41,320
And they cut right before that happens,

2476
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:43,920
but I can see it on the top half just start to fall

2477
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:46,120
to the right off.

2478
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:48,640
Cheese don't stretch on no Cuplip pizza.

2479
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:50,840
I can tell you firsthand.

2480
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:53,080
Okay, so there's one thing I've been wanting to share.

2481
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:53,920
Yeah.

2482
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:54,740
And here we go.

2483
01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:55,580
Okay.

2484
01:32:55,580 --> 01:32:59,240
Hi Eva, this is Mike from Carlos Gourmet Italian Ices.

2485
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,040
I just wanted to reach back out to you.

2486
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:02,520
I got your message online,

2487
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:05,320
and I'm so glad you came out actually.

2488
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:08,240
I had our Ices in Las Vegas at Cuplip.

2489
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:09,320
Call me, my name is Mike.

2490
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:10,640
Call me anytime.

2491
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:11,480
All right.

2492
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:12,320
Leave them.

2493
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,160
What, what?

2494
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:14,120
Call me anytime?

2495
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,440
That's so nice.

2496
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,160
Mike Ambuza?

2497
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:18,000
Mike Ambuza.

2498
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:18,840
What?

2499
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,080
I got in touch with Mike Ambuza through the website.

2500
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:21,920
Whoa.

2501
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:22,740
And he called me.

2502
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:23,580
He's in my phone now.

2503
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:24,420
Oh my God.

2504
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:25,260
Wow.

2505
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:26,520
Did you save the contact?

2506
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:27,360
Mike Ambuza.

2507
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:29,440
Oh yeah.

2508
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:30,640
He's on my phone as Mike Ambuza.

2509
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,080
Whoa.

2510
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:37,080
So yeah, I had a plan to try to get some Ices.

2511
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:38,400
Oh.

2512
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,520
But the Ices actually isn't available in LA right now.

2513
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:42,360
Oh, what?

2514
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:43,180
No.

2515
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:44,760
It can only be shipped.

2516
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:48,280
The website just means that he can wholesale ship to LA.

2517
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:51,600
Which means I would have to rent a commercial freezer

2518
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,660
to hold giant tubs of Ice.

2519
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,120
I actually ran into this

2520
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:56,960
because I was trying to figure out

2521
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,960
where to buy Martin's potato rolls in Los Angeles.

2522
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:02,560
And it is only available for restaurant supply.

2523
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:03,760
I mean, you could think about like,

2524
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:05,680
maybe you could get rid of enough of them

2525
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:07,880
if you got like a thousand Martin's potato rolls.

2526
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:08,720
I mean, that's true.

2527
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:10,960
I start, you know, reselling.

2528
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,280
This is all frustrating,

2529
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,720
but I do just want to remind everybody

2530
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,560
that you can still get Mariah Carey's cookies

2531
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,880
for approximately $5 a cookie.

2532
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:21,120
As far as you know.

2533
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:23,200
I don't know about the time.

2534
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:24,040
Yeah, that was weeks ago.

2535
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:25,400
We don't know.

2536
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:28,600
So I didn't get the Ice,

2537
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:30,800
but I did get a nice 20 minute conversation

2538
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:31,640
with Mike Ambuza.

2539
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:33,280
Wow.

2540
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:36,400
Where he outlined some hopes and dreams.

2541
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:39,320
Well, first of all, he was like, how did you find me?

2542
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:41,240
And I said, you're on the website.

2543
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:42,680
And then also you could just Google

2544
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:44,440
and then your name's on the other website.

2545
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,200
And he was like, oh, you're a detective.

2546
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:48,920
And then he told me that currently

2547
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:50,520
you can't get the stuff in LA,

2548
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,200
but that there's a future plan

2549
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:55,560
that was kind of like the one in view on

2550
01:34:55,560 --> 01:35:00,560
to ideally be shipping the Ice under the Kblip name

2551
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:01,840
from Vegas pretty soon.

2552
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:04,200
So fingers crossed we'll all be deep in Ice

2553
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:05,280
at some point soon.

2554
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:08,560
And he also told me that they're planning

2555
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:12,160
on five new Kblip locations in the next year,

2556
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:13,400
down from 20.

2557
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,520
Okay, more manageable.

2558
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,280
I mean, who knows?

2559
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:19,800
But the most important thing that he said

2560
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:20,880
was he asked me,

2561
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,280
cause then he goes like, wait, wait, wait.

2562
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:24,440
Cause this is like, he goes like, what?

2563
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:26,280
Wait, you went to Overton?

2564
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:27,520
You live in LA?

2565
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:28,760
And I was like, yeah.

2566
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:30,480
And he's like, wait, what?

2567
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:33,160
And I was like, you went all the way there?

2568
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:35,680
And I was like, yeah, I'm a, I'm a Chris Angel fan.

2569
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:38,080
He's like, listen to me.

2570
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:40,000
Chris Angel is a good man.

2571
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,280
He's such a good person.

2572
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,640
And he just went on and on about like,

2573
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:44,000
what a good guy Chris Angel is.

2574
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,760
He's like, we grew up in a similar part of town.

2575
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:48,760
He's really loyal to his friends.

2576
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:50,680
He takes care of lots of kids.

2577
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:51,520
He does all that charity.

2578
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:52,360
What a good guy.

2579
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:53,520
What a good guy to work for.

2580
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:55,160
And so I walked away just like,

2581
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:57,320
I mean, I trust Mike at this point.

2582
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:59,160
And he says, Chris is a really good guy.

2583
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:02,240
So what better way to close out restaurant,

2584
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:05,800
a celebrity than with a guy who's not a bastard.

2585
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:07,080
With a good guy.

2586
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:08,600
We've been talking about guys,

2587
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:10,560
but maybe he's not a guy.

2588
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,480
Maybe he's a good guy.

2589
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:14,840
Like we're good boys.

2590
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:15,680
That's right.

2591
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:17,560
Sometimes guys can be good.

2592
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:18,400
Sometimes.

2593
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,240
And then we can sign off on them.

2594
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:22,440
That sounds like a men's rights thing going on here.

2595
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:24,520
But the idea that like.

2596
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,680
Yeah, well, allow me to continue.

2597
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:27,520
Yes.

2598
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,000
He's a maniac.

2599
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,080
He makes stuff up.

2600
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:32,640
He makes terrible decisions.

2601
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:36,400
He does stuff before things sit through maybe.

2602
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:41,560
He gets like antibodies from like the worst possible doctor.

2603
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:43,960
Names his daughter after his coffee.

2604
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:46,360
But at the end of the day, like he's a good guy.

2605
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:48,040
I like, that's my thesis.

2606
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:48,880
That's great.

2607
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:49,720
Chris Angel's a good man.

2608
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:53,160
And he was, we know that Mike is a good guy.

2609
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:55,640
So then obviously his word was trustworthy.

2610
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:57,720
Somebody said he was a good guy

2611
01:36:57,720 --> 01:36:59,480
and he says another guy's a good guy.

2612
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:01,120
That means they're all good guys.

2613
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:02,040
Well, yeah.

2614
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:03,240
And some of those other guys,

2615
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:05,400
like if they're swindling from other swindlers,

2616
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:07,800
it's like, well, kind of a lateral mood, you know,

2617
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,480
like kind of evens the score.

2618
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:10,320
Sure, yes.

2619
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:11,160
I don't.

2620
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:13,400
And I have these gifts for you guys

2621
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:14,920
to commemorate Celebrary.

2622
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:16,440
They're Ka-Blip Beer Cousine.

2623
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:18,640
Yes, Ka-Blip stuff.

2624
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:19,960
Oh, I'm so honored.

2625
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:24,160
But from the side, they say, don't whine, drink beer.

2626
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:27,720
And then an even worse logo than I've seen before,

2627
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:29,640
because the C is under the blip

2628
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:30,960
and the C is inside the B.

2629
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,720
Multiple versions of the logo.

2630
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,240
Yeah, this is like the worst one.

2631
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:36,760
So this is for you guys to, for your beers.

2632
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:37,600
Wow.

2633
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:38,440
Yeah, yeah.

2634
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:40,240
The beers for us guys.

2635
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:41,080
Yeah, for the guys.

2636
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:41,920
The good guys.

2637
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:42,760
The good guys.

2638
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:44,760
The good guys.

2639
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:45,840
Wow, wow.

2640
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:46,840
That's incredible.

2641
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:50,480
And what a physical journey that you've been on.

2642
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:52,480
A turn like the Manson book.

2643
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,720
I also want to say, like, just, I looked up,

2644
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:56,720
just to make sure, because, you know,

2645
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:58,440
we're talking about, oh, some stuff doesn't make sense.

2646
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:02,200
I looked up the menu for the old restaurant, too.

2647
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:03,280
What was that like?

2648
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:04,960
And it, there's, look,

2649
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:06,560
there's some inconsistencies on that too.

2650
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:08,480
So I think there's an improvement here.

2651
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:09,320
Whoa.

2652
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:10,320
Okay.

2653
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:11,920
So like, it says sugars, and it's kind of a vague,

2654
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:13,800
like, vague, like, logo.

2655
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:15,560
It's like a sign, like, not Seinfeld,

2656
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:17,840
but almost like a 90s logo.

2657
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,920
It's hard to see it, but anyway.

2658
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,200
Part of the menu says breakfast,

2659
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:23,280
then one plate says home plate hamburgers.

2660
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,920
Okay, baseball, right?

2661
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:26,800
That seems like where we're going.

2662
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:30,080
And then it goes to first inning.

2663
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,720
Okay, that's appetizers and soups.

2664
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:33,280
Great, this is a baseball themed place.

2665
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:35,800
And then it says the part where they have steaks,

2666
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:37,000
the main event.

2667
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,400
That's the page called the main event.

2668
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:40,640
That's not in baseball.

2669
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:43,040
I guess the game is the main event.

2670
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,240
No, they never call a baseball game the main event.

2671
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:47,320
Play ball, it's time for the main event.

2672
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:50,080
That's boxing or pro wrestling.

2673
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:50,920
Yeah.

2674
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:52,120
So this, look at this.

2675
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:53,240
This is all over the place.

2676
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:54,080
Sugar is needed.

2677
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:54,920
The place.

2678
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:55,760
Touch up.

2679
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:56,600
That's what I'm saying.

2680
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:58,880
He had to come in and add these special touches.

2681
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,240
Exactly.

2682
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:03,480
Including, and this doesn't top the, you talked to,

2683
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:04,960
master, I saw it, just Mike Gimbusa,

2684
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,600
but I also, I put in a call to Kblip several days ago

2685
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:12,560
because I was curious about one thing that we missed,

2686
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:14,200
which is the love table.

2687
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:17,080
They have a magic room and they have a love table.

2688
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:18,760
And I could find no further information

2689
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:19,960
about the love table.

2690
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:22,320
And I called and it was a similar, yes.

2691
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:25,160
And it was a similar situation to you with the drink

2692
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:30,160
where I was handed from a young girl to a manager who,

2693
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:35,080
I just asked a couple of details about the love table.

2694
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:36,440
And he said that mainly, well, you know,

2695
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:38,400
the tables are all kind of close together.

2696
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:41,200
So the love table is, you know, you got more space.

2697
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:42,760
You're removed from everybody.

2698
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:44,800
So that's what, so it's, and I said, oh,

2699
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,800
is it kind of off to the side or in another room?

2700
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,360
And he said, no, no, no, it's,

2701
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:50,440
it's in the middle of the restaurant actually.

2702
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:55,440
But, and it is a type of granite that lights up and glows.

2703
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:56,480
Whoa.

2704
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:57,320
Yeah, yeah.

2705
01:39:57,320 --> 01:39:58,440
So that's pretty good.

2706
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:00,840
And I said, he asked if I wanted to reserve it.

2707
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:03,120
I said, oh, I'm still figuring out when I might be there.

2708
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:04,400
Is it like a problem to get it?

2709
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,000
And he said, no, no, no.

2710
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:13,800
So another good guy, another, you know, they had to,

2711
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:17,040
I think Chris had to come in, apply these,

2712
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:20,200
these magical things, a weird upside down,

2713
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:23,200
starting around guy, a wonderful love table.

2714
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:26,120
I, I, boy, it would be wonderful if we could all be

2715
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:30,280
at the love table together because we love having you, Eva.

2716
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:32,440
Although I don't think four people could fit at the love.

2717
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:34,040
I'm almost sure that four people could not fit

2718
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:34,880
at the love table.

2719
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,440
We could go, we could do the magic room though.

2720
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:37,280
I would love to do that.

2721
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:39,120
Yeah, that's what you want.

2722
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:40,840
What about you by your own criteria?

2723
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:43,360
How do you judge Kblip for this month?

2724
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:44,200
Oh, interesting.

2725
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:45,120
Well, we've been doing this.

2726
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:48,040
We've been saying, is there a way to Oscar it up?

2727
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:51,240
Which is stuff that you add to the top of stakes.

2728
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:54,160
Is there possibly a way to Oscar it up?

2729
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:55,000
Well, how are they?

2730
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,840
Generally it like knowing that it works okay.

2731
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:01,120
You didn't seem to recommend the wings or pizza.

2732
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:01,960
Or the salad.

2733
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:02,800
Or the salad.

2734
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:05,480
You didn't take anything to go for your husband?

2735
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:06,680
You didn't take anything to go?

2736
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:07,840
No, I would have recommended,

2737
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:10,960
I also would have liked a metal silverware as well.

2738
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:12,120
It was still plastic.

2739
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:16,680
The food in general, I think could be plused up.

2740
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:19,440
And I would like to be, have all the hundred flavors

2741
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:22,520
are on the Carlos Italian Ice website.

2742
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:24,680
And I would like to be able to have all hundred.

2743
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:26,200
That's too much.

2744
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:27,800
Like a Rita's or a Joe's.

2745
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:31,480
Usually has like 15 to 20 flavors that they rotate.

2746
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:34,240
And when they're out, they're out for the day.

2747
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:35,960
But like, man, a hundred.

2748
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:38,160
That seems like you would want the whole restaurant

2749
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:39,160
committed to ice.

2750
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:42,120
I would love if it was an ice restaurant.

2751
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:42,960
Yeah.

2752
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:43,800
That might be the way to go.

2753
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:44,640
Kblip Ice.

2754
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:46,960
Don't, Kblip doesn't stand for anything anymore.

2755
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:48,800
It's just the word.

2756
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:49,640
It's like Epcot.

2757
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:51,160
Let's get the transition back.

2758
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:52,320
It's about the spirit.

2759
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,400
It doesn't matter what it stands for.

2760
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:54,240
We don't even remember.

2761
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:56,960
There's Fat Tuesdays every half a block.

2762
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:59,680
Like a nicer Fat Tuesdays.

2763
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:01,240
Like that you carry around.

2764
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:02,760
You get a little buzz.

2765
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:05,080
Carry Carlos everywhere.

2766
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:05,920
Yeah.

2767
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:06,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2768
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:08,560
Send Mike's kids to college.

2769
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:12,640
Help the doctor get a surgery

2770
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:15,120
so that his hand isn't like a fish anymore.

2771
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:16,520
Let's help all the guys.

2772
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:19,640
And all these guys need our support.

2773
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:21,440
Send ice to the escape camp.

2774
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:26,000
All the kids who are escaping to there need ice.

2775
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,320
Give money to master iceologist Mike Gambuza

2776
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:32,160
to create an ice camp to teach kids

2777
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:34,680
how to pass along his ice tradition.

2778
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:37,680
We need to like help kids who don't have a place to go

2779
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:38,920
and don't have a path in life.

2780
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:43,360
Give them the path to become a master iceologist.

2781
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:44,200
I would love.

2782
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:45,360
Gambuza's ice camp.

2783
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:49,920
Jason, would you take an apprenticeship

2784
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:51,200
with Mr. Gambuza?

2785
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:53,000
It's in Raconkoma.

2786
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:55,320
That's where he lives.

2787
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:56,160
Where?

2788
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:57,000
Raconkoma.

2789
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,840
Is that the name of the town in New York?

2790
01:42:58,840 --> 01:42:59,680
Oh, in New York.

2791
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:02,040
Raconkoma?

2792
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:03,520
Yeah, I never know how to pronounce that.

2793
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:06,000
He lives there, the place with the weird name.

2794
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,920
Jason Sheridan, apprentice iceologist.

2795
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:09,720
The iceologist's apprentice.

2796
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:11,280
Oh, wow.

2797
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:12,400
That's a movie.

2798
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:14,440
I have been, extended family used to run

2799
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:16,960
a couple of Rita's franchises back in Veltelvania.

2800
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:19,480
We would go and hang out behind,

2801
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:20,920
like they had a couch and a TV.

2802
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:23,000
Well, forget everything you've learned.

2803
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:23,840
Oh, I'm actually.

2804
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:25,160
We're slapping it out of you.

2805
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:26,000
We're starting fresh.

2806
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,080
This is all gonna be new.

2807
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:28,720
Master Mike.

2808
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:29,560
This is gonna be like a,

2809
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:30,640
he's not gonna wanna train you.

2810
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:34,240
It's gonna be like Anakin and Obi-Wan and.

2811
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:37,800
I just know you gotta turn that ice over.

2812
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:39,280
Like I'm wondering how long the ice

2813
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:40,120
is staying in those freezers.

2814
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:41,360
Cause a few days in a freezer,

2815
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:44,760
ice starts to, you know, get a crusty layer.

2816
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:47,000
It just gets freezer burned.

2817
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:47,840
Call him up.

2818
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:50,400
That's why he needs to open the storefront

2819
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:51,400
and the strip.

2820
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:52,240
Yeah.

2821
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:53,080
I wanna go.

2822
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:54,040
Yeah, yeah.

2823
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:57,880
Well, I want to see Jason trying to turn the ice

2824
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:00,880
over too quickly, like conducting a bunch of ice

2825
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:02,720
that comes magically to life.

2826
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:05,760
And then suddenly there's ice exploding out of every.

2827
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:08,640
Every piece of equipment and everything.

2828
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:11,680
But then there's too much ice and Jason starts to slip.

2829
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:14,400
Bellagio fountains then across the way,

2830
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:17,720
the ice, you know, the ice capates.

2831
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:19,960
The ice, some sort of ice show.

2832
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,520
It's built, you know.

2833
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:24,400
And then a silent, glowering Mike Gambusa

2834
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:26,120
in a tall wizard's hat shows up.

2835
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:26,960
It's like.

2836
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,160
Bump, bump, bump.

2837
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:30,080
No, no, no.

2838
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,320
I'm, I'll take off the ice-ology.

2839
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:35,560
Just ice off, don't take the scooper out of my whole skirt.

2840
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:36,400
I'm sorry.

2841
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:38,400
Bump, bump, bump, bump.

2842
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:42,040
And of course all ends just like on Mustafar

2843
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:45,360
in Revenge of the Sith with you fighting Mike Gambusa.

2844
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:49,640
It's some sort of a duel.

2845
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:52,040
Instead of lava, it's the opposite of a lava.

2846
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:52,880
Yeah, it's ice.

2847
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:53,720
It's ice planet.

2848
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:54,560
Mango ice.

2849
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:57,720
It's reverse Mustafar as an ice planet.

2850
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:59,040
It's a sweet ice planet.

2851
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:00,520
From the planet Ellusia.

2852
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:02,280
You had shows at one.

2853
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:03,360
You were the joke.

2854
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:08,360
Mike Gambusa cuts you in half.

2855
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:12,840
You end up hanging upside down from the magic room.

2856
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:13,680
Instead of Chris.

2857
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:16,320
Where do you guys get those things?

2858
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:17,960
Those are pretty realistic.

2859
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:19,400
Yes, they are.

2860
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,480
Oh my God.

2861
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:26,920
Geez, what a journey this entire month.

2862
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:30,760
And it's really made it having you with us

2863
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:31,960
telling us this story.

2864
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:35,960
You know, not every celebrity restaurant story is closed.

2865
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:37,880
Some are even just beginning.

2866
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:41,200
And we encourage you out there to drive to Moapa Valley.

2867
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:45,360
Look for Mike, look for all our friends,

2868
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:48,600
Costa and Chris and everybody.

2869
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:50,560
Live your kablip story.

2870
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:51,920
It's still happening.

2871
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:56,480
And boy, all of these have been so wonderful,

2872
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,240
especially the ones you joined us for.

2873
01:45:58,240 --> 01:46:00,440
Eva Anderson, you survived Celebrary.

2874
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:02,560
You just survived, I don't know if you know this,

2875
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:06,240
you just survived your 10th podcast, The Ride.

2876
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:11,080
The first non-Ghost Boy guest to reach 10 episodes.

2877
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:13,400
You get to reach double digits.

2878
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:15,240
Thank you so much, Eva.

2879
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:16,680
I'm so emotional, thank you guys.

2880
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:18,520
Oh my God, it's my favorite podcast.

2881
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:20,640
I'm so grateful that you had me

2882
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:22,680
and I'll come back a million times.

2883
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:24,280
I love it so much.

2884
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:25,120
Thank you.

2885
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:26,280
Please, please do.

2886
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:29,040
Your frequent presence on it and your support of it.

2887
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:31,560
Oh my God, from the beginning, even when you're not on it,

2888
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:33,760
you listen and you tell us stuff that you like

2889
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:35,120
and it encourages us.

2890
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:40,040
And you being a part of all this makes it so, so thank you.

2891
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:41,600
I do have something to plug this month.

2892
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,080
Yes, yeah. For this final episode.

2893
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:47,440
I wrote on the Apple TV drama, We Crashed,

2894
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:52,080
which premieres in two and a half weeks, March 19th

2895
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:53,760
with Anne Hathaway and Jared Leto.

2896
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:55,400
It's super fun.

2897
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:59,200
It's about WeWork and the rise and fall of Adam Newman.

2898
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:01,640
Jared Leto's wild in it.

2899
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:05,120
It's really, so is Anne Hathaway and check it out.

2900
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:07,240
What a guy, the WeWork founder.

2901
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:08,360
Yeah. What a guy.

2902
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:11,520
It's a super funny story of the tech stories.

2903
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:13,680
It's one of the weirdest, craziest ones, I think.

2904
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:14,520
So.

2905
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:17,160
Were you like, was there a lack of confidence on your end

2906
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:19,440
that you could write for and tell the tale

2907
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:23,880
of a long haired businessman with lots of insane ideas

2908
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:25,920
and bad instincts? A weird grading accent.

2909
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:28,120
And a very strange way of speaking.

2910
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:31,200
Oh man.

2911
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,040
Oh geez, great.

2912
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:33,360
I can't wait for that.

2913
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:34,800
So excited to see it.

2914
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:37,040
And yeah, thank you for all of the celebrity.

2915
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:38,560
This is wonderful.

2916
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:40,720
We turn back to Podcast the Ride.

2917
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:43,040
We'll see if we can manage it.

2918
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,160
We'll start saying the names again.

2919
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:47,000
We'll say all the names.

2920
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,320
But I'm sure there's still more guys to come.

2921
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:50,160
We know that there will be.

2922
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:52,400
You can find us on the socials at Podcast the Ride.

A great month.

2929
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:06,080
I had a really good time.

2930
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,240
I can't think of any way to Oscar it.

2931
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:10,720
Neither can I.

2932
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:13,080
Forever.

2933
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:15,640
Dog.
