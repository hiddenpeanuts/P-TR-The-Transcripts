1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,080
Warning, the following podcast contains a retconned lamp, an anniversary treat for one,

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:18,360
the offensively boring and disgustingly unthemed tram roadway, and most exciting, discussion

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,080
of various protocols.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,600
All this plus podcast the ride goes back to Disneyland.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:52,840
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the podcast about theme parks hosted by boys who are so good

8
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,240
that not going to Disneyland for 14 months is their version of edging.

9
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:06,520
I'm, as an edgy joke, courtesy of me, the edgelord, Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson joins

10
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
me.

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,240
Oh my gosh, that makes me so uncomfortable thinking about that.

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,200
I kind of know what you're talking about.

13
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,320
Like, I kind of know.

14
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,200
I've heard it in a context, but is it ever, it's like what Sting does, right?

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,280
The singer Sting, the same thing?

16
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,280
That's related.

17
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,280
You probably put fancier terms on it.

18
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,280
That's a little different.

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,280
That's like pro level.

20
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,280
Well, Jason sure didn't hear what he was saying.

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,280
He was saying the difference.

22
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:33,160
Well, no, Tantric is like you go like hours and hours or like a day or something.

23
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,160
Yeah, but what?

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,160
But is it?

25
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,480
Yeah, I think I believe that edging could be just a matter of minutes.

26
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
Yeah, could be minutes.

27
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,480
Why don't you edge for a day?

28
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,320
I mean, I guess mechanically, yeah, it is kind of the same.

29
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,320
You're saying it is a more short term version of Tantric.

30
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,840
Yeah, the two of you, something.

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,840
You really swallowed your words.

32
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:02,160
You're dipping your little toesies into the spirit of Eros, you know, the spirit of the

33
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,160
erotic God.

34
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,360
What's the term for that?

35
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,800
What's the edging-esque term for dipping your toes into the spirit?

36
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,920
I think that I don't know.

37
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,160
That was just kind of off the cuff.

38
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,560
I'm looking at Eros here and I just want to determine is Eros cute?

39
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,360
Is the mischievous God of love?

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,880
There's got to be so many depictions of heroes.

41
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,960
It'd be hard to, you'd have to judge on an Eros by Eros basis.

42
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:39,040
Yeah, this image says Eros, or it's an article, I think, Eros, the naughty superhero of love.

43
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,040
And then that Kickstarter was funded to the tune of $200,000.

44
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,680
Wow, a new podcast, the right character, Eros.

45
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,400
The mythical God of love?

46
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,600
I think we're, I mean, he's public domain, right?

47
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Eros?

48
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,000
So we could use him.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,200
The naughty, ooh boy.

50
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,840
This can't be how anyone expected the episode to begin that is about our return to the golden

51
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
gates of-

52
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,160
I think we could go down the pantheon of Greek gods.

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,880
I think we could squeeze it in.

54
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,560
Determine which are naughty and which are just cheeky.

55
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
Yeah.

56
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:25,120
I want to know, this is about a moment that we have all waited for for so long, for so

57
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,160
many months, for over a year, moments, separate moments, because we did not all go together.

58
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,120
But separately, over the last few weeks, we have all made our return to the Disneyland

59
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,120
Resort.

60
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
Yes.

61
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,640
And we're very excited to share our findings.

62
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,600
It was fun.

63
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,200
It is kind of fun because we all went on different weeks, different levels of capacity potentially

64
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,240
and different operational things.

65
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:57,000
I had some very unique operational things the day I was there and I'm curious to see

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,400
if they're still carrying it onwards.

67
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,400
It's going to be a lot of operational talk today.

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
I love it.

69
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
I love it.

70
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,040
We're going to go through how they're operating during this time.

71
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,280
Tape on the ground.

72
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,520
Galaxy's Edge specific bathroom markers.

73
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,600
Some days we're looking at the sky and today we're looking at the ground.

74
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Yeah.

75
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,480
So here's the tease for my section of this episode.

76
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,720
First half of the day, I said, man, it's going to be a lot of operations talk.

77
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,640
It's going to be a lot of talk about protocols, how well thought out things are as far as

78
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,040
the pandemic is concerned.

79
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,560
And then the second half of the day happened.

80
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,680
And I'll say this, and this is not serious.

81
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,440
It's not as crazy as you might think.

82
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,680
The second half of the day, I visited the Disney doctor.

83
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Oh no.

84
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
Oh no.

85
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
It's not as serious.

86
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,560
I don't want to hype it up to be something crazy, crazy, but I, for the first time in

87
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,360
my life, had to see the Disney doctor.

88
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
Let me just say that.

89
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
Oh my God.

90
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,800
Well, that's like, do we, do we ask more questions now or do we just put the pin in that?

91
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Maybe with the pin in it.

92
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,920
The enticing tease of chapters to come.

93
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,960
That's very crazy.

94
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,440
And a first for every odd in any episode, let alone this one where health is what's

95
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
on all of our minds.

96
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,840
It's very embarrassing why I was at the Disney doctor.

97
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
I will say that.

98
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,840
Oh man.

99
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,840
Yeah.

100
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,840
Yeah.

101
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,880
Do something about Marriott.

102
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,400
Wait, what?

103
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,600
Like you, did you get your, you get your penis caught in a zipper?

104
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,120
Oh, I was thinking you meant I got something caught in my hair.

105
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
That could be that too.

106
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,120
Yes.

107
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
I should be more specific.

108
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,120
This episode is so dirty.

109
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,760
14 months of just infected your brains.

110
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,600
Twisted movies, like something about Mary, unrated edition.

111
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
I couldn't remember.

112
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Yeah.

113
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
I was like, balls caught.

114
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Yeah, that's right.

115
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
No, that did not happen.

116
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
That was not the problem.

117
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,200
That would, I would hype that up to the moon.

118
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh, that would be an event.

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,400
I thought you said Marriott and I was like, something Marriott related?

120
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,640
That's like a, you know, there's like porn parodies of movies.

121
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,560
There would be like milder parodies of movies that you would enjoy.

122
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,560
There's something about Marriott.

123
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,560
Ah, yes.

124
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,600
A nice film about a hotel.

125
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,200
They lost my reservation, but then thankfully they failed it.

126
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Hotel based parodies.

127
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Hotel based parodies.

128
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Yeah.

129
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,680
There is something about Marriott.

130
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,280
Free soaps, shampoo and conditioner to take home with me.

131
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,280
I'm trying to think of another, like a Sheridan.

132
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
Here, pitch on this real quick.

133
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,200
Sheridan hotels, uh, share, uh, share.

134
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
Hmm.

135
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Share.

136
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
Something with den.

137
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,360
Yeah.

138
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,960
What's a movie with den in it?

139
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
I don't know.

140
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
I guess we'll come back to this.

141
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
Yeah.

142
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
Okay.

143
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
Or share a ton.

144
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,560
Uh, okay.

145
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,360
I can't think of anything with ton in either.

146
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
What a, oh boy.

147
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,800
Man, I really set us up for a failure here.

148
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Yeah, that's all right.

149
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
I'm so sorry.

150
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
You know what?

151
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
You're still on the men.

152
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
You went yesterday, you know?

153
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Oh yeah.

154
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,280
The home, the home woods sweetest thing.

155
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,360
There you go.

156
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
Yes.

157
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
Right?

158
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
Is this home?

159
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Am I making that up?

160
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
Was homewood?

161
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,760
Did I just make up a hotel chain entirely?

162
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,920
Jason, is that a real hotel chain?

163
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
Homewood.

164
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
It is, right?

165
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
Uh, yeah.

166
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Home.

167
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
Homewood sweets.

168
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
It sure is.

169
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
Oh great.

170
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
Okay.

171
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
And it's another Cameron.

172
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,400
Everything you need to feel at home no matter how long you stay.

173
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Book today.

174
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Mm-hmm.

175
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,880
And it's a, uh, it's a, uh, I'm trying to think it's another Cameron Diaz movie.

176
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,880
Uh, oh, that's right.

177
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,880
Oh yeah.

178
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,720
I didn't even remember what the sweetest thing was.

179
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Mm-hmm.

180
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Yeah.

181
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
That was a sort of, it was kind of a bomb.

182
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
Um, all right.

183
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,720
Well I'll come, I'll think about this.

184
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,320
I'll zone out during the episode and come up with a couple funny ones for the end.

185
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
Okay.

186
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,680
And homewood sweets has a mascot, Louis the Duck.

187
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,680
Oh.

188
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
That's another character discussion.

189
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
Yes.

190
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Is Louis the Duck?

191
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,440
Well, you know, Greek deities, they're always turning into things.

192
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,640
Do you think Eros hides out on earth under the guise of Louis the Duck on occasion?

193
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,640
Is that naughty Eros?

194
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
Yeah.

195
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,200
Uh, Louis the Duck is cute.

196
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Look at this.

197
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,000
This is Louis the Duck Saves the Day.

198
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Whoa.

199
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And he's got a rake.

200
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,200
They, they seem to put out, uh, books of this.

201
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,040
Louis the Duck Cleans the World.

202
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,680
It's Scrubbing the Whole Globe.

203
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Mm-hmm.

204
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,680
Louis, thanks Louis.

205
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
Geez.

206
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,640
This, the homewood sweets duck mascot as a full toy line and book series.

207
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Toy line.

208
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
It goes to Canada.

209
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
All right.

210
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
Louis the Duck is also coming.

211
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Oh man, it won't happen to me later.

212
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
Yeah.

213
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Um, but for now, Disneyland.

214
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Disneyland.

215
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
Where is our destination?

216
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
We're back.

217
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
We went back.

218
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,640
And it's, it does feel, it, uh, I don't know.

219
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,640
Overall, everybody happy?

220
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,640
Had a great day.

221
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,640
Yeah, real good time.

222
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
I did.

223
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,320
And I will say that I, I, maybe you guys share this or I am a crazy person, obviously, for,

224
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,080
for some of this, uh, from what I'm about to say.

225
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,520
The first thing that I was like struck by is that, you know, since annual passes are

226
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,200
not back, um, is that, oh, okay.

227
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,040
My time is limited here.

228
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,240
I only have so much time to do so much.

229
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,600
And I'm, you know, spoiler alert, we'll be going, uh, going back for Avengers.

230
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,520
But after that, I don't know when I'm going back.

231
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,320
I don't know necessarily if it might be like by the time there's a new annual pass loyal

232
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,560
to whatever they decide to do.

233
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,640
So I felt like not scared.

234
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,880
Because again, that's, I'm not completely out of my mind, but I felt like that weird

235
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,660
vacation crunch that we always talk about when people say, oh, why do you like to go

236
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,080
down to that Disneyland so much?

237
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
Isn't that a big pain?

238
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,700
And you go, no, it's breezy.

239
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,700
It's a nice trip.

240
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,120
And you have a little drink in the middle of the day.

241
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:52,320
I felt this, this crush now also they don't have max pass, fast pass, single rider, all

242
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,720
of my tools.

243
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,080
I felt like Batman, you know, when they would strip Batman of his belt and his costume and

244
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,480
he just had his fist in his wits.

245
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,800
Just had his fist in his wits.

246
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,360
Like Rachel Gould takes all his clothes off and puts them in like a tent and fights him

247
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,480
with a sword.

248
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,000
That's how I felt too.

249
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,600
So I felt completely disoriented the first hour and also on top of it, of course, everything

250
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,720
is different because of COVID protocols.

251
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,900
So I was totally trying to get my bearings for how the day was going to go.

252
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,520
The wait times were like so high already.

253
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,340
110 minutes for guardians.

254
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,180
No chance of a fast pass.

255
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,100
I was like, I don't know what's going on here.

256
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,060
I don't know how to approach this.

257
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,660
I don't know what to do.

258
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,660
Huh.

259
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:37,940
See, I never, the week I went and I was the first of the three of us to go down, I didn't

260
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,140
see anything over 40 minutes.

261
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,140
45 minutes.

262
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,140
You were at a lower capacity day.

263
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,140
Yeah.

264
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,460
So, but we still felt the crunch to some extent.

265
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,460
Yeah.

266
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,600
But I knew I would be back for Avenger.

267
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,740
So I think I felt it a little less.

268
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,540
But we, I think I said this on another episode recently.

269
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:08,860
So I was like up at like 630 to get dressed and then start refreshing my phone like two

270
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,100
minutes before seven to get the rise of the resistance.

271
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,100
Sure.

272
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,100
Virtual queue.

273
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,100
And I got it.

274
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,920
I got it in like group 29.

275
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,040
By the time we drove down there and like we're exiting the parking garage, they're like,

276
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,640
okay, you have one hour to get here.

277
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,360
So it's like, okay, I guess we're, I guess we know what we're doing first.

278
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
So

279
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
Oh yeah.

280
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,080
It was, it was dictated for you.

281
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,080
Yes.

282
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:40,840
And it was also like a bit of a, you know, you walk from the parking garage through the

283
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
tram route.

284
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,840
You can do the bridge to downtown Disney by the old ESPN zone.

285
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,920
But I was like, well, let's see what the tram route is like.

286
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
Okay.

287
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,680
Walking the tram route is pretty boring.

288
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,040
There's not much.

289
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,040
Okay.

290
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,040
So yeah.

291
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,080
So, so it was Jason saying like, they're not doing any trams anymore.

292
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,360
So if you've never been to Disneyland, basically you park in now one of two giant parking structures.

293
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,520
Generally you just get in a tram and they take you right to the front to the Esplanade.

294
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,520
Yeah.

295
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,720
Cause security is all right before the tram now.

296
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,480
And by the time this comes out, trams could be back.

297
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
We don't know.

298
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
They keep changing stuff.

299
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,400
This is a slice in time.

300
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,080
This is a moment in time.

301
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,080
Yeah.

302
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
Certain protocols.

303
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,920
This will be an artifact that people will just study it for years to come to see exactly

304
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,320
where you could stand in the Disneyland resort.

305
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
So yeah.

306
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,800
So Jason, you alluded to this before.

307
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
I don't know.

308
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:37,120
Is it an episode that hasn't come out yet about how you found walking the tram route

309
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,240
so unpleasant?

310
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
You hate it.

311
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,120
Well, no, I didn't say I don't know if I hate it.

312
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,120
I was curious to see what it looked like, but it just felt like so long and it's just

313
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,000
like the undecorated backside of like downtown Disney.

314
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,080
And I think walking the length of downtown Disney, it's like Vegas.

315
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,960
It's like, yeah, your mind is kind of tricked because it's like there's a lot of lights

316
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,200
and sounds and everything.

317
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,320
And you can hear a little of the area music, but like not a ton.

318
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,480
And so Jamba Juice has a TV in it now.

319
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,400
So that gives you the energy you need to sprint the next half mile.

320
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,920
And a new name and look.

321
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
Oh, yeah.

322
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
They're just Jamba.

323
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,880
So by the time you've discussed all that, looked at the TV, thought like, is that 4K?

324
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,240
What kind of TV are we talking about?

325
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
You're almost at the gate.

326
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,320
But without any of those distractions.

327
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,320
That's right.

328
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
Yeah.

329
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,360
And then don't worry, I'll get to my downtown Disney experience because I patronized a number

330
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,240
of establishments on my way out.

331
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,400
Really interesting because we took the tram route back.

332
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,680
Did you walk downtown Disney Scott or did you walk tram?

333
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,760
Well, I had this whole other thing.

334
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:45,440
I did it in a different way because I not only was this my return to Disneyland, this

335
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,440
was my first.

336
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:52,120
This is my wife, Aaron and I's first overnight without our new son.

337
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,880
So, yeah, grandma was taking good care of him.

338
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,720
And this was so this was a little vacation for us.

339
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,040
And we decided to live it way up and spend the night at the Grand Californian.

340
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,720
Wow.

341
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,280
Which was so fantastic.

342
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,400
A ungodly expense, insanely expensive.

343
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,960
But we're like, but this is look, we've been cooped up.

344
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
This is a big deal.

345
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
Right.

346
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,240
We want everything to be as comfortable as possible.

347
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,960
And oh my God, if you stay there, you like now your security line is 10 people.

348
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,440
You're not hoofing it back and forth.

349
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,520
You're not doing the big walk for Mickey and friends.

350
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,520
Getting to do I stay there maybe once before.

351
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,920
And I don't remember if I did this then.

352
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:41,520
But that whole that you can just walk out of the private exit from California Adventure.

353
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,200
Oh my God.

354
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Like in a day of mega walking and when we're trying to that was a lot of it, too, is just

355
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,120
like, can we not have all of this stress and worry and the day isn't just all about walking?

356
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,680
Because it's also a vacation for a one day vacation for us.

357
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,680
Right.

358
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
And Grand California.

359
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,680
Oh my God.

360
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,680
You are just right in the heart of it.

361
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,680
Yeah.

362
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,400
I want to stay there because when my family comes to visit, sometimes they'll want to

363
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,760
take like one night and stay down there.

364
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,880
And we were checking into Paradise Pier and somebody behind the desk went, Oh, excuse

365
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
me.

366
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,080
Um, would you, would you want to upgrade for free to the Grand Californian?

367
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
What?

368
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,520
And we were like, yeah, okay.

369
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Yeah.

370
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,000
We're trying to save money by saying at the worst one.

371
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,680
It is if you don't know these hotels, if you aren't in the, in the LA area, yeah, it's

372
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,520
the, it's the lower of the three.

373
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,880
And still you would hear that and go, Oh, then it's probably affordable.

374
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,000
And then you will look at the price and go, no, yeah, yeah.

375
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,600
All these, they are gouging out all these hotels big time.

376
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,360
I am kicking myself that I didn't like years ago, like splurge more often because you would

377
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:53,120
use to be able to find the Grand Californian for like occasionally under 300 a night or

378
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,560
and the grand, the Disney land hotel, the same like, and, and if you want to splurge

379
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,280
like, okay, 300 night, but we don't do it that often.

380
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,600
And now it seems like, you know, all bets are off.

381
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,360
I don't know if they're especially gouging in this, like everybody's going to want to

382
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,440
come and you want to be in the heart of it, right?

383
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,920
I don't know if it's like even higher than usual.

384
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,920
Yeah, maybe.

385
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,480
But I would, but like, you know, once you get over that and you're there and like we

386
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:25,480
have a room and a room overlooking the beautiful kingdom of downtown Disney, we've got a little

387
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
upgrade.

388
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,120
I think supposed to be on a, with less of a view, but then we got a view of Napolini

389
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,200
and the new Sandal store.

390
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,040
I think we're right above Jamba with the new TV.

391
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,660
This is the heart of the action felt on top of the world.

392
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,720
So you could just like look out the window and see people walk by and go, look, the new

393
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Jamba.

394
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,720
Like they were so many people were yelling the new branding of Jamba.

395
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,440
They were yelling how excited they were.

396
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:58,800
Yes, children and their parents weep, just drop to the ground like it's the wailing wall

397
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,240
and just breathe it all in.

398
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,800
Yeah, it's really beautiful.

399
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,040
Man, that's so great.

400
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,360
Yeah, yeah, it did rule.

401
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:12,120
So yeah, so we all we all had sort of different experiences then in terms of like the hassle.

402
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,680
I might take away admittedly was because we haven't really talked about how our little

403
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
days were.

404
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,360
Jason, we heard a little bit from you just before recording an episode and it was like,

405
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,360
that was Disneyland.

406
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,360
Oh my God, the walking.

407
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,040
Yeah, it was the first thing out of your mouth.

408
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,400
You're straight to.

409
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,360
So the walking, I didn't expect the group to get called that quickly.

410
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,480
Yeah, that was the pressure I felt.

411
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,480
That's OK.

412
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,400
So now, yes, now I'm seeing your stress.

413
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
I'm stressed.

414
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,400
You were upset about the walk, mainly because you felt a time crunch.

415
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,240
I felt a time crunch from there to Galaxy.

416
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,440
Because I kind of released I released, you know, gradually released pressure of like,

417
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:01,760
we've done a lot of this before, like, let you know, I was asking Jane what she wouldn't

418
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,400
do a lot because she wasn't sure when she would be back next because she had an annual

419
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,480
pay week, annual pay.

420
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,760
We'd renewed our annual passes like right at the end of like twenty nineteen, twenty

421
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,760
twenty.

422
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,280
And we're like, well, we'll come a bunch in twenty twenty.

423
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,240
You know, so that that was we didn't have reservations for anything.

424
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,160
So the only thing we had scheduled was that rise of the resistance ride.

425
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,520
And she had not done it before.

426
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,760
Yeah. So I wanted to make sure she got to have a good experience on that.

427
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,320
Yes. So that was the only thing.

428
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,080
And combined, I mean, I think we stopped to like use the bathrooms or have a drink of

429
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,760
water on Main Street.

430
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:47,640
But I looked at like the step counter, the mile mark in the phone after we went all the

431
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,640
way back, walked through the substantial queue for rise of the resistance, did the whole

432
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,760
ride, which involves walking when we got out of the queue at that point, it was a little

433
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,360
over three miles and less than an hour.

434
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,840
And that's a lot.

435
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,600
I'm not like I'm not like jumping out of my chair.

436
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,440
I know.

437
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,520
I feel like you.

438
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,080
But I've been up since like six a.m.

439
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,120
And I was like, this was not you're not going to get me on that.

440
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,880
Yeah, no, I don't think I don't.

441
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,080
We're not. We are not the same.

442
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,440
That is correct.

443
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:26,040
But like if if this were Orlando and this was a ride, an island of adventure,

444
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,440
you would not have a single problem.

445
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,480
You would have floated over to the well.

446
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,840
No, because with the luxury of staying on site at Universal Studios Resort Orlando,

447
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,400
you can take a boat or you can walk.

448
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,160
You don't have to drive the like one to one to the five to the.

449
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,880
Yes, that is true.

450
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,360
I kept saying while Lindsay and I were walking both ways, I go, Jason hated this walk.

451
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,880
I kept I kept bringing it up.

452
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,800
I go. I loved I loved walking through a lively downtown Disney that when the park

453
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,320
because park was at seven.

454
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,840
One of the best things you can do.

455
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,240
I think that you made a big mistake, though, because I'm really happy now

456
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,040
because I'm realizing I'm we're the only people who did this walk from the tram back.

457
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,680
And again, this will probably change this.

458
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,640
There'll probably be a tram in a couple of weeks.

459
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,560
But I think what happened, and this is totally a guess,

460
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:21,160
is that people were getting a little sleepy on that walk back to the tram.

461
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,160
And it wasn't like a lively downtown Disney because they were pumping music in

462
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:33,160
on the walk back that I I've recorded it because I was so intrigued by it.

463
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,920
This is like what someone would set up a folding table at downtown

464
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,000
Disney selling their own CDs and play hand flute.

465
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,360
This is like what they would be playing.

466
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,120
I mean, you might not be able to hear it that well, but that's got a that's a groove going

467
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,280
like, yeah, I was like, yeah, what is this?

468
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,160
And I was like, you know what I bet this is.

469
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,560
They were like, we got to find some high energy music

470
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,520
because people are like dragging at the end of the day because this boring street,

471
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,160
they set up a ton of benches throughout that tram pathway.

472
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,440
Yeah, like take a seat if it's a little long.

473
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,200
And now they're just like, please leave, please go.

474
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,040
And they put like some like generic up tempo disco music

475
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,400
to get people going like, yeah, yeah, that's going back to my car.

476
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,760
Modern fifth, the Beethoven.

477
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,960
Yeah. Don't don't don't don't don't.

478
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,920
Yes. So I feel like they were like, all right, we got to go into the archives

479
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,720
and find something that will make people like really excited to get back to their car.

480
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,000
And you think that this this this like

481
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,560
drum machine plus a violin is going to just get people's blood surging.

482
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,160
Here's well, I don't I would have picked a different song.

483
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,440
But my my rationale is why wouldn't they be playing like

484
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,920
done? Why would they be playing like a sleepy end of Disneyland song?

485
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,840
Yeah. So that I don't know why they picked that particular piece of music.

486
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,600
But that's my guess is they were like, we got to find some of the most up

487
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,240
tempo thing that wouldn't offend anyone.

488
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:13,760
OK, pull the opening promotional video for downtown Disney

489
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,600
and just rip the audio and let's blast that through the speakers.

490
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,560
It's 2001 all over again, folks.

491
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,960
Most generic turn of the century jazz you can find.

492
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,400
Well, if anyone out there walked to the tram at the end of the night

493
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,600
and they were playing a similar song, let us know.

494
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm curious. Yeah.

495
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,640
Maybe they started with a sleepier Disney song and people were literally

496
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,600
falling over and falling asleep on the way back because it was such a arduous walk.

497
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,000
Can I talk about a little thing that, you know, this this this sort of

498
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,280
it's it's I guess like an end of the night thing as well.

499
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,480
But it was also the to commemorate the dawning of a new day.

500
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,000
There was this this event that happened before all this.

501
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,720
And I think we obviously have to talk about I'm sure we all watched it

502
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,480
with our loved ones, all the listeners watched it,

503
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,000
which was the the relighting of Sleeping Beauty Castle.

504
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,240
Did everybody see this online?

505
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,080
This was like, oh, yes, I did.

506
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,920
This is a seven minute live broadcast.

507
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,680
Is that right? Yeah, I did.

508
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,000
I did see this.

509
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Now, I say that sarcastically and realize we did all see this.

510
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,480
But yeah, it was this odd sort of arbitrary little event

511
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,720
where you're watching it and go and then and it happens.

512
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,680
You know, that was it.

513
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,360
Yeah, I guess so.

514
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,440
It wasn't exactly like lighting the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree.

515
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,120
This is the they just turn the lights on. It's nice.

516
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,440
I'm happy that. Sure.

517
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,120
I think a lot of the I think the park has been unlit.

518
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,640
The one time I went down at night in December to a very spare

519
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,640
downtown Disney, it was really creepy seeing no lights on Ferris wheel,

520
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,600
no lights on spires.

521
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,280
So, you know, that it's going to be lit and stay lit is a good thing.

522
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,640
But then there is this odd I just want to play a second of this video.

523
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,240
Just the odd pomp and circumstance.

524
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,800
And I'm glad, you know, as an Eisner fan, I like that they make their officials,

525
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,280
their executives come out and do weird things like this.

526
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,400
But there's this.

527
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,040
All right. So this is the video reawakening of Sleeping Beauty

528
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,240
Castle at Disneyland. And this is what is he's the president of the resort.

529
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,200
Josh Demaro.

530
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,640
No, Ken Potrock is the president.

531
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,040
He's the wartime president.

532
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,560
He came in during very difficult time. Head of parks and resorts. Yes.

533
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,880
Oh, he's had it. It's not just Disneyland.

534
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,920
He's the head of all of it.

535
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,280
Yeah, he used to be head of Disneyland.

536
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,280
Now he's the head. He's Chapek's old job. All right. All right. Yeah.

537
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,040
And this is one of these. Yeah, people like, OK, I'm gathering people

538
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,880
despise Chapek.

539
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,560
People want to see him fall off a cliff.

540
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,440
They hate Chapek so much.

541
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,360
And yet, Josh Demaro, everyone is swooning over this man.

542
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,720
I don't know what happened.

543
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,920
Suddenly, everyone. This is Prince Charming.

544
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,920
We all, everyone united and loving.

545
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,360
Anyway, this is just this odd moment here.

546
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,160
This lamp is very special.

547
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,080
It's Walt Disney's lamp. There it is.

548
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,440
It is shown in his apartment on Main Street USA every day

549
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,320
as a symbol of the Disney spirit.

550
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,160
Hello, everyone.

551
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,880
I'm Josh Demaro, chairman of Disney Parks, experiences and products.

552
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,720
Thank you for joining us tonight for this special event.

553
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,000
Throughout the past year, Walt Disney's lamp has become a beacon of hope

554
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,240
and optimism that Disneyland will reopen.

555
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,560
Of course. Yeah, we all know.

556
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,080
So definitely. Yeah, we've all thought about it.

557
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,720
The miracle of Walt Disney's lamp.

558
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,120
There was no oil in it and yet it burned for 400 nights

559
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,200
while we waited for Disneyland to reopen.

560
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,320
Crazy nights.

561
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,640
Um, I just yeah, hang on.

562
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,200
Maybe if you work there, you know this, but I also think if you work there,

563
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,920
even if you like really like Disneyland and work there,

564
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,760
it's possible that you don't like.

565
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,120
And then at the end of the night, you go,

566
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,600
let me just go reflect at the lamp.

567
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,240
You know, that's Walt's lamp.

568
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,440
And if that fire can burn, then my fire of hope can burn

569
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,440
that all my friends will be back at home again.

570
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,680
I just do who's like this?

571
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,720
Well, this is I think they're leading on that apartment a lot,

572
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,400
because I asked Jane to send me some photos and she had taken a video.

573
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,520
And we rode the omnibus, like the double decker bus down Main Street.

574
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,160
And it was very cool.

575
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,520
And, you know, the characters all happened to be on the train station.

576
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,880
And so we were going right towards them.

577
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,880
And then as we passed the firehouse, the guy immediately

578
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,040
like stopped talking about Main Street is like,

579
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,840
and here is coming up on the firehouse, you know, on the second floor.

580
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,360
That's Walt Disney's apartment.

581
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,440
And like he had the Walt Disney apartment.

582
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,400
So they're leaning on that a little hard on the reopening.

583
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,680
Yeah. Huh.

584
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,440
I may be because that wall, like that that core and the love

585
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,400
and the personal touch, it makes you forget about that.

586
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,000
I guess we hate shape back a lot or that, you know, that they laid people off.

587
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,040
Like, well, forget. Look, look, look what it's about.

588
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,360
What it's about at the end of the day is this mostly nice man

589
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,400
and the lamp that he loved so dear.

590
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,080
He was he has to be buried with the lamp.

591
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,320
And but we said, no, the world needs the lamp.

592
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,080
And we went against his wishes, but for good reason.

593
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,280
The lamp is it is it magic?

594
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,280
Is it like the genies lamp?

595
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,880
Is it is it's just like that's that place where we used to crash, right?

596
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,280
When he was too tired to go home.

597
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,280
Yeah, there was a hot plate. You can make a grilled cheese.

598
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,480
I mean, I like I was very lucky I got to go up and see it.

599
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,240
And I'm like, oh, the lamp is not magic.

600
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,720
But if you make a grilled cheese sandwich in the hot plate

601
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,680
and eat the sandwich, that's a magic sandwich.

602
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,760
And you and your wish will come true.

603
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,800
Do not want you to make a sandwich with that.

604
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,320
I will say they don't want you to not touch anything.

605
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,240
I mean, no, maybe nobody ever will again.

606
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,360
Only like the most like the elite of Disney,

607
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,560
like like like at his height as Jack Sparrow, Johnny Depp got to make a sandwich

608
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:10,000
and his and his wish of a 10 million dollar raise for the next Pirates came true.

609
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,680
Do you think back in the day did Kurt Russell or like Suzanne Plushett

610
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,480
get a grilled cheese from that sandwich maker?

611
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,280
Oh, I think so. Yeah, I think they're regulars.

612
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,800
I think Dean Jones had his.

613
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,680
Jules for sure.

614
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,640
Keenan wins.

615
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,840
He came every day.

616
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,080
And that how many sandwiches did Annette get?

617
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,080
So many, so many magic sandwiches.

618
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,600
Well, Wally Boag, you know, he's pocketed, you know, on his way out

619
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,520
from doing a Golden Horseshoe show, he's like, well, he worked in the park.

620
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,600
I feel like there was a.

621
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,880
Oh, you think, OK, you got to really like be a profit generator.

622
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,280
Miley Cyrus. Yeah.

623
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,880
Had a lot of magic sandwich. Right. Yeah.

624
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,240
I will. You know what?

625
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,360
I think what you're getting at, if correct me if I'm wrong,

626
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,840
is that there's this bizarre sort of maybe retconning of this specific

627
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,120
lamp in the Walt Disney legend where you're like, I don't know,

628
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,440
do you really like the lamp or like is this even in the lamp?

629
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,480
He was literally like a like a tiny room he would stay at.

630
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,960
And it wasn't like, I don't like I think this is a little strange.

631
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,960
But you know what? Let's just add some more retcon to the Walt's legend.

632
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,400
Let's make up more fake stuff that's like so special, you know, to Walt.

633
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,600
No, absolutely.

634
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,560
Yeah. Did you know like

635
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:28,600
the concrete out front was his favorite concrete that he liked?

636
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,080
The wishing stone. Yeah.

637
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,040
Yeah. He would wish on this specific concrete that he liked.

638
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,520
And they would pour it. And you know that it was really special.

639
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,680
If you put your hands on it, you sort of can feel his presence.

640
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,000
Yeah. That's what's nice.

641
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,680
He left. He left his own fingernails.

642
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,160
Yeah. In the concrete.

643
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,240
His actual fingernails. Not his impressions.

644
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,960
No, his yeah, like like he cut the tips.

645
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,160
And then one full his full thumbnail he pulled off and put into the.

646
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,600
Oh, jeez. Yeah.

647
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,240
But he needed his essence to be in there.

648
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,040
Yeah. He needed. Oh, OK. He was also a sick guy.

649
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,280
Yeah. You can.

650
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,320
If you listen, if you put your ear up to it, you can hear him wailing,

651
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,960
you know, wailing like people don't want to work.

652
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,600
They make more money staying home right now.

653
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,560
We need to do something.

654
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,960
Yeah. Yeah. So that was that's all real.

655
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,120
There's a wall.

656
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,920
There's one of his mustache hairs laid

657
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,600
when they break ground on every new attraction.

658
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,440
And that's everywhere. That's all over the world.

659
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,520
That's Hong Kong, Shanghai. Right. Right.

660
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,560
That's the when they inaugurate the ships,

661
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,880
they like bash the bottle of champagne, but also rub it with one of the

662
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,920
the whiskers that's left.

663
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,680
He left. He had like he died with like two hundred.

664
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,960
And they have to be really careful about spacing those out.

665
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,880
That's why they're slow, slow with attraction sometimes.

666
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,800
OK, we're running out.

667
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,400
We're running out. Clone.

668
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,560
It wouldn't be the same.

669
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,920
Did you know that the Navi in the tank on in right

670
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,120
of flight of passage, all that water is wild saliva.

671
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,480
He would collect his saliva over the years and they needed it

672
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,960
for a special attraction later.

673
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,280
He knew he feel that they would have a special attraction.

674
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,400
Now we're starting to paint kind of a Howard Hughes and Vegas sort of image.

675
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,840
No thumbnails.

676
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,240
Saliva, he saved his hair.

677
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,560
It was all saved.

678
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,560
He cataloged it because he knew it would be important.

679
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
He knew he was important.

680
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,880
Yeah, and he has a big vault of his piss somewhere as well.

681
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,920
He saved that too.

682
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,320
The vault has a bunch of wall.

683
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,280
It's a little of it into the into the most each day.

684
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,280
Just a little magic.

685
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,640
Walt's magic piss makes our moat what it is.

686
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,600
His spirit is alive,

687
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,760
bubbling up under each Disney duck.

688
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,320
I'd love to see Josh tomorrow read that.

689
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,000
I'd like you to read anything you put on.

690
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,720
You can get a nice figure and wears a suit well, you know,

691
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,200
well-coiffed hair, you know, very stylish.

692
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,920
I'll listen to anything.

693
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,680
This is all fine.

694
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,960
Everybody having everybody thinking this guy can get it.

695
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,680
That's great. Enjoy it, everyone.

696
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,400
He is a handsome man. I just don't know when it happened.

697
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,120
This was my what I was zero to 60.

698
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:23,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All of a sudden, one day everybody is just freaking

699
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,040
like, who's the guy from the Bridgerton?

700
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,600
Is that the right name of the show?

701
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,240
Yes. Yes.

702
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,960
Yes, Josh tomorrow within theme park.

703
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,160
And then is that guy? Yeah.

704
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,680
Well, I mean, you know, sometimes if you any pop star, you know,

705
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,360
do you really remember it building didn't just sort of feel like it appeared

706
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,640
any of the big crazes? That's true.

707
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,080
Yeah, yeah, no, there was there was no Bieber and then there was Bieber.

708
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,640
Yeah. So like Josh tomorrow is a lot like Bieber.

709
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,640
If you really think about it.

710
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,600
Anyway, I did not see him yesterday when I went.

711
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,480
Well, OK, so stuff we are here.

712
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,200
Well, there's a question we know.

713
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,160
We know Jason's first ride back.

714
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,320
It was kind of enforced.

715
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,040
Did you choose your first ride back?

716
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,200
What did it end up being?

717
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,520
How do you after all this time?

718
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,560
What's the first what's the return?

719
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
Well, we did.

720
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,600
We ate something first and went to Flo's

721
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,760
and we ate something and then we went on in credit coaster. Nice.

722
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,800
That's and yeah, because we had to start because they make you start in one park

723
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,920
and we had California Venture.

724
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,400
Then you can hop after one.

725
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,720
And we started California Venture, did in credit coaster

726
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,480
because the weight was a little less.

727
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,280
And then that's when I kind of had a sigh of relief

728
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,320
because the weight was like 30 or 40 minutes on the app.

729
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,480
But it really took us like 15 minutes in the line.

730
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,200
And you know what?

731
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,880
Maybe all of these are going to be easier than I thought.

732
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,400
And then we did made way mania again.

733
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,200
15 minutes tops. Yeah.

734
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,720
And I go, OK, because I really was looking at that app and going

735
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,480
110 minutes for guardians, like 60 minutes for like I was like,

736
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,720
we're going to get three things done today.

737
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,680
Yeah, yeah.

738
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,800
And I don't ever want to tell people like that's a guarantee.

739
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,880
But like touring plans does a great job of tracking this stuff.

740
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,680
And oftentimes their experience of actually getting through the line

741
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,600
is a hair shorter than the. Yeah.

742
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:22,200
And they do supposedly they do this psychologically to make you feel like good.

743
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,080
Because if somebody tells you something's going to be 50 minutes

744
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,200
and it takes 40 minutes, you go, why?

745
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,480
What a little trick it is.

746
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,480
But this felt really like inflated.

747
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,400
This felt like double the time when you would look at the app.

748
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,720
So because like Guardian said like 60, 70 minutes.

749
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,120
And I swear we 20 minutes and we were on.

750
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,720
So it was way inflated.

751
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,360
Should we say the time?

752
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,280
I guess I don't I don't remember where you were, Jason, and the because.

753
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,720
And this is also a thing if you don't know.

754
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,040
And if you're in Florida, where everything's just been like, hey,

755
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,760
whoever all the time always anybody into the park.

756
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,680
California has been really spaced out in terms of theme park capacity.

757
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,440
And places are moving up tiers very slowly.

758
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,960
So I ended up being there on the last day that it could only be 25 percent.

759
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,320
Right. It changed in the morning.

760
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,120
We had breakfast at the La Brea bakery right next to the ticket booths.

761
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,400
And it was flooding with people getting tickets for that day

762
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,080
because they just immediately, you know, turn the faucet back on.

763
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,560
So that mean and that went from 25 to 35 percent, which is when you.

764
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,040
So you went with a 35 percent. Yes, I was there.

765
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,160
Thirty five percent.

766
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,800
So it was a little it was still, of course, not very crowded

767
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,600
when you consider the days we've been there before. For sure.

768
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,880
We know like a labor day or.

769
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,960
Yeah. The 24 hour Disney day we were there when I was like,

770
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,600
oh, we're going to get like trampled to death by people. Yeah.

771
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,240
I can almost can't imagine it being like like now that you've done it with less

772
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,240
people, it's going to be hard to go back.

773
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,000
Yeah. It's a first class situation when you have the leg room.

774
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,960
Yeah. How do you go back to coach?

775
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,840
Yeah. It's kind of how all this this felt.

776
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,960
Jason, how much was do you think was it 25 yet or was it down to the very slim?

777
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:09,120
Fifteen percent? Well, I went I think I went May 13th.

778
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,640
So that was less than two weeks.

779
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,280
It had been reopened. So I believe it was at 25 percent.

780
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,080
You texted me a day or two before and was like, you might get

781
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,960
the tail end or we might both get the tail end of 25 percent. Right. Right.

782
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,840
Which is pretty good. You feel it.

783
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,000
You definitely feel it.

784
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,880
There is it's not all day.

785
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,720
It's not like everything feels super spaced out, but there's certain

786
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,320
there were certain moments.

787
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,600
We went to Adventureland pretty quick and you really feel it there.

788
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,960
Because if you know Disneyland, boy, is it jammed over there. Yeah.

789
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,080
I'm trying to think of other Tomorrowland, too, because that middle

790
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:48,520
that Tomorrowland zone next between Star Tours and Buzz Lightyear

791
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,760
Super anything that's always stroller central. Right.

792
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,800
A lot less stroller central and just less people.

793
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,000
Yeah. Some of the more irritating congested areas of the park

794
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,440
were definitely a lot chiller.

795
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:07,120
I have to say the four o'clock crunch in New Orleans Square, though,

796
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,240
that was where I called it.

797
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,200
That's where I tapped out.

798
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,240
I was like, let's go to California Adventure and have a drink

799
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,160
because it was just it is.

800
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,280
It's so nice when it works.

801
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,560
It's so intimate and well designed.

802
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,840
But it was made in the it was designed in the early to mid 60s.

803
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,160
And the park has a lot more people go into it now.

804
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,880
So if you factor in that and you factor in

805
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,120
a lot of only entrance doors and only exit doors

806
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:45,120
and outdoor rope queues, it got pretty gnarly over there.

807
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,400
Yeah. Yeah.

808
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,480
Well, if I could say my first attraction,

809
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,160
I didn't really have a plan until I got in.

810
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,880
And then it just felt like, you know, why don't we do it sort of chronologically?

811
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,920
Let's like do the like you never end up doing that when you're crisscrossing

812
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,120
around with Max Pass and Fast Pass.

813
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,200
Let's just like go left as Walt introduced the lands on the show.

814
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,080
So go and left into Adventureland and then straight to the Indiana Jones

815
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,680
Adventure, pretty like epic first one back. Yeah.

816
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,440
And the ride's great, obviously really enjoyed it.

817
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,320
And you got a weird plexiglass and there's less space in the car.

818
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,400
And that's all good.

819
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,880
I brought I bring it all up partially to say this is one of the more unusual

820
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,920
line setups, because that's a question.

821
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,440
If you haven't gotten to go yet or you're not on the West Coast,

822
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,160
they are keeping it outdoor lines as much as they can.

823
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,480
There's certain spaces where you sort of can't do that,

824
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,760
but limiting your in your indoor time.

825
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,440
And Indiana Jones is very interesting because the Jungle Cruise is closed

826
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,560
currently. So a lot of the queue was the second floor

827
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,800
of what is usually the Jungle Cruise.

828
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:55,160
Oh, it's really weird to be waiting in a line clearly for a different attraction.

829
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,560
And then like, I know this is the Jungle Cruise line,

830
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,840
and yet it's going to take me into Indiana. Right.

831
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,440
Yeah, I will say we talked about this on Patreon.

832
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,480
Universally, you're like, OK, they have like markers six feet apart in line.

833
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,600
That being said, you're literally standing right next to a person

834
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,240
because they're in the line over.

835
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,920
So what is it? What's the point of this?

836
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,240
You still need distance there. Right.

837
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,320
And look, I don't know. I'm not a doctor here.

838
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,880
Yes, but I saw I see what you said. That doesn't make any sense.

839
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,280
I will say Disney put a lot more work into it than Universal did.

840
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,880
But can't you say this most of the time?

841
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,680
Well, of course.

842
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,840
Well, yeah, at least they're like in the line.

843
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,360
You're like, well, there's markers and the markers aren't next to each other.

844
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,440
When there's a line. Yeah.

845
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,520
I go, oh, yeah, this was like they took another couple minutes

846
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,600
when walking through and went, yeah, we should probably put these people

847
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,520
farther away from each other.

848
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,720
Did you have a virtual queue, too?

849
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,800
I did end up doing.

850
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,680
Yeah, that's another thing.

851
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,640
There's only two rides that you can get in a sort of Max Pass ish,

852
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,440
like like digitally reserve your spot in the rise of the resistance

853
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,720
and Indiana Jones, I assume, because that's one of the first

854
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,800
when this was all starting the whole pandemic.

855
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,400
I was like, that's like the most impossible one,

856
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,200
because that's a mega line all indoors.

857
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,320
How is that going to work?

858
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,480
So I guess supplementing it with the digital is part of it.

859
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,440
But no, we just walked in. You walked it.

860
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,160
OK. Yeah.

861
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,520
Yeah, we did the virtual queue for that, but just kind of on a lark.

862
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,680
Like I think we were we stopped after.

863
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,480
I don't know. We did rise.

864
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,080
And then we had a veggie Ronto wrap and blue milk

865
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,760
because Jane had not tried either of those and they were very good.

866
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,200
Blue milk.

867
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,440
I don't know if you can see this right now,

868
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,640
but they give you a little lead for it, right?

869
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,000
They're like a little paper lead to cover it.

870
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,320
Well, it looks like a coffee ground thing, but the opposite.

871
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,240
Yeah, it looks like a little top of your drink.

872
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,880
You got the bottom of like a cupcake, a little cupcake wrapper

873
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,960
or something flipped around.

874
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,520
Yeah. And I think it's again kind of like,

875
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,680
you know, psychological kind of COVID comforting.

876
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,120
It's a little bit, though.

877
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,720
Yeah, it was very pleasant.

878
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,840
And then at some point we did like three of the fantasy land rides.

879
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,720
We did Pinocchio, Toad and Alice and Wonderland.

880
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,320
And then we got popcorn and a soda and sat on the old boat dock

881
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,320
slash smoking section, you know, that little weird part by the water and be

882
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,640
in fantasy land, in fantasy land.

883
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,680
Yeah. Kind of where the it was the motorboat cruise.

884
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,480
Wait, yes. A long time ago.

885
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,600
Yeah. Not to Snow White.

886
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,880
Did you say Snow White?

887
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,040
No, I can do it.

888
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,000
And TFO was tearing it down the day I was there.

889
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,600
Brick by brick.

890
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Thank God, because we all collectively as the left, certainly

891
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,280
we all discussed at the last meeting this Snow White ride and the kiss

892
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,280
will not stand. No, there's no way.

893
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:52,600
Face character was reading from the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx,

894
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,400
which you can now buy at every Disneyland gift shop.

895
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,040
And we're all comforted for that fact.

896
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,520
And as soon as they started selling it, the light in Walter Perman went out.

897
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,320
It was just flickered. Yeah, flickered.

898
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,520
If you can, if a little flame can be considered angry,

899
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,120
I would call it that.

900
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,320
Oh, is Walt Walt is the flame. Hey,

901
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,600
do I look over to the happy place?

902
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,520
I live in the lamp forever.

903
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,520
I'm fire now.

904
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,520
I'm fire now.

905
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,960
I'll transform into another state and got Mickey's voice.

906
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,160
And Walt Disney and Mickey's voice and fly on the flame now.

907
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,880
We should explain this case.

908
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,840
The context is missing later that the,

909
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,920
you know, there's there's all of it because all right,

910
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,320
they're changing the jungle crews.

911
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,200
And some of that is you put in the umbrella of cultural sensitivity

912
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,560
or just updating things.

913
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,560
And obviously Splash Mountain is changing at some point, someday. Not yet.

914
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,680
If you have that question, is Splash Mountain running? Yes.

915
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,360
Is it not? Is it any less song in the South? No, they've not had to.

916
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,280
That whole thing was just like in their foot in the door.

917
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,680
It's going to be Princess the Frog someday.

918
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,560
Now when it opens, but don't worry about it. It's happening. It will happen.

919
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,640
Don't worry. Don't protest.

920
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,480
So there's all these things.

921
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,000
And then all these charlatans are writing stupid articles about Disney

922
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,080
getting to PC or whatever.

923
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,960
And then so there's this like this utterly fake

924
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:22,840
Fox News story about because they just redid the Snow White

925
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,480
ride and added a new ending.

926
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,800
And it involves the prince kissing Snow White to awaken Snow White.

927
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,640
And Fox News has framed this as well.

928
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,880
The left found a new target for their cancel culture.

929
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,280
Snow White and the lack of consent in the kids based on one article,

930
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,000
one blog, one one person who clearly has a quota

931
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,520
covers popular culture and likely has a number of articles

932
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,080
they have to post a week.

933
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:55,440
And I someone someone asked me like, did you see it?

934
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,520
I'm like, no, you don't have to. It's don't worry about it.

935
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:03,400
Like, and I'm sure like, yeah, this is important discussion to have with children.

936
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,800
Yes, but like not.

937
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,040
You mean about consent. Yeah, about consent.

938
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,320
But yes, absolutely about consent.

939
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,920
But like in the context of like a movie from before World War

940
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,760
Two, you're trying to apply twenty twenty one thinking.

941
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,880
It's a cartoon. Yes, it's a good.

942
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,160
It's a cartoon with magic in play.

943
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,320
And then I yeah, I don't I don't know.

944
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,960
And Apple is magical.

945
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,760
Yeah, I guess the apples are just poison.

946
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,520
The apple's not the apple's poison.

947
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,600
Poison an apple today.

948
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,720
That's as much as you could back then.

949
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,240
Yeah. But but and I'm sure Disney's like the Imagineers thinking was just like,

950
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,400
well, it's been a few decades of people saying it doesn't end like the movie does.

951
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,680
And they're like, well, let's try to nip this in the bud.

952
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,440
And and it created a whole new can of worms.

953
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,360
Well, but it was again, it's like I don't know that people were.

954
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,400
Yeah. Outside of like an article, I'm not sure.

955
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,640
Because also Tom Martins wrote an article about the Snow White Ride

956
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,600
I don't know if you read it yet.

957
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,680
Did it come out today or yesterday?

958
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,400
And today? Yeah, I saw he posted.

959
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,640
Yeah. It also talks about how every how much thought

960
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,720
everyone put in Imagineers put into like making sure Snow White

961
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,280
had like ownership over her story and wasn't about with the prince.

962
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,440
And they put all this thought into it. Agency and yes, agency.

963
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,960
That's actually the word I want to say.

964
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,760
And like at the end, they wanted to make sure that like she's hanging out

965
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,400
with her friends and the prince is in the distance.

966
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,880
But it's not about the whole thing.

967
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:32,480
Yeah, yeah. Now she lives with this man who bellows at her in a well once.

968
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,760
Right. That's why. Yeah.

969
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,880
So I think like, you know, they put some thoughtfulness into it

970
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,960
and trying to make sure that, you know, that but yes, you're to your point.

971
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,440
Yes. Like talk to your children about actual like consent

972
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,120
and what that means in the real world. That's important.

973
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:54,080
But also Fox News is blowing this disconnect to life lessons from popular

974
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:58,280
culture the most you can because they will be getting it constantly from left

975
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,720
to right. They will just be getting pop culture shoved down their throats,

976
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,960
like from every angle, you know.

977
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,560
No, just a weird fake controversy.

978
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,600
It's just one of those I have to keep clarifying to.

979
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,640
It's like a war on Christmas, maybe.

980
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

981
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,840
That's the whole thing now is just taking like we found we found one.

982
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,520
If we like we found a needle in a haystack here, this sounds like a radical lift.

983
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,760
They're all mad about something stupid. Here you go.

984
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,320
Let's make this all we are talking about for four hours. Yeah.

985
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,360
Yeah. But it's a self-fulfilling prophecy because like, well,

986
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:35,040
this newspaper needs to have new content and this 24 hour TV

987
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,400
network needs things to go like absolutely apoplectic about.

988
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,480
And it's just they're just shaking hands.

989
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,080
It's just the two Spider-Man pointing at each other.

990
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,680
Did Gutfeld address this?

991
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,400
Oh, man. I don't know that we know.

992
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:57,600
I mean, yeah, I mean, all the good felt bits go viral.

993
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,320
And that's I just have a hard time keeping up with them because they.

994
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,480
Yeah, right. They are all the sewer,

995
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,400
you know, on the homepage all the time.

996
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,520
Sure. Yeah. So, you know, we'll go back and have have a good laugh.

997
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,520
You know, who else will have a good laugh is him who laughs at his own jokes.

998
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,280
Well, no one else is going to do it.

999
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,520
Who else is going to laugh at the people in the room with him?

1000
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,200
These are like his employees, like the people who work there,

1001
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,720
like and they're probably told not just laugh a little to support.

1002
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,880
Yeah, it's like, you know, we do watch the old Tom Snyder show

1003
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,360
and he'd have like one producer chuckle at him here and there.

1004
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,120
And then that's it.

1005
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,080
But that's a show that's like barely intended to be comedic.

1006
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:43,600
That's true. Like the idea is that is to laugh and his own people won't do it.

1007
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,040
Tom Snyder was not the comedian of Gut, meaning Gutfeld is.

1008
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,240
That's for sure.

1009
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,600
And now cowardly to go for it.

1010
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,120
And now we've lost the children with Snyder.

1011
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,960
Tom Snyder talk.

1012
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,000
Yeah, I think that we have the good felt.

1013
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,080
Yeah, yeah. We've got about kids love Gutfeld.

1014
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,800
So anyways, yes, this brings us to a point which is,

1015
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,640
yeah, oh, my God, they redid the Snow White ride.

1016
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,480
There's some new rooms and some new effects.

1017
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,400
They refreshed it.

1018
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,200
Looked at that wait time for five minutes.

1019
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,440
I don't look. I'd rather kind of go on the e-tickets in California Adventure.

1020
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,440
Sorry. Sorry, podcast audience.

1021
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,360
I can watch a video. I did not do it.

1022
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,200
Jason did not do it. Mike, did you do it?

1023
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,880
It is awesome. Oh, good.

1024
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,200
It's so good.

1025
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,760
I'll go back around.

1026
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,240
It was just the clock was ticking.

1027
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,640
It was only like exactly.

1028
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,960
I don't see any chips.

1029
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,720
It was that pressure.

1030
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,840
I had we had no like I was like, oh, yeah, let's take a look at what they did.

1031
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,160
And we were like, wow, look what they did in here.

1032
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,040
They crammed so much good stuff in there.

1033
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,840
And they didn't like it still because so it used to be the it was not

1034
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,480
Snow White Scary Adventure, right?

1035
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,720
That was the whole time losing my mind.

1036
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,440
Yeah, Snow White Scary Adventure.

1037
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,120
And like they were going to like the word was, oh, they're going to take

1038
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,480
the scariness out of it.

1039
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,840
And people were like, well, it's kind of sounds like that sucks.

1040
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,760
Like it's fun to have a little scary.

1041
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,960
Left wants to take the scariness and it's no one.

1042
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,200
Hannity did 20 minutes on the scariness of the Snow White going away.

1043
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,800
But you put so we're so well, we'll see what it is.

1044
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,600
They just have like in the nooks and crannies of it.

1045
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,000
And maybe we'll do a full.

1046
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,600
There seems like there's enough to do like an episode,

1047
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:22,600
at least a second gate on it, like all these little effects, new smells.

1048
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,200
There's so that's what you don't get from videos.

1049
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,240
I didn't know that.

1050
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,880
Yeah, you're not going to get the smells.

1051
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,840
And I'll do like there's one less witch.

1052
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,080
There's two of the witch, like there's three.

1053
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,080
No, there's actually four.

1054
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,680
So I should say there's like two.

1055
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,200
Yeah, there's like two less witch figures.

1056
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,000
And they cram in a full like ending sequence.

1057
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,600
So you have a real like sense of it finishing like a story wrapping up

1058
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,520
because it used to be the dwarves were on the hill.

1059
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,840
The witch was, you know, had the pride bar for the big boulder.

1060
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,360
And then she falls to her death.

1061
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,680
And then you're outside again.

1062
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,080
And you're like, huh?

1063
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,200
Yeah. And then like there was a book there, I think.

1064
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,000
It tells you that it ended happily.

1065
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,080
Right. It did.

1066
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,440
And it's like it's confusing, like it's confusing in the way like Little Mermaid

1067
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,240
is confusing still where it's like Ursula's just gone in their hat.

1068
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:15,160
Now that that has the ending, but doesn't have what came between

1069
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,280
the opposite in the margins.

1070
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,520
Yeah, it's the opposite thing.

1071
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,840
Like you see a little Ursula in the sea and you go, well, like you squint,

1072
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,080
you go, oh, I guess she got killed.

1073
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,320
So she died.

1074
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:31,880
But this one, they give like they push the scene forward in the ride,

1075
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,880
that final scene forward.

1076
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,080
They do a different thing with it.

1077
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,480
And then there's the prince kiss moment.

1078
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,800
It happens.

1079
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,160
It's a full new like forest you're in.

1080
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,040
The thing illuminates and there's like a little magical moment.

1081
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,600
Then there's another scene with Snow White hanging out with the dwarves.

1082
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,040
And we got out and we were like, that was great.

1083
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,160
Oh, that's nice.

1084
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,360
Good. Like that like rockets that ride now to me up.

1085
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,880
And like that's in the conversation for maybe one of like the best dark

1086
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,480
ride in Fantasyland.

1087
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,640
Great. Wow. Wow.

1088
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,040
That's that's awesome to hear.

1089
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,920
I yeah, it's funny how I feel like

1090
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,680
you know, the imagineers would cop to that that was not ideal, that it doesn't

1091
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,080
like there wasn't enough room really to do a happy ending.

1092
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:20,440
We just didn't have the space to get one more scene in there to make it end up

1093
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,680
and nicely.

1094
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,640
And then I watched a side by side of what it is now after the redo and what it was

1095
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,720
before. I'm like, they didn't have the room.

1096
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:32,320
It's just like room after room of scary trees, weird,

1097
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:38,000
like spindly alligators slowly opening their mouths like they're looking back.

1098
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,320
I think you're going to cut a couple of cut some swamp.

1099
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,280
I think when Claude Coates was putting together, he was just like,

1100
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,680
kids hate these trees.

1101
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,600
I'm going to put as many scary trees as I can.

1102
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,840
But it's still like if I was a kid, I would still be scared in the couple

1103
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,680
scenes that still have the witch, like the witch still turns around from the mirror

1104
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,400
and stuff. And yeah, that's an iconic part.

1105
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,720
They didn't change. Yeah.

1106
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,600
And they were spoiler.

1107
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,960
She doesn't she doesn't come out on the boat anymore.

1108
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,840
That's been replaced by an image of the mirror and whatever.

1109
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:12,440
So I don't know. I love when Snow White, when there's Snow White,

1110
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,560
do you see her eating the apple? What is it?

1111
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,720
And then and then the entire image shatters into glass.

1112
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,400
That's what it is. Yes. Yes.

1113
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,840
That's so hard.

1114
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,720
That's like that's like from a 80s music video.

1115
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,640
It's like it's like it gets like abstract.

1116
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,480
It's very silly. And I like it.

1117
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,640
Yeah. That's where the boat was.

1118
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,720
That's what it used to be.

1119
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,440
Now I'm hyping it up.

1120
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,480
Many people will not feel like it was so good.

1121
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,320
But this Todd Barton's wrote an article to I feel like he felt similar

1122
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,840
to me, where it was like, whoa, hey, wow.

1123
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,280
And then about everybody putting so much thought into it.

1124
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,040
I was like, oh, yeah, it feels like they really.

1125
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,520
Oh, that's good.

1126
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:53,880
Because I saw detractors complaining that like, oh, they clearly just copied

1127
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:57,800
some of the stuff from the seven dwarfs mine train in Florida.

1128
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,080
But like, I don't know. Yeah. I'll give it a chance.

1129
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,080
I just the clock was there was only open till 7 p.m.

1130
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,120
the day I was there.

1131
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,320
And we were trying to like, you know, I just crisscrossed the park.

1132
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,400
I thought it was so important because we were at the park.

1133
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,720
I guess I had to do it. OK, well, I guess you can.

1134
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,000
I guess we just didn't feel the I guess.

1135
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,720
I guess you don't want to realistic pressure.

1136
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,240
Look, I spent half a Sunday

1137
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,560
refreshing that reservation website to try and get a day

1138
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:26,640
where I could start in Disneyland because we mostly wanted to do Disneyland.

1139
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,200
When you say spent half a Sunday, do you mean you were eating a Sunday while checking?

1140
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,480
I mean, I had some snacks in there to keep my blood sugar up for sure.

1141
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,920
It turned out to be useless because they keep just if you're looking for a reservation,

1142
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,000
just give it a day or so.

1143
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,640
They might just unleash a bunch because they're unleashing a bunch anyway.

1144
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,200
Yes. I mean, things are changing.

1145
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,760
We may have we may actually when we go to Avengers, we are.

1146
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,720
Spoiler, we're going together on a day.

1147
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,040
We may have a we may have a guest with us also.

1148
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,560
Somebody wants to go.

1149
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,240
So I but I have to check for this person

1150
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,720
because there's not reservations available.

1151
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,880
Oh, so you would have to one would have to open up.

1152
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,440
Yeah. And checking, I didn't get to do a lot of my checking,

1153
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,200
but I did get to there was one thing I got to check for Carthy

1154
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,640
for the Carthy walk up list.

1155
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,640
Oh, that was that involved a list.

1156
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,880
There's digital walk up lists at some restaurants.

1157
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,560
That's the other thing.

1158
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:23,400
Reservations are kind of hard to find for in-park food right now

1159
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:28,880
because restaurant occupancy is limited and some restaurants just aren't open yet.

1160
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,800
But stuff's reopening every week.

1161
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,800
It seems sit down.

1162
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,920
Stuff is not.

1163
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,840
So you really got to be on those mobile orders.

1164
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,560
One thing I'm seeing a lot of on Twitter is people like

1165
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:43,360
big wait for the mobile appeal are being so bitchy about that.

1166
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,320
Like I thought it was all maybe it's worse now.

1167
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,000
I thought every mobile experience I had was fine.

1168
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,520
Some of it took a sec.

1169
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,440
But like so it takes a sec.

1170
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,960
What do you do? Some of these.

1171
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,120
You're at Disneyland again.

1172
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,360
Yeah. Shut up. Flows.

1173
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,080
I wanted to mobile order.

1174
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,040
Flows was an hour after the time.

1175
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,440
Well, it would have taken an hour.

1176
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,240
And I was like, what is this?

1177
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,320
Oh, yeah.

1178
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:09,560
But if it tells you that, you know, like then you're you know what you're in.

1179
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,640
We waited in line. Oh, OK.

1180
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,600
Oh, OK. I see. Sure.

1181
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,400
Gotcha. It was fine, obviously.

1182
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,600
But it is funny.

1183
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,280
I did not post about it.

1184
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,320
Yeah. Yeah.

1185
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,280
I'm self aware.

1186
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,840
And you know, you know, the kinds of accounts that are posted,

1187
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,960
the the Disney daddy's esc accounts that are

1188
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,760
I turn into a Disney daddy a few times in the trip.

1189
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,160
And then I revert back and go, no, no, no.

1190
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,480
You're a reasonable man.

1191
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,880
You're having a good

1192
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,760
you know, it's kind of a Disney daddy moment for me.

1193
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,880
I did not get a lot of sleep the night before.

1194
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,480
I was kind of going off of not a lot of sleep a couple days.

1195
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,360
Yeah. To this, which just meant and and then racing.

1196
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:52,920
It was a lot of hassle and like getting the grandmas to take care of the baby.

1197
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,720
Everybody good. Just like so involved me having to like I had to backtrack

1198
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:59,800
on the freeway and give a key that I'd forgotten to like.

1199
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,720
It set me back 30 minutes and we went down to just so much weird stress.

1200
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,480
All this resulted in me.

1201
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,240
Oh, my God, we're on the haunted mansion for the first time in a long time.

1202
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,320
Also, we're sitting and it's dark in here and I slept through half of the

1203
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,440
haunted mansion. Wow.

1204
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,160
There is this. You are a dad now.

1205
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,840
Congratulations. Yeah.

1206
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,800
You know, are there cool ghosts? Yes.

1207
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,760
Is it dark? Even more? Yes.

1208
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,360
And I. Yeah.

1209
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,880
Similar in Florida.

1210
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:31,520
I took a nap on the Mexico boat ride one of the times that I went.

1211
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,440
And it was so sweet.

1212
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,640
It was such a good.

1213
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,120
Maybe a ride nap is a little secret.

1214
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,840
Maybe the baby ride naps are what you got to start.

1215
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,440
You were out Sheridan Sheridan Sheridan.

1216
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,320
I guess. Yeah.

1217
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,360
Wow. That's Jason's lane.

1218
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,040
You know, you become the teacher.

1219
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,760
I've definitely fallen asleep on rides before, for sure.

1220
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,840
Had you? Yeah.

1221
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,120
Yeah, I think so.

1222
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,960
Which ride do you think?

1223
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,400
I know something in Florida.

1224
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,240
You know, those like long, long Orlando days, especially when I was young,

1225
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,800
like as a kid, like, yeah, I would zonk.

1226
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,560
Maybe when I was a little kid, I would fall asleep.

1227
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,680
But I've said this before, I never I've never fallen asleep in school or anything

1228
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,440
ever. Like, I can't.

1229
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,680
I'm always on guard.

1230
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,280
Oh, no, I was just too.

1231
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,240
Yeah. Too neurotic in school. Yeah.

1232
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:19,760
Yeah. The games, the character games are now switch are switching here, you know,

1233
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:23,320
because like sometimes I like I like, you know, sweets or something.

1234
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,200
And that really steps on the game that Jason is the only one who likes sweets.

1235
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,800
And now Scott's saying he likes to sleep on rides and is sleepy.

1236
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,400
And that's Jason's territory.

1237
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:35,840
So we're stepping on your like well-defined podcast character games.

1238
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:38,560
Well, I you know, it makes me feel any better.

1239
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,280
When I was talking to my dad on the phone the other day, he did.

1240
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,800
I forget how he got to this point, but he did say the phrase like unprompted.

1241
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,920
Well, don't forget your grandfather was a candy man.

1242
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,000
And

1243
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:56,360
as my grandfather used to run the the like third shift, like night shift lines

1244
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:01,440
at the Whitman's Factory in Philadelphia and a candy man.

1245
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,360
Yeah. Hershey.

1246
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,800
I believe he said at some point Hershey tried to poach him.

1247
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,600
What? Yeah.

1248
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,760
And I shared a little that I've never heard.

1249
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,440
No, I forget.

1250
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,480
I forget it. But like every every other year or so, an aunt will like it's like

1251
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,600
everyone got Whitman samplers this year.

1252
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,600
Wow.

1253
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,560
I am a candy man.

1254
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,960
My father before me was a candy man.

1255
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,400
My father before him was a candy man.

1256
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,200
This is my son, Jay.

1257
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,760
This is my grandson, Jay.

1258
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,760
I'm sure.

1259
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,640
That's a good Halloween costume for you two.

1260
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,120
Oh, yeah.

1261
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,120
Yeah.

1262
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:43,240
And his son, Paul Dano.

1263
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,240
Yeah.

1264
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,000
And you just shave and slick.

1265
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1266
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,880
Yes. Get some dip ity do and slick the hair back.

1267
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:54,120
Wow. Explain to my girlfriend, hey, you know, I said I don't really like Halloween.

1268
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,280
I don't want to do a couple's costume.

1269
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,520
I have you with Mike.

1270
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,560
Thing is, I know.

1271
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,560
Yeah, I know you're not.

1272
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,560
I don't like it.

1273
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,560
Yeah.

1274
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,640
If you guys go to a party and you get lost and Mike, you could say, I remember I did

1275
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,640
my hair.

1276
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,640
I remember.

1277
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,640
I remember.

1278
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,640
I remember.

1279
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:12,640
I remember.

1280
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:20,440
Mike, you could say I'm a man and my boy, my candy child, my candy boy.

1281
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,320
Wow.

1282
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,320
That is crazy.

1283
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:29,600
I'm always blown away when there's a piece of Sheridan family history like that that

1284
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,040
I have not heard because I've heard a lot of it at this point.

1285
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,040
Yeah.

1286
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,040
Father was a candy man.

1287
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,640
What a candy man.

1288
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,640
That's so good.

1289
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,640
Geez.

1290
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,640
Yeah.

1291
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,640
Wow.

1292
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:40,640
I think other things.

1293
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:47,040
Well, you know, speaking of people have like shifting, you know, personas and tropes.

1294
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:52,360
Again, we just covered this a little bit on the universal episode on the Patreon, but

1295
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:58,160
there was the question of, am I going to reset and not be into thrills whatsoever or am I

1296
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,800
going to go back full tilt?

1297
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,160
And I'll tell you, there was a five minute wait, five minute wait for Splash Mountain,

1298
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,280
which did not last all day.

1299
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,280
You know what?

1300
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,280
Why not?

1301
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,280
Let's go back in.

1302
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,560
It was the first time that I did not close my eyes on the drop.

1303
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,560
Wow.

1304
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,560
I stared down.

1305
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:20,160
You just, you go up there and you're thinking, man, it's been, it's been 14 months.

1306
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,160
Enjoy it.

1307
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,160
Stare.

1308
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,240
And I boy watching those steam jets come at me.

1309
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,080
I mean, I still look terrified in the picture.

1310
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,120
You never saw it before with your own eyes on a lift drop hill.

1311
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:33,880
When we were at knots, did you keep your eyes open on the timber mountain?

1312
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:34,880
Yeah.

1313
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:35,880
Yeah.

1314
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:36,880
Yeah.

1315
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:37,880
No.

1316
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:38,880
Yeah.

1317
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:43,560
No, I'm keeping my eyes open on the children's rides now.

1318
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,000
No, but it is a big deal for me.

1319
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,040
And I, yeah, this was the first time.

1320
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,320
And I always think that I'm going to do it or I think that I did it.

1321
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,240
And then the photo proves that I did not.

1322
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,200
It's like the dinosaur thing with me where I thought I was staring at the dinosaur and

1323
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,480
apparently I was cowering in fear.

1324
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,480
Yeah.

1325
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,480
Yeah.

1326
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:04,760
So yeah, I still look super scared in the photo, but man, I enjoyed it.

1327
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:11,280
I just like locked eyes with the bottom, yelled happily was and like, I think I was really

1328
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,760
enjoying especially that you get that's the one where you get a log into yourself.

1329
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,760
How awesome.

1330
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,600
I think it added to the pressure with me that I don't want to be like, I'm like nervous

1331
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:24,120
and talking to Aaron like, I don't know, maybe I don't know if I can handle the drop and

1332
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:27,920
there's other people around and probably kids now to have the thing to yourself.

1333
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,600
You'd really do just feel the relaxing boat ride nature of it.

1334
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,000
I felt that on Jurassic World too.

1335
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,760
You're just people around and suddenly it's like you're taking a pontoon around that just

1336
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,240
happens to have a drop at the end.

1337
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,640
Because like if there was a kid on the log, you would have been like, this isn't going

1338
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,640
to be so bad.

1339
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:44,640
Don't worry about it.

1340
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,640
It's going to be fine.

1341
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:46,640
I'm going to be fine.

1342
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,640
You're going to be fine.

1343
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,640
No problem.

1344
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,640
We will be fine.

1345
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,720
So don't you're freaking me out, kid.

1346
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,480
Yeah, I man, so great.

1347
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:58,760
And I'm now like braver in credit coaster.

1348
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,480
I was now just part of Lexica.

1349
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,240
I just love them credit coaster now.

1350
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,480
I can't even remember not loving it.

1351
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,200
So that one's not even a big deal at this point.

1352
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,840
But boy, did I eat that one up and the guardians.

1353
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:15,640
I closed out the night with wow, which is only my second time.

1354
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,120
The bravest.

1355
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,120
I did it.

1356
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,120
I did it.

1357
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,960
Now again, is alcohol involved?

1358
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,120
This is the recurring thing it does.

1359
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,120
It's like flying.

1360
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,120
It just needs.

1361
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,880
I need it to get rid of the jitters.

1362
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:28,880
But boy, did I love you.

1363
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,040
And you know what?

1364
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:35,600
Now, after that second one, I think there was like the fear of the new the first time

1365
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,800
I did it.

1366
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,920
And then this one, there's just been so long.

1367
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:39,920
I was so ready for it.

1368
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,360
And now I like didn't freak me out at all.

1369
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,360
I think it is now just in the lineup.

1370
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:48,560
I think I will always do mission break at this point.

1371
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,560
So I'm so happy.

1372
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,560
Hey, that's great.

1373
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:54,360
Yeah, it's it's so that was like I asked Lindsay, what's the one thing we have to do?

1374
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,080
She goes like guardians.

1375
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:59,400
I saw somebody post that the ride was bad or unpopular.

1376
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,400
I think it's bullshit.

1377
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,400
The guardians so good.

1378
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,160
I just a tweet saying that like the outside was ugly or something like that.

1379
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,160
Yeah, I don't.

1380
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,160
Everyone came around to it.

1381
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,160
Yeah.

1382
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,160
Anyway, I don't.

1383
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:15,240
Regardless of whether you like the movies or not, the ride itself is fun and good.

1384
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,240
Yeah.

1385
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,240
Yeah.

1386
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,240
I don't know what.

1387
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,240
And again, so weird.

1388
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,240
Like we're going to take this.

1389
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:28,040
We're just going to jam some IP in there instead of the original story of the Twilight Zone.

1390
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,560
Like what was I?

1391
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,280
The logic just isn't there.

1392
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,800
And yeah, the thing is super fun.

1393
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,600
I yeah, I don't know.

1394
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,600
I just dig it.

1395
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:42,300
And like, well, we were saying on the second gate how I was like sprinting to Silver Bullet.

1396
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,300
Now I did at knots.

1397
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:46,200
I have a more advanced coaster than I've done.

1398
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,960
Now I'm just sort of a junkie.

1399
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,440
And maybe it's an end of the night thing.

1400
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,200
Like I only got a little bit of time.

1401
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,200
Yeah, maybe I do.

1402
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,720
Like the longer I wait, the more I think about it, I'll back off.

1403
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,360
So I just got to like run to that thing.

1404
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,360
Yeah.

1405
01:03:58,360 --> 01:03:59,360
Or I'll change my mind.

1406
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:03,520
And it's that is, as I was saying, a hell of a ride to end the day and then to just

1407
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:07,760
walk to your hotel room on a path with essentially no one.

1408
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:08,760
Oh my God.

1409
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:09,760
Yeah.

1410
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,520
Such a relaxing, great end of the day.

1411
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:17,220
See, we really did switch because I went over to California Adventure and we got a beer

1412
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:26,020
and a margarita and sat in like the Canary Row, Fisherman's Worth area, enjoyed the sunset

1413
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:28,060
and was like, OK, let's go back to Disneyland.

1414
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:31,700
And then we walked back over to the other park because we like, all right, we have one

1415
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:33,180
hour left.

1416
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:34,820
What's the thing to do?

1417
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:36,780
And we both agreed on Haunted Mansion.

1418
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:37,780
OK.

1419
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:42,580
And that was the right call because we were in line for Haunted Mansion.

1420
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:45,120
And it was like a magical ending to the day.

1421
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,440
We started talking to the person behind us.

1422
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,520
She had a Haunted Mansion dress on.

1423
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,660
It was her birthday.

1424
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,240
She had the button.

1425
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:56,480
And we were talking about like, oh, I saw some people there are letting some people

1426
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,560
in through the like mausoleum, like the door there.

1427
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:00,560
She's like, oh, yeah, have you done it?

1428
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,760
I was like, no, I've never been over there.

1429
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:06,680
I got a picture there, but I've never gone through that back entrance.

1430
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,220
She's like, I've done it.

1431
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:09,220
It's really cool.

1432
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:12,560
And she and we get to the front of the house.

1433
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:17,880
We get to the front door and they stop us and they went, are you guys OK with stairs?

1434
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:18,880
We're like, yeah.

1435
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,880
And they're like, all right, come on.

1436
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,660
And they took us in the back door of the Haunted Mansion.

1437
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:28,560
If you don't do this thing where they intercepted you and said, do you want to do it?

1438
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:31,360
How do you get this see this other end?

1439
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,360
That's a good question.

1440
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,120
You just have to you just ask someone somewhere.

1441
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:39,840
I think what's happening is they're just trying to keep occupancy down in the elevators, but

1442
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:43,600
they can get lots of people downstairs onto the ride.

1443
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:48,360
So they were running the stretching room, but then they're also taking people in the

1444
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,360
back.

1445
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:54,060
So there's a door, if you see like by the graveyard mausoleum crypt area, whatever you

1446
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:56,720
want to call it.

1447
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,960
They took us in that door.

1448
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:03,360
First off, everyone was clearly like, OK, yeah, let's we want to go home.

1449
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,360
Let's get these people in.

1450
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:10,720
It was one of the steepest set of stairs I've ever seen in my life.

1451
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:16,200
There are miniature versions of the stretching portrait just kind of hung along the walls.

1452
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:21,240
And then you can see the lightning effects from the other side of the wall.

1453
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:27,320
And then they open a door and you're in the middle of the portrait gallery walkway like

1454
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,880
Q. Whoa.

1455
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:32,000
And that was why I was like, oh, that's OK.

1456
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:36,440
Because there's still stuff where I'm like, oh, that connects to that.

1457
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:41,160
And then and then and then we got to see like they added those new like dressing room kind

1458
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,120
of screens in the queue line.

1459
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,800
And there's they added one more portrait back.

1460
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:49,520
I think that had been in storage and it was great.

1461
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,520
It was running great.

1462
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:54,280
And pretty much everything I went on, I think, was running great that day.

1463
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,200
Yeah, we got to do that same walk.

1464
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,760
We got asked the same question, the mysterious question.

1465
01:06:58,760 --> 01:06:59,760
Like, are you OK with stairs?

1466
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:00,760
Really cool.

1467
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:05,560
I will say that the thing, the issue that was I was dealing with, I was dealing with

1468
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:09,960
it during this Haunted Mansion trip, this ride.

1469
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:15,360
So my memory is a bit impaired because of what I was dealing with.

1470
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,520
Well, do we need to?

1471
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:18,920
So I think we have to say, yeah, OK.

1472
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:24,000
So just a little bit of context before this, just maybe I don't even need to say it, but

1473
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I was checking.

1474
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,800
I got reservations to Carthay.

1475
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:27,800
We were in Carthay.

1476
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,800
We had some food.

1477
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:33,840
This is just just for just because it's funny.

1478
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:37,000
And this is the first time we've actually dined inside since being vaccinated.

1479
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
That was the first.

1480
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Yeah.

1481
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,160
Not to step on yours, but yeah, I didn't realize we would get indoors.

1482
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,160
That's why we didn't want to.

1483
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,160
No, we didn't want it.

1484
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:51,880
We wanted to be outside, but they like seated us there and we're like, I guess we're vaccinated.

1485
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:55,000
That's yeah, that's a hell of a first place to do it.

1486
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1487
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Yeah.

1488
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
So let it happen.

1489
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Oh, my God.

1490
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,520
Like that was where I first texted you guys.

1491
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,200
Like, here's the thing to show.

1492
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,200
Having the Manhattan inside.

1493
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:05,800
Yes.

1494
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:06,600
Holy shit.

1495
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,640
And that's so great.

1496
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:08,600
Lindsay had her didn't.

1497
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,560
Jill Jill had the dog distracted me, I swear.

1498
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:12,920
A dill gin and tonic.

1499
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:16,600
And I had my Carthay Manhattan like two older folks.

1500
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,880
Your mother likes the dill gin and tonic.

1501
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,440
We like California Adventure.

1502
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,680
It's a slower park.

1503
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,000
More to our speed.

1504
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,720
You know your mother.

1505
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,360
She likes the dill gin and tonic.

1506
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,360
Yeah, made it well to do.

1507
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,080
Mm hmm.

1508
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,080
Yes.

1509
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,200
So we got that.

1510
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,400
We had we had some meatballs as well.

1511
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,600
All the prices are three dollars more expensive.

1512
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,960
Yeah, if I can.

1513
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,880
I feel like I feel like Mr.

1514
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,000
Chaypex snuck the price up on us.

1515
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,680
Why does it tomorrow get the blame?

1516
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,400
That's what I'm saying.

1517
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,040
He's handsome.

1518
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,160
Maybe he's the one pulling the trigger on all the prices.

1519
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:52,960
You might be right.

1520
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:53,680
You might be right.

1521
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:54,280
Yeah.

1522
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:56,520
As a wolf and sheep's clothing.

1523
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:57,760
But he's just so sexy.

1524
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:00,000
I can't imagine he would.

1525
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,640
This is an anti-bald bias with shaping.

1526
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,280
That's what's happening.

1527
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,280
You might be right.

1528
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:09,160
So when we were trying to get the reservations, you can put in like,

1529
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,880
oh, is it a special occasion or something?

1530
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,160
And like we're a couple of days away from Lindsay's birthday.

1531
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,320
She was trying to she was trying to get reservations, too.

1532
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:18,440
I was trying to get reservations and I was trying to go as fast as possible.

1533
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:22,120
I wasn't even putting any of that in just to, you know, expedite the thing.

1534
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:23,360
Finally, I did it.

1535
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,960
It took me 20 minutes of checking.

1536
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:29,400
Lindsay was luckily she wanted me to stop checking, but then she said,

1537
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,560
oh, I want a coffee, so I'll go wait in line.

1538
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,960
You can keep checking out on the bench in the 85 degree heat.

1539
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,560
And I did that.

1540
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:40,360
And she so I got that and she kept saying she's been yelling at me

1541
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:43,000
because I haven't been wearing enough sunscreen.

1542
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,560
This is another thing where I'm like,

1543
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,760
yeah, I should.

1544
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,120
I got burned playing tennis.

1545
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,440
We all know I'm playing tennis again.

1546
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:50,480
That's a whole thing.

1547
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,920
That's a big deal in my life.

1548
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,800
You like already were like your knees were hurting and you burnt.

1549
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,720
You got sunburn.

1550
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:58,960
Yeah, I got sunburn playing tennis.

1551
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,160
But I'm just like, how many times?

1552
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:03,120
Four, three or four at this point.

1553
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,080
Playing again tomorrow.

1554
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,520
Maladies already.

1555
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,760
Yeah.

1556
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,240
So she and Lindsay is big sunscreen person.

1557
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,400
She's got the different types.

1558
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,440
She's got the face one.

1559
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,240
She's got the whatever.

1560
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:15,640
So like before before during when I was checking, she's like, you got to put

1561
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:18,360
we got to reapply, you know, every four hours or whatever.

1562
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,360
So, OK, put the body one on.

1563
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:21,280
I put the face one on.

1564
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,600
She's got one now where it's like

1565
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,000
almost like a deodorant stick.

1566
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,840
It's for like your eyes because your eyes are different, like thinner skin and you

1567
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,080
whatever you put it on there.

1568
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,400
So she's she is made sure I'm not going to get burned.

1569
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:36,080
I'm in the sun now checking because that's like that's the spot on the bench.

1570
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,160
Do it. I'm checking, checking, checking.

1571
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,240
Finally get it. OK, great.

1572
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:39,320
We go over there.

1573
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,600
We get seated.

1574
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,680
We're eating and drinking and having a nice time.

1575
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,640
And then Lindsay, I think, you know, she had a little bit of a drink.

1576
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,480
Not that she's drunk or anything, but she's, you know, she's feeling a little bold.

1577
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,200
She goes, hey, you know, would it be?

1578
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,320
It's like birthday.

1579
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,440
Like, is there anything for?

1580
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,000
She also like throws in like, you know, it was our anniversary,

1581
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
but that's like two months ago, but she's like, it's our anniversary.

1582
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,120
There was some of that.

1583
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:04,920
If you're celebrating, if you're celebrating, you didn't have a chance to celebrate.

1584
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,640
They're not checking ID.

1585
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,360
So she goes like, is that she's like, basically, does that do anything?

1586
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:14,320
And I was like, I'm, of course, always very nervous any time, anything like that.

1587
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,480
Even she's like, oh, shut up to me.

1588
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,800
Oh, I'm the king of. She doesn't do anything.

1589
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,200
She's like, oh, come on.

1590
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,960
Or whatever. And she goes, did that do anything?

1591
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:24,680
And the woman is very nice who was waiting on us.

1592
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:28,120
And she's like, oh, maybe after June 15th, it does.

1593
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,720
He's like, oh, I'm sorry. Whatever.

1594
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:34,680
That's good. It felt like two minutes later,

1595
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:39,800
they brought a giant chocolate milk, like milkshake Sunday

1596
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,720
with a brownie sticking out of the top on the table.

1597
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:46,840
So we're like, we're like, whoa, what?

1598
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,280
Thank you so much.

1599
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,800
And the thing with that happened is Lindsey is to ask that to

1600
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,840
there were two women who were waiting on us.

1601
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:58,160
And she asked it to the one who didn't know that she had a nut allergy.

1602
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:02,960
Oh, oh. So I was at the Disney Doctor, though.

1603
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,760
You think we think Lindsey's going to go in for another nut allergy.

1604
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,560
Not the case. Oh, so.

1605
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:09,920
OK, they put the thing there.

1606
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:10,760
They put the thing there.

1607
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:14,760
We ask about the nuts and they say, yes, there are walnuts in there.

1608
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,800
Lindsey is allergic to tree nuts.

1609
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:20,720
And then just because this is just like so it's such a nice thing

1610
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,080
for them to have done.

1611
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,520
Lindsey goes, oh, it's OK. I'll scrape them off,

1612
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,680
which is not how this works, by the way, if you have a tree nut allergy.

1613
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,960
Yeah. It's so sensitive.

1614
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:35,520
Like one time I had walnuts like at noon and like we kissed at eight o'clock.

1615
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,200
And she was like, did you have walnuts earlier?

1616
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:42,200
You I stopped for coffee on the we were going down to the park once

1617
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:45,720
and I got like a pecan twist.

1618
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:49,320
I remember I was at Panera and I was like, oh, give me an extra one.

1619
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,400
Because I got it from Mike.

1620
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,200
Forgetting about the tree nut conundrum.

1621
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:58,440
And I was like, I got you a pastry and you were like, it's.

1622
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:03,560
Yeah. And so then you were like, well, now you have to eat a second pecan twist.

1623
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:06,880
And I was like, oh, darn. Oh, darn.

1624
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,160
Sure. We.

1625
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,560
So what's going to happen now?

1626
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,800
We there was no way we were going to send this back.

1627
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:20,040
Ask for another one after it's this complimentary thing they just did on a whim

1628
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,400
because they felt like, oh, we want to, you know, do whatever.

1629
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,880
So I'm going to have to eat it.

1630
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,160
I'm going to have to eat those whole thing.

1631
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:29,280
And it is massive. We have there's a picture of it. It is massive.

1632
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,240
We I once again back up to the city walks.

1633
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:37,320
Yes, I say you do not have to eat the whole I making you eat the whole thing.

1634
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,680
But they were so nice to bring it out.

1635
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,160
We have to make a very sizable dent in it.

1636
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:45,720
There's no way we are wasting more like half or more, half or more.

1637
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,080
That's fine. Yes. OK.

1638
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:51,320
It's not. And again, it's not a I mean, it's not as crazy as like that monster,

1639
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:55,120
mini monster or whatever, or as crazy as the Liberty Tree meal.

1640
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,920
But I said it to Lindsay while it was happening.

1641
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:01,720
I go, I am eating a big thing now and I have to finish a certain amount of it

1642
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,640
because I wasn't planning on doing that.

1643
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:08,320
I was planning on getting my my patented to scoop ice cream cone in the end.

1644
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,400
That's my treat from Disney.

1645
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,640
So I was like, I don't want like ton of ice cream earlier.

1646
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,840
My yummy treats are coming too early and free.

1647
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:20,000
A free yummy treat that's not the same flavor of the yummy treat I wanted later.

1648
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,800
You know, if you know, it's sometimes change is good.

1649
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,680
You know, I'm delicious. Yeah. Delicious.

1650
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:29,960
Yeah. So if a wild card treat appears, you know, a wild Pokemon appears,

1651
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:31,160
you know, you got to go with it.

1652
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,560
Hey, I completely agree.

1653
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,160
So so I'm eating this.

1654
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:36,160
Lindsay goes, how do you think I could just have like a little maybe

1655
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,440
of like the milkshake part?

1656
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,280
And she like tries to go, I go, do not.

1657
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,800
What are you thinking? Don't do it.

1658
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:41,800
I go, do you have your EpiPens?

1659
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,520
She goes, yeah, I go, no, we don't want to.

1660
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,000
I go, we don't want to go to the Disney doctor.

1661
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,680
We do not. I said this to her.

1662
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,120
I do not want to go to the Disney doctor.

1663
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,200
And she goes, yeah, OK, you're right.

1664
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,040
And I take a big like I take the spoon.

1665
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:56,920
I went in and I go, there's tons of walnuts in the liquid.

1666
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,960
It's not just on the top or on the brownie.

1667
01:14:58,960 --> 01:14:59,840
I go, it's very good.

1668
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,360
You didn't take a sip of that.

1669
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:02,560
She goes, yeah, yeah, you're right.

1670
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,960
So I do. I eat a lot of it.

1671
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,680
It's great. It was great, obviously.

1672
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:08,600
It's obviously not a burden to do it.

1673
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,160
It's just funny that that happened like that.

1674
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,840
So I eat that. I had a beer.

1675
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,440
I had just ordered a beer, too.

1676
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:15,920
So we were drinking that.

1677
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,280
So we leave there. I'm feeling good.

1678
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,760
I didn't get a ton of sleep.

1679
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:23,480
I'm feeling a little like lightheaded and I also didn't get good sleep either.

1680
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:26,920
I went anywhere for a year.

1681
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:30,640
Yeah. And I'm such a self-sabotager when I'm trying to get to bed

1682
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,320
and wake up extra early.

1683
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,360
My brain just sabotages me.

1684
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,040
Bedtime procrastination.

1685
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,840
There's articles about it now.

1686
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,400
Left and right.

1687
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,000
Yeah. Your brain screwing.

1688
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:41,960
It's so weird.

1689
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:43,920
It was happening just a couple of days.

1690
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,080
Yes. It's so weird.

1691
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,480
Why? Why? Why?

1692
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,800
Our brains hate us like that.

1693
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,120
I have a feeling I know where this is going.

1694
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:54,040
But I am a nerve that you both absorb some of my qualities

1695
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,000
during the quarantine time.

1696
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,760
And we're recording in person again.

1697
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,360
It's no, I think we got it recently.

1698
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,440
Oh, OK. Oh, like through droplets and aerosols.

1699
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,320
We caught it.

1700
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,720
That's it. Back to Zoom.

1701
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,840
OK, so I'm interested to see.

1702
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:13,280
Tell me if I wonder if you do know where this is going.

1703
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,680
So we get out of a car, we hit the 80 whatever degree heat.

1704
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:20,080
And I'm feeling like good, but I'm feeling a little out of it.

1705
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:24,320
I'm feeling a little, you know, you have one drink and a beer and I'm full of sugar.

1706
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,200
And yeah, so I'm just like, I'm feeling fine,

1707
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,800
but I'm feeling a little woozy or whatever, but not so terribly.

1708
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,280
And we're walking and we're walking.

1709
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:37,160
And all of a sudden I go, oh, no.

1710
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,240
I think I think there's sunscreen in my eye.

1711
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,680
I know. And I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, huh?

1712
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,280
And this we've all had this.

1713
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,960
You get soap in your eye, you get sunscreen.

1714
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,400
I want some while you close your eye, you know, it tears up

1715
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,920
and you wipe it on your sleeve and you get it gets out.

1716
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,920
This that didn't happen that easily for me.

1717
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,240
We're getting into Disney and we're walking down Main Street.

1718
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,560
And I'm like, I can't see.

1719
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:06,360
I like I this won't stop tearing.

1720
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,800
It's bright red.

1721
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,800
Did I scratch my cornea?

1722
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,160
What is going on?

1723
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,160
So we're walking through Adventureland.

1724
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:16,720
I'm going, this is really bad.

1725
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:19,760
And I'm not this doesn't happen to me a lot where I like

1726
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:25,080
like I don't like I'm not like over complaining about like an ailment

1727
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:28,000
usually, unless it's for comedic effect on a podcast, but not this instance.

1728
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:29,880
I can't see very well.

1729
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,120
I'm my eyes tearing. I'm closing it.

1730
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:33,120
We're walking around.

1731
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:36,280
I go, let's just walk over by like the Poo Give Shop.

1732
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:37,000
Or something for a while.

1733
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,440
Let me see if I can get this worked out of my eye or whatever.

1734
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:40,880
And we're walking by the Poo Give Shop.

1735
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,320
It's closed. I go, all right, let's go on Poo.

1736
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,280
I don't care. I don't care about that.

1737
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,480
You're still getting on ride.

1738
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:48,680
So we got on the ride and I'm like, I'm like, oh, now I'm seeing heffalumps

1739
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,880
and woozles and like out of one eye.

1740
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:53,080
Oh, no, you're tripping out.

1741
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:55,320
And I'm like, OK, there's not as much light in here.

1742
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,600
So that's good. OK, good.

1743
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,560
So like and so then I'm like, OK, maybe I'm feeling better.

1744
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:00,280
I think I'm feeling better.

1745
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:01,920
We get out. The light hits my eye.

1746
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,080
It stings. It is stinging so bad.

1747
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:06,880
And I'm like, all right, I got to go to Hungry Bear.

1748
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,160
I go into Hungry Bear.

1749
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:13,000
I start getting a handful of water and dumping them in my left eye.

1750
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Yeah. And that's you don't want to do that.

1751
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,080
Well, that's what Lindsay was saying.

1752
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,000
And she was like she was trying to give me she goes,

1753
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,000
oh, take like a paper towel and dab your like eyelashes a little bit

1754
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,880
like you're removing like mascara.

1755
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,200
And I go, oh, and I'm trying to do it.

1756
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,640
She's like, no, that's not how you remove mascara.

1757
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:30,960
And I go, I've only worn mascara like for a play or something.

1758
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,640
I don't know. Maybe it was just eyeliner.

1759
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:33,880
I don't think it was mascara.

1760
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,280
So I'm trying to do it.

1761
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,640
Trying to get it off. It's not working.

1762
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,440
I go, I got to like flush my eye out.

1763
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,440
I'm in a hungry bear.

1764
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:42,280
I'm waiting till people leave so they don't see this.

1765
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:46,080
I am taking handfuls of water and splashing them on my face.

1766
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,920
My mask is soaked.

1767
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:51,640
My mask is like I just dipped my mouth in splash.

1768
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,800
Do you want an eyelid wipe for next time?

1769
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:58,920
Because I started carrying the this is the thing my eye doctor showed me last year.

1770
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,560
Really? An eyelid wipe?

1771
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,120
Well, you close your eyes and you.

1772
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:03,880
You just pulled one out.

1773
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:04,760
Yeah, I pulled one out.

1774
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:07,320
So for the listener, you have this in your bag.

1775
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:10,080
I went through all the samples and I finally splurged for a box.

1776
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,880
You wipe your eyes.

1777
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,640
The dirt builds up under your eyelid.

1778
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,880
And so you wipe your closed eyes and then you rinse it off.

1779
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,680
Or they have non rinse ones now.

1780
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:26,880
OK, so yeah, so that is close to maybe what I did.

1781
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,200
So we get out hungry bear and I think it's bad.

1782
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,440
I think it was Gomer's Gentlemen's Lair, of course,

1783
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:34,440
is the name of the hungry bear bathroom, the gentleman's bathroom there.

1784
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:36,640
And this, by the way, you're avoiding people.

1785
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:40,760
And this is the very spot where you refuse to take off your socks

1786
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:42,080
before getting on splash man.

1787
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,760
And that's why you'd rather do it in the log.

1788
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,040
So public embarrassment in this spot is a true nightmare.

1789
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,240
Well, yeah. And this is the last like these are the last remnants

1790
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:51,600
of the country bears in Disneyland.

1791
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,480
I mean, Gomer's bathroom, Gomer from the country bears.

1792
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,400
You're going to be embarrassed in front of people walking by.

1793
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,880
You're going to be embarrassed in front of Gomer.

1794
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,080
Yes, I don't want to look like a fool in front of Gomer.

1795
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:05,680
But I did. I mean, I was handfuls of water dumping on my eye, trying to like

1796
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:10,560
I was like waterboarding myself with water in the bathroom when people were gone.

1797
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,280
And I'd have to wait.

1798
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,320
So I'd like kind of like linger in a strange way.

1799
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:16,360
And then when they were out of the bathroom, I would do this.

1800
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:18,800
And I thought, OK, like maybe it's getting a little better.

1801
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,080
So I'd go outside.

1802
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:23,520
And then like we were walking towards Hauna Mansion and I go, OK,

1803
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:24,720
and then it would get worse again.

1804
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,480
It would just be just as bad.

1805
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:29,080
And I go and Lindsay's like, do you want to go to the doctor?

1806
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:32,960
And I swear, like, of course, in my head, I go, it's going to be funny

1807
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,080
if I go to the Disney doctor, because I'll talk about it.

1808
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:37,680
But I was trying to be very authentic.

1809
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,040
I was trying to be honest.

1810
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,160
And I was like, no, I think it'll go away.

1811
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,360
It's going to go away.

1812
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:45,520
I don't want to force a doctor visit for this silly thing that's happening.

1813
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,280
So we go on Hauna Mansion.

1814
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,360
It's low light.

1815
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,280
I'm feeling a little better on Hauna Mansion.

1816
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,440
I'm closing my eye.

1817
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,440
I get out. It's just as bad.

1818
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,480
It is burning.

1819
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:59,040
At this point, it's been 30 minutes or whatever of like burning my left eye.

1820
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,880
So she goes, go to the Disney doctor.

1821
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:03,840
And I go, yeah, OK.

1822
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:07,480
She goes, I'll wait in line for pirates and you go to go go to the doctor.

1823
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,640
So I go, all right.

1824
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:09,960
So I walk all the way over.

1825
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,560
Where is it? Where's the Disney doctor?

1826
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:12,800
It's right by the photo.

1827
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,160
It's off of Main Street.

1828
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,960
It's right by Plaza Inn, right?

1829
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:17,960
It's it's by the there's a baby.

1830
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:21,840
There's a weird little corner that kind of just ends up going backstage.

1831
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:22,800
I don't really know what's over there.

1832
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,400
So the Disney. Yeah, I had never been to a Disney.

1833
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,400
I was there once.

1834
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:31,360
And I think it was because like I had a cut or like I had a bandage

1835
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:35,200
that fell off and I needed a new one and they were able to give me a new one.

1836
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:39,360
And I think we'll give you a you can buy Advil or Tylenol at most gift shops.

1837
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,200
But I think they'll just give it to you there.

1838
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:45,000
Like, I'm not sure you need to sign, right? Sign in.

1839
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,880
So I again, I never been there.

1840
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:50,960
Lindsay had to go there because she's like hurt her toe really badly in Florida.

1841
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,960
But that was the Florida Disney doctor.

1842
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,320
So I go in here.

1843
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,040
There's no one inside.

1844
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:59,320
There was a very nice calm man

1845
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:03,360
who always felt like he was like I was pausing for him to finish his thought.

1846
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:07,040
But he had finished his thought, if that makes sense, like rhythm wise.

1847
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,160
Or he'd be like, all right, what's going on?

1848
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,440
What's the problem here?

1849
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:14,560
And I go, well, I have like a suntan because you have an eye wash station

1850
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,160
or something like a sun. I have lotion in my eye.

1851
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,080
It won't come out. I don't think I've scratched it, but it's possible.

1852
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,280
I'm in such pain.

1853
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:22,600
I'm in such discomfort.

1854
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:25,920
And he's like, OK, well, what's your name?

1855
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:27,040
And I go, OK.

1856
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:31,880
And I he took like there's a form and the form looked like it was full of names.

1857
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:35,360
And I look and there were people outside and I go, oh, I'm going to have to wait.

1858
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,280
Like, is it going to be a big wait?

1859
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:40,040
Like it's like the ER or not the ER.

1860
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:44,080
Yeah. Well, I guess the ticking clock of the day, you're saying like

1861
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,280
it's not annual pass on a whenever I'm right back.

1862
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,600
And I'm going to lose some of it to sit in a big line of the Disney doctor.

1863
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,760
Yes. So so he goes.

1864
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:54,760
All right. Well.

1865
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,600
Follow me back.

1866
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,480
And I go, all right, because I was like, he was like, all right.

1867
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,800
And I was like, he's going to say, like, go outside and I'll call your name.

1868
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,880
I was like, follow me back and go. All right.

1869
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,840
So I'm walking through and I can't see.

1870
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:07,480
But I'm also because I'm a theme park journalist trying to go like look in the.

1871
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,960
OK, how can I report on what else is here?

1872
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:14,240
Lap coat Mickey Lapcoat, probably a lap coat Mickey painting.

1873
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,400
Nothing. No, no.

1874
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,600
Like, yeah, goofy.

1875
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,160
It's not the most themed.

1876
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,160
It's pretty white.

1877
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:22,480
Yeah, it's pretty stethoscope or something.

1878
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:22,880
Yeah.

1879
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:23,880
Shoking themselves.

1880
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:27,880
And we're like, goofy, misdiagnosing someone.

1881
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:31,760
Ship making a makeshift splints for Dale.

1882
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:32,600
Yeah.

1883
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:38,880
Yeah, goofy filled out the wrong pill prescription for some old lady.

1884
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,360
His eyes are exploding out of his head.

1885
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:44,000
Or should I kill her?

1886
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,200
Overdia.

1887
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:46,960
So I'm looking through.

1888
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,320
I saw a bigger room that looked almost like

1889
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,640
like after some sort of disaster, like there were a lot of

1890
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:55,400
cots or a lot of like it was a bigger room.

1891
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,120
Wow. I mean, really didn't look quite.

1892
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,640
Oh, yeah. He stroke. People need to lie down.

1893
01:23:58,640 --> 01:23:59,680
I think it was like for that.

1894
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:03,080
I think it was like if Dad has had too much heat for the day,

1895
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:05,160
maybe he had a couple too many drinks.

1896
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:06,920
He gets to lie down in there.

1897
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:10,120
But then he took me into a very small room that was very similar to like a doctor's

1898
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:13,920
office room. They had the eyewash there and he goes, all right, let me.

1899
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:19,600
And this is my I'm probably remembering half of it because I was still like so disoriented.

1900
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
He goes, we have the eyewash station here.

1901
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:23,880
But I don't know.

1902
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:25,040
He really doesn't work.

1903
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,640
So he goes, here's what you're going to do.

1904
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,000
Here's what I think you should do.

1905
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,720
And he has he goes he takes a towel and he goes, take the towel.

1906
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:36,040
Turn the water and wet the towel.

1907
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:39,760
You know, pull down your eye like this, like pull down the bottom of your eye.

1908
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:43,400
Generally, you know how you get suntan lotion and you, you know,

1909
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:45,480
you go in the pool and it still stays on.

1910
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,520
That's probably what's happening to you right now.

1911
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:50,800
He goes, plop pools in the bottom of the eye, pull the eye down,

1912
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:56,160
take the washcloth and just, you know, go along the eye like, like,

1913
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,560
like scrub the bottom of your eye.

1914
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,280
And he goes and do that back and forth.

1915
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:02,320
And I go, OK, all right.

1916
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:05,320
So I take it and I do it like I do it like twice.

1917
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:06,600
And I'm doing it badly, too.

1918
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:07,640
And I go, is it like that?

1919
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:08,640
And one is like approval.

1920
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:11,880
And he goes, well, I guess I mean, if it feels better,

1921
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,560
like I can't tell you what to do.

1922
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:16,000
And I go, oh, yeah. And he goes, we do as many times as you want.

1923
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,440
And I go, oh, OK.

1924
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,800
So I'm like trying to like go back and forth a little bit.

1925
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:22,600
And he he goes, all right, does it feel better?

1926
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:25,120
And I go, I think so.

1927
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,400
So he goes, all right, well, come back if it does.

1928
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:30,360
And I go, thank you so much.

1929
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,600
So I walk out and it still like hurts.

1930
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:35,200
But it did work. It worked.

1931
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:37,160
He was absolutely right.

1932
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,840
It had pulled in there.

1933
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:41,320
No water. It wasn't even it was just stuck.

1934
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:45,440
It was just stuck on the bottom of my eyelid and re irritating it over and over again.

1935
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:46,680
Yeah, it's the part I like.

1936
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,320
Your lids are lubricating your eye.

1937
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:53,000
And if there's dirt or some other substance, it's not, you know, doing it correctly.

1938
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,760
Yeah. And I ran over.

1939
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:57,360
Lindsay had just gotten in the front of the line of pirates.

1940
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:00,480
And I just like immediate like jumped over in the line with her.

1941
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,400
Oh, you still got on the wow.

1942
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,320
I still got on pirates with her. Oh, yeah.

1943
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,120
I don't remember the time right after that.

1944
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:10,600
I was still like in some discomfort.

1945
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:13,120
So I don't really remember even walking back.

1946
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:16,160
It was all a little, you know, trauma blurs your memory.

1947
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:19,360
Yeah, yeah. I remember getting back in line and then going, OK.

1948
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:23,360
And then like 30 minutes later, I could feel it was not perfect,

1949
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,840
but it was fine. And now I'm fine. Oh, good.

1950
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:30,400
So I was like, wow, what a what a situation it really I mean,

1951
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:34,000
obviously in the scheme of things, that's not a serious problem.

1952
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:38,160
But if you ever had some stuck in your eye, you can feel kind of panicked about it.

1953
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,360
Yeah, yeah. That's that's ruining the day.

1954
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:44,280
Yeah. Mixed with the full tummy and.

1955
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:46,480
Yes, yeah.

1956
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:51,960
A bunch of like the the chill of Carthay, followed by the panic of eye pain.

1957
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,800
Yeah, yeah. God.

1958
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,360
Geez. Yeah. Boy.

1959
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:01,440
When we say you survived this episode, you were going to mean it. Yeah.

1960
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:04,480
It was a harrowing. Yeah. Yeah. That's insane.

1961
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,160
Oh, my God. Yeah.

1962
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:08,920
Well, let's we should start winding it down. Sure.

1963
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:12,840
Let's just like let's let's, you know, call out some stuff. Yeah.

1964
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,360
I had some other.

1965
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:15,960
I mean, I did my Mark Twain.

1966
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:18,880
I did a maiden voyage on Mark Twain.

1967
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,720
I didn't do the train.

1968
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:23,560
Here's what it was explained to me at the Main Street station.

1969
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:28,160
I could board the train at Toon Town and then I could exit at any station,

1970
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:30,600
but I could only board at Toon Town.

1971
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:33,600
And when I went over to Toon Town, it was looked like a shit show.

1972
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,400
And I was like, ah, skipping this one like that.

1973
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:39,120
That was one of the outdoor lines that just seemed like out.

1974
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:42,200
It was unclear where it started and ended.

1975
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:47,960
So they reserving the train station for the distant character hangs.

1976
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:51,560
Yeah. That's kind of what was like the steps where you would walk up

1977
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:56,080
to get on the train and means that Main Street is where Mickey

1978
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:59,120
and Minnie are hanging out and like a lot during the day.

1979
01:27:59,160 --> 01:27:59,920
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1980
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,480
Here's times are they out.

1981
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:03,480
Here's Donald and. Oh, boy.

1982
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:07,600
Yeah. And they really from up on their perch, some steps up.

1983
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,080
They give you they do give you a moment.

1984
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:11,560
Goofy posed.

1985
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:15,160
They like I think the distant character hangs are good.

1986
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:16,760
I agree. Yeah. A bunch of them.

1987
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:20,600
It's really good for them that kids aren't harassing them and pulling on stuff.

1988
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,320
It's probably makes it an easier job for that.

1989
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:25,240
I think those things are really nice.

1990
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:26,720
Kind of a more confusing one.

1991
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:30,560
Here's Jack Sparrow on the second floor above the Pirates of the Caribbean,

1992
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:33,720
kind of hidden by tree branches.

1993
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:36,960
I looked from a couple of angles, couldn't really make him out.

1994
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,960
I'm pretty sure you can only see him if you were directly below him.

1995
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:41,360
That was a little weird.

1996
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:42,600
Couldn't hear him either.

1997
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,960
But Lindsay said because I didn't see Jack.

1998
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:49,680
She said she saw Jack Sparrow walking back to exit to like go on break or whatever.

1999
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:52,680
And she's got a kid goes, hey, Jack Sparrow.

2000
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:55,480
And he turned around to like wave or say hello or whatever.

2001
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:58,040
And then Jack Sparrow turned back around to go back to the exit.

2002
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:00,880
And the door was closed and he smacked right into the door.

2003
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,640
Oh, no.

2004
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:04,000
I hope he's fine, obviously.

2005
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,240
But it's a comedic situation.

2006
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:08,760
I just want to prove I forgot.

2007
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,600
I took a photo of my eye.

2008
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,400
Here is probably irritated, right?

2009
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:14,400
Yeah, here you go.

2010
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,040
Yeah, it looks a little red from from.

2011
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:16,400
G.

2012
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,800
Rubbing. Yeah, fine.

2013
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:21,640
That's like that would be the last frame of a movie.

2014
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:24,640
Oh, yeah. But we're looking at your dead body and like, yes,

2015
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:27,000
whatever horrors you've witnessed in the third act.

2016
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,040
Yeah, the mask is soaked.

2017
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:32,920
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And your hair is like, oh, wait, I got a different one, too.

2018
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,640
Look at both. Like.

2019
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,040
Oh, my God.

2020
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:40,040
Oh, yeah. Compared to the other one compared to the well one.

2021
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,640
Yes. Yeah, yeah. Jesus.

2022
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:45,120
I'll get I'll get you a bottle of OptiV tears.

2023
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,320
That's what I usually carry on me.

2024
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:49,680
It's kind of sensitive eyes.

2025
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:51,840
OptiV gave me my OptiV tears.

2026
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:54,400
And that is we met this crazy bird.

2027
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,200
We were eating popcorn.

2028
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,680
It was called him Eric.

2029
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:02,720
I thought he looked like he wanted to kill me.

2030
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:04,520
Jane thought he was friendly.

2031
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:07,160
But that bird, that beak seems like a weapon.

2032
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:09,960
So I don't know. He was mad dogging me a lot.

2033
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:13,320
Now, I have a Disney bird question, which is we felt like we were seeing

2034
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:15,000
a lot more geese than before.

2035
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,400
I saw geese. Really? OK.

2036
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,360
You know, this is to. Yep. What's going on with this?

2037
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,120
Why are there more geese?

2038
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:22,640
My guess would be that since there were a lot fewer people there for a year

2039
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:25,880
that more birds and geese were like, hey, this is our home now.

2040
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,800
And now that empty spot.

2041
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:31,000
And now they're kind of stuck there because they're like, well, we were here.

2042
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,560
Why are you all coming here?

2043
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,800
Yeah, we saw a cat.

2044
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:36,080
We saw a cat from the Haunted Mansion line.

2045
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:39,880
It was on the big hill that the train goes above the mansion.

2046
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:43,280
Kind of those little things really make you feel like we're back.

2047
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:46,080
Yeah, we didn't see any cats.

2048
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:49,840
We saw a lot of birds, a lot of ducks, like the ducks even bolder

2049
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,800
than I remember them, where you're like you.

2050
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,400
I almost ran into you.

2051
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:55,880
Like you are not worried about me at all.

2052
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:58,800
Like you were a duck and you are not concerned that I'm a human

2053
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:01,720
and that you should get away from me.

2054
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:02,520
Yeah, we saw that.

2055
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:05,440
I'm trying to think we we had a Ronto rap, of course.

2056
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:07,640
We had we did.

2057
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:10,560
Yeah, as we said in our episode about it on the second gate,

2058
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:11,840
I think it's a must do.

2059
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:12,920
It's really looking forward to it.

2060
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:15,280
Aaron loved the veggie one a lot.

2061
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:17,480
And I think we're going to see on the second day

2062
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:20,840
we all made Ronto wraps at home to varying degrees of success.

2063
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:25,240
And the I think a big thing we missed, I think that I think the bread,

2064
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:27,000
there's more going on than you remember.

2065
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,320
It had been a long time.

2066
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,040
There's you feel the grill of it.

2067
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:31,320
There's texture.

2068
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:35,760
There's more complexity to that bread than you recall.

2069
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:38,160
And I think that's something that we all we all missed.

2070
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:40,560
Yeah, I agree. Yeah.

2071
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:41,680
But yeah, that was good.

2072
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:44,000
That was sort of our last thing we had.

2073
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:47,720
I did. Yeah, I had my free ice cream treat earlier in the day.

2074
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,800
Lindsay's first time doing Rise of the Resistance.

2075
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:53,880
Wait, all of our significant others are not done.

2076
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:57,000
Why? We did not allow them to go with us the first time.

2077
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,160
We went alone.

2078
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:01,160
Boys Club. Yeah.

2079
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:02,920
We're gatekeeping.

2080
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:04,920
Yes. Yeah.

2081
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,480
You'll yes, you'll get in a couple of months, you'll get it.

2082
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:13,400
When the gentlemen say it's OK, when we deem the right acceptable,

2083
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:17,080
we will allow the ladies to see it after hopefully a year later

2084
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:19,880
over a year later.

2085
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:21,480
That's weird. We all had that same experience.

2086
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:23,840
I yeah, I don't know.

2087
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,280
Did it let anyone down?

2088
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:28,600
I Aaron was a buzz, super thrilled with it.

2089
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:30,080
You know, I don't want to watch that happen.

2090
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,240
Yeah, Lindsay was very.

2091
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:32,960
Yeah, she really liked it.

2092
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:36,280
She loved the reveal with the with the back ship.

2093
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:41,560
You know, yeah, you forget at the end that that is a big surprise.

2094
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:44,200
Like it almost wasn't one of the big things I was talking about.

2095
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,880
And that was what lit her up.

2096
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:49,040
Hey, and you just love him by then.

2097
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,160
That was so excited.

2098
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:53,640
Yeah, the little misdirect with the ship, with the door.

2099
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:55,440
Yeah, yeah.

2100
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,760
I yeah, it's still so great.

2101
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,360
It was so nice to be on that specifically broke during the day.

2102
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,800
That took up a lot of time.

2103
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:03,920
And it is your.

2104
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,960
Jason, it is way up in the corner.

2105
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:09,720
If you're going to make the sojourn, it's like it's not the same as like

2106
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:11,680
Star Tours is down. I will come back.

2107
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,360
It's kind of centrally located.

2108
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:15,000
You got to really commit.

2109
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,320
Or are we going to walk all the way over?

2110
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:20,280
And it did just take up an inordinate amount of the day.

2111
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,680
Not really, because it is such a great ride.

2112
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:27,000
But then it made us we had to gun it after that to get a couple major things in.

2113
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:30,880
I since we got it at seven, I didn't try to do do it at noon.

2114
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:32,680
But it was noon.

2115
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:36,560
I had to do the new I like waited one millisecond and checked something like,

2116
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,040
is that my pass number?

2117
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:41,560
And I know you have to do it in the first 10 seconds or you're screwed.

2118
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,720
It is. Yeah. You don't know about all this.

2119
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:45,560
There's two entry points.

2120
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:48,000
You do it before you get to Disneyland at 7 a.m.

2121
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:50,360
Just let me try to get on and get a spot.

2122
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:52,680
And then you do it at noon when you're at Disneyland.

2123
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:54,480
I think it's the same for the Spider-Man.

2124
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:57,160
It is. You cannot have both at the same time.

2125
01:33:57,160 --> 01:34:00,840
So the problem there is if we want to do rise the day we go,

2126
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:04,520
is that it'll be we have to get the Spider-Man reservation before noon.

2127
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:06,560
We have to use it before noon.

2128
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:07,920
OK. Oh, yeah.

2129
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,720
I only have DCA.

2130
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:11,240
Yeah, I only have DCA to.

2131
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:12,680
You're on your own.

2132
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:14,320
He's going to for that as well.

2133
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:17,520
OK, there in addition to a special special guest.

2134
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,680
OK, the yeah.

2135
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:24,160
But yeah, I did the noon and it worked, which got me on.

2136
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:25,680
At five, but then it broke.

2137
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:28,320
And so, yeah, it like did take over the day.

2138
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:32,400
Stressful thing, but also funny, fun shades of when Rez the Resistance open

2139
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,320
that first morning, your ultimate checking,

2140
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:39,840
you know, events like you really having to nail it.

2141
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,400
Watching everybody like with phones and getting happy or unhappy.

2142
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:46,360
It is a funny like thing that happens in the park now.

2143
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:48,320
A little mass phone event.

2144
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:53,560
Yes. So she has she really had a good time with it.

2145
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:57,120
I assume I probably like tried to tell her some of it,

2146
01:34:57,120 --> 01:35:01,080
but like it's been a year since, so I'm sure that's a lot fresher.

2147
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:04,440
Yeah, I think I had said like, yeah, it's great.

2148
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:06,160
It's like indoors and outdoors.

2149
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:07,880
There's anti-parts and outside parts.

2150
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:10,600
And she vaguely recalled me saying that, but could not picture

2151
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:13,040
how that played out exactly. Yeah.

2152
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:16,280
And also, it really it really is like you see pictures,

2153
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:18,560
you see video of the ad at room.

2154
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:20,440
I think she watched a video of that part.

2155
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:22,400
I said, I'm not going to spoil all of it, but you guys see this.

2156
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,480
And she's like, OK.

2157
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:25,520
And then you do it in person and it's a whole other.

2158
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:29,400
But why does that part not look impressive on a video and in.

2159
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:32,360
It's just like scale doesn't. Yeah.

2160
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:34,040
It doesn't translate all.

2161
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:36,800
I mean, I'll take pictures of stuff that I think like, oh,

2162
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:39,360
look at this big, crazy thing. And it looks like shit.

2163
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:41,640
Yeah. If you don't have lenses or anything to support it.

2164
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:45,440
Yeah. It really has to be like shot in a specific way to convey that, I think.

2165
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,600
Yeah. Jane had watched videos, but she was like,

2166
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,320
that Canon room looks a little scary.

2167
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:51,880
I was like, yeah, it is. It is.

2168
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:54,160
It's really you really think they're going to hit you.

2169
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:59,600
And she doesn't like the stuff guys above her, you know, robots above her

2170
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:02,400
and stuff. And there's a lot above you in that ride.

2171
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:03,960
Point of view. Yeah. Yeah.

2172
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,880
So so that was yeah.

2173
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:08,400
So she was she liked it. Yeah, it was we had a good time.

2174
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:11,160
Good. So downtown.

2175
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:13,160
So downtown Disney.

2176
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:14,600
I alluded to this earlier.

2177
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:18,000
This is the most crowded I have ever seen downtown Disney

2178
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:19,720
because the parks closed.

2179
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:22,240
Both bars closed right at seven.

2180
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:25,800
And then if other people were just coming in to go to downtown Disney.

2181
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:28,920
But I didn't have too bad of experience.

2182
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:31,760
We got ice cream and salt and straw.

2183
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,840
I think I'd only ever been one other time.

2184
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:38,320
And then I got a coffee.

2185
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:42,280
I got an Americano at Starbucks for the drive back.

2186
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:45,440
And for whatever reason, they're like, don't forget to use your 50 percent

2187
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:49,560
off coupon. And I was like, OK, I don't know why.

2188
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:50,480
I have this.

2189
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:53,200
Like, I don't know what you're talking about, but I'll take it.

2190
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:56,440
And then Jane got a roll of sandwich to go.

2191
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:58,640
So no, the wait wasn't too bad.

2192
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:00,880
There was just a lot of people.

2193
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:04,440
Oh, and a lot of outdoor lines, because that's why it seemed probably crowded

2194
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:05,440
because everything's out there.

2195
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,320
They were staggering, letting people in the store.

2196
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:09,960
It was like a 30 minute wait to get in the world at Disney.

2197
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:12,280
Wow. It's like, yeah, we looked in Star Traders.

2198
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:14,280
We stayed. Most of the new stuff were good.

2199
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,120
You know, yeah, yeah.

2200
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:19,000
Huh? Yeah, I'm trying to think.

2201
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,600
Big other stuff with me.

2202
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,680
The I really I was telling you guys off the show the other day,

2203
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:30,280
I told Jason this, that like, I really think that I never felt more

2204
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:34,040
like the the pandemic is over or like the worst of the pandemic is over

2205
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:39,600
than being on Space Mountain, the most indoor ride that there is.

2206
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:44,240
Yeah. The most iconic like you go to Disneyland for that

2207
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:48,520
and you yell and you're so happy and it really felt like, wow,

2208
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:49,400
this is it.

2209
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:53,000
It really like came over me in a wave in Space Mountain,

2210
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,880
like a good place to end up having that feeling.

2211
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:02,080
Yeah, I think it would have we were hoping to have more of a triumph.

2212
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:05,680
But when it's still dystopian mask world, I think we were still like,

2213
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:07,240
it's great to be back.

2214
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:12,200
It's like in six months, we'll be like, yeah, really.

2215
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:16,320
Well, maybe I felt it in Space Mountain because you can't see dystopian space.

2216
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,160
Well, that might be why it hit me.

2217
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:19,840
And then you don't I don't remember.

2218
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,040
I think they just staggered Rose.

2219
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:25,080
I don't think there was any bizarre plexiglass going on,

2220
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:27,560
which there's all that those things are interesting.

2221
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:30,200
A little you know, the haunted mansion stretching room.

2222
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:32,720
They give you numbers and spots to stand on.

2223
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:35,920
You all hug the. Oh, it's yeah, it's weird.

2224
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:41,040
I realize we broke COVID protocol in the Lieutenant Beck spaceship

2225
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,920
because like I was like, we got to get right in front where the

2226
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,880
we can see that. Yes.

2227
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:48,080
And we were like right on this like railing.

2228
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,480
And I realized like halfway through that there was a number

2229
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:53,040
we were supposed to be in the they were supposed to shove us in the corner

2230
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:54,240
in a different place.

2231
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:56,880
And I was like, oh, no, we I didn't get any direction.

2232
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,080
We broke. Yeah.

2233
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:01,360
Well, we're trying to maintain the cavefabe of the ride.

2234
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:02,720
Get in, get in.

2235
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:05,440
Also, by the way, there's numbers on the floor and you need to correspond to that.

2236
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,880
Because all the numbers rebel.

2237
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,160
COVID protocols and by the way, resistance numbers, by the way,

2238
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:11,080
covered in like the yeah, the

2239
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:13,080
in the and the Star Destroyer, it's like, don't worry,

2240
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,680
I'm going to give you a number of color.

2241
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:16,080
It's red. You're going to go on the floor.

2242
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,800
It's red. And I hate you because you're a rebel and bad.

2243
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:19,440
Blah, blah, blah.

2244
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:20,760
Like, but they're trying to shout.

2245
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:21,960
They're trying to do two things at once.

2246
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:25,760
And you know, shows are debating whether like we like Law and Order,

2247
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,720
like they're wearing they acknowledge COVID.

2248
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:31,120
It'd be so funny if like a Disney plus show like the bad Star Wars,

2249
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:35,160
the bad batch is suddenly like and COVID-19 is really throwing the rebellion

2250
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:37,920
for a loop like, wait, what did he say?

2251
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,280
He changes every other term, but not that one.

2252
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:44,080
Yeah, that'll be interesting to see.

2253
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:47,520
Baby Grogu has to deal with it on that season of Mandalorian.

2254
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,920
Yeah, it's a it's a big scary droid.

2255
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,520
No, yeah.

2256
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:57,280
One like Revis, Revis relative Loki knocks over one of Owen

2257
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:59,680
Wilson's test tubes and all.

2258
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:02,840
Oh, no. Mischievous Loki. Wow.

2259
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:05,880
Ka-chow. Ka-chow.

2260
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:08,920
You better say Ka-chow.

2261
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:11,720
I kept saying, Ka-chow, what is it?

2262
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,960
I go, it's like the Queen's catchphrase.

2263
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:15,360
Yeah. Ka-chow.

2264
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:17,280
Ask any child here.

2265
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:20,920
Well, first off, don't ask any child, but they would be able to tell you

2266
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:23,080
in theory what Ka-chow meant.

2267
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:26,560
Yeah. It took me years after seeing cars to know that that was a catchphrase of.

2268
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:33,280
Here, I tried to do the Avery Monson hat trick of fortune tellers.

2269
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:38,200
Oh, right. And Fortune Red was out of commission or in a closed part of the store.

2270
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:40,240
It was unclear. Yeah.

2271
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:42,560
Like a tarp.

2272
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:46,240
There's a person with a desk and then Fortune Red was behind.

2273
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:47,960
They were counting people ins and outs.

2274
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:52,440
So, OK. But Esmeralda and Shrunken Ned, both running.

2275
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:54,440
OK. I forgot all about them.

2276
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:55,400
Yeah. Next time.

2277
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:58,040
So the details are going to.

2278
01:40:58,040 --> 01:41:00,600
Yeah. I mean, I did Big Thunder.

2279
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:03,000
What did I do? Yeah, Big Thunder.

2280
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:03,960
We had to do that.

2281
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:06,800
We we actually did not step foot in Tomorrowland.

2282
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:08,480
Wow. Just just time.

2283
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:09,600
Yeah, we crossed through it.

2284
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,520
That was about all we had time for.

2285
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,520
And yeah, we didn't. Yeah, I don't know.

2286
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,280
I think I think we hit the highlights.

2287
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:19,040
There was it's being not having gone on a lot of these rides for so long.

2288
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:21,360
I have to go back now and check because there was stuff in the Haunted

2289
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:23,760
Mansion graveyard where I go, is that new?

2290
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:28,400
There's a telescope up on the veranda.

2291
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:30,240
I don't know. Was that always there?

2292
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,760
Was there always a telescope?

2293
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:33,320
I knew to me. Yeah, it seemed to.

2294
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:35,920
Yeah, it was the first time I really noticed it, too.

2295
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:37,800
There was like at the end of the graveyard.

2296
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:42,160
There was a weird scene with like a guy, maybe with like a bell or something.

2297
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:43,640
People are going to be really mad if this has been there

2298
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:44,960
since the opening or something.

2299
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:47,400
But we both were like, is that new?

2300
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:50,080
That doesn't look like I got to go back and go side by side.

2301
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:52,960
I mean, we'll discuss this, of course, in the Haunted Mansion episode

2302
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:56,320
in three or four years, whenever that part of the ride comes up.

2303
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:58,520
But I'll go back and do that.

2304
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:03,000
But that's I just larger point just to make is that ever not after not going on

2305
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,200
these, there's always a couple of things because there's so much going on.

2306
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:06,920
We go, is that new?

2307
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:10,240
Yeah. Was this hologram wall always there in Tomorrowland?

2308
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:14,120
I know the wall was always there, but was it always like colored like this?

2309
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:17,120
Oh, I think that's a fairly recent.

2310
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:18,200
OK, that's recent.

2311
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:20,680
I remember the discourse around that.

2312
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:22,880
I like it. It looked great.

2313
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:27,200
Good like Disneyland Twitter discourse always is.

2314
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,080
I feel like there was I think like it was mostly accepted,

2315
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:32,760
but I feel like there were some people that didn't like it.

2316
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:35,160
It looked found a way to not like paint on a wall.

2317
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:37,640
Yeah, sure. They will.

2318
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:38,360
There's a will, there's a way.

2319
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:42,120
It looked appropriately futurey, but it was clearly like, you know,

2320
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:43,960
decorative landscape.

2321
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:46,280
It wasn't like there was no Instagram spot.

2322
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:48,720
There was no stand here for a picture spot.

2323
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:51,040
So maybe that's why I was like, oh, that looks nice.

2324
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:52,280
Yeah. Yeah.

2325
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:57,960
Let me just say this greater arc of because like, you know, it was

2326
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,600
there was the running guy and we had these great moments like,

2327
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:01,560
do we have time to do this?

2328
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:04,760
And I think, all right, we can't do Soren and Guardians.

2329
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:05,960
So which one do we prioritize?

2330
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:07,400
And we did pick Guardians.

2331
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:08,600
It was so great to go out on that.

2332
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:12,080
But we do have time for for a little mermaid because that'll be shorter.

2333
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:14,960
So like doing all this math again was kind of exciting.

2334
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:17,360
But we, you know, the time was a little crunch partially

2335
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:21,040
because we also took a big long breather as guests of the Grand

2336
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:25,120
Californian to chill out at the Craftsman Bar,

2337
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:27,360
which is outdoors and by their pool.

2338
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:29,920
And this typically would be open to everybody.

2339
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:32,120
But we realized after we got the hotel, oh, my God,

2340
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:33,360
we're the only people who get this.

2341
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:35,280
It was so sparsely populated.

2342
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:38,560
And again, any new parents just know the feeling of the first time

2343
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:40,120
you get to step away.

2344
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:42,680
This was the chillest thing ever.

2345
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:44,400
The food there is fantastic.

2346
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:47,160
They do a really good if you like the vibe of

2347
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:51,760
of the whole Grizzly Peak area, it's like getting to just sit in that

2348
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,080
for a while, that big tree trunk.

2349
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:57,520
That's the water slide base over there.

2350
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:00,920
It's just such a like we just wanted that resort thing to.

2351
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:02,480
It's the Disneyland Resort.

2352
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,440
We got our resort vibe.

2353
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:05,520
Food's great.

2354
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:09,800
We both ended up drinking a perfect day IPA.

2355
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:11,720
And that's how we felt.

2356
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:13,840
It really was a perfect day.

2357
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,680
A like music guitar version of Warmth of the Sun,

2358
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:21,280
which is one of my favorite, one of the best Beach Boys songs.

2359
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:23,720
Kind of a dusk.

2360
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:25,360
Boy, it was wonderful.

2361
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:28,240
Then leaving from Guardians,

2362
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:31,240
like taking that little stroll,

2363
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:34,720
grabbing another beer on the way up, taking it back to the room,

2364
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:37,960
to the balcony where we have a view I was joking about.

2365
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:40,040
It's a view of downtown Disney.

2366
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:44,120
And that's funny and silly, but also a view of the distant spires

2367
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:46,600
of Space Mountain, right of Splash Mountain.

2368
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:50,880
And it was just just after all this lockdown and all of the all of the

2369
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:53,880
newborn madness that we've had to get to get to relax

2370
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:56,040
and just have a beer up there.

2371
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:59,400
Boy, we've just we've it was just so great to feel so chill.

2372
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,800
You really took it in that night.

2373
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:07,360
Woke up, got to have the leisurely wake up of eight

2374
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:11,320
fifteen as opposed to what we're what we're usually doing.

2375
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:13,880
Probably another new parent that you know that first time

2376
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:16,200
where you don't have to wake up and immediately deal with stuff.

2377
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:20,840
So relaxed again, I go out on the patio and just just take it in like, wow,

2378
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:22,880
it's really feeling like we're turning a new leaf and it's over.

2379
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:24,480
And we got to relax.

2380
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,800
It was a perfect day, as the IPA said.

2381
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:30,160
This is I just feel well rested.

2382
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:33,960
I maybe could not have not felt better.

2383
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:37,640
I reached into my hoodie pockets

2384
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:41,720
and felt immense searing pain on my right hand.

2385
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,960
Oh, no. An unrecognizable pain.

2386
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:49,240
What in the world is there a like a barb from a barbed wire in there?

2387
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,520
Wait a minute. It can only be.

2388
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:55,480
And I kept digging through the pocket and there was a bee in there.

2389
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:57,880
This was the morning.

2390
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:02,320
The sweater had only been inside somewhere in the park

2391
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:06,160
or at California Adventure, a bee stowed away

2392
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:12,160
and stayed in the room the entire night and then stung me so hard.

2393
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:14,000
Still see it. Still. Wow.

2394
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,120
Still feel it a little bit.

2395
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,800
What do you mean? I got stung by a bee.

2396
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:22,720
So, Mike, you're telling your story of woe. Wow.

2397
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:26,000
Jason, you had your immediate hike to have to do.

2398
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:30,840
And I have like I'm truly it is like a movie moment of like deep breath.

2399
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:32,880
Ah, life's pretty good.

2400
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:35,600
Then I got stung so hard by a bee.

2401
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:39,120
So I guess this was nice for everybody.

2402
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:41,240
But we all got punished in our own ways.

2403
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:43,720
Yeah, that's true.

2404
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:50,240
You know, I had a number of conversations with people and and they're like,

2405
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:53,440
you know, I feel a little myself included.

2406
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:57,360
I feel a little overwhelmed by getting back out into the world.

2407
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:00,240
It's also refreshing. It's invigorating.

2408
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:01,400
It's nice to do.

2409
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:04,800
But emotionally and mentally, like after 14, 15 months,

2410
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,160
it can be very draining and very shocking.

2411
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:10,720
So when it manifests in physical woes

2412
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:15,040
that that feels like insult to injury sometimes.

2413
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:18,040
The stress manifested into a bee.

2414
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:19,240
Yeah. Stung Scott.

2415
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:21,560
And yeah, did I make up the bee?

2416
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:24,600
Was the bee just in my head like Tyler Durden?

2417
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:28,880
You absorbed my anxiety just to manifest as bees sometimes.

2418
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:30,200
Sorry, you got that too.

2419
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:32,920
I've seen that happen to Jason, really stressed and all of a sudden

2420
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:35,400
a few bees just appear.

2421
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:37,480
Yeah. Stinging him repeatedly.

2422
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:41,160
Yeah. And I psychosomatically like leaked

2423
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:46,000
the like my body was like, I'm going to leak the lotion into his left eye

2424
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:49,320
because I want in the same way that my body self sabotaged

2425
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:53,120
any before by not allowing me to go to sleep the same way this happened.

2426
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:54,600
So, yeah, you're probably right.

2427
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:58,320
We've talked about spirits in the air and all this is possible

2428
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:02,520
that the the sun, tan lotion in the eye and the bee

2429
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:05,000
were both manifestations of Walt.

2430
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:09,160
He was preemptively punishing us for that riff

2431
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:11,960
that ran to the thing we did earlier in the show.

2432
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:14,000
He's like, I'm not going to be happy about this.

2433
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,600
Yeah, I'm not a flame.

2434
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:19,240
I don't have a bunch of pee in a fact in a warehouse somewhere.

2435
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:24,000
I rarely kept my toenails and thumbnails around or did anything with them.

2436
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:26,320
This crass show that you boys do.

2437
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:27,800
I'm not happy with it.

2438
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:31,040
Is he part of it because there was a weird full moon this week.

2439
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:33,240
One of the blood moons or some sort of blood.

2440
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:36,480
Like something was going on with the moon this week, throwing stuff off.

2441
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,920
Saying that Walt created a blood moon.

2442
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:42,240
Does he is does that like the eclipse powers Imhotep?

2443
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:45,600
Does does Walt come back?

2444
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:48,880
Does he start to materialize like a happy heart?

2445
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:49,800
Does he materialize?

2446
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:51,520
Let me think about it. Yes.

2447
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:53,200
OK, exactly correct.

2448
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:54,320
Yeah, that's what happens.

2449
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:57,640
So when the next time there's a blood moon, keep your eye out.

2450
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:03,480
For for, you know, a beloved figure named Walt Disney,

2451
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:05,840
he might sting the palm of your hand.

2452
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:07,040
I'm going to sting you.

2453
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:09,080
Make you go blind for half an hour.

2454
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:11,040
I'm back. I'm going to sting you.

2455
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:13,360
I'm going to ruin your eyesight.

2456
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:14,000
I'm going to.

2457
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:18,160
I'm not happy with all the changes at the resort, but boy, that Josh tomorrow

2458
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:21,600
in one hunk, that's that's a looker.

2459
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:24,320
He's got the Disney look.

2460
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:27,560
He could replace a young Kurt Russell in one of our films.

2461
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:32,000
I'd share a grilled cheese with him off the hot plate any day.

2462
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:34,720
I bet Suzanne Plushet wants a date with Josh tomorrow.

2463
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:39,280
So you two nudges them together.

2464
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:41,800
Beach party movie and that and Josh tomorrow.

2465
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:45,200
Write the script.

2466
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:47,560
We'll get the boys on it.

2467
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:48,440
Wow. All right.

2468
01:49:48,440 --> 01:49:50,440
Brothers writing a song for it.

2469
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:54,720
The summer beach party.

2470
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:56,360
Josh tomorrow.

2471
01:49:56,360 --> 01:49:59,120
Three piece suit at the beach.

2472
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:01,400
Three piece suit. Yeah.

2473
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:03,360
He's always wearing three piece suits.

2474
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:04,960
Josh tomorrow. Oh, I see.

2475
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:09,040
Yeah, I thought I thought it was a joke about Annette's one piece bathing suit,

2476
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:11,320
which is of course what Walt insisted.

2477
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:14,360
I'm just true wanted her to wear because a two piece was scandalous.

2478
01:50:14,360 --> 01:50:16,880
More pieces, more chase.

2479
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:20,480
And that I want to wear cover up that I want to wear a three piece bathing suit.

2480
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:24,480
I'm still so mad that Annette wanted to show skin

2481
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:28,160
that I'm going to sting everybody as a bee for the next century.

2482
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:30,240
And Walt, come on.

2483
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:31,760
Yeah, cut us a break, Walt.

2484
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:33,240
But look, we love your park.

2485
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:36,320
It was great to be back. It was great to be home.

2486
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:39,480
You you survive

2487
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:42,440
podcast the ride away.

2488
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:42,960
What are you doing?

2489
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:44,400
What are you in for? Just do the plug.

2490
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:48,520
Do the plugs. The plugs are if you want, if you enjoyed

2493
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:57,000
This was our discussion of our return to Disneyland.

2494
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,240
If you want to hear earlier in the week, we talked about our return

2495
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:01,840
to Universal Studios. We're heading back everywhere.

2496
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:02,840
It's felt so great.

2497
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:05,600
And we talk about it on Patreon.com slash podcast.

2498
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:09,480
The ride, the second game with its three bonus episodes every month.

2499
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:11,840
Michael.

2500
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:22,320
You said it, whoever this is.

2501
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:24,640
Skylar Grace, Scott. Oh, of course.

2502
01:51:29,480 --> 01:51:32,400
We have to wait for the kick in, don't we?

2503
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:34,840
I guess we have. Yeah, you got to wait.

2504
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:35,720
Thanks for listening.

2505
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:38,880
Be on the lookout for bees and

2506
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:40,880
happy visits to the park, everyone.

2507
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:49,280
Whoa, this is really energetic violins.

2508
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:53,120
I feel like I'm walking the darkened frame path back to the parking garage.

2509
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:56,520

01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:59,360
Oh, I think I'm going to be a good I could I only have.

2511

Is this mostly my eye in the montage?

2512
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:03,760

2513
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:07,040
flipping the photos zooming in on the photo.

2514
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:10,960
I don't have the bee, but I'll try to find clip art of an angry bee.

2515
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,440
All right. Great. Great.
