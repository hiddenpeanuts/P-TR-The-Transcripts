00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,800
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the second gate where we don't acknowledge any musical genre

2
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,360
as legitimate until it's been performed by a duck.

3
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,080
I'm Scott Gardner, over there is Mike Carlson.

4
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,800
Hi, I'm here.

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,600
And yes, I would say even multiple ducks, multiple different ducks.

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,640
I will technically take one, but it really, because we are dealing with a genre that has

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,120
been handled by multiple ducks.

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,760
Three, are you thinking of three different ducks?

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,800
You have to three?

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,600
Three?

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,880
Disco ducks?

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,080
Three disco ducks.

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,560
Okay.

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,160
Geez, well we're going to have to do this.

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,320
We'll have to get into it because I remembered something that was just put on my desk two

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,040
weeks ago.

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,360
In relation to ducks and disco.

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,800
Now if I'm correct in the timeline, two weeks ago was before we were even talking about

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,120
doing this.

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,680
Correct.

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,400
So unrelatedly, a disco duck came across your disco duck desk.

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,440
A new disco duck was presented to me two weeks ago, two or three weeks ago.

23
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,720
Maybe this is pre, maybe three weeks ago because of fire, like fire time.

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,920
Taking off my glasses like Walter Cronkite.

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,800
Many albums.

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,640
But whoa.

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,360
Multiple albums from 30 or 40 years ago.

28
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,520
I would say, I think more than one song would really throw me for a loop.

29
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,240
You're telling me there's a disco duck with multiple albums?

30
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, I mean, now we've said it too many.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,960
Well, it could be the closer.

32
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,680
Is it the closer?

33
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,200
If it's the closer, it's the closer.

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,480
I don't know if it's a closer because I don't know that the music is very good.

35
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,800
Well, I don't know if the music or the main thing is very good either.

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,160
That's what we're going to assess today.

37
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,760
Well, we will assess it, but it might be better than what I'm talking about.

38
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,440
But the character is great.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,320
Okay.

40
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,520
I'm a big fan of the character.

41
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,720
Well, should we address it?

42
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,080
Should we do this in order?

43
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,960
How do you want to do it?

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,680
First of all, while we're really going in order,

45
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,400
cub reporter Jason Sheridan is out on assignment.

46
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,800
But that has left us to do a little bit of musical cleanup work.

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,280
And I think this is a, you know, I'll explain a little bit about what this is

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,560
and what we're doing.

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,400
It's why it's Mickey Mouse Disco today.

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,800
And this occurred to me because I finally made it

51
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,880
to Disneyland for the first time in a while.

52
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,920
I'm in the queue for Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway.

53
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,520
A wonderful queue.

54
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,040
There was ever unskippable queue out there.

55
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,720
And thankfully now that it's reasonable.

56
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,240
Now, that's a pretty, I was also very much, she'll be proud.

57
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,120
I was very much like app checking a glue to that.

58
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,240
And there's a world of difference on that ride, especially.

59
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,320
I was like, sometimes I'm seeing it 45.

60
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,000
Sometimes I'm seeing it 20.

61
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,880
I see it 20.

62
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,760
I make a mad dash.

63
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,080
20.

64
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,400
That's really closer to like 12 minutes or something.

65
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,200
And you're right.

66
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,240
They're all over, you know, we've talked about that lately,

67
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,840
but I haven't been in the parks much.

68
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,920
And I was really feeling that inflation throughout.

69
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,920
That was really on my side all day, knowing like that's not going to be that.

70
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,520
And it was not, yeah, now that I love the moment, by the way,

71
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,360
of any ride that starts in this like big e-ticket, tough to get on,

72
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,280
virtual queue, stress hassle.

73
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,280
When it becomes just part of the fabric of the park and you can just go

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,600
and it's not a big deal and not a stress.

75
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,680
And the queue is like kind of what it's meant to be for the level of ride.

76
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,760
It's, oh, it's just the best when it's like actually been, you know,

77
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,520
absolved into the park experience.

78
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,480
I guess absolved.

79
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,240
No, I think absolved is not right.

80
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,960
Absorbed, I guess.

81
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,000
Absorbed is right.

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,400
Yes, I was going to say dissolved, but that's not right.

83
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,120
The ride's there.

84
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,160
It wasn't absolved.

85
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,200
Quite the opposite.

86
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,920
Some sort of layer, like new layer has been dissolved and then it is.

87
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,720
My layer of stress has been dissolved.

88
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,960
And I feel absolved of the stress that it's been in my head about going on the right.

89
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,600
I agree.

90
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:05,600
I think also that's probably when you really assess how good it is as well.

91
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,320
You really get a clear picture now that the hype is gone.

92
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,960
What is your desire to get on it?

93
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,600
Then you start adding up because every ride, there's a different calculation you make for

94
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,560
wait times.

95
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:16,800
Yeah.

96
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,920
Obviously, what's worth it?

97
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,600
What's worth that amount of time?

98
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:19,760
Yeah.

99
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,400
You really have to like pair it correctly.

100
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,320
Will I do that with a 45?

101
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,520
Yes, worth it to me.

102
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,120
Will I do that for a two hour?

103
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,760
I don't know.

104
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:27,920
Yeah.

105
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,520
And Mickey Mini holds up.

106
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,440
Mickey Mini's Runaway Railway holds up.

107
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,120
I know it's kind of controversial, but I think it holds up.

108
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,920
With who?

109
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,400
I don't know.

110
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,560
There's some people that seem like cranky about it.

111
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,720
Well, there's people that are cranky about it.

112
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,200
It's true, but I mean, it's not some widely hated rider or whatever, but I feel it holds up.

113
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,680
This is it.

114
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,320
Have I said this thought that's been on my mind for a while on the show out loud,

115
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,320
which is that sometimes we get pinned with the phrase, cynical, and understandably,

116
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,560
because we'll be cranky about various things.

117
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,760
And we aren't just gung-ho.

118
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,000
Everything that the parks do is perfect.

119
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,120
But I'm really like, if you think that we podcast the ride or cynical,

120
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,320
you have not watched enough Disney YouTubers.

121
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,880
Oh, yeah.

122
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,920
My God.

123
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,360
Some of these people where you'll see a thumbnail that's like,

124
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,320
the destruction of Epcot as we know it.

125
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,800
And it's a video about guardians of the galaxy of an incredible ride, an immaculate ride.

126
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,360
I'm like, I think we are not that degree of unreasonable.

127
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,640
No, I don't think so.

128
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,520
It's dark out there.

129
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,880
And I've said this before, the change from when we started doing this to now,

130
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,880
as far as the different vloggers and the different YouTube content,

131
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,120
it feels like it's exploded.

132
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:52,640
And now it has all the different bad avenues that every other topic that gets covered like this has.

133
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,360
Yes, you're right.

134
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,880
All the different political lanes, all the way up through, of course,

135
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,600
extremely hateful borderline hate group.

136
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,000
And then it also never fails to surprise me.

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,720
There's an account I follow that is so aggressively anti-Tiana.

138
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,520
And I'm like, oh, God, this account or whatever.

139
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,120
But then the account literally is not political.

140
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,160
It started posting mean things about Republicans.

141
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,920
And I'm like, this is wild.

142
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,160
Because most of the people that are still upset about it

143
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,040
seem to have a very specific political leaning.

144
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,920
Not this account.

145
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,760
The only politics this one account has is that they want Splash Mountain back.

146
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,720
And I'm like, whoa, that's because every other thing I see,

147
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,440
I go, well, this obviously correlates to their political leanings and blah, blah, blah.

148
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,760
No, not this one account that I've had pegged wrong.

149
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,640
No politics, no worldview other than I want to go on Splash Mountain.

150
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,840
And you ask them, and they're not even aware of Song of the South.

151
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,800
Right, maybe not.

152
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,160
I like the bees.

153
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,680
Maybe not.

154
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,960
And this happened a couple of weeks ago, too, where I was just like,

155
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,760
wow, you are not political at all.

156
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,080
You just want Splash Mountain back.

157
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,520
It takes all kinds to make theme park media.

158
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,000
I think the really the way what you were just saying that it

159
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,880
like the explosion in theme park media since we started,

160
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,440
it's really it's especially evident in that

161
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,640
that some of the earliest and strongest freakouts by any of us

162
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,200
during the course of the show were Jason in response to us saying,

163
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,960
what if we recorded audio of ourselves in the theme parks?

164
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,880
Just like the hugest spike of and now like you don't walk through

165
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,200
the park without somebody recording.

166
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,400
Right on a selfie stick or especially in Florida.

167
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
But yes, in Disneyland, you see it all the time.

168
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,800
And yeah, Universal, I guess, a little less.

169
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,200
But and I guess City Walk, even less, even less potentially,

170
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,560
which is what we were talking about.

171
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,440
But I am.

172
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,680
Yeah, I am grateful for that.

173
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,000
That climate, because it did result in counterpoint.

174
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,040
You were wrong.

175
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,840
It also resulted in the one where he out of no

176
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,400
but because I said we should record at the top of the City

177
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,080
Walk parking garage within two exchanges, he was yelling,

178
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,520
you don't even go on the rides.

179
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,880
You just drink the wine one.

180
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,000
I will remember on my own.

181
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,200
Yeah, that is him saying you just drink the wine.

182
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,480
You don't even.

183
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,280
Yeah, I remember.

184
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,720
I shouldn't do.

185
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,760
He's not here to defend.

186
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,240
No, I know.

187
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,920
Well, I don't think you would defend that.

188
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,200
I mean, or you would defend it.

189
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,160
I know he would.

190
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,680
We know exactly how he would defend it,

191
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,000
which is he would say something like, I'm just a little guy.

192
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,240
That's right.

193
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,560
That's the smoke bomb he uses to walk out of anything.

194
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,880
He would do that thing where he digs like the top part of his toe

195
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,240
into the ground and like shakes it around and like kind of looks coy.

196
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,400
Gee, did I was I would pull out his big lolly, take a couple licks.

197
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,320
Yeah, take pull his pockets out to show he has no money and just a moth comes out.

198
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,320
You want it.

199
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,840
I'm just a little urchin.

200
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,480
And it would work.

201
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,760
And it went.

202
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,120
Our hearts would be melted.

203
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,620
That's right.

204
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,200
OK, well, this is a good sign.

205
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,600
We got caught in a tangent in the first, the first line of my notes.

206
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,880
Team Park related?

207
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,200
Yes.

208
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,520
Yeah, you should be happy because the rest of it won't be.

209
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,000
The rest is going to be about an album from almost 50 years ago.

210
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,520
So I was in the very excellent room, very excellent queue,

211
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,480
and I turned a corner into what is an especially great room or part of the queue,

212
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,400
which I would call the retro room or the retro zone.

213
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:18,720
Yeah.

214
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,800
Where things get a little it's like 70s, 80s, both.

215
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,320
It's a little bit like disco, dance floor, walkman.

216
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,720
It's a bunch of stuff kind of all mashed together.

217
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,040
And up on the wall, there's two album covers, vinyl album covers.

218
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,960
One is Mouser Size, which I was also proposing that we do and we will do soon.

219
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,080
But I was realizing there's OK, there's the album of Mouser Size,

220
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,320
but there's also the television show.

221
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,920
So where that is going to take ample time to figure out.

222
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,840
But also next to that, Mickey Mouse Disco.

223
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:58,960
And this is part of this lineage of Walt Disney Records attempts at like pop crossover,

224
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,200
which eventually leads to this album Splash Dance from the early 80s,

225
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,080
which we did an episode about and which we're very fond of.

226
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:12,160
What I would consider the crown jewel of that stretch of time of Walt Disney Records,

227
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,320
and this, you know, Halyx is in there, too.

228
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,000
It's some of the same people involved in putting Halyx together,

229
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,240
but they never released an official album.

230
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,040
So if you're dealing with these albums, Splash Dance, my favorite, Mickey Mouse Disco.

231
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,680
I was aware that it happened, that they did this, never listened to it,

232
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,520
never actually gotten into the music.

233
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,480
No, I hadn't.

234
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,520
So that's what I figured we could kind of do here together.

235
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,720
I think it's an interesting reference point.

236
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,760
A great album cover.

237
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,160
I feel like that's a lot of the strength of it is just like it kind of paints a picture

238
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,040
and it is just a it is a fun picture, regard even if you haven't heard the music,

239
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:57,040
you know, kind of swirly, very ELO, kind of like squiggle font neon for Mickey Mouse,

240
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
big blocky chrome disco.

241
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:07,200
And then there's Mickey and Minnie, both Mickey's in a sparkly vest, big puffy sleeves.

242
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,280
They're in color coordinated like orange costume.

243
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,880
She's got a big flower in her hair and they're dancing and they're bumping seats.

244
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,000
They are bumping seats, yeah.

245
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,080
Doing a little seat bump and having a good old time.

246
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,480
These dresses flying up, you know.

247
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,960
Oh, to be on the other side of this camera angle, huh?

248
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,400
Ooh, hey, just us boys, we can talk show.

249
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,680
Oh, yeah, no, Jason's not here.

250
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,320
Because he would be hornier, I'm saying it would be out of control if he were here.

251
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,560
Yeah, yeah, well, he's so much more in touch with sexuality than we are.

252
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,960
Yeah.

253
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,240
I would just make a little comment like I just did and then that would be it.

254
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,440
But Jason, who knows?

255
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,880
It would just do boil over into a raging sexual trough.

256
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,440
Right, exactly.

257
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:49,940
Trough.

258
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,280
We'd have to jump into, I was trying to say froth.

259
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,000
We'd have to jump into his big sexual trough altogether if he was here.

260
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,160
But no, I will stop the dialogue here about what I've just said.

261
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,520
But it is a fun, they're having a fun time on the dance floor.

262
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,760
And they're really like, I don't know if this is the coolest.

263
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,320
No, Mickey, I guess Mickey's looks a little cooler, but they do look like cool.

264
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,360
They look cool to me.

265
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,560
Maybe.

266
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,400
I don't know if I grew that because I think they look like they're contestants on Dancing

267
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,480
with the Stars, which I wouldn't call cool.

268
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,600
I guess that's true.

269
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,280
It's fun, maybe.

270
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:25,840
It's fun.

271
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,400
All right, fine.

272
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,640
When do I find Mickey cooler?

273
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,600
I mean, it really depends.

274
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,880
I mean, if you're a more 70s oriented person, then sure.

275
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,240
I mean, obviously Mickey was cool as balls when he looked all hip hopped out.

276
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,720
That rap album that we talked about a while.

277
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,440
Well, and on the cover of A Whole New Sound, the recent Walt Disney pop punk album.

278
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,040
Which we really, we owe.

279
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,720
Which we do owe that at a certain point.

280
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,360
Club three loser, but I think we could circle back to it.

281
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,200
And that's an episode I could do.

282
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,560
We could hit stop on this.

283
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,360
I could do it right now.

284
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,040
I've listened to the whole thing three times.

285
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,080
You know it well enough.

286
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,120
I know it well enough to do it off the top of my head, what I like, what I don't like.

287
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,880
But yes.

288
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,000
How much do you like?

289
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,680
Well, I don't want to save it.

290
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,160
I like percentage of like is an interesting word when it comes to this.

291
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,440
I like 25 ish 30 ish percent.

292
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,240
It's pretty good.

293
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,760
I mean, that's really all we like.

294
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,360
I'd say on splash dance.

295
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,680
True.

296
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,160
Yeah.

297
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,320
I think that's a huge percentage for a Disney album to like

298
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,680
sincerely like that percentage of a quarter of it.

299
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:33,920
Yeah.

300
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,600
But yeah, I'll save my further thoughts for that episode.

301
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,280
I don't think they look especially cool.

302
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,560
He's just in a hoodie.

303
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:40,720
Yeah.

304
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,760
He just looks sleepy.

305
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
He's actually trying to play it cool.

306
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,560
He's trying to not be so.

307
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,040
Right.

308
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,920
Not effortful.

309
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,320
Yeah.

310
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,880
Yeah.

311
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,520
There's effort going on in disco.

312
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:57,280
Again, I'm familiar with this image so much more than I am with the music itself.

313
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,240
And I like the image when it appears.

314
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,040
I think I thought I had the vinyl of this.

315
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,840
I don't.

316
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,520
I do have mouser size, which we'll cover when we get there.

317
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:18,400
But yeah, I was just curious how on the money this is, how accurate of an entry

318
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,960
in the field of disco music it is.

319
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:28,080
Because we've talked a lot about, okay, whenever Disney and the big characters,

320
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,760
the big six or whatever entering into a musical field, whether in the parks

321
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,840
or on an album, there's always the question of like, how of the moment is this?

322
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,120
Yes.

323
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,440
And in this case, this did come out in the 70s.

324
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,120
So you're like, all right, yeah, disco in the 70s.

325
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,440
Sure.

326
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,400
They made it technically right under the wire.

327
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,320
It doesn't seem so crazy.

328
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,320
But what I didn't realize is that this album was released in July 1979.

329
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:08,240
July 1979 is also when that event was held, the Disco Demolition Derby or whatever it was

330
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,920
at Comiskey Park, is that correct?

331
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,760
This is a big Chicago event.

332
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:18,080
Steve Dahl is the notorious DJ who held this big event where he exploded

333
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:24,240
lots of disco records and wore a big helmet and was this kind of like military guy.

334
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,480
And disco sucks and this is the end of disco.

335
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,600
So this album did come out in the same month as this very aggressive event,

336
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,760
which is kind of viewed as having worked and been a big public sign

337
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,960
that culturally we are done with disco.

338
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,600
So that doesn't feel good.

339
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,760
And any write-up that you find of this album does call it a late period disco entry.

340
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,920
I saw that a couple times, late period.

341
00:15:51,920 --> 00:16:00,080
So first of all, we've said this before, disco is awesome, I think.

342
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,920
Disco rules, in my opinion.

343
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,280
See, I'm in a weird, I'm all over the map on this.

344
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,600
No, there's bad disco, but just the best disco is great.

345
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,280
Well, I entered into this, I went through this thought exercise.

346
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,680
I went, do I like disco?

347
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,400
It's like, I think that I don't.

348
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,240
Then I'm going through a checklist.

349
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,680
Bee Gees, incredible.

350
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,120
Love the Bee Gees.

351
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,800
ABBA, like ABBA.

352
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,400
I like Donna Summer and especially like the Marauder stuff.

353
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,480
I'm like, well, aren't all those the primaries?

354
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,000
I guess I do like disco.

355
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,600
But all of that stuff feels like it all transcends the genre,

356
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,320
that it's just like really great dance music.

357
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,120
Not even in all cases is it really dance music.

358
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,760
I think what I don't like is kind of like cash in shit is like,

359
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,280
well, there's a lot of it.

360
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,400
I think that's where we're getting.

361
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,160
Yeah, but I saw Sheik listed as dance music,

362
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
and I know some of that stuff is overplayed,

363
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,360
but it is great.

364
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,800
There's really great stuff in there.

365
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,960
See, I don't know, because I do listen to a ton of like 70s funk soul R&B.

366
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,880
I might move that over to like is cool.

367
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,200
I don't think cool in the gang is disco.

368
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,120
I think that's closer to the funk area.

369
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,000
Love Hangover by Diana Ross, which is awesome.

370
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,760
What is that?

371
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,800
I don't know if I know that song.

372
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,160
I guess we're just going to be playing.

373
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,960
OK.

374
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,440
Let's see.

375
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,400
It's kind of like it's a longer song, but like it's I don't know.

376
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,960
There's so many different weird like genres and sub genres.

377
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,320
I think when it comes to disco and dance music from the 70s and early 80s.

378
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,040
I certainly like lots of dance music from then.

379
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,080
This is very disco.

380
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,580
Yeah.

381
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,160
Oh, this.

382
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,560
OK.

383
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,120
Yeah.

384
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,680
Yeah.

385
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,040
It starts slow and then it goes.

386
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,580
Yeah.

387
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,800
Silly Love Songs is kind of a disco song.

388
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,520
Sort of.

389
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Not maybe the first part of it, but the baseline is pure disco.

390
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,080
Well, look, I have my own Silly Love Songs opinion, which is that I prefer the second

391
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,840
version, which is in the movie, Give My Regards to Broad Street, even though it is

392
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,320
paired with a very bizarre music video with like a break dancer and everybody's in bizarre

393
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,480
white paint like they look like they look like Starlight Express.

394
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,280
Yes, honestly.

395
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,280
But it's got the Toto dudes on it.

396
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,760
So I like that's my Silly Love Songs.

397
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,240
I hear you.

398
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,680
It's very cheesy in its own way.

399
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,560
The duck I was talking about might have a version of Silly Love Songs on one of the albums.

400
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,280
Get into the duck before this album.

401
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,200
Well, maybe we do it at we do.

402
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,800
Let's do it when we get to our duck.

403
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,520
Yeah, that's right.

404
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,480
That's the thing.

405
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,280
So there's tons of like stuff you I think you at least disco adjacent that it rules.

406
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:39,920
Yes.

407
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,080
But I think here's what I was thinking about.

408
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,920
Disco also made me think about the Bee Gees documentary, which I enjoyed very much directed

409
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,280
by Frank Marshall.

410
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:51,760
That's right.

411
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,720
I am a fan of Frank Marshall's Bee Gees.

412
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,120
How do you mend a broken heart?

413
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,320
I think the name, which I did like Beach Boys documentary horseshit garbage from the worst

414
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,120
things I've ever seen.

415
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,640
Bee Gees documentary.

416
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,440
Excellent.

417
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,640
And they weave this narrative in the documentary, which I thought was very compelling, that

418
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
involves that disco demolition thing.

419
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:20,880
And that when things get to a fever pitch of disco sucks, we hate disco, the movie's

420
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,840
theory is that the Bee Gees, which are great, timeless, obviously, like, you know, revisionist,

421
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,120
like we, you know, like everybody loves Bee Gees now.

422
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,040
Still, they didn't die with disco.

423
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:41,200
Uh, but commercially, then the Bee Gees paid the price for a bunch of cheap cash in bullshit.

424
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,520
And in the documentary, they flash through a bunch of things like that.

425
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,520
A disco Christmas, a disco duck, the Rick D.

426
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,360
That's there's there's one of the ducks.

427
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,640
They really pin it on disco duck, which I love because that is a that's a pile of shit.

428
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,880
I mean, it's a novelty song, I guess.

429
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,560
I guess it's supposed to be silly.

430
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:06,320
But I think there is like we aren't even dealing in the same like realm of music when you compare

431
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,760
like actual staying alive to disco duck.

432
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,640
Fuck you.

433
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,040
Yeah.

434
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,120
And well, and and the village people also, I think, fall in the category of it feels

435
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,320
a little gimmicky.

436
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:16,640
Yes.

437
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,920
Around the same time.

438
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,480
Are we allowed to say that on microphones right now in America?

439
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,040
That's a whole thing.

440
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,240
That's the official nationwide anthem.

441
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,440
It replaced the Star Spangled Banner and the national anthem.

442
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,640
That was right after it was an addendum to the Gulf of America.

443
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:34,960
Right.

444
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,280
Yes.

445
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,720
Initiative.

446
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,160
But that is a sillier.

447
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,160
YMC is a sillier song.

448
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,080
Now, I'll say this, I listened to Macho Man for the first time in 30 years or something

449
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,720
on the way over here because I hadn't I didn't remember how it went.

450
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,640
I'm like, Macho Man is kind of good.

451
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,680
Maybe not the chorus.

452
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,560
Probably is.

453
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,920
But it's kind of good.

454
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,160
I mean, any of these slaps is the kid to say.

455
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
Because I just all I remember is the chorus.

456
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,360
That's very nice.

457
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,160
But I would not go I would not start going around saying, hey, Macho Man slaps.

458
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,200
Depends who you're with.

459
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,920
Again, if you've got if you're trying to seem hip and youthful, just word to the wise.

460
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,240
Yes.

461
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,800
So I also think and they talk about that and I forget if it was the Bee Gees documentary

462
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,040
or not, but then it's also like there's a lot of like masculine guys in the 70s who

463
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,520
were like, what is this disco stuff?

464
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,920
Is it is it for wimps?

465
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
Like there's all that element to it for.

466
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,720
And then we say five words that we shouldn't say.

467
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:28,960
Right.

468
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,360
Exactly.

469
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,520
That I think was completely the feeling.

470
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:31,760
Yeah.

471
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,760
And that's also yeah, the documentary is definitely like, yeah, there was kind of a

472
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,960
homophobia racism to the yeah, yeah, yeah.

473
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,720
So I guess it was a fever pitch, probably just of the genre, which happens to everything.

474
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,240
I mean, there's always reactions to things that explode.

475
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,640
Yeah.

476
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,360
And then you have to like in time sift through the sand and revisit and go, no, this thing,

477
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,080
like the thing that took the fall like the Bee Gees did is so great and remains so great.

478
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,640
And think about like how deep is your love?

479
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,680
It's like that's not even.

480
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:04,800
No.

481
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,280
Disco.

482
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,480
So yeah, we're just in another like, oh, it's just so like lush and moving and incredible.

483
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,920
So even like lump that in forcibly with just like, you know, the worst of Casey and the

484
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,880
Sunshine Band.

485
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,800
Although even them, I was about to like hate on Casey and the Sunshine Band.

486
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,480
And then I'm like, oh, wait, boogie shoes.

487
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,240
Shoes is kind of good.

488
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,040
Yeah.

489
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,880
There's a good, I don't know.

490
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,520
Yeah, it's.

491
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,040
Well, and then like even like Rolling Stones Miss You, which I love.

492
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,360
I love the like eight minute version of that song.

493
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:33,840
Yeah.

494
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,600
That's disco baseline.

495
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,480
Like that's so influenced by disco.

496
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,000
Like even like bigger artists from decade earlier were like, well, maybe we try a disco.

497
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,600
This is another weird thing about me that I, when, you know, in this era, a lot of bands

498
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,880
reached what critics might call a disco nadir where like a bunch of groups tried to like

499
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,480
get in on the trend.

500
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,400
And at the time they might've said like, oh, this is the worst song they've ever done.

501
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,800
I like most bands disco nadir.

502
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,680
I like Miss You.

503
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,760
If you consider the Chicago song Street Player disco nadir, I really like Street Player.

504
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,240
The Beach Boys have a pretty indefensible disco song called Here Comes the Night.

505
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,200
And the main reason it's indefensible is because it's 11 minutes long.

506
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,680
Oh, God.

507
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:28,640
However, one time I put it on in front of Erin, who actively dislikes the Beach Boys.

508
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,880
And it's the only time I've ever put on a Beach Boys song.

509
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,320
And she was like, oh, what's this?

510
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,120
I like tricked them because it's such a different sound.

511
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,640
I like tricked them into.

512
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,920
There's another disco nadir I'm not coming up with.

513
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,360
There's an Elton John one, but I don't remember it.

514
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,400
I don't know that song very well.

515
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:46,880
There is.

516
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,600
I know exactly what you're talking about.

517
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,480
I found this like a year ago and I was like, what is this?

518
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,560
I did like it and I can't think of the name of it.

519
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:54,880
Yeah.

520
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,200
Unless there's a couple of them, but I found one.

521
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,920
I want to say it was on an EP or something, but maybe I'm misremembering.

522
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,520
I guess maybe we're finding as we talk, it's a better genre than not.

523
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,120
And I think, yeah, got like a, I don't know, an unfair tag is being like cheesy.

524
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,480
And you know what I really hate is just like Halloween costume.

525
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,560
I don't like seeing like a, you know, like a big puffy wig and a big open shirt.

526
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,320
Yeah, that's kind of annoying.

527
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,120
Yeah, no, always.

528
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,720
But if you can separate it and go into what it really was.

529
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,360
Now to tie it back to Mickey Mouse Disco, that is the thesis I wanted to bring to the table.

530
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:36,080
Is Mickey Mouse Disco worthy of inclusion in the Bee Gees documentary,

531
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:42,880
flip through the bad disco shit, or is it done kind of affectionately enough?

532
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,240
And is some of it catchy enough to actually be upgraded a little bit from,

533
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,720
you know, the disco quickie cutout bin territory?

534
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,680
And I'm not sure.

535
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,160
I think I don't even know my opinion exactly.

536
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,200
I think we're gonna have to listen to these tracks together to figure it out.

537
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,080
Okay, yeah.

538
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,080
I think I have an answer, but I'm not sure.

539
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,680
I guess I think I have an answer, but yeah.

540
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,880
I'm not totally sure.

541
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,200
Now, one thing that confuses it a little is like,

542
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,000
it's not like they put this out and everybody made fun of them and yelled at it.

543
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,560
This album peaked at number 35 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart.

544
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,480
It went double platinum.

545
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,240
So this was a success.

546
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,560
And in fact, emboldened Walt Disney Records to do more stuff of this nature,

547
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,320
things that we like like Splash Dance.

548
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:38,960
And they went into it with the goal of highlighting the characters in a new way,

549
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,680
in an unexpected way, in an updated way.

550
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:48,800
Because I think in this weird, listless, post-Walt, pre-Eisner Disney era,

551
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,160
not a lot was happening with the characters.

552
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,880
You could meet them in the parks, but I don't think a lot of shorts are happening.

553
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,560
It's not like they really had TV figured out yet because there's no cable yet.

554
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,800
There's no Disney channel yet.

555
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,240
So like new stuff with the characters, almost not at all.

556
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,080
I believe, if I have my history correct, that Mickey's Christmas Carol was like a real,

557
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,560
like a homecoming feeling, like a sigh of relief of like,

558
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,920
wow, this is like this magical piece that uses all the classic characters

559
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,560
in a really affectionate way.

560
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,400
I don't think there'd been like a new thing with Mickey Mouse really in years,

561
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,440
or a lot of those characters.

562
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,000
Like they were dusting them off for the first time in a long time.

563
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,520
And that was a bad time for animation too, because like Robin Hood was good,

564
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,680
and then almost nothing else worked for a long time.

565
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,960
So this is these Walt Disney Records people going like,

566
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,280
let's bring the characters back from the dead.

567
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,080
Make them boogie.

568
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,080
Well, you may as well.

569
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,120
They weren't doing anything else.

570
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,680
Let them boogie.

571
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,800
They got nothing but time to boogie.

572
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,320
Let them hit the dance floor.

573
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,000
The people who put this together, by the way, who come up in the Halyx story,

574
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,200
Jim Magan, who I think is later part of Disney afternoon shows as well.

575
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,160
He's like on every Disney afternoon show when I looked him up.

576
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,360
Yeah, like a writer also?

577
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:13,200
Like a music person, but then also, yeah, this is clearly a big, big figure.

578
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,520
That's a guy I was like, oh, maybe we should try to get him on the show.

579
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,960
That would be a great thing to try.

580
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,080
Yes, maybe not constantly getting hounded by requests.

581
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,720
Another person involved in this, there's a book about Walt Disney Records

582
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,320
that goes into some of this history.

583
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,200
But a guy named Gary Kreisel was putting all this together.

584
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,800
And I learned that he is the uncle of the great comedy director Jonathan Kreisel

585
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:40,880
behind Portlandia and Baskin's and Kroll Show and Tim and Eric and a lot of the best stuff

586
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,920
for the last 20 years.

587
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:47,680
So, yeah, his uncle was responsible for a lot of the best stuff of Disney's musical

588
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,360
history and part of the Halyx story as well.

589
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,880
So, yeah, so there was their goal to revitalize the characters in some way.

590
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,440
And being that that was the goal, I don't think they really knew a lot about disco.

591
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,640
And this guy, Jim Magan, Magan?

592
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,840
Yeah, I don't know.

593
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,800
I've never heard of that one.

594
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,040
But Jim, let's say, which is spelled J-Y-M-M.

595
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,240
It's like a Star Wars character.

596
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,640
Jim Magan, yes.

597
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:21,040
Especially you put like a second A or like five G's in that Magan and then we're good.

598
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:28,800
Anyway, Jim was kind of like really quickly trying to digest a lot of disco the night before

599
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,440
and bringing in things like, OK, so they do this like, boo, boo, boo.

600
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,880
So we should do that, boo, boo, boo.

601
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,400
So I think that's something to judge when we listen to these songs.

602
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,320
Is it clearly somebody trying to figure out what disco was the night before?

603
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,600
Cramming for a test, yeah.

604
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,400
Yeah, yeah.

605
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,160
Or does it feel mildly lived in, mildly authentic?

606
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,360
Yeah, I didn't realize.

607
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,920
I looked at it right before what the pew pew sound is.

608
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,840
It's an electronic like tom.

609
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,960
It's like a drum.

610
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,240
Oh, so is that played off like a little pad?

611
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,120
Yeah, played on a pad.

612
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,760
I didn't even realize that until 10 minutes ago, 20 minutes ago, or 40 minutes ago.

613
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,200
I didn't realize how long we've been recording.

614
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,520
Oh, 190 minutes ago.

615
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,360
I was like, oh, we didn't even play the album yet.

616
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,280
How long was that disco?

617
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,800
How long did I talk about Street Player?

618
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,640
Well, anyway, I mean, I guess why not just start talking about the album itself?

619
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,840
We talked about the cover.

620
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,800
There's other bits of history that we could talk about, but I think we can learn by listening.

621
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,560
So when Mickey Mouse set out to do disco,

622
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,000
what was it like?

623
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,960
Was it good?

624
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,640
Only we can answer that.

625
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:41,760
Well, I guess let's listen to the first track, which is the first track on Mickey Mouse Disco

626
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,120
is Disco Mickey Mouse.

627
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,080
Disco Mickey Mouse.

628
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,960
Move some words around.

629
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:52,960
Right away.

630
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,520
Which I love that.

631
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,480
I really do.

632
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,000
That weird disco noise.

633
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,440
Yeah, it's a good sound.

634
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:16,000
Oh, he's got the motion.

635
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:46,160
I don't know.

636
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,960
What do we think?

637
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,720
I'm kind of like, do I have any response at all?

638
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,960
It's kind of neutral about it.

639
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,360
Yeah.

640
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:55,920
Yeah.

641
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,880
Which is maybe not probably not what you want to happen.

642
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,520
It's not the laziest thing in the world, I'll say.

643
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,000
I feel the album is there's effort.

644
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,400
I've heard lazier cash-ins for Disney and other different, like, whatever,

645
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,760
like, cynical corporate attempts.

646
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,760
It really doesn't get worse than that rap one.

647
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,200
Right.

648
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,080
Yeah, well, that's true.

649
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,720
Yes.

650
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,160
So this is not my favorite song on the L, I will say that, but it is like-

651
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,440
It's just setting the page, I guess.

652
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,560
They don't want to get two.

653
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,440
They don't want to get up here, the height of the album.

654
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,520
There's a phrase they used in the Conan writers room, the Earl of Early.

655
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,520
That's like kind of one that's like a good starter, conveys the premise,

656
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,000
but it's not that good because the good, that good one you got to close with.

657
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,560
Right.

658
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,280
Earl of Early.

659
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,120
I think that's the one where they say he has Clark Gable ears.

660
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,200
Yeah, I almost was going to let you keep playing it just to get to Clark Gable ears.

661
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,680
Yeah.

662
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,240
Which I like.

663
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,600
And then they also call him Macho in this song.

664
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,840
They call him Macho.

665
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,920
We might say that these people listened to like four disco songs

666
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,800
and then just kind of rearranged all the words they heard.

667
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,800
But I don't know, I think it is a, I think it works as a,

668
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,240
it sounds like a disco song.

669
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,560
It does.

670
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,520
It sounds like it is effort.

671
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,160
I don't know that anything is so unique in the arrangement as far as a disco.

672
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,880
Again, it's not going to, I mean, spoiler alert,

673
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,760
it's not going to hit splash dance levels for me.

674
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,800
I don't believe so.

675
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,760
Well, another thing lacking is that no voice either.

676
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,840
And that's not the case with the whole album, but yes, there's no Mickey voice.

677
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,320
Some characters do appear, but you got to knock at points right away

678
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,600
that Mickey Mouse disco does not have Mickey Mouse on it.

679
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,160
Yes.

680
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,440
So I think this one is like, you give it if it's, to me it's like two stars,

681
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,960
two and a half stars out of five.

682
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,400
It works.

683
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,720
I don't know that it's in my rotation like some other songs from A Whole New Sound.

684
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,120
Let's say there's songs from all new sound in your rotation.

685
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,960
I think on my top songs, there might've been like one that had been like number 50 or something.

686
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,040
Here you are harassing Jason.

687
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,040
Well, maybe I was trying to invite it.

688
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,880
No one would go, well, what are your songs?

689
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,920
Let's talk to you.

690
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,200
No one's picking up the hint when I'm trying to get Jason's songs out there.

691
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,240
The idea where we supposed to turn it on you and go.

692
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,200
Well, not anymore.

693
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,400
Now we're into February.

694
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,240
So what's the time has passed?

695
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,520
I don't want to just do the whole new.

696
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,840
We can't, we'll do it on that episode.

697
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,800
Oh God, I'm dying to know something made it to the top 50.

698
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,520
I think it did.

699
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,400
I'd have to double check.

700
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,040
Minor, there would have been, mine would have been too confusing to get into because look,

701
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,680
my son really does like the Beach Boys much to my wife's chagrin.

702
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,240
So like 10 of the songs, just all it is.

703
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,720
I think my top song was Surfing USA and it wasn't because of me.

704
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,880
And I did, I have, I swear I have not forced the Beach Boys on him.

705
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:59,360
I did not tie him to his bed, play it definitely loud all night until he stopped screaming and

706
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,560
woke up and said, Brian Wilson was genius daddy.

707
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,520
I mean, I believe what you're saying, but that it was inevitable.

708
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,760
And in the same way that I would say, I did not force my daughter to like Ninja Turtles.

709
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,640
I didn't tell her to chase me around pretending she's crying, but it was inevitable.

710
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:18,960
Yeah.

711
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,080
I think so.

712
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,000
So, but she did, that's, she decided she liked Krang.

713
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,600
She gives Krang a little hug sometimes when she sees a figure or a little plush Krang.

714
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,040
It's just nice when the interests.

715
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,040
Yes, it is nice.

716
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,280
Yes.

717
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,120
I mean, there'll be a rejection at some point, a horrible rejection of everything,

718
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,120
but maybe there won't, maybe there won't be, I don't know.

719
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,240
But I'm just glad that you're aware of that possibility because that's been my fear with

720
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:51,680
you for a long time is that you, when the 12 year old, I don't like anything you like hits.

721
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,160
Yeah.

722
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,440
That you're going to be in a lot of trouble.

723
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,920
And then when you're, when your daughter doesn't like third eye blind anymore

724
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,120
and all the great music that you've convinced her is cool.

725
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,880
Well, I don't even want to think about that.

726
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,000
That actually isn't something I thought.

727
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,160
Third eye, that's going to turn you into a jumper.

728
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,840
Semi-jumper life is number three on my top 50 you listen to in 2024.

729
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,880
So blue, blue.

730
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,720
I don't know if that's a joke.

731
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,520
I don't think it is.

732
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,080
But my top 50 has a lot of children's songs.

733
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,120
Mickey's more on the way.

734
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,560
Railway song is in there.

735
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,520
Oh, that's nice.

736
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,600
Nothing can stop us now.

737
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,560
Nothing can stop us now.

738
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,520
I was about to say like, maybe you don't have Mickey Mouse sing disco,

739
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,360
but then like Mickey's very nice in that they haven't figured out how to make Mickey sing yet.

740
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:37,920
Yeah.

741
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,720
They also, I think there was a lot that they were trying to figure out about Donald,

742
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,720
which we'll get to in the Donald song.

743
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,040
Yeah.

744
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,520
But I guess is welcome to Rio.

745
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,800
That's maybe the low point of the album to me.

746
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,200
Yeah.

747
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:49,600
It's the most uninteresting.

748
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
Well, that's not a good one to put in number two then.

749
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,600
Look, we don't have to do it.

750
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,480
I would say I almost want to just keep moving to the greatest band

751
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,720
because the greatest band has something to it.

752
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,360
I agree.

753
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:01,920
Yeah.

754
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,560
Yeah.

755
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,600
There's some melody here.

756
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,440
Here's the great, this song's called The Greatest Band.

757
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:15,120
Now, this is when you start almost like other genres are getting in here.

758
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,040
This sounds like Philadelphia Freedom or something.

759
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,400
This is, I was going to say it's like, what's the, Don't Go Breaking My Heart.

760
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,440
Or Don't Go Breaking My Heart.

761
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:21,600
Yeah.

762
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,760
It gets more disco-y after this part.

763
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,520
I think I'm going to change the lyrics a little here, but I like this.

764
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:32,400
Yeah.

765
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,840
I mean, I like these chord changes too.

766
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,080
Yeah.

767
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,120
Like that one.

768
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,200
Yeah.

769
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,800
That's very theme park too.

770
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,960
Like that's a very like 70s-80s.

771
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,680
This could have been in a great review on the Carnation stage.

772
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:47,920
Yeah.

773
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah.

774
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,600
This is, when I was listening to that, I was like, okay.

775
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:53,760
Yeah.

776
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,040
Those first two songs, okay.

777
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,200
And it's also unclear what the song's about until the very end.

778
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,600
Or like who's in the greatest fans.

779
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:03,840
Yes.

780
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,000
No Disney or characters are mentioned, which is to its benefit.

781
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,760
That's why I think you could put this on at a party and it wouldn't bother people for a while.

782
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,040
Yeah.

783
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,280
But I think if you were to, and I should have, I guess I could have done this,

784
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,040
but like if you break down the chord changes on this, I'd go, this is like auto.

785
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,840
It's interesting to my ear the way it changes.

786
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,280
And then I do enjoy like the reveal at the end.

787
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,600
It doesn't make, I guess it makes sense, but.

788
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,960
You want to go to the reveal?

789
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

790
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,720
Uh-uh.

791
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,080
Oh, listeners are racking their brains.

792
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,280
Who is in the greatest band?

793
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,960
Wait, did I go too far?

794
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,880
The greatest band.

795
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,840
So they reveal now.

796
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,480
Goofy.

797
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,280
Goofy?

798
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:39,600
What?

799
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,720
I thought Bootsy Collins would be in it.

800
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,120
Goofy's.

801
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,720
So they're all playing instruments.

802
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,200
Donald's playing the guitar.

803
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,240
And Minnie's playing the shaker or a tambourine.

804
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,600
Horace Horsecollar is playing the whoopee push.

805
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,080
Donald Trump.

806
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,920
Bear Bell's playing a horn instrument or a.

807
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,440
Wow, what a reveal.

808
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,240
That's the big reveal.

809
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,040
Glad we built it up.

810
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,120
Wow.

811
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,080
Get ready.

812
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,640
People are pulling their cars over to the side of the road.

813
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,440
Oh my God.

814
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:19,360
Well, this podcast has done a lot of big buildups and then wait till you see who it is.

815
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,640
And Mickey Mouse is dancing.

816
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,120
Yeah, Mickey Mouse is dancing at the end of a Star Wars show.

817
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,640
This is.

818
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,440
Unbelievable.

819
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,480
You don't see that coming.

820
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,680
We're gonna do a poll on that one.

821
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,560
We're gonna see who's.

822
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,000
I mean, I have a feeling people are never on my.

823
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,480
That one.

824
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,360
Well, sometimes.

825
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,080
People are never on my side except for the club three poll.

826
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,280
Well, that's true.

827
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,320
Even if they don't know it.

828
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,000
So yeah, so I wish there was more of that early on,

829
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,160
but I do think musically that's enough for me to be like, oh, I like this.

830
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,800
This is good.

831
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,360
Yeah.

832
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,720
So there that's.

833
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,960
That gave me hope for like music being acceptable.

834
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,460
Yes.

835
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,560
On the record.

836
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,680
But then it puts them in a tough spot because it now what that is set is that

837
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,680
less characters probably equals better song.

838
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,960
You know, but you want if the point of this was to keep the characters alive,

839
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,880
you're going to have to start hearing them at some point.

840
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,040
Right.

841
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,600
I guess we aren't quite there yet because they had they got to close that side one on a high note.

842
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,240
That's zippity doo dah.

843
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,680
Is there anything interesting about this?

844
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,440
I don't know.

845
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,640
It's just like it's it's like it's what you think it is.

846
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,360
I would I would argue that the other instrumental

847
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,760
of a popular Disney song is better than this.

848
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,160
Like like like there you go.

849
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,840
You got sorry.

850
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,080
If you like, okay.

851
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:49,440
This almost just feels like they could just play this in the park.

852
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,200
Yeah, it doesn't feel very remarkable.

853
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,400
You just wouldn't notice it.

854
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:52,800
Yes.

855
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,200
Now I hate to infect this episode with more a whole new sound,

856
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,360
but that is sometimes like the eye to eye cover on a whole new sound.

857
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,080
You go, well, this just sounds like the real version.

858
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,800
Okay.

859
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,240
So why do we do it?

860
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,680
It does it though.

861
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,880
Would I like it?

862
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,560
No, I'm not saying you would like it,

863
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,760
but I'm saying they didn't do enough to it to warrant it being on this album.

864
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,240
Does it?

865
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,920
I don't remember.

866
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,560
Okay.

867
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,680
No one I know.

868
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,080
Okay.

869
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,800
None of my guys.

870
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,120
No offense to whoever does it.

871
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,280
And who would you call your guys?

872
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,240
I do not have that.

873
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,520
No one on that album.

874
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,640
Are you sure somebody made it to the top 50?

875
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,560
There's got to be some guys in there somewhere.

876
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,760
Well, it's a it might be the new found glory part of your world.

877
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,760
Not one of my band that I listen to a lot,

878
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,040
but a band that understood the assignment.

879
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,280
Okay.

880
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,320
Let's just say that.

881
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,040
All right.

882
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,960
Which I don't think you care for that genre at all in general.

883
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,600
No.

884
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,760
So, but I would say of all the stuff, they understood the assignment.

885
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,000
Yeah.

886
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,880
And you get all your like pop punk trappings.

887
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,680
All of the.

888
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,400
I will say, I think if you grew up with that kind of thing,

889
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,920
I got no hate for, you know, if they, if that,

890
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,200
if you're like nostalgic for it and that was your like coming of age music,

891
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,960
then by all means.

892
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,800
Like annoying, annoying voice, like.

893
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,360
If what, if what takes you back to the tender days of 17,

894
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,800
is somebody going, then sure.

895
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,040
Right.

896
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,280
And I don't want to step on it, but it is what it is.

897
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,480
Look at this stuff.

898
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,680
Isn't it neat?

899
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,480
Like that's what it sounds like to me.

900
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:30,960
Yes.

901
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,080
Yeah, that's what it sounds like.

902
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,400
What did you say?

903
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,640
But again, digressing left and right here.

904
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,040
I'm sorry.

905
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,400
I guess we're, what this is teaching is that we're really just dying to make it.

906
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,440
It's a whole new sound.

907
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,440
Something tells me I'm going to have a stronger emotional response.

908
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,080
I think that's right.

909
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,120
To the tracks on a whole new sound.

910
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,160
Let's go to macho duck.

911
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,760
I'm going to change that nice thing I said.

912
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,200
If you grew up with it, I'll end up like, if you grew up with it, you're wrong.

913
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,960
Don't get a different childhood.

914
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,880
Jump in a river if you like this crap.

915
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,120
That's where it's going to switch to.

916
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,520
Macho duck.

917
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,080
Let's go right.

918
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,320
Yeah.

919
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:06,640
All right.

920
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,440
Macho duck.

921
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,480
Top of side too.

922
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,840
Things have come to a head.

923
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,160
We've got to start hearing some characters.

924
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,520
No Mickey, but we might get a certain macho duck here.

925
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,520
Street noise.

926
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:20,800
Oh, geez.

927
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,160
It's very Saturday night.

928
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,360
It's gritty, this song.

929
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,000
Oh, good evening, Mr. Duck.

930
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,040
Can I get the door for you?

931
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,880
I mean, I love that Donald voice too.

932
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,600
He's got two left feet, but he doesn't care.

933
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,280
Justin blue, fit to the form.

934
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,960
Ladies love to touch his uniform.

935
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,600
He does wear a sailor suit.

936
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,640
That's what they mean?

937
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,000
That uniform?

938
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,920
I think, unless he's wearing a full dress sailor outfit.

939
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,360
And we haven't thought a lot about Donald Duck's military service.

940
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,080
Well, we should.

941
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,040
Donald's time in the Navy.

942
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,320
We should be talking about more.

943
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,760
Another disco song.

944
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,480
Yeah, right.

945
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,600
A song he would like.

946
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,840
Takes him back to his days in the Navy.

947
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,340
Right.

948
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,280
So ladies love to touch his uniform.

949
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,920
How many people or animals did Donald kill in the Navy?

950
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,280
He doesn't want to talk about it.

951
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,240
Why is he so angry?

952
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,920
Because he's seen some shit.

953
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,440
I'm just trying to stay busy.

954
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,760
That's why I make all these movies.

955
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,480
Psychoholic.

956
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:30,880
I can't.

957
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,200
I'm doing Jason Stitch.

958
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,680
I love this Donald voice though.

959
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,800
So this is a different Donald also.

960
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,400
This is a different, this guy's named Jim Tatevich.

961
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,960
He was on the Disney studio staff as location spotter.

962
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,600
Do you know what that means?

963
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,240
Does that mean like spotting of like sound effects?

964
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,040
Or does that mean like finding locations for live action movies?

965
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:53,680
That's a good question.

966
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,800
This I don't know.

967
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:01,360
But from 1964 on, he would fill in if Clarence Ducky Nash was unavailable to be Donald Duck.

968
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,240
And then they started, the Disney brass kind of started liking this guy

969
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,840
because he does the voice, but you understand it a little bit better.

970
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,840
And he apparently, what does this say?

971
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:16,080
He generated the voice in his throat rather than the back of his mouth,

972
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,720
which is what Nash and probably most Donalds have ever done.

973
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,000
The current with Tony Anselmo.

974
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:30,160
So they would send Tatevich, they'd pass Tatevich the ball if clarity was in the picture,

975
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,960
which I get, and I do understand what he's saying in this.

976
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,280
So they needed, yeah, they needed it here.

977
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,120
I mean that you get the gist of that.

978
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,360
Fine.

979
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:09,280
Not as, I would say it does, they sure did a good job being less sketchy than Macho Man.

980
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,920
Yes, it is less sketchy than Macho Man.

981
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,760
Oh, Macho Duck.

982
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,520
But not as good as The Greatest Band, but I do enjoy Donald's voice in there.

983
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,560
So I enjoy it from a comedy perspective perhaps.

984
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,040
He did just, he just ad-libbed it.

985
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,440
They finished the song and they said, just go in there and yell responses.

986
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,440
And he did four takes of that and then they combined the funniest stuff.

987
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:39,760
So it really, so it was, this is improv we're hearing from somebody who understood how to be Donald.

988
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,080
What do you think, okay, so you, I know you really want to crack this Donald voice,

989
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,800
but do you, what do you think awaits you in success?

990
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,840
Like if you, or do you feel like you're going to at some point get it?

991
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,960
And then like really make the audience laugh or applaud?

992
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,720
Like where does it, what happens?

993
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,520
What's at the other end of this rainbow?

994
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,320
No, it's all personal satisfaction, I think.

995
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,040
I'm not like, yeah, I don't, I think it's impossible.

996
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,120
I don't even know how, how I would go about it.

997
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,960
I still don't really know.

998
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,760
Well, does that help you that knowing about the throat and where do you,

999
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,520
where do you think it's coming from right now?

1000
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:19,360
I don't know.

1001
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,520
I guess I was, I guess I was doing it in my cheeks more than I was doing it in my throat.

1002
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,400
So it's like, sounds like the xenomorph.

1003
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,040
So back of the mouth is what the man himself, Nash, did.

1004
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,640
Do you think you could throw it to the back?

1005
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,440
I'm trying to throw it to the back.

1006
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,880
Can you do anything from the back?

1007
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,240
Can I do anything from the back?

1008
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,800
Well that doesn't, you still have your effective voice.

1009
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,120
I was somehow, I was like, if I just start,

1010
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,520
will it just somehow perfectly magically be Donald?

1011
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,480
All right, here we go.

1012
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,920
I'm talking as me and now I'm, no, that just, nothing happened.

1013
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:56,160
I don't know.

1014
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,440
Like, I really don't know.

1015
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,240
The worst thing would be if the two of us just did this

1016
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,240
and then you just heard a thump and you're, and then another thump, we both,

1017
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,000
and you realize that was us just asphyxiating, passing out on the ground.

1018
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,440
Then, then it's just silent for 45 minutes.

1019
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,600
Then a forever dog custodian comes in and says, oh no, and then stops the recording.

1020
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,320
Well, then it's Jason coming in and saying,

1021
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,240
what you've just heard is the way Mike and Scott passed away.

1022
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,480
We wanted you to hear this audio document of how they died as fools,

1023
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,680
trying to do a Donald Duck voice and getting nowhere close.

1024
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,520
They would have wanted it this way.

1025
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,480
And then he would have tried.

1026
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,360
Their last words.

1027
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,560
That's the way, when I'm doing it, I feel like I'm choking

1028
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,320
within the throat.

1029
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,240
When you throw it to the throat, I don't know what that is.

1030
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,280
I don't know what that means.

1031
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,240
It can't be good.

1032
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,840
I can't, it's not sustainable.

1033
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,400
No.

1034
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,120
So I don't know.

1035
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,920
I really, I guess in my private life, I need to keep trying

1036
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,600
because I feel like, I feel like it's completely out of reach.

1037
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:02,400
Do you feel like the best way that you could die would be

1038
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:09,760
to at the same time, reach climax and reach a perfect Donald Duck voice?

1039
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,840
Auto erotic ducks.

1040
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,680
Duck fixation.

1041
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,120
Duck suffixiation.

1042
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:15,360
Yeah.

1043
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,480
I mean, that sounds like.

1044
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,560
The best orgasm of your life combined with finally cracking Donald.

1045
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:20,800
Right.

1046
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,280
Like you're like, I did it.

1047
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:31,280
Like I yell, I did it in Donald's voice simultaneously while you orgasm.

1048
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:31,920
Yeah.

1049
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,880
That would be something.

1050
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,720
I don't know.

1051
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,960
That is achieving pure bliss.

1052
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,160
I think mine is worse.

1053
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,720
I think my Donald is the worst voice of any of our voices of any kind on the show.

1054
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,520
It's possible.

1055
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,240
I did it.

1056
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:45,680
I did it.

1057
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,480
I'm coming.

1058
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,880
Somebody's going to have to teach us.

1059
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,160
I think I need to be taught.

1060
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,440
I can't do this myself.

1061
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,160
Obviously.

1062
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:00,400
Well, it requires you got to like throw your, you know, this is like.

1063
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,360
It's like a ventriloquist.

1064
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,080
Maybe it is like a ventriloquist type thing or something like,

1065
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,600
because they throw, they do their voice.

1066
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,560
They have to throw it other places so it doesn't look like they're talking.

1067
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,280
Yeah, sure.

1068
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,400
So, I mean, I want to be more of a ventriloquist in my daily life.

1069
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,360
So perhaps that's maybe a Terry fader.

1070
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,040
Jeff Dunham could teach me.

1071
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:19,760
Not them.

1072
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,280
They're too busy, but somebody like that.

1073
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,320
When you figure out your ventriloquist act where you make a,

1074
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,160
you throw your voice so that a dummy can perform semi-charm life.

1075
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,680
Your daughter will think you're cool forever.

1076
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,720
Knucklehead Smith singing semi-charm life.

1077
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,360
He's revolutionized the ventriloquism industry

1078
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,040
while remaining hip and youthful to boot.

1079
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,320
That sounds like a good act.

1080
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,600
So what do you have planned next?

1081
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,200
Oh, doing Donald's, Donald Duck's voice until I come and die.

1082
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,440
All right.

1083
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:57,840
A macho duck.

1084
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,840
Are we out of that one?

1085
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,040
Macho duck paints.

1086
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,520
You know what I always, I do like, they like paint Donald.

1087
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,280
They always give like Donald something fun.

1088
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,480
Splash Dance does it too.

1089
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,680
He's a digital duck.

1090
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,320
Yeah.

1091
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,040
So like they do give him like a little more character.

1092
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,880
I mean, Goofy's got a song coming up here too.

1093
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,360
Yeah.

1094
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,600
But I feel like they always give Donald something fun.

1095
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,600
He's the one who actually gets the most fun.

1096
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,640
He's really, he's really winning in these for sure.

1097
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,200
Now, is this where we need to talk about because

1098
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:30,800
Disco Duck by long time DJ Rick Dees presented as maybe the worst disco song.

1099
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,840
And then we got Macho Duck here.

1100
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,360
Now you're telling me about another duck with albums worth the material.

1101
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:44,400
There is another duck inspired by Disco Duck and Rick Dees, but not created by Rick Dees.

1102
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,440
He must be fury.

1103
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,000
He must be.

1104
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I don't try to sue this duck into the ground.

1105
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,480
It's very possible he did, but we are talking about Irwin the Disco Duck.

1106
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,480
I don't know if you've ever.

1107
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:57,600
Nope.

1108
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,240
Come across.

1109
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,920
I haven't had the pleasure.

1110
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,680
Irwin was put out by Peter Pan records.

1111
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,840
It was a child's record label.

1112
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,600
Where they tried to rip off visually.

1113
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,480
This is, this is a rip off of Donald big.

1114
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:18,400
Yes, his hair and his clothing apparently were a rip off of Rick Dees.

1115
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,000
So he was visually designed to look like Rick Dees as well.

1116
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
The human man is a rip off of tooth, a human man.

1117
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,720
And there are, I think, six albums on Apple Music of Irwin the Disco Duck and

1118
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,560
Irwin the Disco Duck Christmas and New Year's party.

1119
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:36,960
Right.

1120
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,720
And Santa's dancing with them.

1121
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:44,320
In the Navy, Disco Fever for All Ages.

1122
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,400
Oh, I guess there's only five.

1123
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:46,720
Yeah.

1124
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,520
Five on here.

1125
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,120
Disco Duck Dance Party and

1126
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:54,320
Irwin and Papino the Chipmunk fun songs for all.

1127
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,080
The first song is called Shut Up You Face.

1128
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,240
Oh my God.

1129
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,960
And it has, yes, we have no bananas on it.

1130
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:10,080
There is a wide range of songs that like he, one of the albums has Sesame Street on it.

1131
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,400
The theme from Sesame Street, Candyman.

1132
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,200
Rubber Duckie.

1133
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,040
Rubber Duckie.

1134
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,240
He's on Down the Road from the Wiz.

1135
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,280
Like it is a bizarre collection of songs.

1136
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:29,760
They're the one that in the Navy does have Macho Man and YMCA and La Freak by Chic.

1137
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,720
Uh, I Love the Nightlife.

1138
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:33,840
Sorry.

1139
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:39,040
Also this cover that I'm looking at where it says it lists all the tracks on the top.

1140
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,040
And the first one is Shut Up You Face.

1141
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:46,720
And then there's an extra sticker on top that says with a little red note that says

1142
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,000
Contains the Hit.

1143
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,040
Shut up you face.

1144
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,920
They want to make sure on two occasions to alert you to shut up you face.

1145
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,160
Yeah.

1146
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,560
So I like, I'll say this.

1147
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,960
I like the drawings of Irwin.

1148
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,160
And his lady too.

1149
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,160
There's some decent logos on here.

1150
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,200
It is also like this, like the Disco Duck Dance Party cover.

1151
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,600
It's almost like the reverse of like whatever Lady Duck this is.

1152
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:17,600
She's showing her on her butt to the, like there's a, there's a Fritz the Cat-ness to it.

1153
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,520
Even though it's not explicit, it's for children.

1154
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:19,920
Oh yeah.

1155
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,280
No, I'm seeing crack.

1156
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,880
I'm seeing duck crack.

1157
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:30,240
This is predating the like very strong sexuality of Howard the Duck.

1158
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,520
But a few years later.

1159
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,680
But I do like these drawings.

1160
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:39,280
I don't know how much more there is to investigate past these bad albums.

1161
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,680
My recommendation would be investigating no further.

1162
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,160
I don't know.

1163
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,520
I don't think there's any.

1164
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,720
I mean, I am kind of dying to hear Shut Up You Face.

1165
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,640
Though I have my fears that Shut Up You Face is going to be offensive

1166
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,360
on some level.

1167
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:53,920
It's possible.

1168
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,960
Perhaps all levels.

1169
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,600
I haven't listened to that.

1170
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:00,080
Let me just play Silly Love Songs for you to explain what kind of,

1171
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,600
or what format these songs.

1172
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,840
This is going to become my new favorite Silly Love Songs.

1173
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,120
Well, just wait a second.

1174
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:06,960
Number one, this.

1175
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,460
Wow.

1176
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:10,720
This is a magical hit for you.

1177
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,120
Silly Love Song.

1178
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,480
Disney should have ended this.

1179
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,680
So, so what is, what most of the songs have is an intro by Erwin.

1180
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:27,760
And then a poorly recorded cover of a song.

1181
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,760
So let's keep going here.

1182
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,160
And I want to get to the vocal.

1183
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,720
It's like a tea kettle.

1184
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,640
Yeah, it's a breaking pipe.

1185
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,320
You're like.

1186
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,520
Baseline a little off, a little, like a little wrong.

1187
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,460
Wait.

1188
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,520
Silly Love Songs.

1189
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,120
It's not a duck singing.

1190
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,000
It's not a duck singing.

1191
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,040
It's just some idiot.

1192
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:01,280
Some guy out of out of tune, out of key singing.

1193
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,320
Let me hear.

1194
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,120
Let's hear that one more time.

1195
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:09,600
Here we go.

1196
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:16,160
You think that people would have had Silly Love Songs.

1197
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,200
It's like a little off though.

1198
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,600
Hitting notes are coming at the wrong times.

1199
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,080
They had like one take for this.

1200
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,840
So that is like kind of how Erwin does things.

1201
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,280
There's a love will keep us together too.

1202
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,400
They just started, they just forced people into this.

1203
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,240
They would like, they found people who they had like, they were blackmailing people.

1204
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,920
Like we're going to, we're reporting you to the authorities to the crime for the crimes

1205
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,960
we know you committed.

1206
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:45,280
Right.

1207
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,640
Unless you come in here and sing Silly Love Songs mildly on key.

1208
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,160
Okay, please.

1209
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,480
Please don't put me away.

1210
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,000
We'll kill you right now.

1211
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,440
There's a gun to your head.

1212
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,720
Sing a semi passable Silly Love Songs or that's that.

1213
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,440
You think that people.

1214
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,080
That sucked, but it'll do.

1215
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,920
A little awful, but okay.

1216
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,160
This album hits the streets at midnight.

1217
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,320
It's going to have to work.

1218
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,480
We have a deal.

1219
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,760
Okay, love will keep us together.

1220
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,400
Love will keep us together.

1221
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,360
Missing half the instruments.

1222
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,840
True spit in the face to Neil Sadaka.

1223
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,240
To Neil.

1224
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,800
We didn't even get into the song.

1225
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,480
Oh, I'd love to get into Neil Sadaka's Instagram.

1226
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,320
Hello, I'm Neil Sadaka.

1227
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,280
I'm Neil Sadaka.

1228
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,120
The dorkiest hit singer.

1229
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,120
The dorkiest pop star in history.

1230
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,120
Yes, but a good Instagram follow.

1231
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,320
Oh, a lovely tune.

1232
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,600
That was a wonderful tune.

1233
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,080
I'm playing with my grandson on Instagram.

1234
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,120
I'm Neil Sadaka.

1235
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,240
My Neil is better than my Donald for sure.

1236
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,200
Yeah, yeah.

1237
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,000
Oh, to be as good at Donald as Neil.

1238
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,720
So I guess we have to play.

1239
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,160
What's the song you want to hear?

1240
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,200
Let's do it at the end.

1241
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:15,840
All right, yeah, fine.

1242
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,440
Okay, so Irwin, I will still keep investigating Irwin.

1243
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,800
I don't know if there's much more to do,

1244
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:27,280
but I am delighted by the existence of Irwin the Disco Duck and his multiple albums.

1245
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,720
My fear at this point is that no one bothered to save Shut Up You Face.

1246
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,440
Oh, perhaps.

1247
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,600
Which album is it on?

1248
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,920
That's what, it has somebody named Papino the Chipmunk on it.

1249
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,080
Oh, maybe I missed, I haven't seen this one.

1250
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:43,360
Shut Up You Face, a song that exists outside of Irwin the Duck.

1251
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,760
I don't know, it seems like there's a lot of covers.

1252
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,880
Irwin Duck.

1253
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,760
It is on YouTube.

1254
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,480
Oh, thank God.

1255
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:56,160
With 214 views, you all listeners will tie for 215.

1256
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:56,640
Wow.

1257
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,920
Lucky day for you.

1258
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,520
But I guess for now we should actually listen to this album.

1259
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,280
Mousetrap.

1260
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,840
Oh, well, hey, I got good feelings towards Mousetrap.

1261
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,480
All right, okay.

1262
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,680
Let's check out Mousetrap.

1263
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:18,720
Mousetrap.

1264
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,440
It's got some energy.

1265
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,400
That's good, I love to hear Mousetrap.

1266
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:20,880
Yeah, yeah.

1267
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:28,960
Mousetrap will slap you and grab you by the tail.

1268
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:36,160
But he's slick, he moves quick, that fast will never fail.

1269
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,520
You won't ever catch him resting.

1270
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,160
His feet never touch the ground, no.

1271
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,760
So this is a song about what would happen

1272
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,120
if you angered Mickey enough for him to physically assault you.

1273
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,160
You're right.

1274
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,760
Ah, Mousetrap, hey, I'll kill ya.

1275
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,040
These shirts look small, but I always keep a crowbar in them.

1276
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:02,240
Mousetrap, Mousetrap.

1277
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,680
Or a literal Mousetrap.

1278
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:07,040
Mousetrap will slap you and grab you by the tail.

1279
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,160
He just flicks it at your face.

1280
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:14,160
But he's slick, he moves quick, that fast will never fail.

1281
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,080
The horn's in it, I think, elevated, too.

1282
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:19,360
I think the horn players are doing some heavy lifting on this record.

1283
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,880
Yeah, I love those.

1284
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,120
Yeah, that's passable, though.

1285
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,240
Yeah, that's pretty good.

1286
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:30,400
Yeah, I don't think there's anything stellar on this album,

1287
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,040
but I think you put on Mousetrap, I think you put on The Greatest Band.

1288
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,080
If that's just in a disco shuffle,

1289
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:39,440
I don't think it skids the party to a halt

1290
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,000
and everybody just stares over at the speakers.

1291
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,360
No, but yeah, again, I hate to keep comparing it,

1292
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,320
but it's not going to bring you to tears like Gyro Gear Loose

1293
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:51,280
or Mickey's Got a Crush on You.

1294
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,600
Those two songs, I just listen to those songs in earnest.

1295
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,320
When I'm alone, not for fun.

1296
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,840
I love the Sparks one, obviously.

1297
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,600
Yes, and they're a great song, too.

1298
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,360
From my little bit of poking around it,

1299
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:06,320
I think we're going to find that Mouser Size is kind of a bridge.

1300
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,640
I think we will end up liking the Mouser Size music more.

1301
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,240
There's even a song on that album called Bugaboo

1302
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,040
that I remember from the workout videos when I was a kid.

1303
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:17,280
Oh, I didn't know that.

1304
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,960
They would show on the Disney Channel,

1305
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,760
and Bugaboo was a cut track from this,

1306
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,600
because it is a little bit more disco than the rest of it,

1307
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,280
which is more like early 80s.

1308
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,880
Maybe we're more in the Earth, Wind, and Fire territory.

1309
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,080
That's another band I really like.

1310
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,840
I wouldn't call that disco, though.

1311
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:34,800
Yeah, I don't know.

1312
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,640
Who cares?

1313
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,520
Like what you like.

1314
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,800
If you like Earth, Wind, and Fire, great.

1315
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,800
If you like Erwin and Papino the Chipmunks,

1316
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,440
then that's especially great.

1317
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,920
Watch Out for Goofy?

1318
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,280
Let's play Watch Out for Goofy.

1319
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,120
So Watch Out for Goofy, this song just existed,

1320
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,800
and it wasn't even going to have Goofy on it

1321
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:00,000
until they liked Tadevich's Donald improv so much.

1322
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,360
They were like, we've got to get another character on here.

1323
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:05,760
So they got Tony Pope, who I don't think was always Goofy,

1324
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,720
but maybe sometimes.

1325
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,080
Really takes a second here.

1326
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,920
Four on the four bass drum.

1327
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,560
And then the haba.

1328
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,200
That's nice.

1329
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:27,840
I like that.

1330
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:28,320
Yeah.

1331
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,400
He falls on his face and he's out for the night.

1332
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,600
He concusses himself.

1333
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,160
So watch out, watch out for Goofy, watch out for Goofy.

1334
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,520
Gosh, what's my name?

1335
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,320
Who's the president?

1336
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,120
I can't draw a clock.

1337
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,120
The other body just can't dance.

1338
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,720
Yeah, this is another, this is a top three or four for me.

1339
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,200
And it's just, yeah, like watch out when Goofy wants to dance,

1340
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,960
but he will hurt himself.

1341
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,680
You need to be careful around this giant dog.

1342
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,160
Jesus Christ.

1343
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,440
He will hurt himself and maybe you accidentally.

1344
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,880
He does, he means well.

1345
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,280
Now they also say Donald is two left feet in that as well,

1346
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,320
but they don't, it's not a dire warning like this song is.

1347
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:34,640
Yeah.

1348
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,880
I like that that goes by and Donald just goes, what?

1349
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,160
He's just insulted.

1350
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:44,720
But this is like a sweet warning to any women

1351
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,040
that get invited to go dancing or when.

1352
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,040
Here's like, that guy Goofy, should I ask him?

1353
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,560
I've been thinking about asking him out.

1354
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,840
Well, yeah, yeah.

1355
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,240
Yeah.

1356
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,120
No, great.

1357
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,840
Really great honesty if he stays on his feet,

1358
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,040
but you didn't hear that from me.

1359
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:57,680
Right.

1360
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:02,400
But you will end the night driving a bleeding Goofy to the hospital.

1361
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,400
You have to understand that he will hurt himself.

1362
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,560
He does it all the time.

1363
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,880
You will be something we'll call it.

1364
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:15,840
He will like hit a loose disco floorboard propelling,

1365
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,200
which then launches him back up into the ceiling,

1366
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,200
straight his face into the disco ball,

1367
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,840
and doctors will be picking a disco ball mirror

1368
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,480
out of his cheeks for the remainder of the night.

1369
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,800
So if you're looking to hook up, not a good idea.

1370
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:29,120
Yeah.

1371
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,160
He's going to have to take it easy.

1372
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:34,240
He will be in no shape to hook up after a night of dancing.

1373
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,040
Have you ever seen someone break every bone in their body?

1374
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,960
Because that is what will happen.

1375
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,200
He will not be able to do anything.

1376
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:46,080
I fell into the DJ booth that I got vinyl records in my penis.

1377
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,440
Vinyl shards.

1378
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:54,080
Oh, my teeth fell out when I crashed them on the floor.

1379
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:55,760
We had to pick them up.

1380
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:00,320
It took an hour to find them all lodged in people's boots.

1381
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,400
Donald bought his ice cubes, put them in his drink,

1382
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,760
took a sip, choked to death.

1383
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:09,060
Yuck.

1384
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,400
Sorry, Linda.

1385
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,800
I wanted the night to go better than this.

1386
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,600
I thought now it would be all right.

1387
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,600
I thought I had gotten a handle of disco dancing,

1388
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,320
but my eyes burst out of my head.

1389
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,920
Hard to have sex with your butts in a cast.

1390
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:35,280
So yeah, this is the sad song, I think, of the album.

1391
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,240
Yeah, well, there's a melancholy to it melodically anyway.

1392
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,960
But one of the better songs.

1393
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1394
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,000
But that's some of that moodiness,

1395
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,920
where if you pay attention to the lyrics of Stayin' Alive,

1396
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:48,880
it's pretty heavy stuff.

1397
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:49,120
Right.

1398
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:52,160
If you pay attention to the lyrics of Watch Out for Goofy,

1399
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,840
you'll realize how much you do have to watch out for Goofy.

1400
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:56,800
Similar, yeah.

1401
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:02,160
Now, if there's any musical legitimacy to this album,

1402
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,400
a lot of it might come from what you're about to hear.

1403
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,440
Do you know about this fact about It's a Small World?

1404
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,080
Oh, is it in the Fat Boy Slim song?

1405
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:10,320
It is.

1406
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,320
Well, I was going to let the listener guess.

1407
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,720
Well, I could cut it if you want.

1408
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:16,880
Oh, yeah, sure.

1409
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,480
Yes, let's do it.

1410
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,960
OK, do you know this fact about the Fat Boy Slim?

1411
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:23,460
No.

1412
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,680
I'm leaving this in now.

1413
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:26,320
All right, it's in.

1414
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,040
Now it's in.

1415
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,000
Now that I've fucked up the reset.

1416
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,680
I was going to cut it, but now we're not.

1417
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:29,920
It's in.

1418
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:30,480
God damn it.

1419
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,360
All right, just play it.

1420
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,640
I was trying to say a fun fact.

1421
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:33,920
Let's say, y'all.

1422
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,360
Praise you, right?

1423
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:38,880
Wow.

1424
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:39,680
Praise you.

1425
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,280
No, I could have been the question.

1426
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:44,560
But I have to praise you like I should.

1427
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,360
Yeah, how about that?

1428
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,880
Did you know the thing that was going around?

1429
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,800
Hold on, it's a small world.

1430
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,680
I guess I'll let it play out.

1431
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:55,280
It's in a world of land, a world of people.

1432
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:55,840
Or not.

1433
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,320
I think it's successful, but it's not something I want to listen to.

1434
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:01,600
I mean, that's clearly a great sound if it's

1435
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,680
sampled for a big hit record later.

1436
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,560
I mean, my God.

1437
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:10,160
I like the music other than the lyrics are fine in there,

1438
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,200
but I like the music.

1439
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,640
I think the music sounds pretty cool.

1440
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,640
Can you imagine if I'd done it smooth?

1441
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,320
And if the big question.

1442
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:20,080
If I'd done the reset right and then everybody was thinking,

1443
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:24,480
wow, Scott really set up that trivia in such a clean, cool way.

1444
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:30,800
He's like, God, him doing setups to neat trivia is as slick as Mickey Mouse on the dance floor.

1445
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,400
Not good, but instead I was more like goofy on the dance floor.

1446
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,120
Wow.

1447
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,320
Yeah, boy.

1448
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,760
Take me to the hospital.

1449
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:38,640
Brain hospital.

1450
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,080
You're really fucked up, too.

1451
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:44,400
You're both in the hospital beds next to each other.

1452
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,160
You break everything.

1453
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:49,040
I fumbled a fun factoid.

1454
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:52,960
Did you puncture your brain on the corner of a DJ table like me?

1455
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:56,640
I just found this.

1456
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,880
There's a, I get these Instagram clips from this guy, Luxury.

1457
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,080
Do you ever get this gentleman?

1458
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:02,640
No.

1459
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,760
And I forget his co-host's name, but I think he has like a podcast and it's all about music.

1460
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,320
The groove is in the heart sample.

1461
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,000
You know the song?

1462
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:12,320
Certainly.

1463
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,880
Do you know where this sample comes from?

1464
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:15,280
No.

1465
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,160
Oh my God.

1466
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,600
I kind of just play the clip.

1467
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,080
Yeah, yeah, please.

1468
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:18,960
Let me just play the clip.

1469
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:19,840
This blew my mind.

1470
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:21,440
Yeah, what is that?

1471
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:27,520
I couldn't ask for another because it actually comes from this.

1472
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,480
What?

1473
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,000
This is the Green Acres theme.

1474
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:33,520
Really?

1475
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:34,400
From 1966.

1476
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,040
Yep.

1477
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:37,520
Little moment is Eva Gabor.

1478
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,160
No way.

1479
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:42,720
Right here.

1480
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:50,320
Whoa.

1481
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:54,640
And they've done a kind of classic early sampling thing where you just go.

1482
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,080
Sampling Eva Gabor from Green Acres and doing.

1483
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,200
And then more importantly.

1484
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,040
Which is so like two of hearts.

1485
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:10,400
Oh, totally.

1486
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,840
That I trope came from.

1487
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:20,240
I'm uncomfortable how much we're watching another podcaster and just playing him through.

1488
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,480
Let's plug Luxury.

1489
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,560
I mean, they're very successful.

1490
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,960
They probably don't fumble their factoids.

1491
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,040
L-U-X-X-U-R-Y.

1492
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,800
Luxury always gets it right.

1493
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,280
But every clip I've ever seen of this, and this is something I will be listening to,

1494
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:37,360
but every clip I see I'm like fascinated by whether it's like old stuff or like

1495
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:42,400
let's analyze the baseline to Mr. Brightside by The Killers and then say what like,

1496
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,560
oh, this sounds like this song from 30 years ago.

1497
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,240
So I'm into this channel, but that blew my, I was like, oh my God, Green Acres sample.

1498
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:53,680
Green Acres and kind of a cousin to that Beastie Boys license to ill Mr. Ed sample.

1499
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:54,240
Oh, right.

1500
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:54,560
Yeah.

1501
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:55,360
Time to get ill.

1502
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,360
So that's fun.

1503
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:59,600
A good theme song representation.

1504
01:08:59,600 --> 01:08:59,840
Yeah.

1505
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,840
Well, so there you go.

1506
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:09,760
I mean, that speaks to the quality of this album, you know, a later very prominent

1507
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:10,720
and catchy sample.

1508
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:16,960
Um, but then the, you know, can you go to the last like 20 seconds of Small World?

1509
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,800
Cause then, cause that starts and I'm like, well, damn, that's a fucking great sound.

1510
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:24,080
And then, then it just kind of becomes like too many songs on top of each other.

1511
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,200
They're like layering a lot.

1512
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:25,760
So here we go.

1513
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:37,200
This last 23 seconds was ambitious, but I don't know that it like hangs together.

1514
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,280
It's kind of like at the end of the actual ride,

1515
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:43,600
maybe that was like where they're like, everyone's singing their different sort of versions.

1516
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,560
And it's I guess, I get what you're saying though.

1517
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,920
I don't hate it, but it's sort of like a little bit like too much.

1518
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,120
But hey, I don't know.

1519
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:51,600
Notable.

1520
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,720
Now they only got one more track to really make a big impression.

1521
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:55,120
Right.

1522
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,120
And that is Chim Chim Tree.

1523
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:00,400
The big closer, another Sherman Brothers song.

1524
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,400
It's a small world, of course.

1525
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,400
Closing out with a disco Sherman block.

1526
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,880
Disco Mary Poppins.

1527
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:13,280
And of course, not like in a melancholy song in a lot of ways, Chim Chim Tree.

1528
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,160
Not like Step in Time, which there's other versions.

1529
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:22,720
I feel like there's a techno version of Step in Time somewhere that I've talked about before.

1530
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:23,760
Maybe I'm wrong.

1531
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,720
You can pretend all you want that's not in your top 50 for the year.

1532
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,000
It might be in my top 50, but then-

1533
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,440
Very good job playing it cool.

1534
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,840
So track nine is Chim Chim Tree.

1535
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,880
This sort of chimney sweeps lament from Mary Poppins.

1536
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,240
Now I'll say this.

1537
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:42,880
I like this.

1538
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,240
I like this part.

1539
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,600
It's very serviceable, waka waka waka kind of guitar.

1540
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:01,200
It's kind of like a good music-y Herb Albert.

1541
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,080
Little staccato trumpets there.

1542
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:06,320
Like kind of good.

1543
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:08,800
It switches.

1544
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:13,520
I don't hate this, but then I'll always want to listen to music that's like this,

1545
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,960
that isn't Chim Chim Tree.

1546
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,800
Well, sure, I could agree with that.

1547
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,280
This part is less fun to me.

1548
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:23,600
But the sexier music version I like at the start.

1549
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:25,920
I don't know how sexy I found it.

1550
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:26,640
Sexier!

1551
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,680
It was sexier than that, sure.

1552
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:32,160
And it's sexier than regular Chim Chim Tree.

1553
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,200
I completely agree.

1554
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,680
Chim Chim Tree is a sad song.

1555
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,800
It's not as sad as Feed the Birds, but it's sad.

1556
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,000
But there's a lot of sadness in, you know?

1557
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:43,040
Yeah.

1558
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,160
Last Dance.

1559
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,040
It's the last dance.

1560
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:45,600
That's true, yeah.

1561
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,840
Yeah, this part doesn't do much for me.

1562
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,440
It also doesn't sound like the song.

1563
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,720
Makes you think about the guy who's gonna have to sweep the chimney of the disco

1564
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,080
when the party's over.

1565
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:56,560
Right.

1566
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,520
Get all the sun out.

1567
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:01,600
So, I mean, that's the gist.

1568
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,800
I don't know why they closed with this.

1569
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,320
I'm not sure with the choice there, but...

1570
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,320
I'm gonna go ahead and say Mixed Bag.

1571
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,840
Mixed Bag, this record.

1572
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:10,240
Yeah.

1573
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:14,720
There's never anything so crazy, silly, insane.

1574
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,160
The fine is fine.

1575
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:19,200
It's just fine.

1576
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,040
It's in this fine lane.

1577
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,280
Maybe listeners feel the same way.

1578
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,520
Maybe you knew that cover, never listened to it.

1579
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,800
I think I imagined something much sillier.

1580
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,280
Yeah.

1581
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,120
Not so much.

1582
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:36,560
It's kind of like sincere disco music that once in a while nods to the Disney characters

1583
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,200
and to the Mary Poppins.

1584
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,000
Yeah.

1585
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,480
Yeah, I feel like it's somewhat successful.

1586
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,880
It's somewhat successful.

1587
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,920
And there's enough, you go, oh, you ever heard this funny little thing?

1588
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,920
And then maybe you never listen to it again,

1589
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:56,400
but you're never gonna maybe listen to Chim Chim Marie disco version again.

1590
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,720
But it might be, oh, you know what's funny?

1591
01:12:58,720 --> 01:12:59,840
They did this disco thing.

1592
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,920
That's sort of where it lands, I think.

1593
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,600
I think we're giving people fodder for, you know,

1594
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:09,200
hour, five and a half of a long car ride.

1595
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,920
You're really running out of stuff.

1596
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:16,640
Especially if you're in like, well, we're tight friends,

1597
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,440
but we've still run out of stuff to say.

1598
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,120
Well, that's the moment where you can say,

1599
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:25,840
hey, did you know that there was once a disco version of Chim Chim Marie?

1600
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,480
Right.

1601
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,040
And then, oh, do you want to hear it?

1602
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:29,540
No.

1603
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,000
And then you kind of keep driving and just hope

1604
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
there's a funny road sign to comment on.

1605
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:35,120
Hopefully.

1606
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,000
To break the next silence.

1607
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,720
Oh, you ever heard of this Erwin, the disco duck?

1608
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,720
Well, you mean Rick Deez's disco?

1609
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:45,600
No, no, no, no.

1610
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:45,840
No.

1611
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,680
There was another disco duck.

1612
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:50,640
Do you want to hear that?

1613
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,000
No, even less.

1614
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,760
Do you want to jump out of the car right now?

1615
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:56,480
Yeah, I think so.

1616
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,640
Tumble, tumble, tumble, tumble.

1617
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,080
It walks the rest of the way home.

1618
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,720
We delayed, at least you delayed that from happening

1619
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,880
with some of this information on this episode.

1620
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,400
So that's good.

1621
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:12,400
That's what we try to give you is fodder to try to keep your friends

1622
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,240
from physically jumping out of the car as long as possible.

1623
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:20,960
Though it might eventually cause the physical jumping out of the car.

1624
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:21,520
Maybe.

1625
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:21,760
Yeah.

1626
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:22,720
I don't want to say it will, but maybe.

1627
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:25,680
We don't bear any responsibility for any of that.

1628
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:31,280
Now, another thing to say about this record is that it also turned into a short film.

1629
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,560
There was a theatrical release of Mickey Mouse Disco,

1630
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,800
which you can watch kind of restored on YouTube.

1631
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,920
They took the best seven minutes, which does cut down pretty good.

1632
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,520
Actually, when you take the best of the best of what you just heard, that ain't bad.

1633
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,360
Kind of give it a big optical title, kind of jazzy intro.

1634
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:54,640
And, you know, they just like film some disco lights and they just keep cutting

1635
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,480
to the words Mickey Mouse and Disco and then Mickey Mouse and Disco.

1636
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:02,000
And, you know, when they did that thing, they always do where they took the old shorts,

1637
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,520
you know, where Mickey's like dancing with the cards behind his back or, you know,

1638
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,280
they found all the parts of the characters dance and they cut them together.

1639
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:16,880
And that was enough to be the pre-show for a movie called The Last Flight of Noah's Ark,

1640
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:25,360
starring Elliot Gould and Ricky Schroeder, a movie that Roger Ebert called a dreadful movie,

1641
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,200
bankrupt of creative imagination.

1642
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:27,700
Oh, wow.

1643
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,920
This was in the, this was in the era that proved why Eisner needed to get in there,

1644
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:39,200
because that's 1980, the kind of this dark, the Ron Miller time, you know,

1645
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,280
they really don't know what to do with it.

1646
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:45,600
The age of Candle Shoe and Condor Man, they don't know.

1647
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,000
Disney has no idea how to make a hit film.

1648
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:54,080
And then even Ron Miller himself called this movie a $6 million, a $6 million write-off.

1649
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:04,800
So, but, you know, some disco, you might leave, you might like really sadly slump out of that

1650
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:09,040
screening of The Last Flight of Noah's Ark, not know what to talk about and then go,

1651
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,880
oh, you know what I like to say? Disco.

1652
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:17,040
That disco made me smile before the movie crushed my spirits for, I'm going to guess 76 minutes.

1653
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,160
As short as it could possibly be.

1654
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,240
It didn't technically qualify as a film.

1655
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:29,040
Merciful 76 minutes, I hope.

1656
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,080
So there you go. Mickey Mouse disco.

1657
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:38,960
I guess, I think we have to view this as a step in the path to Splash Dance.

1658
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,200
It gets you Splash Dance.

1659
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:41,680
Right.

1660
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:46,800
And I'm going to say maybe have high hopes for Mouser Size as well.

1661
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,920
I liked the Mouser Size songs from what I poked around.

1662
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,960
And we still haven't done Totally Mini either, which I like.

1663
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:57,280
Mini? We haven't done, we wanted you to do that Toontown album you brought up.

1664
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,760
And my hopes are not necessarily for that.

1665
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,160
Craig and Company for the album for babies.

1666
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:06,480
I hope I'm wrong, but that one I feel like I'm lowering my expectations for.

1667
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:11,120
And then all of which obviously culminating in the best thing that Disney or any company

1668
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,800
has produced, a whole new sound.

1669
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,920
A whole new sound. 25 years after pop punk.

1670
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,880
Disney finally, finally.

1671
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,080
That is true, I know.

1672
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,240
When you really got it, it's like, okay, so what?

1673
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:31,360
They're like a year, two years behind Saturday Night Fever as opposed to 25 years after the death of the genre.

1674
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,240
Yeah.

1675
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:33,280
I mean, not the death.

1676
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:33,520
Right.

1677
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:37,120
Because some of the bands are still around and able to participate.

1678
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,560
But then there's like newer bands.

1679
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,720
I'm like, okay, that's an interesting choice.

1680
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:46,400
I mean, that's kind of like, hey, we finally did Disney D-Lite.

1681
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,120
We got D-Lite to agree, at last.

1682
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:54,400
It took 40 years, but I mean, that'd be better, probably.

1683
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:54,720
Yeah.

1684
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:56,640
It's D-Lite around, do we know?

1685
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,960
I like the songs, those are good songs.

1686
01:17:58,960 --> 01:17:59,920
That's a good question.

1687
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:00,160
Yeah.

1688
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:01,360
I don't know.

1689
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:10,240
Well, something we do know is that we teased a song for the end, which we'll have to experience together.

1690
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:15,360
And you know how earlier we said we just didn't do the edit?

1691
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:21,520
I think here, I'm going to say if the episode just goes blank after I do the plugs,

1692
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:26,640
that means that there was an edit for offensive material in the song, Shut Up, You Face.

1693
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,760
Somebody else has that song, I see now.

1694
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:30,240
Okay.

1695
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:31,760
That that is not an original.

1696
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:38,000
And I'm going to guess that the quality of the original Shut Up, You Face was questionable.

1697
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:45,840
So then to do a cover, they rushed out Gunpoint, much worse cover of Shut Up, You Face.

1698
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:50,960
But you know, I don't know what Papino is going to bring to the table.

1699
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,520
I feel like I know what Irwin the Duck offers,

1700
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:58,240
but maybe Papino the Chipmunk is going to surprise me.

1701
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,600
Well, fingers crossed.

1702
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,800
So are we ready?

1703
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:05,200
Maybe Papino is the Michael of this Jackson 5.

1704
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:08,080
Well, I'll do the plugs here.

1705
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:08,560
Oh yeah, go for it.

1706
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:08,880
Yeah.

1707
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,920
I'll say You Survive podcast, The Ride, The Second Gate.

01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,200
If there's albums we didn't mention in that album litany,

1712
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:25,760
this seems like a good area for us.

1713
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,960
We should make it through all of these odd Disney albums.

1714
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:33,760
So always a good thing to get our attention by throwing them in the club three poll.

1715
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:39,120
But now, let me do a big, as big as possible of a windup,

1716
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,520
because it'll be funnier if then you hear nothing,

1717
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:46,080
here with Shut Up, You Face, Irwin and Papino the Chipmunk.

1718
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:52,800
And now here's another one of those great tunes that are guaranteed to set your feet a-tappin'.

1719
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,960
Talking about feet, Irwin.

1720
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,800
Yes?

1721
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,160
Wait, stop, stop.

1722
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,240
Why did Irwin stop talking like a duck?

1723
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:01,280
That's a good question.

1724
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,960
Papino, I was really confused.

1725
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,080
Who's that?

1726
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,960
And then a new voice, and that's a high-pitched chipmunk.

1727
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:07,760
Cool, got it.

1728
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:10,000
But at first I was like, is that Irwin?

1729
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,760
Why did, there's no consistency.

1730
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:12,880
No consistency here.

1731
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,760
And who made a million in the footwear business?

1732
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:16,240
No.

1733
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,320
He started out on a shoestring.

1734
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:33,440
So far, so not offensive.

1735
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,640
I'm reading that this was actually a hit, this real song.

1736
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,320
This is where Jason, shut up, shut up, you face.

1737
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,720
Number seven, Irwin.

1738
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:53,040
No, just say the phrase already.

1739
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,080
No, I know, we gotta get to that.

1740
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:54,640
Come on.

1741
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,760
I still have it.

1742
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:06,640
Say it.

1743
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,280
Echoes from, what is happening?

1744
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,640
They haven't set you up, you face.

1745
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:14,960
Different voice.

1746
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,200
Made for fun and frolic.

1747
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,080
And so do I.

1748
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,240
Can we not stop until they say shut up, you face?

1749
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:20,800
I guess not.

1750
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,360
I'll start cleaning up while we, well.

1751
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,360
Oh yeah, this is the first gear tear down.

1752
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:25,840
All right.

1753
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,440
Yeah, I'll take the microphone stand out.

1754
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:28,880
Apologies for all the rustling.

1755
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:29,680
Yeah.

1756
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:30,240
Well, good one.

1757
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:32,880
So we're trying to clean up next Sunday, I guess?

1758
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:33,840
I'm gonna, yep, that's good.

1759
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:34,480
I'll unplug and light it.

1760
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,160
Do you think you're free in the afternoon or the morning?

1761
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:37,920
I think you're gonna hear the mic unplugged now.

1762
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,120
I'm free in the morning, I think.

1763
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,520
How's that, how's that McCafe you came in with?

1764
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:46,320
Is that, mic unplugged his microphone.

1765
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,000
So we can't, we're gonna have to go off mine.

1766
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,120
Oh, well, I just have to go off the one recording the speaker.

1767
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,000
Any plans for tonight?

1768
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,440
Just kind of putting the kids down or?

1769
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,560
I'm gonna give Gladiator 2 a go.

1770
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:03,360
Really?

1771
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:03,840
It's all right.

1772
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,960
Verse three, for fuck's sake.

1773
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,080
Save shit up, you face.

1774
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:11,520
So do I, and so do I.

1775
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,240
Something, it were to be our song.

1776
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:17,520
Well, now the listeners know what the tripods holding up sound like.

1777
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,120
To find a song.

1778
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:19,680
With who?

1779
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:25,680
But I, I love to spend my time in singing some joyous song.

1780
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:26,720
Some joyous song.

1781
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:27,280
Jesus.

1782
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,120
What's possibly the appeal of a song called shut up, you face,

1783
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,120
that doesn't even say the phrase, shut up, you face?

1784
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,520
You're sure it's the right title?

1785
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:40,320
Listen, listen, echoes from afar.

1786
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:44,320
Listen, listen, echoes from afar.

1787
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:47,120
Echoes from afar, that's what the listeners are hearing now.

1788
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,320
It's the only audio left.

1789
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,880
Echoes from afar, funiculi, funicula.

1790
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,360
Fa la la la, fa la la la, fa la la la, fa la la la la, fa la la la.

1791
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:54,560
I think it's a lost cause.

1792
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:59,680
Echoes from afar, funiculi, funicula.

1793
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:00,240
What?

1794
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:01,200
That sucks.

1795
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:01,680
Fuck you.

1796
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:02,240
That sucks.

1797
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:02,720
Fuck you.
