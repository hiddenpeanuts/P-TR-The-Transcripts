1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,040
Guys, we have to keep it together.

2
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,880
We have to keep brave faces and be professionals.

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,680
And in light of the news from a few hours ago that the CityWalk Abercrombie is going

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,680
away.

5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,680
All right.

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,680
I don't want to see any tears.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,680
I don't want any attitude.

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,800
Like, look, I have a little bit of that just before we start recording.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,800
I just wanted to say, like, we have to be professional here.

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
Even this.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
That's what being broadcasters is all about.

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,840
No, no, none of that quiver.

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,840
You can't do that.

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,860
We owe these, these people pay for these episodes and we can't be doing that whining and moaning

15
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,320
Mike Carlson and you over there, Jason Sheridan.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,400
I understand.

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:03,720
But we have to shed our tears in private, you see, Abercrombie and you're pointing

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
to Jason.

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,720
Jason's saying nothing.

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,720
I fucked this up before.

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
Haven't I?

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,720
I'm going to try.

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,560
Oh, this is another.

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,240
Is this a little quiet book?

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,400
It's a quiet one, but we haven't gone back to it.

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
Well, now hold on.

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,920
Well, I do want to preface this way.

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,720
I have never purchased an item.

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,720
Okay.

30
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,720
All right.

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,720
All right.

32
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,720
This defense is insane, Jason.

33
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,720
You can be aware of a brand without ever having purchased anything from the brand.

34
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,720
I'm just saying, I'm going to take this.

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,720
Okay.

36
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,720
Abercrombie and Finch?

37
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
No.

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,720
Is it Fitch?

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,400
In Jason's defense, I wasn't sure myself.

40
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,960
I was like, I'm going to look it up, but that would be cheating.

41
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,200
I think if you'd put it to me, I might've said Finch as well.

42
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
I changed it right at the last moment.

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,440
Because Finch is an animal in this world and Fitch is nothing.

44
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,440
Right.

45
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,440
Am I wrong?

46
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
No, you're not wrong.

47
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,040
Well, the reason it sticks out to me is that, and forgive me, someone animated this chunk

48
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,920
of our podcast from the original City Walk Saga.

49
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
Oh, really?

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,360
Where Jason says Abercrombie and Finch, and I casually just say Fitch, and it's animated.

51
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,960
This is why it sticks out of my brain.

52
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,720
I had rewatched a lot of stuff and relistened to stuff when we did last City Walk, so it's

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
fresher in my head.

54
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,640
Well, we need more stuff to get animated because it's going to help us remember things.

55
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,240
So audience, do us a solid and just animate everything we say from now on.

56
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,760
Could you be a deer and animate all the stuff we say?

57
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,480
There's probably going to be an app that will do that soon.

58
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:36,200
I was coming in so fresh, well rested from the holidays, you know, I made sure to have

59
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:44,280
a good breakfast and take all my medicine, and I was like, well, still getting my sleep

60
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,200
schedule and my medicine schedule, still trying to get it in order.

61
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,440
This medicine is going to help.

62
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,240
Remember to take this medicine every day, Jason, because it will help you recall one

63
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,000
letter differences in City Walk France.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,360
But I just felt so composed, and I was like, nothing home plate, Mike just threw the craziest

65
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
curveball.

66
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,560
I don't really want to take any blame here because I was doing a separate bit, and then

67
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
you made it all finger pointing.

68
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

69
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,720
It just stuck out so vividly in my mind, but it's just because of this animation that was

70
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,720
done.

71
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:24,520
It actually threw me off to begin with unintentionally because I didn't know that one was closing.

72
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:31,520
Yeah, I thought that might be a way to, yeah, as we record this, everything is changing.

73
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,520
All the City Walk stuff's going away.

74
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
Sparkies went down.

75
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
Sparkies going down.

76
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,040
High fly today is the last day of operation, I believe.

77
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,040
Oh my God.

78
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,040
What are we doing here?

79
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,040
Right.

80
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,040
Let's get up.

81
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,840
to, you know, putt around and mostly fall an unpleasant, loud wind tunnel.

82
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,560
And we're here.

83
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
I don't know.

84
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
We're here working?

85
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,120
Audience, get off our backs, please.

86
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,760
You're taking us away from the things we love.

87
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,320
No, not our children.

88
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,080
From loud, loud wind tunnels.

89
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,400
Everything though, with Downtown Disney changing, new things are opening at Downtown Disney.

90
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,600
You can get like a slushy rosÃ© at the top of Sip and Sonder, the new restaurant.

91
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,840
Yeah, I was reading that on the way here too, that you can get like $18 Lemonade.

92
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,360
An $18 Lemonade, yes, at Sip and Sonder.

93
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
At Sip and Sonder.

94
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,360
I got a pair.

95
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,360
I'm so excited to go to Sip and Sonder.

96
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,360
I'm the opposite.

97
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,520
Sip and Sonder seems like bad news to me.

98
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,760
I read a bad review of Sip and Sonder this very morning.

99
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,760
Is it about the chicken sandwich?

100
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,520
No, there's a couple different places in this one little complex that's opened.

101
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,560
That's what this whole, all this New Downtown Disney stuff, that's what it's all going to

102
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
be about, right?

103
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,280
Is like expensive, increasingly bad chicken sandwiches.

104
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,040
That's the entire game in all of these malls outside of theme parks.

105
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:56,960
I totally think I've seen Mike as happy in ages as he was to say Sip and Sonder like

106
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,680
three times in a row.

107
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,240
Let's put him on blast.

108
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,680
Is it an and or an ampersand or an N?

109
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,120
Let's play his game against him.

110
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
It's not the N.

111
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
It's not an N?

112
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
All right, we know that.

113
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,480
I don't know if it's an ampersand.

114
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,560
I think, oh, I think it's an ampersand.

115
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Let's go with ampersand.

116
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,760
This guy, he's got to take his medicine.

117
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,600
Sip and Sonder, Sip and Sonder.

118
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
It is an ampersand.

119
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
It's an ampersand.

120
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Okay.

121
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
I believe, unless it's a different Sip and Sonder.

122
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Mm-hmm.

123
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,160
Oh, maybe it's a different Sip and Sonder than the one that exists, but I doubt it.

124
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,120
How different is Sip and Sonder is there?

125
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,960
Is this a brand that exists outside of this?

126
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,040
I thought it was a Disney created thing up until this moment.

127
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,960
But now I'm questioning that.

128
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
Huh.

129
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,080
Well, you're right.

130
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,440
I don't know what to make of all these changes.

131
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,080
I feel like these places are rapidly changing in this year.

132
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,800
We've said for years now, oh, Universal's getting rid of stuff.

133
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
They don't know, blah, blah, blah.

134
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,920
But it really feels like we're hitting a turning point in these last few months.

135
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
It is ramping up.

136
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Ramping up.

137
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
It's ramping up.

138
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
You might say.

139
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,920
Very fast.

140
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
I need my medicine too.

141
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
Yeah.

142
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,560
But I feel, I don't know what to make of it.

143
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:06,800
I almost feel like the rift we healed in the City Walk saga has something to do with this

144
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
now.

145
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,400
Are they doing this just for, are they doing this for us, are they closing a bunch of things

146
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,200
and opening new things just because they want more, because they want another series?

147
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
Not a saga.

148
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,640
I don't know how we can do it though, but yes, it feels, to me, who's very full of himself

149
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,360
and egocentric, it feels like what we did caused a lot of this to happen.

150
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,040
The rumors of two new hotels at City Walk Hollywood, it's going to look so different

151
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
in a couple of years.

152
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,280
I can't think of what else might cause all these City Walk restaurants to close.

153
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,000
It must be us and certainly not the unbelievably terrible quality of said restaurants and that

154
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,840
they are never solicited by human beings.

155
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,360
But what they want to do is open more things like Toothsums.

156
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
That's true.

157
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,040
Toothsums is part of the new wave of bad stuff.

158
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:00,080
It seems like just an abject failure, just also this morning, I guess I was having a

159
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,080
theme parky morning.

160
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,520
I was having a text exchange with Dennis McNicholas who joined us a couple of years ago, who was

161
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,000
asking for like, so what is up with this Toothsum?

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,520
I'm seeing a movie.

163
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,520
Should I hit up Toothsum?

164
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,820
I said under no circumstances should you go to Toothsum and he said, well, I am just learning

165
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,480
about Jacques and Penelope.

166
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,480
He was having that discovery.

167
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,680
Oh, there's the characters and he sent a few photos and I was like, no joke, Jacques and

168
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,000
Penelope were cut for budget one week ago.

169
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,720
It's really all happening right now, isn't it?

170
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
It's all happening now.

171
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,360
We're in the deepest period of city walk change.

172
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,000
We did that entire series in a way of like, isn't this place weird that it never changed,

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,280
that it's been this odd way for the last five years, unchanging?

174
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,240
And now, boy, that's out the wind.

175
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,240
It's changing every day.

176
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,240
It's unrecognizable.

177
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,880
Now it's really going to be something.

178
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,680
Now Penelope's parents are never going to find her.

179
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,120
God, they might never close the loop on that.

180
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,960
We might never get an end to the story, at least for narrative purposes.

181
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,040
They have to keep those characters, don't they?

182
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,040
I think so.

183
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,920
What if they turn it back into a hard rock, but then brought Penelope there and she's

184
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,800
just managing the hard rock?

185
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
That's fine.

186
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,360
That's technically a story and Jacques is a robot, but he has a good guitar and he rocks

187
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
sometimes.

188
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,360
What if he is the guitar?

189
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,360
Oh, what do you mean?

190
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
What if he's playing himself?

191
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
Oh yeah, that's true.

192
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
Oh, okay.

193
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
Yeah.

194
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
Yeah.

195
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,360
You can put that in, but he could be like a one man, but he could have a keyboard in

196
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,360
his tummy.

197
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh, that'd be better.

198
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah.

199
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah.

200
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So he could do a whole thing going on.

201
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Trombone ears.

202
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Trombone ears.

203
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeah.

204
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Little cymbals and balls, I don't know.

205
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,480
Your cymbals are little balls that clap together as our balls clap together when we walk.

206
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,160
Closing the loop may be a thing.

207
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:45,240
What if the evolution of City Walk is that circle is complete and stuff starts coming

208
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
back.

209
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,560
There's a wind up toy store.

210
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,600
There's Jody Moroney's Sausage Kingdom, which what would that just be called nowadays?

211
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Jody's Place?

212
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
The Jody's Place.

213
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Oh, I think it would be like Jody's.

214
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
It would be a simpler.

215
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Is that what you're saying?

216
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Jody's even simpler.

217
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
Yeah, yeah.

218
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Like a new version.

219
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,720
Jody Moroney's Sausage Kingdom is too wordy potentially.

220
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,640
The rumor is Buka will close too.

221
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,640
Like, I think.

222
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Really?

223
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
I think.

224
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
Wow.

225
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,800
That's why I saw a rumor, but also makes sense because it's not a universal own thing.

226
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
Yeah.

227
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,040
It sucks ass.

228
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,040
Yeah.

229
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,040
Julie, man.

230
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,280
But it's made it a long time while sucking ass.

231
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,640
Sucking ass does not mean that it should close because it's done so well.

232
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:33,040
As long as the Raiders store stays, store for a football team that is no longer in California

233
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,240
and is not even one, is certainly not one of the two teams in Los Angeles.

234
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,000
The absolute majority of its existence, it has not been, the entirety of its existence,

235
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
it has never been.

236
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,240
Wait, maybe the entirety, right?

237
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
I don't know my time.

238
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,680
No, they were in the Los Angeles.

239
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
Didn't they move after the earthquake?

240
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,680
But it was in the early 90s.

241
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,680
Yeah.

242
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
But that store was not open.

243
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,520
That part of CityWalk was not there at all.

244
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,520
Oh, right.

245
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,520
Yeah.

246
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,520
Maybe it's never.

247
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,520
God, that's insane.

248
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,240
Has anyone in the last two or three weeks cracked open the Google Maps overhead view

249
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,960
of CityWalk like I have?

250
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Yeah.

251
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
You have?

252
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,880
Because I was trying to place for these hotels that are getting rumored.

253
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,960
Because I'm very CityWalk minded lately with all these rumors and closings.

254
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Yeah.

255
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
Yeah.

256
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,920
Because yeah, there's rumor two hotels, one goes by the entrance to Universal, one goes

257
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,200
where iFly is, that's the smaller one.

258
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,080
But it looks like it takes over the movie theater, I don't know what the geography of

259
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,080
that is.

260
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
All the things they could remove.

261
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,640
That would be the strangest CityWalk decision that the movie theater, the one thing anyone

262
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,320
uses and that doesn't fuck up what it does, unless I'm on, like I don't see movies there

263
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
a lot.

264
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,040
It's just to me, like you go in there expecting to see a movie and then you see a movie as

265
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,000
opposed to any CityWalk restaurant or store that finds a myriad of ways to fuck up what

266
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,800
is promoted as the task of the place.

267
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,560
You go in expecting pasta and they serve you diarrhea.

268
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,400
That's what happens often in CityWalk.

269
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,120
But yeah, movie, they'll show you the movie you bought a ticket for is what you're saying.

270
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,920
Someone sent us the tweet over the holidays.

271
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,240
The film critic for Variety was like, so wait, if you go to CityWalk, you pay for parking

272
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,120
and then the AMC still gives you dirty cash?

273
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:24,200
I do like that with everything changing that that has not, that they still just, they still

274
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
hand you dirty cash.

275
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,280
Well, if you use the AMC app, there's a way not to get the dirty cash, but that is still,

276
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,400
if you don't do it ahead of time, how you have to get your money back.

277
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,800
Can I, I want to shout out, this is, this is, I have this, you know, it happens to us

278
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,880
once in a while.

279
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,920
I'm driving up to CityWalk through two and a half weeks ago with my daughter.

280
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,960
I'm just going to, we're going to stroll around.

281
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
Weeks ago or hours ago?

282
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
No, not out.

283
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
We didn't have time today.

284
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,840
I almost, I almost did yesterday, but I hurt my toe and it was like hard to walk around

285
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
with my shoe on.

286
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
It's okay.

287
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
My toe is fine today though.

288
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
Don't worry about it.

289
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,040
If it had been at CityWalk, we could have gotten a lot of material.

290
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,040
That's true.

291
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,280
But I was just a stray toe hurt.

292
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,200
I had taken, I was taking her just up there.

293
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,280
We're going to go in the park for a second and then we're going to have something to eat

294
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,320
at the El Vivo, El Vivo Italian kitchen.

295
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,320
I feel like there's an eel in there.

296
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,320
What am I thinking of then?

297
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,320
What am I?

298
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Isn't it an aisle?

299
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
Is it just Vivo?

300
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
I think so.

301
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
What am I thinking?

302
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
We would be the people to know.

303
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Well, if anyone.

304
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,360
Well, that's my new buca di beppo is that I had an eel.

305
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
A stray eel.

306
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,120
He wasn't sure if it was an ant or an ampersand and he put an eel in there.

307
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,040
Oh no, I'm going to edit this out though.

308
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,440
So I'm going up there and I realized, cause I have a pass that has the parking, I realized,

309
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,760
oh shit, it's past six o'clock, which is by the way, this is some dumb policy of Universal

310
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,320
not to let you park for free.

311
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,320
If you have the free parking in your past after six o'clock, even though the park still

312
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,040
can be open till nine, like regular riffraff.

313
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,040
It's weird.

314
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,920
There's no annual passholder respect.

315
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,420
It's a bizarre policy that they need to change.

316
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,960
And I'm pulling up and I realize, oh my God, it's six 15 shit.

317
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,560
And I pull up and I really innocently, I wasn't trying to pull anything.

318
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,240
I go, Hey, I just realized this doesn't work right after six or whatever.

319
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,600
And the guy at the booth goes, don't worry.

320
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
I got you.

321
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,760
And I went, Oh, really?

322
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
Thank you so much.

323
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
That's really nice.

324
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,960
And he goes, you do podcast the ride, right?

325
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Wow.

326
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,800
And I go, Oh, I do do podcast the ride and he goes, he goes, yeah, cool.

327
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,040
I think he said, I hope he's listening and I didn't get his name.

328
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,800
I should have gotten his name, but there's, you know, his name is hero.

329
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,880
And he said, I think he said, love that.

330
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,600
And then he gave me the parking and off we went into city.

331
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:42,800
You toil with no reward, with no light at the end of the tunnel, days and years of misery.

332
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,160
And then finally it all picks up.

333
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,080
And then I had to cause Noah was in the car.

334
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,960
I turned, I turned to my daughter and I go, daddy was just recognized and we got free.

335
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,560
I told her what had happened and she was, what did she say?

336
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,560
Oh my God.

337
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,640
She said, she made a noise or something.

338
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,000
I was going to say there was more than that.

339
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You're lying.

340
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
No, no.

341
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,560
She said what she had been saying for like 20 minutes.

342
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,600
Me, me, me, me, me, me, honk shoe.

343
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Me, me, me, me, me, me.

344
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Was that us?

345
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
She's sleeping.

346
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
That's sleeping.

347
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Yeah, she was dead asleep.

348
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,120
That's the second time that you've said honk shoe out loud and I had no idea what you were

349
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,120
talking about.

350
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,120
You don't know honk shoe?

351
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
I guess I don't know.

352
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,640
It makes sense to me as a, as a verbalization of the snore, but I hear it in and of itself

353
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,760
and I don't know what it means.

354
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,080
I never thought of that as that.

355
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,120
I always thought of it as like, that's always the noise I heard.

356
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:36,040
If I had to spell it out, I would say like, like snort and then like, few, I guess.

357
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,160
No, I think, I think making it the stiff phrase honk shoe is more confusing to me.

358
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
Who made that up?

359
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
I don't know.

360
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,160
I just spread it.

361
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,680
Another hero, a different hero.

362
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,680
So Charles Fleischer.

363
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,440
Oh, maybe I just, maybe it's from something.

364
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,440
I just didn't know.

365
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,560
One of the early Looney Tuts guys.

366
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:00,040
Well, I think it's time to unpack a topic that very well might make our listeners honk

367
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,520
shoe if we're not careful.

368
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:08,080
Or it's the, or this is an insanely dynamic topic.

369
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,080
I'm not sure.

370
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
I don't know how.

371
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,080
I can't tell.

372
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,440
My dry alert is going off.

373
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,360
However, I do find it to be genuinely interesting.

374
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,360
It is good.

375
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
I think it is interesting.

376
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
I think it is interesting.

377
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,320
And that topic is go.com.

378
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,800
Go.com broad strokes.

379
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:33,040
This is Disney's failed internet portal from the like 99 2000 dot com boom.

380
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,280
And this is something, this has been in the works for a while.

381
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,920
We've wanted to do this for a while and it came up a little bit in the mobile app episode

382
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,320
as it did honk shoe.

383
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
Was that one where I was just listening?

384
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
Was that the episode?

385
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Maybe.

386
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
I think Jess, I think it was.

387
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,600
I think Jess knew what you were talking about, but Jess knew that specific phrase.

388
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,120
It must have been nice in that time to have occasional people here who understood what

389
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,080
you were talking about.

390
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,000
As opposed to you got me here in this chair 90 percent of the time who doesn't back you

391
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
up.

392
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm 50.

393
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm 50.

394
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
There's a chance with the other.

395
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,680
50-50 I'm with him though, I feel like.

396
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,680
Something like that.

397
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,440
Because like as soon as I, even though he's goofing on me for Sip and Saunders, you know

398
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,280
this man wants the Sip and Saunders, he loves Sip and Saunders.

399
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,280
You know that.

400
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,600
He's excited to go Sip and Saunders.

401
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,720
I'm excited to check out Sip and Saunders.

402
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Right.

403
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
Of course.

404
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,600
I'm saying half the time I don't know what you're talking about and then the other half

405
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,720
I'm like right with you.

406
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,000
We have that hive mind.

407
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,840
Look, I will admit I don't know the dictionary definition of Saunder.

408
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,280
I looked this up yesterday.

409
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
Oh.

410
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,280
I think it's like.

411
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,360
You're on Google Maps for City Walk and you're looking up Saunder.

412
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,800
I think it's, let me read it or just a noun.

413
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,160
The feeling one has on realizing that every other individual one sees has a life as full

414
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,880
and real as one's own.

415
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
Okay.

416
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
I encountered that.

417
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,160
I was like, I encountered that like 10 minutes ago, five minutes ago, I looked it up and

418
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,480
I was like, that can't be right.

419
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
That can't be the name.

420
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,840
You looked it up five minutes ago.

421
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,120
So when we were talking, you were looking up the dictionary definition of Saunder?

422
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,120
Yeah.

423
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,120
Wow.

424
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,120
Because I didn't want to look stupid.

425
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,120
Jason, I called it Il Vivo.

426
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,480
I can't look dumber than that.

427
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,600
People are going to be roasting my ass for years.

428
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,640
We are having a very stupid January over here.

429
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,240
Vivo of course means live.

430
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,440
I looked that up too.

431
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,160
You're manning the dictionary over this whole time?

432
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,120
I do this every episode.

433
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,120
I look up stuff.

434
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,160
That you don't end up saying?

435
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
You're just like over there.

436
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
You just got dictionary.com open?

437
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
Yeah.

438
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
On background.

439
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
On background.

440
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,440
So Jason's got dictionary on background.

441
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,320
So you've got a complex now from doing the show where you're like, oh my God, they're

442
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,480
going to ask me what Saunder means.

443
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,160
Oh my God, they're going to ask me what Saunder means.

444
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,680
I need to know what Saunder is.

445
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,680
You're like, I'm going to look it up.

446
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,680
I'm going to play it cool.

447
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,320
If they ask me, I will know.

448
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,760
And then I'm going to do all that work and Mike's got to come out and go like, spell

449
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,760
Aero pastel.

450
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
You may as well.

451
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
A-E-R-O-S-T-A-L-E.

452
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
No, you missed a bunch of letters.

453
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,760
You missed a P, right?

454
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,760
You missed a lot of letters.

455
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,760
Oh well.

456
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,760
It just turned into an S really fast.

457
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,040
I mean, you spelled it right, but you just missed the middle I think.

458
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,040
I don't like curveballs.

459
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
I'd better go with Aero pastel.

460
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
Aero pastel.

461
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
Aero pastel.

462
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Aero pastel.

463
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,040
Aero pastel.

464
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
Aero pastel.

465
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Aero pastel.

466
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,280
I don't like curveballs.

467
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,040
I'd better with a sinker or right down the middle.

468
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
You just asked for it.

469
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
You're like, curveball me please.

470
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,040
Can I have a curveball, sir?

471
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:23,320
And I said it was going to be trouble.

472
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,840
This is how we're going to make it to the topic.

473
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,840
I don't know.

474
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,000
We should abort this episode.

475
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Let me know.

476
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
No.

477
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Okay.

478
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
We don't do that.

479
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,320
The InfoSeek heads want us to get to the top.

480
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,320
Yeah.

481
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,040
Shiver through the ghost of their body when we say InfoSeek.

482
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:43,560
Though this was on the docket on our end when I did a little, hey, what do you want next

483
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,760
year?

484
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,320
We did get a reminder.

485
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,920
The people once again demand go.com from the great Milschneff.

486
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,940
Thank you for reminding us to do it.

487
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,320
We were on the way here.

488
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:03,800
Now what this is, as I said pre the Aero pastel spelling.

489
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,520
This is this is kind of a relic of this was Disney trying to get in to the internet in

490
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,760
the ask Jeeves dot com era.

491
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,760
Yeah.

492
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,280
In the pets dot com era.

493
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:22,000
The first time that the internet was big money stock market wise and everybody all these

494
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,600
corporations are trying to figure out what their strategy is.

495
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,440
And this was their strategy.

496
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,560
And it was a weird flawed strategy as we will get into.

497
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,200
But I wanted to say all that really quick just to say.

498
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
All right.

499
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,200
Does this seem like kind of a weird relic?

500
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,160
Is this a thing from 25 years ago that we're talking about just arbitrarily?

501
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:46,080
And I would say no, because go dot com has a very day to day relevance.

502
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,980
And I will do a little exercise with the listener.

503
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,920
If you don't know this already, I would say to the listener, why don't you go to your

504
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
browser?

505
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:01,440
Why don't you type in Disneyland dot com or Disney world dot com and see what happens?

506
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,680
I'll wait to click the click.

507
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,120
You got to improve your Wi-Fi, but that's taken a while.

508
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,760
I'll sonder while you're having that page load.

509
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
You got to do that.

510
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,800
And remember that all of our listeners have their own internal lives that are bussing.

511
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,040
Every day I'm sondering.

512
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Every day.

513
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
I'm sondering.

514
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
OK.

515
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,560
Now that you've sondered, people have maybe if they didn't already know this, realized

516
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:31,040
that in trying to type in the simple should be one of the most iconic URLs in the world.

517
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:38,200
Disneyland dot com and you have been rerouted to Disneyland dot Disney dot go dot com.

518
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
Right.

519
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,600
Now, I say this like this is new to some of the audience and maybe it is.

520
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:50,120
But if you're versed in these things, if you've tried to do any of the, you know, of getting

521
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,220
tickets and reservations or hotels or any of that, or even if you just been in the app,

522
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:01,820
you might have found yourself in Disneyland's mobile app and then you get sent far away

523
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,980
to the hinterlands of go dot com.

524
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,980
I love that.

525
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,500
It just remains this bizarre rerouting that is part of the Disney Internet experience.

526
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Sorry, go ahead.

527
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,540
Oh, I was going to say, I just love, you know, we talked about on the app episode, but half

528
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:23,700
the features on the app just opens a mobile browser and sometimes you have to log in again.

529
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,700
Yeah.

530
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:29,540
Like, why didn't you just build this into a tab on the?

531
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,540
I don't know.

532
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,580
I don't know what the entirety of like how this is all 25 years ago.

533
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,820
This gets built even even older than like there's been ample opportunity for Disney

534
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:47,660
to like join the modern Internet and to like defang this strange like like this, this little

535
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:53,940
creature of go dot com, these two little letters that just like suck the life out of their

536
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,180
URLs.

537
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,180
Yeah.

538
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,180
I've never been able to do it.

539
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,180
It's strange.

540
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,180
Yeah.

541
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:03,220
I think probably it's one of those situations where every time they build something new,

542
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,900
it's like, well, the cost to completely revamp this is 100 million.

543
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,900
This is hypothetical, obviously, 100 million dollars.

544
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,640
But to just add this new thing on top of go, it's 10 million dollars.

545
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,380
So they keep making the decisions cheaper, which probably ultimately, if they had just

546
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,340
scrapped it 15, 20 years ago, they would have saved money, but they didn't.

547
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,940
And they refuse to at this point.

548
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,860
Well, it's kind of like, I mean, you hear about the Internet in general is like there's

549
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:35,140
stuff at the Internet online or at companies that's held together with tape and popsicles

550
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:42,380
or like, oh, this works because of Teddy and Teddy is retiring next year and no one else

551
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,380
knows how to do this.

552
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,380
Teddy's a guy.

553
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,380
Yeah, it's a guy.

554
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,940
I thought it was like a search engine or something.

555
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,940
No, no.

556
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,700
Just like so much is still done ad hoc.

557
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,180
So in that sense, Disney is on point.

558
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,260
Now, is this safe?

559
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,980
Is this smart?

560
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,180
I don't know about that.

561
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,180
Safe is an interesting quote.

562
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:08,100
You're saying like, is Disney more at risk of being hacked or we all, any of us who put

563
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,740
our information and dare I say, our credit cards on Disney's website?

564
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:18,220
Are you suggesting, Jason, that there might be that we're all at risk day to day due to

565
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,260
this go dot com?

566
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,020
Well, I just these holes on the Internet in general.

567
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:26,700
There's been so many data breaches at these big companies.

568
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,980
Credit cards get leaked.

569
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,140
The government gets breached sometimes.

570
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,340
Social Security numbers get leaked.

571
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:38,860
Yeah, I feel like once a month I get a letter of like, here's complimentary, you know, ID

572
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:45,740
theft tracking because like a gym you went to years ago got hacked.

573
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,100
Sure, sure.

574
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,020
Well, I you know, I can't speak to that.

575
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,780
I don't know, you know, is go dot com safe?

576
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,780
I don't know.

577
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,300
But was go dot com successful?

578
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,540
I would say no.

579
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:02,740
Was go dot com the path to Disney making a big splash on the Internet?

580
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,100
It absolutely was not.

581
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:11,740
No, it's a strange, odd history and which I guess we can sort of go through here.

582
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,780
I mean, to do this, you have to go back to a time and this might be a time before a lot

583
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,620
of listeners even remember.

584
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,660
And I don't know how well I'm going to explain this, but the word portal, I hadn't thought

585
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,660
about the word portal.

586
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,660
Oh, yeah.

587
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:28,580
But this was very this was, you know, when we were having our Internet awakenings, it

588
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,580
was always OK, we were aware of the Internet.

589
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,580
The Internet's here.

590
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,100
They had those those dial up sounds.

591
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,100
Those were crazy.

592
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,860
You pick up the phone and we're going, is there a monster in the phone?

593
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,860
What's this?

594
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,860
It was wild.

595
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,300
You had to be there.

596
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,660
Oh, you know, you're a 90s kid.

597
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,260
And anyways, like it seemed like a lot of the right.

598
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,260
There's money in the Internet.

599
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,860
So there's a there's a there's a gold rush here.

600
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:56,460
And a lot of it was like, could you be not a controller of the pipes?

601
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,780
But I still don't understand why this was the case, but like to get on to the Internet,

602
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:06,660
you probably went through some weird, I mean, these portals, although Yahoo is different

603
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,660
than like prodigy.

604
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,820
This is where it gets confusing for me, like because those are like programs.

605
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,500
Get on the Internet via prodigy, or AOL really won that.

606
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,420
But AOL is also considered a portal.

607
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,420
I don't know.

608
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:23,020
The point is there were these like four things that were like your first stop on the Internet

609
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,020
originally.

610
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:30,620
Yahoo was a big one that Disney tried to make a relationship with, but it kind of fell apart.

611
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,620
Yes.

612
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,620
Yeah.

613
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,580
So and this and I think that the notion was there's money in these because like, hey,

614
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,660
you got to start your Internet journey somewhere.

615
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:44,140
And if you start on one of these, whether it's a website or a full like program that

616
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:49,860
you enter, you know, it's your gateway to all of these like chat rooms and like little

617
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,860
subgroups.

618
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,180
And, you know, there's article, there's content in these places, but then also it's places

619
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:00,220
for advertisers to sell their wares and make it's like, how is anybody going to make money

620
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,220
off the Internet?

621
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,380
Well, through these portals, I guess, was the original idea.

622
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,980
Similar to now, things I think kind of ended up at like, if you're going to go online,

623
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,380
you're going to start at one of five programs or apps or whatever.

624
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,380
Right.

625
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,860
Kind of like went back to that.

626
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:18,460
But kind of before Google just sort of threw down, like, well, it's us.

627
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:23,960
I just remember when I was like, I like, Mom, Dad, did you know we don't need AOL to get

628
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
on the Internet?

629
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,500
I remember I had this conversation with my parents at one point.

630
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
Yeah.

631
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,500
Like that blew my mind.

632
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,380
You're paying $30 a month for CDs.

633
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,380
Right.

634
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:37,900
If we don't have this CD, we can't, then we don't pay this company to hear those sounds

635
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,620
because if we don't hear, you've got mail.

636
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,060
If we don't hear goodbye, that means we're still on the Internet.

637
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,380
Well, yeah, you are still on, you can always be on the Internet.

638
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:52,260
Even more specifically, you didn't need AOL to be on AOL Instant Messenger.

639
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,580
Well, yeah, of course.

640
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,580
Yeah, yeah.

641
00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:00,580
That was the main, I feel like the main draw for me with AOL.

642
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,900
After like six months it was, because initially I was so excited about AOL.

643
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,980
You go in the DC portal, the Marvel portal, and you click on stuff.

644
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,580
I don't even know that it was anything that cool there.

645
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,220
It was just like, oh my God, you're loading photos of characters.

646
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,900
It was reduced color photos of Green Lantern.

647
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,900
Right.

648
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,700
It was a photo of Green Lantern that didn't have the bitmap data it needed to make the

649
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,020
green extra green.

650
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,020
Uh-huh.

651
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,000
And so, yeah, I don't remember why.

652
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,980
Maybe they like chats with the creators once in a while or something via that.

653
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,460
If you go on at a certain time.

654
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,300
But yeah, after a while somebody was like, hey, no, you don't have to have it anymore.

655
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,660
And I came home with this information and I presented it to my parents.

656
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,660
What are they saying?

657
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,660
I think they went with it.

658
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,660
I forget.

659
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,660
Yeah.

660
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,660
If it's a cost saver.

661
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,660
Yeah.

662
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,660
Yeah.

663
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:51,820
Well, that may be what pulled down AOL generally, because in all of that, what I was just doing

664
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:56,500
in painting the picture of the Internet era that we're talking about, there weren't a

665
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,540
lot of mics out there, enterprising mics figuring out that you don't need the CDs.

666
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,380
AOL was doing huge in the stock market.

667
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,340
Yahoo was huge in the stock market.

668
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:12,540
So for Disney, it became, how do we have more of a presence online than just Disney.com?

669
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:17,300
Do we have to partner with one of these places or should we build our own?

670
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,300
Yeah.

671
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:26,100
And from what I remember in the Disney war book, buying EBC, the network EBC, and buying

672
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:33,980
Infoseek, which would be a part of Go.com eventually, were sort of like the later Eisner

673
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:39,420
era, like everyone going like, oh God, what are we doing here?

674
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:46,220
But I think his instinct for we should have a portal was correct in a sense.

675
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,220
Yes.

676
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:53,180
And down the line, even more correct because like, well, Comcast owns television networks

677
00:28:53,260 --> 00:29:00,660
and a movie studio and a theme park and this and that and the other thing.

678
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:05,460
AT&T used to own Warner Brothers and they became a lot more symbiotic.

679
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,460
Sure.

680
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,460
Sure.

681
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,460
Yeah.

682
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:15,500
Well, and he apparently, apparently Eisner once said, we'll never do cable.

683
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,460
We will never be part, that's never going to be part of our business.

684
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,180
And then they had to scramble and do cable.

685
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,500
So I think, so he didn't want that to happen again.

686
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,340
So like we have to have a solid internet presence, but how are we going to do it?

687
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,340
And thank you for name check.

688
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,340
So Disney war.

689
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,460
I want to just really quickly name check a couple of things because I have a bunch of

690
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,820
screenshots from books.

691
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,580
So if I just read passages, I'm not stealing it.

692
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,540
Disney war by James Stewart is one, if you want to read about this stuff without a bunch

693
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:46,700
of jokes in the way and a bunch of Abercrombie talk at the top, you can go to these books

694
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,460
in your local library.

695
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,460
The audio book of Disney war is very good if you would still like to listen to the dry

696
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,460
facts.

697
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,460
Great.

698
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,460
Great.

699
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,840
Uh, Disney war by James Stewart is one, uh, uh, keys to the kingdom.

700
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,380
How Michael Eisner lost his grip by Kim masters.

701
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,300
I mean, I have half a mind to burn.

702
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,300
I know.

703
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,300
It's upsetting.

704
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,300
I don't even lie.

705
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,700
I didn't like having it in my presence, but I washed my hands after turning every page.

706
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,380
But then, then now let's get back to bit.

707
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,940
Let's let's get back to, you know, wholesome good literature.

708
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:21,500
And I will occasionally reference Eisner's book himself, uh, work in progress camp, uh,

709
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,500
not camp.

710
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,380
Camp is a, we got to get to camp in 2025.

711
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,420
What have we, uh, year after year and we aren't making it to his book about his childhood

712
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,420
camp.

713
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:36,460
Uh, um, anyway, so, but I wanted to credit those books, uh, because I'll be reading little

714
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:41,940
passages from them here and there, uh, including this one from Disney war.

715
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,820
This is important backstory with the rise of personal computer and internet access.

716
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,140
Eisner had become a voracious user of email.

717
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,140
That's what I like about it.

718
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,500
He's on the cutting edge always.

719
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,140
This guy used email.

720
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,780
You think every seat, you think Sumner used email?

721
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:01,740
Uh, no, he was like, it was printed out for him and laid on, laid onto a naked woman's

722
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:08,380
body page by page and he would read as incentive for the pages to come off so he could look

723
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:15,660
at her, at her bare body, uh, but I assume, uh, uh, it's

724
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:20,220
speed and convenience perfectly fit his impulsive personality, especially when he was suffering

725
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,220
from insomnia.

726
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:27,780
So you see, I email for Eisner, this is, this gave him a way to work even more, to always

727
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:31,140
be, will always be tinkering with the Disney company.

728
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:36,340
Um, but what this led to was like, Disney needs to not only have an internet presence,

729
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:40,120
we have to like be the main internet presence.

730
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,320
So, uh, a bunch of people came on board to, to, uh, you know, consult on this situation

731
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,360
and they all told Eisner, what we should do is buy an existing website or partner with

732
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,880
one of the main, so like, like we would recommend Yahoo for the money that we have allotted

733
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,880
for this.

734
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,000
Uh, we, we think that we should partner with Yahoo, buy a big steak in Yahoo and that's

735
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,680
how we will have a big internet presence.

736
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,840
And Eisner said, no, we need our own.

737
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,240
Why would we do it from the ground up?

738
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:14,480
And what he would point to is, we didn't let Marriott, uh, you know, run all over Disney

739
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,920
world and build a bunch of hotels.

740
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,960
We built hotels our way.

741
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:23,400
We built the beautiful Swan and Dolphin and, uh, uh, we can't just do that on the internet.

742
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,880
We need the Swan and Dolphin of the internet.

743
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,400
Um, so lots of advisors, all Michael Graves in here.

744
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,400
Yeah.

745
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Yeah.

746
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
Make him do it.

747
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
He can design a building.

748
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
He can design a webpage.

749
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,720
Um, anyway, uh, and sorry, I'm like, I'm ducking all around these new, I feel free to

750
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,520
interrupt with less dry things.

751
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,160
It just feels like the current situation with streamers, with, uh, streaming services where

752
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,960
every, every company made the same, well, we have to have our own.

753
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,040
And then it's just destroyed half of them.

754
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,040
Yes.

755
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,040
Yeah.

756
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,360
And what that led to in almost every case was like, we need our own.

757
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,680
It's got to have a name that's snappy, a simple, a name that the, that Gen Z will get by because

758
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,240
you see they stream, they don't even watch cable.

759
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,360
This is what a report that I read told me about them.

760
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So here's $500 million to figure out what our name is.

761
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,480
And then it was just all plus and max everywhere I just landed on plus and max.

762
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,600
If you, uh, speaking of current things, like I would advise everyone, take a moment.

763
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:30,800
We already sent you to Disneyland, disneyworld.com type in go.com now and do that myself.

764
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,680
It is, um, it's hanging in there.

765
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:42,280
It is a long, like basic HTML list of, it's just text.

766
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,280
It's just text.

767
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,120
It's like a GeoCities website.

768
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,520
It'll say like endless scroll.

769
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,080
It's promoting projects from 2023, just text without a photo.

770
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,280
Loki season two, the God of mischief returns October 5th in season two, which picks up

771
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,520
in the F when Loki finds himself in a battle for the soul of the time variance authority.

772
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,840
No photo of what the time variance authority is.

773
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,840
Why would you need it?

774
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,960
It's just a text webs.

775
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,280
That's very strange.

776
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280
Wow.

777
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,960
It's still hanging in there.

778
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,800
And like, I found this a few weeks ago and I was just like, the fuck is, why would you

779
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,800
the top?

780
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,800
They don't update it.

781
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,200
I don't think, because the top thing here at the top of 2025 under Walt Disney pictures

782
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:27,480
is wish, wish Asha, a sharp-witted idealist makes a wish so powerful.

783
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
That's it.

784
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,880
I still, I don't know what wish is.

785
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,880
What's about Asha?

786
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,840
It's about now.

787
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,840
Yes.

788
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,840
You're right.

789
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,840
I do know it's about Asha.

790
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:43,760
Haunted Mansion 2023 is at the top of, so go.com, the entire, it's all built around just like

791
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,760
a tree website.

792
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,880
That's just a list of things that they were doing in 2003.

793
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:54,640
Like why wouldn't you just put in a redirect to send you to Disney.com?

794
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,960
Like I don't know, this is strange.

795
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,520
And still all of their presence serves to send people to this.

796
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,920
It's kind of beautiful.

797
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:11,400
It's kind of a beautiful postcard from early internet, but with the content of two years

798
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
ago.

799
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,280
This is one of the most dynamic things I've ever seen on a corporate website.

800
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:21,040
20th century studios, enjoy all your favorite movies from 20th century studios.

801
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,360
This is, how much does that, how much did what I just read, how much does that cost

802
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,000
Disney every year?

803
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
10 million dollars.

804
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:32,000
You know, Disneystore.com though is not go Disney.

805
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Interestingly enough.

806
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Really?

807
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,240
So they are not every facet of the company is all tangled up.

808
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,280
Because shop Disney is now Disneystore.com.

809
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,680
Shop Disney is no more.

810
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,560
Shop Disney is no more.

811
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,800
It's Disneystore.com, but not go.com.

812
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,840
This is now, all of this is pointless, right?

813
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,040
But isn't it ultimately, it's like, it's at least a job creator that like there's people

814
00:35:54,080 --> 00:36:00,640
who've spent entire, their entire lives just like shuffling assets from here to there.

815
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,000
And is that a good job?

816
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,160
Is that a worthy job?

817
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,800
Maybe not, but it is a job and you know, and the cleaner these things get, then you don't

818
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,720
have people to be the janitors of the internet.

819
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,880
Just like pushing around assets with a broom, never landing them anywhere satisfying, never

820
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,720
fully getting them in a trash can.

821
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:25,840
I bet, I bet like major banks that everybody uses have similar infrastructure to this.

822
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:32,000
I get the sense that like, even like you would be shocked at like what old ass system banks

823
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,440
are built on top of.

824
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:39,800
If you just put, put the right code into bankofamerica.com, you'd go, oh, I have access to everyone's money.

825
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,800
Yes, it's possible.

826
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,000
Like I think hopefully it's better than go.com, but I think there's a lot of this going on

827
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,360
with stuff that was what internet 30 years ago, it's built on the top of it.

828
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,360
Let me go back to Eisner stuff.

829
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,400
I forgot about this.

830
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,320
So they said, why don't we just partner with Yahoo?

831
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,240
We'll buy a bunch of Yahoo and that'll be the strategy.

832
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:04,280
And he said, he not only rejected the Yahoo proposal, but also seemed annoyed by it.

833
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,720
Why do this with anyone else?

834
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,040
We'll do this ourselves.

835
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,240
He derided the person who presented that plan and his team as wimps.

836
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,240
Wimps.

837
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240
Wimps.

838
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
Yeah, geez.

839
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:24,480
So not only, he's not only like doggedly determined, he's insulting anyone who says otherwise.

840
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,480
What a man.

841
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:32,520
Why don't you go home and fail to get it up to have sex with your wife?

842
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,240
That's clearly an idea from the brain of somebody who doesn't have what it takes to pleasure

843
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,240
the woman they love.

844
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,500
Doesn't have a thick, firm erection whenever he wants.

845
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:45,380
By the way, we shouldn't partner with Viagra.

846
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,900
Disney should have its own erectile dysfunction pill.

847
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:53,520
I'm trying to think which character is associated with that.

848
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,520
That occurred to me too.

849
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,520
I couldn't think of a good one.

850
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,620
The old mill.

851
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,860
It's got to be something strong and trustworthy and a brand that people remember.

852
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,860
Chernobog.

853
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:09,780
Side effects of Chernobog may include rage, calling people wimps in meetings.

854
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:16,140
Do not take Chernobog if you've experienced low blood pressure, heart conditions.

855
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:20,620
If you're allergic to hellfire, do not take Chernobog.

856
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:24,380
So anyways, then they do something called the Digital Future Summit.

857
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,580
Eisner listened to various strategies, including, hey, maybe you could buy one of the, how much

858
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,580
did that cost?

859
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:33,180
All right, here's a hundred million dollars to host the Digital Future Summit.

860
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,180
Hmm, very good.

861
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,460
No, I think you're all wimps.

862
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,300
I think we will still build our own.

863
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:43,660
Now they did own a stake in something called StarWave, because StarWave is how they built

864
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,340
the ESPN and ABC websites.

865
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:54,060
So then they combined StarWave with buying a bunch of, 43% of something called InfoSeq.

866
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:59,860
And they mashed up StarWave and InfoSeq, and instead of calling it StarSeq or InfoWave,

867
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:04,940
which would still be viable, we should buy those URLs if they don't already exist.

868
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:09,060
But that became, all right, we will technically, all right, we'll start with something.

869
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:13,220
We'll mash these websites together, but other than that, we'll build it from scratch.

870
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:18,540
InfoSeq apparently was the third most popular internet search engine after Yahoo and Excite.

871
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,380
There's one that's lost to the sands of time.

872
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,380
Yeah.

873
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,380
How the hell is Excite?

874
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:26,780
Created by a man who came on my radar during COVID.

875
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,780
Yeah, here we go.

876
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,780
You know what we're talking about?

877
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,780
Steve Kirch.

878
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,780
Steven Kirch.

879
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,780
Steve Kirch.

880
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,780
Kirch.

881
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,780
Kirch.

882
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,820
The guy who did Excite?

883
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,820
InfoSeq.

884
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,820
InfoSeq.

885
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,820
Oh, oh yeah.

886
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,820
I missed this name.

887
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:45,980
He turned into a rabid anti-vaxxer and a guy who would challenge people on planes, would

888
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:51,700
post photos of himself on planes, challenging people on the internet to a vaccine contest

889
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,700
of some kind.

890
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,700
Vaccine contest.

891
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:59,420
Or data, I wouldn't say that, but data, and you'd look at some of the stuff, I'm so out

892
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:03,740
of my mind, I would fall, he would be in spaces on Twitter and he would be arguing with data

893
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:09,060
with doctors, and you're like, he clearly just lost his mind, and he's still going.

894
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,740
This is his number one pursuit right now is anti-vaxx.

895
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,900
Did you have to go into spaces to absorb this material?

896
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,820
Well, spaces, yeah, you'd have to click on listen to.

897
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,820
I would listen to it.

898
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,820
But you don't have to sign up for anything for spaces?

899
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,820
No.

900
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,820
No.

901
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,820
You can just get out.

902
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,820
I still might say-

903
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,820
I don't think I've ever purposefully gone to spaces.

904
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,820
That's what I was going to say.

905
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:32,500
I think, Jason, if you agree with me, I think that even clicking on spaces once is indication

906
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,500
that Mike has lost his mind.

907
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:40,900
I have watched clips of spaces, and it's usually like, look at this dumbass, and it's Elon

908
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,900
or-

909
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,900
Well, it's his alter ego.

910
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,140
His alter ego, who is a guy, quote unquote.

911
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:51,140
I don't want to ask a guess, but HB1 is a guy named Adrian-

912
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,140
Adrian Ditman?

913
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:57,740
Yes, and Adrian Ditman will post like, man, Elon's kids must love him.

914
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,740
He'll post the saddest shit.

915
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:04,980
The most powerful people on earth all have false personas, like Trump's fake secretary.

916
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,980
Yes.

917
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,980
God.

918
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,980
The guy.

919
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:14,180
Steven Hirsch, notable, made a bunch of money selling Infoseek to Disney, is one of the

920
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:19,060
people credited with the invention of the optical mouse.

921
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,060
What's the optical mouse?

922
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,060
Not the ball mouse.

923
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,060
Not the ball.

924
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,140
Rich, because remember when you first had a mouse and it was like, you would get shit

925
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,540
in there, dirt, and you'd have to clean the mouse ball out?

926
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,540
Oh, sure, sure.

927
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,340
Oh.

928
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:34,020
Light, yeah, optical mouse, but other people were working on it, so it was like simultaneous

929
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,020
inventions.

930
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,020
Okay.

931
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,020
And then-

932
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,140
So does he make money when we buy an optical mouse or no?

933
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,140
Good question.

934
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,140
I don't know.

935
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,140
I don't know.

936
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,140
It's unclear.

937
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:47,500
There's a long interview with him from like 10 years ago on YouTube, but that would be

938
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,420
before all the COVID stuff.

939
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,660
It seemed like he started with good intentions with COVID.

940
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,660
He seems-

941
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:59,700
Bunch of money into research and other scientists and doctors, and then he started complaining

942
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,060
about like the vaccines will make you infertile.

943
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,660
Oh, and he's like a hydroxychloroquine guy.

944
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,660
Oh, boy.

945
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:10,060
He's got, let me just say this, bad vibes when you look at him.

946
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,060
Oh, yeah.

947
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,060
Yes.

948
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,060
That's a, no, that's like a-

949
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,060
Snapped.

950
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,060
Yeah.

951
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:19,500
That's like you like have hypnotized somebody and then you like say the key word again and

952
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,860
marker, and then you say marker and snap your fingers.

953
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,060
Yeah.

954
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,540
And then the guy goes into that mode.

955
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,540
Oh, no.

956
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,660
So anyway, he got a lot of money from Disney.

957
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:34,620
He gave a woman on a first-class Delta flight a hundred grand to remove her mask for the

958
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,580
entire flight and she refused.

959
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,580
That's what I should have said.

960
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,580
Yes, yes.

961
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,580
Yes, that's right.

962
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,060
He was like challenging people to take their mask off.

963
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,420
I just like, I don't know.

964
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:49,140
So Disney essentially, Disney paid this person that hundred thousand dollars and then much

965
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,140
more.

966
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,820
Michael Eisner handed him a bag of cash.

967
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,100
And yet, as you guys might have bumped into, this might not be the worst person involved

968
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,100
in the creation of Go.com.

969
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,100
Sure, sure, sure.

970
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,100
We got a lot of folks to talk about.

971
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,820
Yeah, there's some troublemakers for sure.

972
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,820
That's one way to put it.

973
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,900
So to go back, so all right, we're going to mash these things together and then I don't

974
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:13,700
know where the name Go.com comes from, other than it's something basic that hasn't become

975
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,740
a website yet.

976
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:21,220
And this optimistic era of it's all still ahead of us, we are going to take over the

977
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,540
internet with Go.com and the Go Network.

978
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,660
They also call it the Go Network.

979
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:32,620
And this is the period in which Eisner writes his book, A Work in Progress.

980
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:36,300
And just to read a passage, this is where he was at at that point, what he was looking

981
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,020
forward to at this time.

982
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:41,420
As we envision it, Go Network will enrich people's lives in many ways.

983
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:46,180
Call up Go Talk, for example, and you'll be able to communicate in new ways, not just

984
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:50,460
by sending messages, but by actually talking with as many as half a dozen other people

985
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,540
who are online at the same time.

986
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,540
What does that mean?

987
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,540
So you can get...

988
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,700
So it's a chat room but out loud.

989
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,420
It's an out loud chat room is what Go is going to have.

990
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,420
That's like spaces.

991
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,420
It's like spaces.

992
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,420
Oh yeah, it's kind of the spaces of it's time.

993
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,420
Twitter spaces.

994
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:10,740
Well, this seems like a great opportunity for people of all types to enter a room and

995
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:15,020
then for one person to say like, let me see your dick, can I see your dick?

996
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,860
Eisner was not thinking of that at the time.

997
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:18,860
Anyone was.

998
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:22,740
They all get reports like, just so you know, everything we're talking about here, 89% of

999
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,300
it will be sex related uses.

1000
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,940
What was ham radio like that in the old days?

1001
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:32,140
Was CB radio like that, where like people would just say dirty stuff in the old days?

1002
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:34,380
I feel like it feels cleaner because it was an old...

1003
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,620
They would say dirty stuff, but after you said a bunch of like Delta, Delta, Niner.

1004
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,620
Oh, okay.

1005
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:40,220
Well, but yeah, it would be like penis, but it would be...

1006
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,980
Delta, Delta, Niner, suck my balls.

1007
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:43,980
Over and out.

1008
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,300
Like penis had a code word maybe or something.

1009
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,300
So everything just felt a little cleaner.

1010
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,300
I don't know.

1011
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,060
He had a CB.

1012
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,300
I always thought, yeah, I always thought it was like hobby enthusiasts.

1013
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:57,180
That's if we were doing this as a radio show 30 years ago, we'll see Jason knows he's on

1014
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,180
ham radio.

1015
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,180
Right.

1016
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:05,420
He knows all the hip lingo, he's on ham radio.

1017
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:10,300
Go Shop will be designed to search out the best products and the best deals on the internet

1018
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,620
in any given category.

1019
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:16,540
And also to hook you up to a professional web shopper who will find precisely what you're

1020
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,540
looking for on the internet.

1021
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:22,460
This is, I was glad to find this because I can't find any, I can't find any literature

1022
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:25,740
that says why go.com is going to be any different than any other website.

1023
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,740
Yeah.

1024
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:27,740
They're here as specifics.

1025
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:33,380
You can enter a room of six perverts and talk to them on the phone, on the not phone.

1026
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,660
And you can get a personal shopper, which is what?

1027
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:40,820
Is that a person in the world who go drives the stores for you?

1028
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:41,820
Yeah.

1029
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,540
Or is that entirely online?

1030
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,500
And then, and do they just end up like, okay, very good.

1031
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,460
Well, thank you for these parameters.

1032
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:49,460
I'll talk to you again in an hour.

1033
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,460
And then he comes back and then like, all right, I think I found what you wanted.

1034
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:55,540
And then it's just a photo of his dick.

1035
00:45:55,540 --> 00:46:01,340
They essentially wanted to invent Twitter spaces and stitch fix like 15 or 20 years

1036
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,340
ago.

1037
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,340
Yeah.

1038
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,340
Okay.

1039
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,340
It is stuff.

1040
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,340
That's also something is the internet is unfolded.

1041
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:10,220
I found where it's like Twitter starts and Instagram starts and I go, well, Facebook

1042
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:14,300
did all this already, but like, apparently that's not how people like to absorb things

1043
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,540
all in one big like, cause it didn't make any sense to me why you would do Twitter

1044
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,540
or Instagram at first.

1045
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,900
Cause I went, well, it's like just being on Facebook, I guess, right?

1046
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,620
Cause you can post a status in there and you can post your photos in there.

1047
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:29,940
It's not how people like, people like it, you know, in one app dedicated to a thing

1048
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:30,940
in general.

1049
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:31,940
I feel like.

1050
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:36,700
Well, and how many old photos do you have like with hipstamatic filters on them?

1051
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:37,700
A lot.

1052
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,700
Yeah.

1053
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,700
I don't need Instagram.

1054
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,700
I just bought hipstamatic.

1055
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,700
Sure.

1056
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,700
Yeah.

1057
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:49,060
He also, uh, back to Disney war, this is actually, this is from his like letter to the Sherald.

1058
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:54,380
This is, this in general, because we look, we do a lot of glorifying Eisner on the show.

1059
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,380
Rightfully so.

1060
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,380
Yes.

1061
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,940
You might read what he's saying here, but the near future of the company and go, okay,

1062
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,440
well, maybe there's trouble in paradise.

1063
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:08,060
So this is, this is his outlook at the top of 2000 in January, there's Fantasia 2000,

1064
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:12,480
a remarkable continuation of a distinct Disney legacy from Memorial Day weekend.

1065
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,440
His dinosaur, which is truly like nothing you've ever seen before further down the road

1066
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,400
kingdom of the sun, which will definitely be called that and not have a contentious

1067
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,340
documentary made about it.

1068
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:28,760
And Atlantis are looking to be wonderful additions to the Disney animation legacy on the internet.

1069
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:34,400
Go.com is an exciting venture into, into an entirely new world of information and entertainment.

1070
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,120
Can what dazzle?

1071
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,880
It's a exciting world of information.

1072
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,000
What does it mean?

1073
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I don't think there was ever a vision here.

1074
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,260
And while he was right about most of that, while dinosaurs certainly is like nothing

1075
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:52,200
I've ever seen before, it was much, much cuter than anything anyone's seen before or since.

1076
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:58,440
Yeah, look, at least he never offered to pay a woman $100,000 on a plane to take a mask

1077
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,440
off.

1078
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,720
You know, maybe he was losing it a little bit, but maybe it didn't get that bad is what

1079
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,720
I'm saying.

1080
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,720
I agree on some level.

1081
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,720
Yeah.

1082
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,560
Whatever the, the Eisner's worst beliefs have not been on the record.

1083
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,560
He keeps them private.

1084
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:16,520
Can I just confirm kingdom of the sun became emperors new group?

1085
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:23,200
That is when it was a much more austere sting, a sting based project before he got pushed

1086
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,200
out of it.

1087
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,200
And his wife made this documentary.

1088
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,200
That's fantastic.

1089
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,200
Sweat box.

1090
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,200
You ever seen that?

1091
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,040
I, I can't remember if I've seen it.

1092
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,680
You know, Disney chases it down and deletes it at every turn, but it's so it's worth,

1093
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,600
I've watched it like in a tiny box in another box and another box on YouTube and it still

1094
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,760
is just as entertaining that way.

1095
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,600
It's a really great look into a messy creative process.

1096
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:51,640
That's funny because Disney plus has, I guess, waking sleeping beauty is reasonably positive.

1097
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,200
Yeah, well, that's the thing.

1098
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,000
They're all the documentaries are incredibly positive.

1099
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,200
This is like, this is things wife, Trudy Styler, correct?

1100
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,600
Making a documentary about part largely about how sting got screwed and like seeing it kind

1101
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,600
of as it.

1102
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,600
Have you seen it, Mike?

1103
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,600
I haven't.

1104
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,600
I highly recommend it.

1105
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,960
Yeah, I don't know why that's future.

1106
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,960
One of those where I go shit.

1107
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,960
Yeah.

1108
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,600
You again, you have to let you got to like search, you got to search for it and pounce

1109
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,240
on it when there is a version on Vimeo or Dailymotion or something.

1110
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,240
Right, right.

1111
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,320
Because Disney wants to make sure no one ever sees this interesting look at what it's actually

1112
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,560
like to make one of these.

1113
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,560
Yeah.

1114
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,560
It's not that bad.

1115
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,800
Like you don't see, it's not like you see Disney executives like, you know, uh, uh,

1116
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,800
using racial epithets in each other.

1117
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,880
Yeah, it's not that bad, but their brand is just so like, you just can't even anyway.

1118
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,880
It's good.

1119
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:46,280
Um, so, uh, yeah, then it became, well, what are we, who's going to run this thing for

1120
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,280
us?

1121
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,200
Uh, and there's a guy, I forget his first name, but wine bomb is the last name.

1122
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,840
This is the genius who's going to run go.com, but then he left all of a sudden to start

1123
00:49:54,840 --> 00:50:01,400
a new website, business.com, which is still, I assume what everyone does when it's time

1124
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,400
to do business.

1125
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
You go to business.com.

1126
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Business.com.

1127
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Yeah.

1128
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Did you go to it?

1129
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
You go to it.

1130
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,480
First, you go to tie.com collar.com cufflinks.com and then you're ready to go to business.com.

1131
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:20,720
This is reminding me when I had to write papers in high school, like early high school, because

1132
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,880
eventually Google slowly got dominance.

1133
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,520
But I feel like early internet, I would immediately, I was like, all right, I'm going to open one

1134
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:38,440
browser window that for Yahoo, one for SGS, one for like excite or something like that.

1135
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:44,040
And then I'll search like the Odyssey, the Odyssey, the like on all of that, like whatever

1136
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,440
the topic was.

1137
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:52,200
So like the executive brain and like just to see like, well, something give me the secret

1138
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:57,800
hidden website, you know, that does all your homework for you that would that helps at

1139
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,800
least.

1140
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,800
Sure.

1141
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:00,800
Yeah.

1142
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:06,600
So anyways, so this this guy goes and then a new guy named Patrick Norton comes in and

1143
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,920
Patrick Norton is like enough.

1144
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,480
He's one of the guys behind Java.

1145
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:17,440
So he's an Internet, you know, like they ended up with him in the Starwave merger.

1146
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,400
So here and Eisner likes this guy enough that he's touted in the book.

1147
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,600
Here's why our Internet future is bright, because Patrick Norton is with us.

1148
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:32,240
He got real estate in Eisner's book, and that's why Go.com will be a dazzling portal into

1149
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,880
Internet, into information and words, things that are never fully explained.

1150
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:42,560
Then this guy went into a chat room.

1151
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,800
Or look, look, all right, he got he got to catch a predator.

1152
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,760
This is what happened to this guy.

1153
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:53,120
Like exactly that, he entered a chat room and talked to somebody who was actually an

1154
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:57,400
FBI agent in disguise and there was a sting operation.

1155
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,720
And this guy got obviously removed from the project.

1156
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:06,200
What was notable to me about this is that it is public what screen name he used during

1157
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,320
this, which was Hot Seattle.

1158
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,440
I mean, it's interesting.

1159
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,560
I mean, maybe Seattle's pretty breathtaking.

1160
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:19,200
The Frazier guy, you know, he's just like when I hear Hot Seattle, yeah, trying to conjure

1161
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,480
the image, you know, Seattle was hot at the time.

1162
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,320
That's all I'm culturally is what I'm saying.

1163
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:24,520
Right.

1164
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,240
What do you think I meant more than that?

1165
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,000
Not temperature, temperature wise.

1166
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,280
I know, certainly not.

1167
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:29,880
Cold up there.

1168
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,160
That's what makes it an ironic joke.

1169
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,800
That's another thing I was trying to do with the name.

1170
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,200
Why?

1171
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,760
It's you're the pervert reading into the name Hot Seattle.

1172
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,120
Yeah, that's something, isn't it?

1173
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,200
Also, way to out your location.

1174
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,280
Maybe keep that quiet, not in your screen name.

1175
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:43,800
Right.

1176
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,840
There's not his address in there, I guess.

1177
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,840
Yeah, yeah, at least you left that out.

1178
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:55,120
Uh, so anyways, things are not, we're losing people left and right for various reasons.

1179
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,920
I didn't even know this other guy you said was a bad dude.

1180
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,080
Oh my God.

1181
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:00,880
Uh, all right.

1182
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:07,840
So, but then Isender finds somebody, uh, who did not end up in a shady chat room to put

1183
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:08,760
in charge of this thing.

1184
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,560
And he says, you're going to figure it out.

1185
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,840
We are going to become the, the guy's name is Bornstein.

1186
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,120
I'm sorry, I don't have the first name.

1187
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:17,600
He says to Bornstein, we are going to become the number one portal.

1188
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,000
And Bornstein's a TV guy, he's never done internet.

1189
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,600
So he doesn't, he doesn't know because it's not his world.

1190
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,720
But Isender's like, I trust you.

1191
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,520
You're good on TV.

1192
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,320
It'll, you'll be great.

1193
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,680
And, uh, so we're going to be the number one portal.

1194
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,120
Bornstein says, how?

1195
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,760
Isender says, we're Disney, we're storytellers.

1196
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,320
Is this the beginning of storytellers getting used as a deflection for any

1197
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,640
criticism you might have?

1198
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,000
Storytellers, storytellers, don't worry.

1199
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:43,560
We'll sort it out.

1200
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,240
Storytellers.

1201
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,680
This is such a funny.

1202
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,920
This is, is there any more bold example of like executive rich guy brain than

1203
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:55,880
this of just like, I don't understand anything about this, but I will make

1204
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,720
somebody else never encountered failure at all.

1205
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,680
So all I have to do is say storytellers every meeting and it'll surely get

1206
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:07,600
solved because like Walt, like it worked for Walt with Bob Gurr and creating

1207
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:12,080
ride vehicles and it works in other ways with imagineering, but this is a

1208
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,680
whole different concept.

1209
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,440
Yes.

1210
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,360
Because like, you're right.

1211
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,240
That is a good thing to compare it to because like, and this is, look, there's

1212
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:23,400
a lot of rich guys who just like point to a capable person and say, I believe

1213
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,200
in you, figure it out.

1214
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,760
And it's half motivational and half like, I don't know what I'm doing.

1215
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,520
But in that case, you did have a guy who just like a clang around with

1216
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,040
hammers and figure out a ride.

1217
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,440
How do you like, we're deep into Yahoo again, to paint the picture by this

1218
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,520
point, it was, it was on the table.

1219
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,120
AOL called Isner and said, what if we buy Disney?

1220
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,040
How about that?

1221
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,560
And it wasn't that crazy of an idea.

1222
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,880
That's how big AOL is.

1223
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,240
Yahoo is gigantic.

1224
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:48,720
Right.

1225
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,960
How are the, how is Disney just from nowhere going to go get, you're

1226
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,760
going to beat Yahoo years late?

1227
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,840
Hubris.

1228
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,760
Yeah, yeah.

1229
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,400
Story, well, by telling a story.

1230
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,280
The problem is you aren't thinking like a storyteller.

1231
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,680
If we tell the story where we're successful, then the story will be true.

1232
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,440
My favorite apocryphal like story about that of like Disney and tech is every

1233
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:17,560
time these two companies fortune swap of like Disney is going to buy Apple.

1234
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:22,080
And then Apple gets huge with the iPod and the iPhone and everything.

1235
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,240
And it becomes Apple is going to buy Disney, which I feel like is the

1236
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,680
drum beat I've heard the last few years.

1237
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:39,600
Oh God, there was another, oh, the other one from this era is like the, the, who

1238
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:44,520
knows how far it got, but the like, look, we have our own theme parks, our own

1239
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,640
hotels, why do we have our own airline?

1240
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:53,920
And then someone had to go like, look, that plane crashes in a cornfield in the

1241
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,800
mid wet, like, and there was just a smoldering Mickey head.

1242
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,920
We are screwed.

1243
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,360
And I don't even know how true that it's just like a story.

1244
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:05,880
I like that.

1245
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,320
They're not concerned about the potential human beings.

1246
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:13,760
No, that's not concerned about one piece of debris was burnt, but enough to

1247
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,360
do where it kept a clean Mickey on it.

1248
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:21,960
Storytelling has to have a happy ending, a positive, easy flight to Orlando.

1249
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,040
That is every corporation.

1250
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:28,040
That is really the calculation at the end of the day, the story telling as

1251
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,000
Brooke, the idea of like, what is the story we're telling?

1252
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,760
I don't know how many years ago at broke containment from Disney, but, but just

1253
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:41,560
hearing about like a sandwich shop or like, oh, it's an app where we pick up

1254
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:46,240
your dry, just hearing about whatever arbitrary thing is like, what is the

1255
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,640
story we're telling?

1256
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,720
It's like, I don't know, man, what do you do?

1257
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:53,040
Just talk about what you do and just do a good job.

1258
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,440
Please.

1259
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,160
Everything's breaking and everything's expensive and horrible.

1260
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:58,920
Yeah.

1261
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,680
I, yeah, I don't know.

1262
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,840
Well, he, so he was, this is another thing.

1263
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:10,320
Eisner was a pioneer is just saying the word story and running out of the room.

1264
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:11,560
Tell a story.

1265
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,720
What he's gone.

1266
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,960
Uh, it was so much more style than everyone else.

1267
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:21,320
So when all of this, I still have never really now go.com does is built in all of

1268
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,040
this time.

1269
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:22,400
Yeah.

1270
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,400
Did you guys have any sense of what the hell was going on on go.com?

1271
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,600
Did you poke around any iteration of go.com?

1272
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,360
I mean, very little at the time.

1273
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,920
Yeah, I've seen the old versions.

1274
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:38,600
Jane had a very positive memory of going to disney.co.com because like, I think the

1275
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:43,240
top menu bar at the top of the web page was a little monorail doodle.

1276
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:49,040
There was a little monorail graphic and then there was a game like you could play.

1277
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:57,000
Uh, where stitch, oh no, where you would play and stitch would be making sandwiches.

1278
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:02,400
And my old man, Jason was just like, you mean like burger time?

1279
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:03,600
Oh yeah.

1280
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,920
For the stitch made sandwiches.

1281
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:09,360
You had to catch the sandwich ingredients or whatever.

1282
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,400
And you didn't play this too wild to make a sandwich.

1283
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,800
That seems like more patients.

1284
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,320
Well, yeah, but he gets hungry.

1285
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:15,840
You know?

1286
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:16,080
Yeah.

1287
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,480
But I was, I was stitched.

1288
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,760
I just eat all the ingredients.

1289
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:23,920
I can't picture him like, all right, then mayo and three leaves of lettuce.

1290
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,880
What would it sound like if he was Jason?

1291
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,400
Hand me that sourdough.

1292
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,400
Yeah, that's right.

1293
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,560
That was one of the better stitches.

1294
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:34,160
Yeah, it was.

1295
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:34,440
Yeah.

1296
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:34,720
Yeah.

1297
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,320
Oh, nice.

1298
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,920
So, you know, so we've talked about hundreds of thousands or hundreds of

1299
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,520
millions of dollars spent and the only positive thing anyone's had to say, or

1300
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:48,840
any, even one specific memory is there is a flash game where stitch made sandwiches.

1301
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:49,560
Right.

1302
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,560
So that's good.

1303
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:51,520
That's nice.

1304
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,440
I did poke around.

1305
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,400
I went to the old internet way back machine and I found some old iterations

1306
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:02,480
of go.com and I was thinking like, well, I just want to see what it looked like.

1307
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,320
And there was a weird, they were doing like just tortured, like, okay, like how

1308
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,360
do they make it Disney?

1309
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,560
How do they make it cute?

1310
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,680
And it will be, it is like the go is done and like the Walt font.

1311
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,080
Right.

1312
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:17,520
Oh, that's probably because the original logo was like a green light, but then

1313
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:22,240
they got sued by a different website called go to.com.

1314
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:28,560
It's my favorite detail when someone like doesn't take the 10 minutes to double

1315
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:33,520
check, like, Hey, before we go full steam ahead, let's make sure this doesn't

1316
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,400
already exist.

1317
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,640
Well, I, you know what?

1318
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,920
I saw the diff, the logos I was watching.

1319
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,920
So I forget what YouTube and I was like, it doesn't look so close to it.

1320
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:41,600
Really?

1321
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,080
Yeah.

1322
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:46,000
It wasn't so I don't have an image of the original go.com logos.

1323
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:46,960
I can't really place it.

1324
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:53,120
All I know is that where they landed with this very Disney writing go and then

1325
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:57,120
like a yellow circle around it and it's all on top of orange is very ugly.

1326
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,480
Yeah, it's terrible.

1327
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,080
Bad enough that I thought it was fan made.

1328
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:07,680
I encountered it enough times where I was like, okay, I guess this is legitimate,

1329
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,480
but I thought it was just a fan thing.

1330
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:15,360
There's a good video on YouTube by Rob place that kind of sums this all up in a

1331
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,400
few minutes.

1332
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,960
I'll shout out this video by midway to main street, which I did not know this

1333
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,680
channel, but this is the, this is the, the go network logo.

1334
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,880
Uh, and then it's like a Sesame street.

1335
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,520
I mean, I guess it's, I don't know.

1336
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,360
It's a green, green circle.

1337
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,840
Goto.com got there first.

1338
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:36,160
Yeah, I guess, but it's not like I would have gone, Oh my God, they're ripping.

1339
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,360
Other than the fact that it's just a stoplight or a gold light.

1340
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:39,720
Excuse me.

1341
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:40,400
Not a stoplight.

1342
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,800
I just call it a stoplight.

1343
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,080
Why do you, why do you call it a stoplight?

1344
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:50,440
You know, cause you go with it, you yield as well.

1345
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,400
No one calls it, he calls it a yield light.

1346
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:52,640
Yeah.

1347
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,600
Netflix, give me 50 million for some standup.

1348
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,440
How about that?

1349
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,080
Well, I think that would have been, that would have been a

1350
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,360
standup special 45 years ago.

1351
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,800
Well, there's a market for it.

1352
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:06,560
I think for retro, retro standup special that I'm doing here.

1353
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:07,960
Why not?

1354
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:14,440
Uh, uh, well in, in my poking around this website, when I was like, okay,

1355
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:18,280
when did, when were there photos taken of vintage go.com?

1356
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:22,280
When could I look at, uh, how, how a sparkling this website was?

1357
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:28,840
Well, keep in mind that the era that it was open, uh, was, uh, when it was up

1358
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:33,040
and running and there were the most like safe screenshots of it was a particular

1359
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:39,560
time, that time being late 2001 and all again, let's do a little Simpsons.

1360
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,080
Come on, say it, Jason.

1361
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,920
What was going on that you recall in late 2001?

1362
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,040
It's very funny you said that.

1363
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:50,600
Cause as we were talking about early internet, I flashed back to, uh, the

1364
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:56,480
fall of 2001 where I, uh, was put in the, uh, elective class.

1365
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,920
One of the options I chose was called internet one second half of the year.

1366
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,480
I was in internet too.

1367
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:06,240
Now internet too was like playing around with like whatever

1368
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,440
Microsoft website designer.

1369
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:15,720
But internet one was basically just sitting fucking around online for 45

1370
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:22,840
minutes and occasionally starting a geo city, like, Oh, try making a geo cities

1371
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:29,680
page and I mostly read like Marvel had a lot of free comp, like a weird

1372
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:33,200
amount of free comics online and he's saying it.

1373
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:37,120
So wait, wait, it's very specific.

1374
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:43,120
I remember a boring morning in the second, uh, like second, third period of

1375
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:48,560
the day, internet one, taking around all the internet and walking to government

1376
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:54,440
class and in the time it took me to walk to government, the first tower of the

1377
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:59,400
world trade center was hit and by the time I was in government class, the

1378
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:05,400
second tower was hit and we saw it live in government class, government class,

1379
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,840
which he usually had CNN on anyway.

1380
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:13,000
So walking into that was a startling experience.

1381
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,400
You think you're going to just see another hour about Brittany and the snake.

1382
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,160
Sure enough.

1383
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,720
Don't get me started on the snake.

1384
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,920
That's the world we left.

1385
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:29,200
Anyway, that is, that is what like, so a lot of go.com a lot of go.com is

1386
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,480
thriving areas, them try to combine that they've committed to being a news

1387
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,080
website with also promoting Disney stuff.

1388
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,800
So like just a few clicks away, like, all right, they have to, there's a big banner

1389
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:42,120
and the banner has big scary jets in it.

1390
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,200
And it says America fights back news story.

1391
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,160
U S raids can be round the clock.

1392
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,480
Al Qaeda issues call to arms.

1393
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:55,240
Then above that, check out the monster zinc movie trailer, then a few away from

1394
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:58,840
that villains layer win a billion dollars.

1395
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,280
If you dare enter the villains layer.

1396
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,240
Meanwhile, just a few ticks over.

1397
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:07,640
There is a literal villains layer and that's Osama's cave that

1398
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,880
we're trying to locate.

1399
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,720
Eisner was not like dictating headlines.

1400
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:14,160
Was he?

1401
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,400
I can't imagine.

1402
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:20,360
Well, look, you know, go.com we have to do another nine 11 story.

1403
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,000
Why can't we highlight the villains layer?

1404
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:27,000
Did I, do I need to reiterate that you can win a billion dollars?

1405
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,240
I need to be pushing the billion and let's call president Bush.

1406
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:37,200
What if whoever finds Osama is awarded the ransom of a billion dollars?

1407
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:37,920
I got it.

1408
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,680
Who, who wants to be a billionaire?

1409
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,720
Print it, print it on go.com.

1410
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:45,360
This is where this is really, this is new mythology.

1411
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,880
Ville that you could win a billion dollars.

1412
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,080
What, what is a billion dollar?

1413
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:51,280
What was that prize then?

1414
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:52,640
And what is that worth today?

1415
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:57,200
If you didn't spend your billion dollars in 2000, Oh, the inflation has

1416
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,600
been brutal on a billion dollars.

1417
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,000
Five billion, 10 billion, put all my money into villains.

1418
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:05,480
The economy was in such a turmoil post nine 11.

1419
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,360
I thought it'd be safer in villains.

1420
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:12,520
Finally got my villains settled down and the housing market crashed.

1421
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:19,960
Uh, I might, when I was looking on the way back machine, it, it snapped

1422
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:26,480
to like 2006 and they were like a first look inside Narnia and it's like, oh

1423
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:29,600
yeah, I guess, uh, the Chronicles of Narnia was coming out.

1424
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:30,040
Okay.

1425
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:31,760
Yeah.

1426
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,760
It's not all bad news.

1427
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:36,280
Well, look at this stolen fertilizer trailer found intact.

1428
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,440
And that's, that's right under the headline.

1429
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,800
Cheney war on terror on course, a dark time.

1430
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,640
And yet even in that dark time, a stolen fertilizer trailer could be found.

1431
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,560
Again, you could get Snow White on DVD.

1432
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,040
The one that started at all.

1433
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:54,280
Kind of topical as some kinds of fertilizer can be used in explosives.

1434
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:55,400
Sure.

1435
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,680
Oh, is that what it was for?

1436
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,560
In fertilizer trailer found intact by Al Qaeda.

1437
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,800
So anyways, look, this is a rough, this is a rough time in general for Disney.

1438
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,080
And this is, again, it's, I hate to say it.

1439
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:17,800
It is an era where maybe I can understand why people were reticent about, uh, more

1440
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:23,920
Eisner and doubling down on more of the job it pains me to say, but like, I

1441
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,640
understand, but they just had to give him a couple more years.

1442
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,120
And I think he would have figured it out.

1443
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:29,560
He would have sorted it out.

1444
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:29,960
Yeah.

1445
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,600
Well, then people start trying to help him figure out.

1446
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:35,280
And this new guy, Bornstein, who he said, figured it out.

1447
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,320
We're storytellers by February 2000.

1448
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,360
Keep in mind, I just, I read that letter that was like, 2000 is going to be a

1449
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:41,920
wonderful year.

1450
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:46,720
We got Fantasia 2000 and then we got go.com in February 2000.

1451
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:51,400
Bornstein gets everybody together and he says, yeah, we cannot compete and win.

1452
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,560
This is the portal strategy is a failure.

1453
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,120
We will lose.

1454
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,800
He just threw it.

1455
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,200
He threw up the white flag.

1456
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:04,840
The portal strategy was a flawed objective carried out with a poor strategy.

1457
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:09,680
He argued that we should instead just maintain websites of ABC, ESPN, the

1458
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,280
Disney channel, all the things that we do.

1459
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,720
Uh, but he knew this was corporate suicide.

1460
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:17,080
He knew he was screwed by saying all the, although to that end, I think Eisner

1461
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:21,200
did appreciate the honesty, uh, I think listened to it and did not fire this man.

1462
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:25,640
Uh, I mean, there's no one else to put on it, but like that's, that's immediate.

1463
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:30,360
That they barely made it into 2000 with a guy going, we lost 30 over.

1464
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:36,160
We lost smart enough to know that the name that I encountered, I hadn't seen

1465
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:43,000
in a while, uh, mixed in on all of this was Tom stags was tasked with some of

1466
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:43,240
this.

1467
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:48,000
And I'm, am I remembering correctly as Tom stags, the one who was in that

1468
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:55,720
photo of groundbreaking at Pandora, like Navi, the big shovels shovels.

1469
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:59,560
And then when they printed it out and put it in the restaurant, one of them had

1470
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:04,840
been photoshopped out because he was left the company because he was a guy like

1471
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:08,760
they were like, oh, he's going to be the next CEO for a while and then the stags

1472
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,840
stags is missing from the photo.

1473
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,640
I think that I know what you're saying.

1474
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:13,840
I think that's right.

1475
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:14,480
Look up.

1476
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:22,120
Cause I, why I, why I, Nick Weiger was in the running and then secretly on the

1477
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:28,960
board of directors, Bob Iger is not Nick Weiger, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Iger

1478
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,040
like kneecapped stags and forced him out of the company.

1479
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,720
Cause that was the word on Iger is that he was like, he's a very like

1480
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:38,200
politician, but he doesn't appear to be a guy who's scheming, but he is.

1481
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,800
He's like a, he's like a Leno, I think in a way.

1482
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:47,560
Just being like, uh, altering history, like photoshopping someone out of a

1483
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:51,760
picture that's already photoshopped to put giant Navi in there.

1484
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:52,680
Oh, you should find that.

1485
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,480
I, it gives me the Willie.

1486
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,240
You should see if you can find the, I think it was cause I think he was,

1487
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:58,080
he was pushed out there.

1488
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,120
I've seen his name pop up recently.

1489
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:03,160
I forget where he is now, but I feel like his name has popped up recently

1490
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,640
as a successor to Iger, like they're still floating the idea that Iger is

1491
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:08,880
going to be gone in a couple of years.

1492
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:09,480
Oh, right, right.

1493
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,000
And that maybe he could come back.

1494
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,640
I don't think it's going to happen, but I have seen his name pop up again.

1495
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,720
He's not back with the company, but we'll see.

1496
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:16,360
It's interesting.

1497
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,120
When you talked about it, when you, when you say photoshopping out like dark

1498
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:22,280
history and things that we don't want to acknowledge, that makes me flashed all

1499
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:25,680
these photos of Walt clearly smoking a cigarette where they fomented his hand

1500
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:29,040
to not be, and I wanted to, this has been on my, I've been wanting to

1501
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,600
mention this for a long time.

1502
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:35,840
This is something I observed last year, a long time ago, the last I went to

1503
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:39,480
Disneyland, actually, uh, uh, that I discovered, and I'm going to issue this

1504
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:41,160
little scavenger hunt to the listeners.

1505
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,280
See if you can figure this out.

1506
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,160
Uh, maybe you'll find something that isn't what I'm intending to, isn't what I

1507
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:51,760
found, but I know from this Disneyland visit that there is somewhere on the

1508
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,480
Disneyland park, in the parks, I won't even say it's hotel or anything.

1509
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:58,800
It's in, in one of the parks, you can find a visual depiction of someone

1510
01:09:58,800 --> 01:09:59,680
smoking a cigarette.

1511
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:04,080
Does anyone know, do you, do you have any idea where this might be, who it

1512
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:07,200
might be, a real life person, a photo.

1513
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,200
Oh, I don't want to comment.

1514
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,320
Oh, interesting.

1515
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:10,920
Interesting.

1516
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:11,280
Okay.

1517
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:15,440
There's a, a visual depiction of cigarette, of a cigarette being smoked.

1518
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:19,480
If you know what it is, reply under the episodes or send it to us somehow.

1519
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:23,360
This is a fun little Disney scavenger hunt, which I will reveal in a later

1520
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,440
episode because I've been wanting to bring this up for a little bit.

1521
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:26,320
Not a pipe.

1522
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:27,760
No, cigarette.

1523
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,200
Cause I know a pipe one.

1524
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:29,840
There is a pipe.

1525
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:30,560
Who's smoking a pipe?

1526
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:33,240
I think in Pinocchio, I thought there was a pipe.

1527
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:33,680
Oh, okay.

1528
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,480
Uh, well, I don't know in the, in the, in the, but that's like, is that somebody

1529
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:42,760
smoking a pipe as a, as in the little morality play, like it's bad that you're

1530
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:47,000
smoking a pipe in scrubbing all the cigarettes, I do think they forgot one,

1531
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,040
if not two, if you know what it is, I'm curious.

1532
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:52,040
And yeah, thank you for refraining from guessing.

1533
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,880
Is it at the cigarette stand?

1534
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,480
Is there still a cigarette?

1535
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:56,400
No, I wish.

1536
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,960
Do you wish those crowded days?

1537
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,920
Oh, you're just craving a parliament.

1538
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,480
Are you still wanting to smoke a cigarette?

1539
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:04,360
Not at all.

1540
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:06,040
No.

1541
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:07,600
How real that was.

1542
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:07,720
Yeah.

1543
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:08,840
When was the last cigarette you had?

1544
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,880
I, it was like a year ago or something.

1545
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:12,240
Okay.

1546
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:13,560
It's pretty recent though.

1547
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,520
Port of Entry is his.

1548
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:15,800
Oh, right.

1549
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,440
In Port of Entry.

1550
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:16,800
Was that it?

1551
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,760
Oh, I think right after Port of Entry, I finished the pack back in

1552
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,640
California, like one or two.

1553
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:23,400
Okay.

1554
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:24,520
But you're done.

1555
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:25,560
Yeah.

1556
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,280
I don't, it makes me feel like shit.

1557
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:28,760
Okay.

1558
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:29,600
All right.

1559
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:34,360
So anyway, I'm trying to figure out how to like, wrap up the tale

1560
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:35,560
or have I missed anything?

1561
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:39,240
Well, I think I'm, I'm lacking actually information of like when they, they just

1562
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:42,880
pulled it other than this guy saying in February, we've already lost.

1563
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:46,600
We got, we just have to like, let's just make corporate websites.

1564
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,120
What are we doing?

1565
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,560
We were never, we were never going to have a search engine.

1566
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:48,720
Yeah.

1567
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:51,840
I saw part, I mean, maybe we kind of talked about this, but like, there was

1568
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,080
an idea that they were going to get InfoSeek and StarWave and

1569
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:56,720
combine them to some degree.

1570
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:57,680
Well, that is what happened.

1571
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:57,920
Right.

1572
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:01,240
But I mean, I mean, in the sense that this was going to work in the sense that

1573
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:04,760
like, we'll take two totally different types of companies and merge them, which

1574
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:10,280
was a bizarre idea spread across the country and vastly different, like cities

1575
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:13,320
and headquarters, too many variables there for this.

1576
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:15,280
This feels like a half-ass thinking too.

1577
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,920
You're like, well, these two companies put them together and like, let's go.

1578
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:22,440
And I was going to say StarWave made like CD-ROMs and stuff.

1579
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,200
Oh, okay.

1580
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:27,200
And they made, uh, uh, there's a Muppet game they made, which I think we

1581
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,960
may have talked about before called Muppets Inside.

1582
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:33,480
Is that the one with the really ugly, weird, like full body,

1583
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,360
like the walk cycles are bizarre?

1584
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:40,040
So, but there's a Doom parody called Kitchens of Doom, which is a Swedish

1585
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:43,960
chef fighting giant vegetables, which is kind of fun.

1586
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:44,640
Yeah.

1587
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,440
I was like, Oh, this may be, I think feeling maybe mentioned, mentioned it,

1588
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:48,800
but I didn't really remember.

1589
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,800
Um, but there's a bunch of different weird stuff and it's like the

1590
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,840
Muppets are caught in the computer.

1591
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,640
And I'm like, Oh, that's maybe something we dig into later.

1592
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:57,800
Oh, good cover.

1593
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:58,640
I don't know this.

1594
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:58,880
Yeah.

1595
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:04,640
They also like this kind of like, uh, not smug, a satisfied Kermit.

1596
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,600
And maybe we haven't.

1597
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,400
I just, there's so much stuff we mentioned and I forget.

1598
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,320
Uh, but, and then there's also another thing that StarWave made, which is

1599
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:17,560
called, it's a Clint Eastwood CD-ROM, which was just like an IMDB for him

1600
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:21,040
with like, that you would just get like, see his credits and I think maybe

1601
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,560
he had a clips of his movies.

1602
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,320
I, that's something I got to dig into too.

1603
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,320
Clint Eastwood.

1604
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,160
The CD-ROM.

1605
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,800
This is like when his social media posts, like with the logo on the picture of

1606
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:37,240
like, Clinton getting ready for a shoot day.

1607
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:38,680
Uh, um, yeah.

1608
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:39,360
So, Oh yeah.

1609
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,760
I'm looking at a still from it.

1610
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:45,440
That's just like, it's, it's, it's this bizarre graphic from Bridges of

1611
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:49,560
Madison County where they're like, uh, Clinton and Merrill are

1612
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,440
Photoshopped into the landscape.

1613
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,320
Um, Francesca offers Robert a token of her love.

1614
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:56,680
This was from that other video.

1615
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:57,760
This, they, I'm winning.

1616
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,480
I've, I have, uh, I have a hundred Francesca love tokens.

1617
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,800
I'm winning Clint Eastwood the game.

1618
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:10,800
Um, cause we, we, of course did the CD, whatever the CD, uh, the cyber

1619
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:15,480
awards, uh, episode on the second game, but we really like, I was like, wow,

1620
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:18,160
we got to get back into some CD-ROMs this year, maybe two, cause there's

1621
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,560
so much funny shit that no one cares about there.

1622
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:24,080
There's some really good emulators out there.

1623
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,040
So some of these might be playable.

1624
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:26,840
Some could be playable.

1625
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:32,080
Some are even playable on the internet archive or at least saved and hosted there.

1626
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:32,520
Yeah.

1627
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:35,720
Um, Starwave also developed the first site and publishing system for Jim

1628
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,040
Kramer, Mad Money's Jim Kramer.

1629
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,400
Well, Starwave sounds good.

1630
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,680
I'm, I'm pro everything Starwave is doing.

1631
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:44,080
Yeah.

1632
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:47,520
And apparently in 2004, Disney reactivated the Starwave identity as

1633
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:52,280
Starwave mobile, which published casual games for mobile phones is on Wikipedia.

1634
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:52,600
Wow.

1635
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,240
With the mobile game, several Scarface licensed games.

1636
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:00,280
Oh, I kind of remember these as you're saying this, I kind of

1637
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,520
remember the mobile Scarface games.

1638
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,240
You kind of remember the Scarface mobile game.

1639
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:10,920
Well, I feel like that might be an offshoot of like after Grand Theft Auto

1640
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:14,560
three and then vice city were big hits.

1641
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:22,120
There were attempts to mimic the other world, some more successful than others.

1642
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:22,560
Yeah.

1643
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,720
Well, there's like, Scarface is funny too.

1644
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:28,720
Cause like they, they made Godfather games and like those, they're just seemed

1645
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:31,360
funny to me, um, but they did do it.

1646
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:34,200
So I don't, I don't know if those are playable still on mobile.

1647
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:38,640
There was a run of like, Oh, well, Grand Theft Auto is crime.

1648
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,320
You know, what else is crime?

1649
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:43,560
And everyone knows Scarface and the Godfather.

1650
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,120
Yeah, those are crime.

1651
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,480
Uh, here's a lie.

1652
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,720
Here's a Tony line that's just written in text.

1653
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,120
Hey frog face, you just messed up.

1654
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,240
You steal from me.

1655
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:53,840
You're dead.

1656
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,920
That's something Tony Montana would say.

1657
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:57,200
Yeah.

1658
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:58,520
I didn't want to go.

1659
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,800
So I'm like, yeah, well, you know, I'm in dicey territory.

1660
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:05,160
If I'm doing a Scarface, Scott does funny stuff on the show.

1661
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,960
He does this great Scarface impression.

1662
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:09,760
Yeah, that's true.

1663
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:10,360
Hey, hello.

1664
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,040
Maybe I'm just worried that I can't do it.

1665
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:12,400
Maybe.

1666
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,160
Yeah, it's a very obvious impression that I can't, when in doubt, throw it

1667
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:16,720
at Jason frog face.

1668
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,560
No, that was not good.

1669
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:19,840
You also did the thing.

1670
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,320
Wait, say it is, say it is stitched.

1671
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,280
Hey, frog face, you just messed up.

1672
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:26,560
Hey, frog face, you just messed up.

1673
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:28,040
That was good.

1674
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:28,440
Yeah.

1675
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:32,880
Frog face, a very funny and that's, that's the kind of thing.

1676
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,080
Scarface is that like a classic Frenchman?

1677
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:35,920
Take it from me.

1678
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:36,960
Scarface.

1679
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,120
You're a real frog.

1680
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,280
I'm Scarface.

1681
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:41,560
Ribbit ribbit.

1682
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:46,120
Uh, have I said, have you, you guys seen Scarface?

1683
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:47,240
I've said this on the show before, right?

1684
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:47,920
What?

1685
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,120
You've seen Scarface, right?

1686
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:49,400
Yeah.

1687
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,720
I don't think I've ever seen it all the way through.

1688
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:52,920
It's so, it's great.

1689
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,680
Um, but it's so funny cause I didn't see it until I was older too.

1690
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,640
And I was like, everybody, like there's like posters of Scarface and like

1691
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:00,880
rappers of Scarface or whatever.

1692
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,200
He's the biggest fucking loser of all time.

1693
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,800
He's a pathetic loser in love with his sister.

1694
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:09,600
Oh, we've talked about this cause good fellas is very similar.

1695
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,640
Like a lot of them are also huge losers who die or fail.

1696
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:16,960
Eventually they all die, but there, there is more, I feel like chunks of them

1697
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,640
looking awesome and good fellas.

1698
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,040
Where they're like, cool.

1699
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,760
But Scarface, I feel like he's just this pathetic loser of all time.

1700
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:23,520
And it's hilarious.

1701
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:24,880
It's so funny.

1702
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,560
And it's such a weird movie, but like, it's so funny to come out of that

1703
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,360
movie and going like, this guy's fucking rules.

1704
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,160
I get it.

1705
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:35,400
Maybe the art and the t-shirts are put up and worn by people who

1706
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,560
have not seen the movie.

1707
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,320
It's possible.

1708
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:38,520
I just pay a lot of attention.

1709
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:38,800
Yeah.

1710
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:42,760
Very similar to like, like Sopranos is very funny.

1711
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:43,360
Yeah.

1712
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:47,000
Like the college dorm room posters, just black and white.

1713
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,280
Everyone with their arms crossed, 10 bad asses.

1714
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,920
That's my takeaway from the show.

1715
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,160
Also fucking weird.

1716
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:57,840
Like uncle Juder and the kids.

1717
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,920
Anyway, recommend Scarface.

1718
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:01,400
Great movie.

1719
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:07,760
Well, look, you know, just as some of these characters have mixed ends, you

1720
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:12,360
know, it's not so clean as being the hero or the villain or having a victory or a

1721
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:16,120
loss that's sort of where Eisner lands in this, because you might hear everything

1722
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:20,720
that we said and you might chalk this up as just a massive loss.

1723
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,320
However, this is also from Disney war.

1724
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,200
They point out that in, you know, not long after that guy said, Hey, we

1725
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,240
have to stop doing this.

1726
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,160
This was a disaster from the get-go.

1727
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,760
The bottom fell out of the technology sector.

1728
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,240
The dot-com boom went dot-com bust.

1729
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:38,840
The internet segment in particular was, was hit hard.

1730
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:43,840
AOL Time Warner was especially hit hard, fully vindicating Eisner's belief that

1731
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,760
Time Warner had exchanged valuable hard assets for a grossly inflated stock.

1732
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:53,080
And it's, and as the book says, a book that is largely critical of Eisner, they

1733
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:58,280
say rebuffing an offer from AOL was arguably Eisner's best decision of the

1734
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:01,280
decade since the consequences would have been ruinous.

1735
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:01,840
Yeah.

1736
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,600
So as much as it is embarrassing that whenever you want to go to Disneyland.com,

1737
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,720
these two little letters appear that are like the ghosts of Michael Eisner's

1738
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,400
failure.

1739
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:16,000
You know, what's worse is that Time Warner became AOL Time Warner, and that seemed

1740
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,080
incredibly foolish very, very quickly.

1741
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:23,320
And Eisner had that opportunity and he said, no, he called the CEO of AOL.

1742
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,800
And he said, he probably called him a wimp too.

1743
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:27,480
He said, how dare you?

1744
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:31,920
And isn't that better if it had ended up AOL Disney and then all of Disney's

1745
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,840
built around AOL.com potentially worse.

1746
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,240
Maybe we don't have the Disney company anymore.

1747
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:41,760
Maybe go was the confusing mess that had to happen in order to retain this

1748
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,320
company, retain these parks and let us do this podcast that we do.

1749
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:49,120
He's a great man and we should never question him again.

1750
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,120
Nothing will ever take away that opinion.

1751
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:56,120
There's no story that we can dive into that will make me think otherwise.

1752
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:57,200
He tried.

1753
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:03,040
He put a Hillbillies rolling on logs in Disneyland's Lake.

1754
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,040
He tried to build his own.

1755
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:09,320
I find it confusing that you chalk that up as one of the craziest things he ever

1756
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:13,200
did was a brief promotion where there was state fair stuff.

1757
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,040
This guy was out of his mind.

1758
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,640
He had Hillbillies guys on logs.

1759
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,000
He was sick and twisted.

1760
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,160
He would do anything.

1761
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,560
He did balloon stuff.

1762
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,720
Remember in state fair, he did balloon stuff with all of our friends, with the

1763
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:29,840
guys, but these are all popular for deck and like log rolling.

1764
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,760
Log rolling is popular.

1765
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:35,520
I feel like at state fairs and stuff.

1766
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:36,040
Yes.

1767
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:39,840
Or like, this is what I do agree with Jason here that putting, taking, saying

1768
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,160
we're going to do a state fair thing and then putting a state fair thing at it is

1769
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:46,120
not particularly one of the most balls out decisions Eisner ever made.

1770
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,440
This is counterculture shit.

1771
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,680
This is fucking real counterculture shit.

1772
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:50,880
Man, Eisner was punk.

1773
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,640
Eisner is punk, bro.

1774
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,560
The traveling inflatable thing.

1775
01:20:54,560 --> 01:21:00,080
If they had just included it for free, like with your fair admission or whatever,

1776
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:01,680
probably would have worked.

1777
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:06,120
Can I put you on finding a video of this fair, this fair show with the balloons?

1778
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,680
Oh, the traveling.

1779
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,200
We need to find that video of the show.

1780
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:13,360
You guys said that it has to be a separate episode, but we need to find the video.

1781
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:14,680
We need to find the video.

1782
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:15,520
Well, I'll try.

1783
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,080
And it's in, it's in Jason's best interest because otherwise that episode is

1784
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,840
going to turn into nothing but talking about inflatable stuff.

1785
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:22,800
Right.

1786
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:26,040
Unless we have hard research materials to go off of.

1787
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,600
There's no other way that episode can go.

1788
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:33,360
But my hands, I've put my like, not on the, I'll look, I'll look the best I can.

1789
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,120
I'm casking you with finding.

1790
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:34,640
Yes.

1791
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:35,400
Okay.

1792
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,360
You're on this.

1793
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,440
You're the reporter, the cub reporter.

1794
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:39,760
There's something else that we got to do.

1795
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:44,040
And I'm going to, I'm going to keep, uh, I'm going to spread this Eisner love

1796
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:48,800
elsewhere in the Eisner family tree because I was, I was reading one of many

1797
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:53,240
articles about go.com, shutting down, laying off a lot of people, them throwing

1798
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:53,800
in the towel.

1799
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:58,280
And at the end of the article, there was a little addendum and it said this.

1800
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:04,080
Meanwhile, Eisner's son, Eric has changed his business plan at his own digital

1801
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,640
entertainment site, the romp.com.

1802
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:08,560
Is this anyone familiar with this?

1803
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:09,440
No.

1804
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:10,280
Oh boy.

1805
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:12,400
I think we were planning another episode here.

1806
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:18,640
Eisner juniors babes in animation site will begin charging a subscription

1807
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,280
for premium users soon.

1808
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:25,480
If you want the newest booty call cartoon, as soon as it comes out, you can pay

1809
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:27,960
for it, said a romp spokeswoman.

1810
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:33,280
Now I, this, everything connected for me here because I realized that, and forgive

1811
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:36,800
me, I don't know the listener who put it, but we've gotten this suggested as a

1812
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:41,280
club three topic before, and I was texted out of the blue a couple of months ago

1813
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,960
by friend of the show, Joe Quazzala.

1814
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:47,200
And he alerted me to a particular film and he led me down the rabbit hole here.

1815
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,200
And I was like, why are you telling me about this?

1816
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,680
And he said, well, you might be interested in who the director of this

1817
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,600
film is one Eric Eisner.

1818
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:57,080
And what he's talking about is a 2003 movie.

1819
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:58,600
And this has been suggested for club three.

1820
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:03,320
The movie is called Jake's booty call, otherwise known as national

1821
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:06,120
lampoon presents Jake's booty call.

1822
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:12,520
This is a flash animated based on an interactive game series for romp.com

1823
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,880
turned into a feature film in 2003.

1824
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:19,040
It's a series of 33 multi-plot animation games.

1825
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:26,440
That was turned into a feature film, uh, written by and directed by Eric Eisner.

1826
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:29,160
Eric Eisner made a flash animated sex comedy.

1827
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:32,160
This is very small for you guys in my laptop across the room, but take a

1828
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:36,960
look at the art that I give you a sense of, uh, you know, we're in leisure suit.

1829
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:42,080
Larry, it's a rip off of Larry, but with less personality, but this is, I mean,

1830
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:47,160
this era of home star runner, like flashed animation was he bombs world?

1831
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,040
Like, yeah, it was in vogue.

1832
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:49,440
Yes.

1833
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:54,320
And Eisner and the Eisner's as they are on top of every wave, just as Eisner

1834
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:58,840
knew that he, we, he, Eisner, the fan of email knew that they had to

1835
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,120
have an internet presence.

1836
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:06,120
So did Eric Eisner know that we need a animated film that's very cheap and

1837
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,720
ugly with a lot of boobs in it.

1838
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:13,520
We guys, whether club three or not, we've got to do Jake's booty call.

1839
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:16,840
We have to, there's a whole, all of the love gets put on brick.

1840
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:17,280
Yeah.

1841
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:18,160
What we're giving.

1842
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:21,760
No, I don't think I've, I mean, I knew there wasn't Eric Eisner, but I haven't

1843
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,080
thought about him almost at all.

1844
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:26,000
Eric Eisner, as much the filmmaker is his brother.

1845
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:31,640
Michael created two great filmmakers, the body of work that will

1846
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:33,280
resonate for decades to come.

1847
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,600
I declare Jake's booty call.

1848
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,200
Jason's birthday shot.

1849
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:42,800
You're, you can't call my shot.

1850
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:44,360
Why can't I?

1851
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:45,920
I don't know.

1852
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,200
That's a hell of a shot to call.

1853
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:49,960
Your birthday is coming sooner.

1854
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,120
You should call Jake's booty call.

1855
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,160
No, that doesn't make any sense.

1856
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:54,840
No, you should.

1857
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:57,600
But parliamentarily parliamentary procedure.

1858
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:02,160
You have to wait until your birthday and make your birthday shot, stealing

1859
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:06,720
Jason's birthday shot and forcing him on his birthday to do Jake's booty.

1860
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:07,080
Fine.

1861
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:07,240
Yeah.

1862
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:10,240
I was going to do a wholesome thing for my birthday.

1863
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:10,960
No, you're not.

1864
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,200
Show us boobs.

1865
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:20,520
No, the rom.com right now is just a landing that says big news coming soon.

1866
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,600
Stay tuned.

1867
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:23,720
Leave your email to be notified.

1868
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:26,240
So who knows what that is?

1869
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:30,480
Jake back over 20 years later for another booty call.

1870
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:33,160
He may have aged, but he's as horny as ever.

1871
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:33,760
Wow.

1872
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,600
Jason, could you do the voice of Jake?

1873
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:36,600
Who did the voice of Jake?

1874
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,080
I don't know anything about Jake.

1875
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:40,280
You do know a lot about him already.

1876
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:42,520
We're all learning together.

1877
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:43,400
That's the point.

1878
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:47,920
Uh, voice acting was provided by Jay Lerner and Julian Max Metter.

1879
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:48,880
Okay.

1880
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:49,920
Well, they're out.

1881
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:50,880
Yeah, they're out.

1882
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:51,560
Jason's in.

1883
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,160
Jason Sheridan, who has a bigger fan base than them.

1884
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:59,720
Yeah, this reminds me of another movie that we have not gotten to yet.

1885
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,840
The, what is it called?

1886
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,240
It's all the food mascots.

1887
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:05,920
It's CG animated.

1888
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,880
Oh, I know Charlie Tuna.

1889
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,600
I've watched that too many times for my own health.

1890
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:16,640
It's not sausage, but it's like a precursor to sausage.

1891
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:17,160
Yeah.

1892
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:18,440
It's like a less successful.

1893
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:18,640
No.

1894
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:23,600
And Charlie Sheen is a big dog man who kisses a human woman by Hilary Duff.

1895
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,160
That's a, that's a, that's a rough go.

1896
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:27,800
Yeah, that's bad, but you're correct.

1897
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:28,440
We haven't done it.

1898
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:29,560
We have not touched that.

1899
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:30,200
Teen Creeps.

1900
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,240
Did Teen Creeps do that with Oscar?

1901
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:32,680
Maybe.

1902
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:33,480
I don't remember.

1903
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,160
I feel like maybe that's an Oscar.

1904
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,640
Well, Eisner's ours.

1905
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:40,800
No other podcast is going to claim the word of the filmography of Eric Eisner.

1906
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:42,520
Step aside, blank check.

1907
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:50,320
I'm afraid you'll never cover the $50,000 blank check that was used to make

1908
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:51,960
the film Jake's Booty Call.

1909
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:56,040
It's not even that much in terms of funding of film.

1910
01:26:56,040 --> 01:27:00,760
Well, I'm sure that created a real beautiful work and I can't wait to do it anyway.

1911
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:01,280
So yes.

1912
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:03,680
Hey, shots called right at the top as it should be.

1913
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:06,240

Let's find all the cigarettes in Disneyland.

1922
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:39,160
Um, I'd also like to say that I think I, my brain was thinking of ill Devo, the

1923
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:43,200
international singing group, when I incorrectly called like one of those

1924
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:52,000
things that the mom's like, I think I was also, I like, when you said the eel, I

1925
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,600
was like, I've seen that eel.

1926
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,080
Well, I freaked you out.

1927
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:57,760
So you were ready to agree with me because you didn't want me to do anything.

1928
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,000
You don't want me to put you on the spot.

1929
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,040
I know I'm yeah, you were just like, I'm a little word, whatever you say, sir.

1930
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:04,360
Please don't call me something.

1931
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,920
You can mispronounce any of the different city walk.

1932
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:09,400
Okay.

1933
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:18,080
It's Abercrombie and oh, at the end of the episode, let's come on.

1934
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:18,400
All right.

1935
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,320
We're going to Fitch.

1936
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:21,560
Wait, what'd you say?

1937
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,360
Fitch.

1938
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:22,680
Yes.

1939
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:22,960
Good.

1940
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:26,840
Yeah, we've learned that's an ampersand.

1941
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,160
Oh, I, I don't know.

1942
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:31,080
Is it an E doesn't matter.

1943
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:31,840
They're shutting it down.

1944
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:32,520
It's dead to us.

1945
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:32,920
Okay.

1946
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,000
Fucking care.

1947
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,520
Take your ampersand and shit.

1948
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:39,080
You're that ampersand is getting in the way of the future of the city walk.

1949
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:39,720
Yeah.
