1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:26,400
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate where everybody knows your name, but we might

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,680
not use it so you don't sue us for copyright infringement.

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,560
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Jason Sheridan.

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:38,320
You know, plausible deniability is very important, although it's not always a savior.

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,160
You know, it doesn't always work.

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,800
But it can help kick the trial many years down the line.

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,800
Many years down the line.

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,920
Yeah, this is a drag out fight we're talking about today.

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,920
Mike Carlson.

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,960
Yeah, we know your name as long as it's one of those names where like thousands of people

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,120
have it, because then it's fine.

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,720
I think then it's fair game to use that in a script.

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,840
But if somebody is like a very unique name, you can't use it.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,600
It's like one syllable that's just four random words or four random letters thrown together.

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,600
You can't have a copyright for that.

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Right.

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,680
This today, we're talking about, I mean, I don't know if we're calling the episode just

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,440
Shears Airport Bar, that could be it.

20
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:20,240
But there's, you know, sometimes with these episodes where there's this odd little story

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,880
that unfolds, you want to save it and build the tension and save the turn.

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,240
But in this case, I feel like I should read what was sent to us and what I sent to you

23
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,240
guys, which inspired us to turn around an episode on it.

24
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,120
This is from this was sent to us by David Gansel at Doggins.

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,120
Thanks David.

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,340
Long time supporter of the show.

27
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,340
Thank you.

28
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,600
And this was the when we asked for second gate suggestions, he said the Shears themed

29
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,680
airport bars where they had animatronics of characters who looked like Norman Cliff, but

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,740
were not named Norman Cliff.

31
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,000
So they got sued by Winton Ratzenberger.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's that.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,600
OK, so we've put all the cards on the table, but you can see why we lit up for this.

34
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
I kind of knew this story.

35
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,440
Do you guys know about this before?

36
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,900
I feel like I've seen the photos that I saw before, but I don't know that I knew the context

37
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,900
for them.

38
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,900
Yeah.

39
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,900
Yeah.

40
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,900
Or that there was legal.

41
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,900
Yeah, I don't think I knew that.

42
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,900
I know that's funny.

43
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,900
Look at that.

44
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,120
But I don't think I did not remember what happened.

45
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,160
Because it is.

46
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,760
It's funny in and of itself.

47
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,920
It's without if there wasn't the legal stuff going on.

48
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,920
It's interesting.

49
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:36,160
It's a you know, we love the more obscure of IP as can turn into a themed experience,

50
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,160
the better.

51
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,160
And this is an obscure.

52
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,160
Obscure is not the right word.

53
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,160
It's like almost like obtuse.

54
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,920
Like how do you make a Shears themed experience?

55
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,080
It's a really weird thing to do.

56
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
They took a stab.

57
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,880
They figured something out.

58
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,880
Yeah.

59
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,880
Yeah.

60
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,880
Something I feel like it's more common now.

61
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,640
I feel like back then it was a little bit weirder to do this.

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
Well, it's common.

63
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,160
I feel like in these kind of one off pop up experiences lately.

64
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
Yes.

65
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:11,600
Or like, you know, like I was just next to the stranger things immersive experience, which

66
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,400
is built in a former Costco in Montebello.

67
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
OK.

68
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,600
I was there for some of the former Costco is a dinosaur thing called Dino's alive.

69
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,360
That's what I was there for with the kiddo.

70
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,040
But I but there was a stranger things next to that, like that kind of thing.

71
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,040
I think there's a few locations of that or there have been moved or something like, you

72
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,200
know, a very like this is clearly a promotional vehicle for something it's on now.

73
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,600
And, you know, or like that I was going to say Xavier Renegade Angel.

74
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
That's not it.

75
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
What was the movie with the James Cameron?

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,560
Oh, you know, Battle Angel.

77
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,240
That's right.

78
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,720
Xavier Renegade Angel would be a fantastic.

79
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,400
That would be upsetting.

80
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,720
Immersive experience.

81
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
Yeah.

82
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,120
Very difficult to understand.

83
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,800
Difficult.

84
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,200
Kind of interesting.

85
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,760
Like it's like, I really like the people doing this.

86
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,920
But you're like, I kind of don't get this.

87
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,840
You know, I think I might need to leave.

88
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,520
I think I might have to get out of here.

89
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:12,120
I feel like I don't remember a time before the stranger things experience.

90
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,040
I feel like I have.

91
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,520
You mean before like getting it advertised?

92
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,720
I feel like aggressively.

93
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,800
Yeah, I can't think of anything more aggressively advertised to me.

94
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,720
Sure, sure.

95
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,480
Well, you know, algorithms pick up on what you search for and what you talk about.

96
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,720
And I'm sure we're going to cause a lot of ads for it by talking about it right now.

97
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,160
Yeah, that's true.

98
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:40,640
I also I mean, Eva, Eva's been a very big proponent, participants, like follower of

99
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,160
the immersive like theater community.

100
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:49,600
And I think that word is starting to lose a lot of meaning because I think a lot of

101
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,640
cities, especially Vegas, when I follow Vegas blogs, Vegas blogs, they're like there's a

102
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,080
new immersive thing coming to resorts world.

103
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,960
There's a new immersive thing coming to shops at Crystal.

104
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,120
Like and that's the thing of the moment.

105
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,800
You know, is it is it becoming where it gets watered down?

106
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,960
Like how we all you know what we all thought the word gastropub was before it started

107
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,000
just getting applied to like quick flipped rescued version bars, you might say.

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,360
Yeah, very quickly just meant fried egg on a hamburger.

109
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,640
Regular food is one one thing kind of weird.

110
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,560
Yeah, we'll make it without that if your dad wants it to know.

111
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,360
But this seems like it's very strange in a lot of ways.

112
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,560
It's a really odd property to do something with.

113
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,440
And then and then a very strange venue.

114
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,480
Have we ever talked about anything that exists only in airports?

115
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,560
Oh, that I mean, I was I don't think so, but I'm sure it's come up.

116
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,800
I mean, Chili's too has come up and, you know, a little bit tangentially.

117
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,920
But no, we haven't really devoted much time to a big like what would even what even would

118
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
it be?

119
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:04,640
Rock and Brews kind of in a similar vein where it's like a watered down version or Trader

120
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
Vicks.

121
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,000
Scott, I think you mentioned that in San Jose and the airport, which was which was fantastic.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,520
But none of these are, you know, like it's I think it's rare even in like that Trader

123
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,280
Vicks was very open air and you could see planes over here, which you want to see.

124
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,360
That was not like stepping into fully immersive Tiki Hut.

125
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,140
Yeah, you know, like there's there's not a lot of here in the airport.

126
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:36,540
You're stepping into a room that feels like you're not at the airport, which I guess this

127
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,620
in attempting to put the bar Cheers from Cheers into airports.

128
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,420
Yeah, they were trying.

129
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,420
Yeah.

130
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,420
And I guess like an airport lounge.

131
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:50,860
I mean, I've only been in like one lounge, maybe two different airport lounges in my

132
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,980
day.

133
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,900
And that's not that's supposedly like meant to.

134
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,340
Oh, you're escaping.

135
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,020
Like you go up in the elevator and it's like, have you ever done this?

136
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,020
I think I have.

137
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,940
I think we yeah, we had some deal to do it for our honeymoon.

138
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,940
Yeah.

139
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,740
It's like you go up in an elevator and you're going into the luxurious lounge away from

140
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,380
those regulars.

141
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,860
But really, it's like a big room with some chairs and you can get like a fruit salad

142
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,620
on your plate and then like some free coffee and a Danish.

143
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:24,140
Now you say that, but I'm sure I bet in the moment you were like, wow, yes, this is this

144
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,140
is living.

145
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,140
Don't get me wrong.

146
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,300
I like doing the lounge if I can.

147
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,300
Yeah.

148
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:35,100
I have a credit card that gives you a free like lounge access to different airlines.

149
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,820
Maybe I've talked about this before and it's pretty clear that the airlines don't want

150
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,220
these card holders there because they're sometimes say like they're not you're not allowed like

151
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,900
you're not allowed in here if you have X and Y.

152
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,900
Oh yeah.

153
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,740
So like sometimes you got to like wait around and wait for like other people to leave the

154
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,260
lounge because I feel like this whatever deal they cut with Chase has flooded airport lounges

155
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,140
with just like people that aren't actually flying a ton.

156
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,140
Riff raff.

157
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:06,820
Riff raff is really non-rich people like me and riff raff like me.

158
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,700
That's not even like a big thick platinum card.

159
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,980
It's not like one of those bit, you know, or like the one that Billy McFarland made.

160
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,300
The fire festival guy.

161
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,020
What was his scam with the big thick card?

162
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,540
Was it like turning a regular card into a big thick card?

163
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,620
Something like that.

164
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,780
I will say the card that got me this other card is a thicker card.

165
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:35,900
It's one of Chase's thicker cards and I was using I'm so sure I've said before the Chase

166
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:41,100
trifecta which is having three different chase cards and optimizing them for different points

167
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,820
depending on what your purchases.

168
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,940
This was before you had an actual baby.

169
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,940
This was your baby.

170
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,940
This was truly my baby.

171
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,940
Chase trifecta.

172
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,780
Who had got all your extra hours and kept you up at night.

173
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,780
Yes.

174
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,340
Not because it was yelling at you but because you were trying to properly defeat the system.

175
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,340
Yeah.

176
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,620
The priority pass I believe is the thing that you get with it.

177
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,620
Oh, is there?

178
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,620
Yeah.

179
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,340
It gets you into certain lounges at certain times if they feel like allowing it.

180
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,340
Okay.

181
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,340
Yeah.

182
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,300
The thick card scam by the fire festival guy was called Magnus's.

183
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,420
It was a black, it wasn't issued by a bank.

184
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,940
It was just a black metal card onto which you could graft the magnetic stripe of your

185
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,940
current credit card.

186
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,700
So you had to pay $250 to get a bunch of plastic to make your card thicker.

187
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,100
It was a card thickener.

188
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,100
Wow.

189
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Interesting.

190
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,100
Today on the show, thick cards.

191
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,100
Thick cards.

192
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,660
And how to make your cards thicker.

193
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,660
Yeah.

194
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,660
Wow.

195
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:44,140
He tried to get in the like bullshit status symbol sphere by making a completely nonsense

196
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,420
like a nonsensical bullshit.

197
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,420
Yeah.

198
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,060
He would have had to go, he had to go do the other end of it too which is like, okay, so

199
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:58,900
I'll get people buying Magnus's, but then they also, I also need to convince NYC upper

200
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,580
crust to only take Magnus's or to be impressed by Magnus's.

201
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,580
I feel insane using this word.

202
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,580
Magnus's.

203
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,440
Is Magnus's, does that mean that you would get a Magnus plural or is the whole thing

204
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,780
called Magnus's?

205
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,700
So multiple Magnus's are Magnus's.

206
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,860
Oh yeah.

207
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,060
I don't think he knew.

208
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,100
He probably didn't know.

209
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,420
This is also terrible timing because it's like this kind of lined up with, okay, the

210
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,660
stripe is less important than the chip.

211
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,260
The chip is more secure and what everyone's going to start taking.

212
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,260
Oh, that's right.

213
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,260
Yeah.

214
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,300
I bet the rise of the chip was exactly when he was trying to come up with his super stripe.

215
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,300
Oh, right.

216
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,300
Yeah.

217
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,300
He should have made a thicker chip.

218
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,860
Can you make a thicker chip in the card?

219
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,540
He spreads probably the next scam.

220
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,880
That's what he's aroused by.

221
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,580
Or I mean a business opportunity.

222
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,060
Right.

223
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,060
Not a scam.

224
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,620
Are you saying that the guy that this guy was not exactly timely with his, the guy who

225
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:02,580
tried to get people to the Bahamas to watch the giant acts blink 182 and Ja Rule in 2018.

226
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:07,220
It's like, it's like Liz Lammon's boyfriend, the beeper king of New York.

227
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:13,380
Billy McFarland, the real life beeper king of New York.

228
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,420
Also Magnus has got an F from the better business bureau.

229
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,500
Oh, no.

230
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,660
So listeners, be careful with your thick cards.

231
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,180
I know you want your cards to get thicker, but use, use caution.

232
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,180
Right.

233
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,180
So, all right.

234
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:35,980
So this thing, the, the, the cheers are so cheers, obviously massive on the rise through

235
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:41,580
the eighties went off in the early nineties where concluded in the early nineties in such

236
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:47,860
a massive way where it's the second biggest televised finale ever.

237
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,820
And 89 million people watched or something like that.

238
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,460
You know, this degree of finale you'd never get.

239
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,740
Have you also, you know, what in thinking about cheers?

240
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:03,460
Well, first of all, cheers, thoughts, anybody, a big cheers head of the three of us?

241
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,180
I like cheers, but I would not call myself a cheers head.

242
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,180
I don't know.

243
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,880
I can't give you famous lines.

244
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,880
I can't do anything.

245
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,720
If cheers on, I go, I like this.

246
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
I get this.

247
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
Yes.

248
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
Yeah.

249
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,840
Always liked everything I've ever seen from it, but no catalog fan.

250
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
Okay.

251
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,320
Here's my cheers fan.

252
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,520
I like cheers.

253
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,760
When I was younger, I looked at a bunch of colleges in Boston.

254
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,160
This could be a five timers club.

255
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,160
And if so, I apologize.

256
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,840
It does sound like the beginning of a five timers club.

257
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,400
There's a one to one thing here.

258
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:43,000
I looked at like Northeastern University, Boston University, Emerson, and I wanted to

259
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,480
get a feel, Boston, pretty cool city.

260
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,000
I've only been there once or twice.

261
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,120
I really only wanted to look at like the cool comic stores and the Bull and Finch pub, which

262
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,400
is now called, I think at the time was transferring over to Cheers Beacon Hill.

263
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,960
And that is the establishing shot of Cheers.

264
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Yes.

265
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,960
Yeah.

266
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:11,080
I wanted to really own that, like realize the merchandising possibilities.

267
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,720
I think the success of that location and that they started putting the Cheers name and all,

268
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,060
they got an official license and put the Cheers name on lots of things and they're selling

269
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,200
as much merch as they are making sales in the regular restaurant.

270
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,840
Like that place became like what a planet Hollywood wants to be.

271
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,840
You know?

272
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
Yeah.

273
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,720
It's the best case scenario for like a theme kind of restaurant.

274
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,600
There's this article pretty thorough about the history of this on this website, Vine

275
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,520
Pear, and they mentioned like, yeah, at some point they were making as much on merchandise

276
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,800
as they were on food and beverage.

277
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Yeah.

278
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Yeah.

279
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,080
Like in the millions we're talking about.

280
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,080
God, wow.

281
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,520
What I was going to bring up Cheers-wise is I had the faintest memory of this happening,

282
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,840
and it involves the Bull and Finch, the real life exterior.

283
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:08,360
Do you guys know how when Cheers went off the air with this hugely watched finale that

284
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,360
it was a big night of programming for NBC and it was not just the final Cheers, but

285
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,880
also the then new Jay Leno Tonight Show did an episode at the Bull and Finch.

286
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
Wow.

287
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
I didn't know this.

288
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,200
But partially inside, but partially outside.

289
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:32,880
The start of the episode is the biggest grandstands you could imagine on the street just facing

290
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:42,560
that exterior with just the rowdiest Bostonians, everybody getting up and screaming and whooping

291
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,720
and hollering to see the Cheers gang off.

292
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,000
But they still plan kind of a conventional tonight show where it certainly they mainly

293
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,280
talk about Cheers, but he's also doing Clinton jokes and Hillary jokes.

294
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,920
And he's on the street doing them or he's on the street.

295
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
Yes.

296
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,280
This is outside to a crowd.

297
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:07,480
I might wager is three times bigger than the regular tonight show studio.

298
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,760
And I would imagine 10 times drunker.

299
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:18,240
So these jokes are not exactly landing, although you maybe are getting some like woohoo's or

300
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,440
arbitrary booze.

301
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,880
It's a fascinating thing to watch.

302
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,280
Did you say this is the first Jay Leno Tonight Show?

303
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
No, no, no.

304
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,280
That would have been hell of a way to start.

305
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,280
That's his beginning.

306
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
No, no, no.

307
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:34,200
It was just like newish on the air, I think in the first year.

308
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,880
But it's I flipped through it on YouTube and it's a very strange hour of programming, like

309
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,600
monologue jokes about Cheers and then also try to like make the punch lines of Clinton

310
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,360
jokes about Cheers.

311
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,000
And then the cast comes out and right off the bat, he sells them out right away.

312
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:56,600
He's like, here's the cast and warning, they are drunk and they and they all they they

313
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
certainly are.

314
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,600
There's no big moment where one of them pukes or falls over or anything.

315
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,640
It's just more that kind of like, yeah, just like what really a lot of people like a lot

316
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,000
of beers deep where like they aren't saying anything that interesting and they're kind

317
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,920
of swaying back and forth.

318
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,200
So nobody's exactly hitting like perfect talk show couch zingers.

319
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:25,360
It's really like it's a very like seedy, dark episode of television, like visually

320
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,120
and then just watching.

321
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,120
Here's these with these people I know are masters of punch lines and they're all just

322
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,080
kind of like rattling on.

323
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,080
Oh, man.

324
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,880
That's also weird.

325
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,120
Like that's a weird juxtaposite because it's like the Bull and Finch pub pretty close to

326
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,640
Boston Commons, which is big, beautiful green space right in the middle of another one of

327
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
my favorite sitcoms.

328
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,600
So now that one I am a mega fan of.

329
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,360
Well, now I yeah, I knew what that was because I like Boston Commons because I would watch

330
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,320
all the syndicated sitcoms on USA.

331
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,920
Of course, we all grew up watching prime time in the A.M.

332
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,960
You know, is that Boston Common would Boston?

333
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,960
Oh, man.

334
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
Wings.

335
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,600
Well, Wings was the best thing in that ton of wings.

336
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,560
Remember Ned and Stacey, Deborah Messing and Thomas Hayden Church?

337
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
I remember.

338
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
I've never seen it, but I remember it.

339
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,560
I remember the names.

340
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,400
I remember seeing an ad for that and thinking, hmm, I plan to not watch that ever.

341
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,840
You were a Ned and Stacey kid.

342
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,960
I well, like 15 watching like this summer.

343
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,800
But like, got to get wake up, wake up, go downstairs, watch the watch the sitcoms.

344
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,400
What was the premise of Ned and Stacey?

345
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:44,680
People in their 20s or 30s live in the city and possibly someone works in publishing.

346
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,520
You said that so strange that that's that staccato people.

347
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,960
I thought you said Pete Bull.

348
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,080
Pete Bull is the boss of people.

349
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,160
Ned and Stacey, who start to date with their shared hatred of their boss,

350
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,640
Pete Bull, people with the hottest literary age in New York.

351
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,360
But when the newest book he works on flops, he has to move back to his home town.

352
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,360
No, I don't.

353
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
I was a pretty good.

354
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,280
I really got that.

355
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,280
Quick pitch.

356
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,120
Geez. Yeah.

357
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,160
Just go take that to a network right now.

358
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm wondering if I was one of like five people in America who, like when the trailer

359
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,200
for sideways came out, I'm like, is that the fucking guy from Ned and Stacey?

360
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,280
It's Ned and Stacey.

361
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,200
Wow, that's interesting.

362
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,880
Yeah.

363
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:38,720
So, Jason, just for your future, like shopping gifts at live shows, Ned and Stacey.

364
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,280
I wasn't even that big.

365
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,680
I just liked location.

366
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,720
Like, oh, yeah, this movie was filmed here.

367
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,400
A lot of stuff filmed in Philadelphia.

368
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,360
So I was always like, oh, cool.

369
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,760
This scene from such and such was filmed here.

370
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,520
Oh, they shot hack here.

371
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,040
Remember hack?

372
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:03,480
No, hack was a drama about a cab driver who was a vigilante who would get justice.

373
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,720
Is that in USA?

374
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,840
I think it was on CBS.

375
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,080
Hack.

376
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,440
When you were 15?

377
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:17,440
This was in 2002 to 2004 created by David Kep, the writer of Jurassic Park and Lost

378
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,320
World and Crystal Skull.

379
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,240
Sure.

380
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,520
And Carlito's Way, which is purple in the link because we talked about it once on the show.

381
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,320
I don't remember why we talked about Carlito's Way.

382
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,000
Why did we?

383
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,960
But that's proof that purple links are helpful on the laptop to remind us of what we talked about.

384
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,760
Carlito's, there was a bar in the valley that for like, I think over a year now has

385
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,960
said coming soon, new bar Carlito's Way.

386
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,160
And when we looked up the plot of Carlito's Way, it's like, oh, this isn't a fun story.

387
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,480
No.

388
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,680
Why was there going to be a bar of it?

389
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,080
That's what that's that's a much bigger leap than the Cheers Airport bar.

390
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,640
Yeah.

391
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,920
I'd like to see someone take it, though.

392
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,400
Huh.

393
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:03,000
That's well, I'm actually I don't want to keep asking Jason about what he was watching at age 15.

394
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But I mean, these are fascinating.

395
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,800
You've you've you've now produced a name.

396
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,120
I'm surprised to hear from anyone who watched that and Stacey.

397
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,680
But now Hack, you've pulled out of nowhere.

398
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,560
I've just never heard of that one to begin with.

399
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,120
Hack was just I think it's filmed a lot in Philadelphia.

400
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,160
So like family members and stuff was like, oh, I saw them filming Hack.

401
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,600
It's like I didn't see that.

402
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:32,160
I saw Danny Devito and Charlie Day once in it, like in a crew in an alleyway in Center City

403
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,880
because they're shooting exteriors for It's Always Sunny.

404
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,960
Like, do you need anybody?

405
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,320
You need anybody?

406
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,800
Partsie on cast for this scene you're filming right now.

407
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,240
Didn't work.

408
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,440
I'm in turning for free at a weekly newspaper.

409
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,240
That's going to go under soon.

410
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,600
That's when you were calling publicists.

411
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,680
Huh? Yeah, that's when I was calling terrorizing publicists.

412
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,920
And what's the story we've told before on the show?

413
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,960
The story we told before is I was fact checking horoscopes that were horoscope

414
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,320
slash gossip columns and I had to call Sandra Bullock's agent and I got all the way

415
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,480
about Jesse James about the divorce and I got all the way through because E,

416
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,880
I think E's website used to tell you this actor's agent is so and so at this agency.

417
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,680
And the switchboard just put me through to the assistant and then to the agent.

418
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,160
Yeah, it's easier than people think, I think.

419
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,360
Oh, yeah. You can get there.

420
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,280
You can call and see if they'll tell you who Sandra Bullock is dating.

421
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,240
They're not maybe going to do it, but you probably get the phone number and do it.

422
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:42,240
So whoever picks up the phone at the agency has an obligation to say what's going on in her personal life.

423
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,120
No, not an obligation, but I'm just saying you get pretty close to the truth.

424
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,160
You'll probably get a wallet at some point, but as Jason's saying, yeah, it's not that it's not as hard.

425
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,440
He asked the question carefully.

426
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,600
So can you either confirm or deny if you say nothing, if you cough, that means this is right.

427
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,080
Yeah, Jason was treating that publicist, though, probably like those weed dealers in New York.

428
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,400
Like, come on, come on, you know, give me the truth.

429
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,120
Give me the truth.

430
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,680
It's called the Fourth Estate, pal.

431
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,480
Better open up.

432
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,920
Twenty-two year old Jason.

433
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,280
We had a dipshit horoscope writer lives across the bridge in Jersey.

434
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:18,600
And I found out that they based this on a year old story and they got the day wrong or they got the week right.

435
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:25,760
But they had the year wrong on the People magazine story they linked to as like, oh, this is my source.

436
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,480
In a different reality, you could have ended up in that bullpen with Harvey Levin on the TMZ show.

437
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,240
Oh, yeah.

438
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,040
Jason, what do you got?

439
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,880
Well, Sandra Bullock and Jesse James, they're done.

440
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,400
Kaput.

441
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,920
Oh, really? Yeah, yeah, I called him.

442
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,200
Don't worry.

443
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,480
I have my ear to the ground on all this shit.

444
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,200
I have my Philly sources.

445
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,960
I got my source.

446
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,720
Oh, yeah, Charlie Day, Danny DeVito.

447
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,760
Filming in an alley.

448
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,840
Filming in an alley.

449
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,960
Doesn't need an extra.

450
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,920
Center City by the Good Deli.

451
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,240
Soon enough, the Jason stock rises at TMZ.

452
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,040
The guy with the dreadlocks gets pushed towards the back.

453
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,560
Oh, yeah. And then Jason's up front.

454
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,160
Let's say, can we rearrange the seating just for this episode?

455
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,520
Just to try. Just to see if we like it.

456
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,680
Is this show still on?

457
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,240
It is, right?

458
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,000
I think so.

459
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,640
Yeah, I think that's.

460
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,400
I realize the Steve Wilco show was still on the other day.

461
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,280
What? Yeah, not Jerry Springer, but Steve Wilco's.

462
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,840
Did you have to go to the hospital?

463
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,880
How else would you know this?

464
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,160
It's only on hospital TV.

465
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,360
It's the feed that goes right to hospitals.

466
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,760
But I think their audience, I think it's still syndicated.

467
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,960
So, yeah, you can still see Steve, the bodyguard from Jerry Springer's show.

468
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,280
But Jerry Springer's gone.

469
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,040
Jerry Springer is off the air.

470
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,320
I don't know if Steve has been on longer than Jerry, but he's

471
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,640
she's certainly been on a long time.

472
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,680
Yeah, I'll say that.

473
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,040
And the show doesn't look that much better in quality than it ever did.

474
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,840
Doesn't look like they've really upgraded for 2023.

475
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,680
If you got the viewers, no need to get new cameras.

476
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,600
I'm curious. Well, wouldn't that then make it

477
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,960
not to just bluntly tie it back to the topic,

478
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,520
but that really makes Steve Wilco's the Frazier of two.

479
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,320
That's right. Jerry Springer's.

480
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,680
Cheers. No, it's perfect. Yeah.

481
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,760
Frazier coming back.

482
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,440
Is that right? Is that in development?

483
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,320
How I believe?

484
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,440
No, I don't know if it's hell, but I believe it's coming back.

485
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,960
And I think it's just the opposite of hell.

486
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,960
How much can we push this forward?

487
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,280
Heaven, heaven. It's not hell.

488
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,240
David Hyde Pierce is not coming.

489
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,280
None of the cast is coming back except for Kelsey.

490
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,280
Wow. None of your favorites are bad.

491
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,160
And I think it's like some there's like some prickly thing about it. Wonderful.

492
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,920
Probably Kelsey saying like, I don't want them back. Mm hmm.

493
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,320
I don't want them back and I don't want the woke agenda.

494
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,760
The woke mind virus impacting this production.

495
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,320
Mr. Money plane can call the shots.

496
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,920
OK, so so this thing they, you know, paramount pictures,

497
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,400
they're trying to merchandise everything they can.

498
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,600
They're with Kings Island and all those they're in the business

499
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,560
of trying to figure out weird IP in themed environments.

500
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,400
What would the hurler, the Wings World coaster?

501
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,720
They've they kind of like had to go the furthest maybe with not kid IP.

502
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,760
So so impressive attempts on their part.

503
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,200
Cheers seems like it might actually have a chance to go to the furthest.

504
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,040
Have some momentum. Of course, people might want to go to a cheers bar.

505
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,040
And this is also, again, to quote this Vine pair article,

506
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,040
which I'll credit for a lot of this, the writer Aaron Goldfarb

507
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,080
credit to you, good article.

508
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:36,720
He says how it's also the rise of the airports having chains you recognize at all.

509
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,280
I don't think I realize that.

510
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:38,800
Yeah, I didn't know that.

511
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,800
Your KFCs and your Pizza Hut's were not really in airports

512
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,840
and that sometimes they're making twice the business in these air

513
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,240
because you have to go somewhere in the airport.

514
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:53,600
Right. And just airport air travel being like affordable, being like,

515
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,280
oh, you can do it a few times a year, as opposed to just one time a year.

516
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,720
Like the middle class shelling out money to fly more.

517
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,880
Sure, sure. OK, OK.

518
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,320
So there's an opportunity here.

519
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,800
Maybe we can attempt a Cheers Airport bar.

520
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,360
And they test in just a couple of markets.

521
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,640
It started in the Detroit Metro Airport in February 91,

522
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,920
a week later opened in Minneapolis, St.

523
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,320
Paul.

524
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:25,520
And what what do you find if you're in a Cheers Airport bar?

525
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,000
In terms of just the pure themed experience?

526
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,000
I mean, OK, so there's there's there's kind of a central figure who you're

527
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,600
following, who I think actually the article got the got his name wrong.

528
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,800
When I looked into some other things,

529
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,240
I believe Stan Novak is the name of the guy.

530
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,840
Stan Novak was the person from Host International,

531
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,760
which I think was affiliated with Marriott and they're they're a,

532
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,560
you know, hospitality or like airport food kind of company.

533
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,720
So he really makes this his pet project.

534
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,120
And he spent a year on the Paramount lot

535
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,440
working with the actual set designers of Cheers to recreate the setting exactly,

536
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,560
which sounds cool. Yeah.

537
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,960
There's there's surprisingly few things like this, I feel like.

538
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,600
Where you go, like, isn't it weird?

539
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,120
There wasn't a bunch of we're going to

540
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:20,360
copy paste a bunch of central perks or the or the Seinfeld diner.

541
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,600
How was there not more of this?

542
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,560
Yeah, I know.

543
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,240
I mean, they've done it recently with Papa, like the Max.

544
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,520
We they had here in Los Angeles for a couple of months and then it turned into

545
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,200
movies or before that it might have been

546
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,920
Los Poyos.

547
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,120
El Polly Loco? No, no.

548
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,440
It might have been closed.

549
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,400
Yeah, that's right.

550
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,920
Poyos Hermanos.

551
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,080
Yeah. And which would like start out OK and then get sadder and sadder as the run

552
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,280
went on for them. Well, it seems like it's really all about let's make that first

553
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,600
week really solid, much like theme park restaurants.

554
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,760
Yes. Very, very similar.

555
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,680
Can we make things at the beginning so that maybe people it'll take people a long

556
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,960
time to notice the decay.

557
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,800
One of the funniest ones when we went to the Breaking Bad one, it was just because

558
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,560
the Formosa was closed, supposed to go to the Formosa, which is right next to where

559
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,880
they were doing all these pop ups, which is the L.A.

560
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,280
confidential place on Santa Monica Boulevard.

561
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,840
Historic L.A.

562
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,400
Yeah, cool place.

563
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,680
It's still open again or was closed now or whatever.

564
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,400
So we were like, I guess we'll go to this Breaking Bad pop up.

565
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,480
And it was like the last days of it.

566
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,280
It was so bleak.

567
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,920
No one in there like test tube.

568
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,400
And you're like, this isn't what the show was like.

569
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,040
They wouldn't have had meth themed things.

570
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,120
No, that gives away the cover of the restaurant.

571
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,560
The closest thing was like they kind of had like Saul's office set up in the back.

572
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,600
It was all right.

573
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,480
But they also wouldn't have had that in Los Pozos.

574
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,760
Yeah, no, it was bad.

575
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,240
It didn't work.

576
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,000
We did do the Max one, which was like as close as they could get.

577
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,680
It was OK. I was never a big saved by the belt person either.

578
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,440
So, yeah, I can't imagine it was so like what I am thinking sounds cool about.

579
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,280
This is the attempt at accuracy and making

580
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:11,120
the space layout seem more, which I think a lot of these things don't or can't

581
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,200
quite do. And it's also the thing which I've said years ago.

582
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,160
I why I would have I preferred them to make like an Avatar Hotel versus

583
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,600
Star Wars Hotel because just purely on the aesthetic of a Cheers, that is a place

584
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,920
you would have a nice time chatting and drinking.

585
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,920
Uh huh. It's not a seedy bar.

586
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,640
It's a very comforting bar.

587
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,000
I like anywhere that has fixtures or the

588
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,400
lighting vibe of Cheers to this day.

589
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,120
So it makes sense that you like if you make a bunch of these, people are going to

590
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,400
want to like hang out with them, even if they have never seen the show.

591
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,520
Sure. It would be like the Max is something where like

592
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:51,840
the food has to be amazing for people to come to this high school cafeteria a lot.

593
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:57,400
Uh huh. But if it's a nice theme bar, that's that's probably going to attract

594
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,360
more people if it just actually works as a bar.

595
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,680
Yeah, sure.

596
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,040
So, you know, it might be kind of spatially accurate.

597
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,280
It's the signature square bar surrounded by round, no backstools.

598
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,880
You've got a Red Sox jersey from Sam Malone up on the wall.

599
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,160
You've got a cigar store Indian and you got a Whirlitzer jukebox.

600
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:25,600
And then here's the sentence that is a little rough, which is

601
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:32,640
staff was even required to pass an acting class, perhaps even affect a Boston accent.

602
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,880
Which they would use to perform for customers.

603
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,720
Okay.

604
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:43,480
Question number one, why do any of those characters speak in a particularly

605
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,400
Bostonian accent? I don't think that's really a part of Cheers, is it?

606
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,400
No. Who would be the closest to the went George went as a Chicago accent.

607
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,280
Yeah.

608
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,080
Yes.

609
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,680
And like Ratzenberg has a funny voice.

610
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,840
Yeah.

611
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,240
But he's kind of it's not Boston.

612
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,000
I don't think.

613
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,320
Who was the older woman who worked at the bar?

614
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,280
Carla.

615
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,960
Carla. Yeah.

616
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,720
She's kind of got the voice.

617
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,520
Everyone kind of has either.

618
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,440
Frazier's got a fancy man accent or everyone else kind of has like a generic

619
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,920
working class and Woody Harrelson's kind of like, hey, I'm laid back on the court.

620
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,920
Everyone's got

621
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,560
Ted Danson, I don't think really had an accent.

622
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,880
What did she sound like?

623
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,160
Hello.

624
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,920
Hey, I'm Shelley.

625
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,040
Well, that's what everyone did.

626
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,840
Hey.

627
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,000
Also, Norm's or not Norm Sam's Red Sox.

628
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,920
That's kind of melancholy, right?

629
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,600
That he only played like one or two games for the Red Sox.

630
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,760
Right. Yeah. Right.

631
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,880
He was like a baseball.

632
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,160
Was he in the majors?

633
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,320
This is how my lack of Cheers knowledge.

634
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,760
He was

635
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,920
he is career ended like prematurely, something like that.

636
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,800
Is that how this series ends to do to get back?

637
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,800
Question.

638
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,760
That would be weird.

639
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,800
Does he get called back after like 11 years?

640
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,240
That's why it closes.

641
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,080
I can't remember.

642
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,280
Chance to play it or someone sells the building.

643
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,200
I don't remember the plot line at the finale of Cheers.

644
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,480
I remember the last person out turned light off.

645
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,040
Do you remember, though, how Ned and Stacey ends?

646
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,040
Well, abbreviated, I'll say that.

647
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,920
OK, you're right.

648
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,080
There was and it wasn't like a cliffhanger like Al for something

649
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,400
where one of them gets attacked by the government.

650
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,560
Not as far as I know.

651
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,600
I think they briefly finally get together.

652
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,640
Is that right?

653
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,560
I don't really remember.

654
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,560
You know, she went on to Will and Grace and he went on to sideways.

655
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,640
So I think they're they were occupied elsewhere.

656
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,760
OK, well, no, I'm at least comforted by their career success.

657
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,720
Yeah.

658
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,760
I think I think, though, unfortunately for the characters,

659
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,920
I think it's the same ending as dinosaurs.

660
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,560
I think the Ice Age starts.

661
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,200
Oh, really? A new Ice Age starts and that and Stacey, their reality,

662
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,680
it seems like ours, but it veers into a wildly different universe.

663
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,800
And if it's like younger people living in the city, I'm sure like the blackout

664
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,360
joke was like, can you get a cappuccino around here?

665
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,560
I want to warm up a little, you know,

666
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,200
they were always talking about coffee on these shows.

667
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:17,880
Yeah.

668
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,840
Freeze frame.

669
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,360
So long that and Stacey coffee humor is popular.

670
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,680
But the idea that they to work in this

671
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,880
airport bar, you have to do an acting class.

672
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,800
Yeah. So this is interesting because I think this is immediately.

673
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,280
This immediately ruins it.

674
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,880
It quickly ruins it because it's like if you're going to do what they think they're

675
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,840
doing, it better be good because I guess it's going to be like Tony and like they

676
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,520
think it'll be like Tony and Tina's wedding or something.

677
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,800
Twenty four seven.

678
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,800
Yeah. Which, by the way, something I think we should do an episode about.

679
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,760
I know I'm aware you've mentioned this.

680
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,720
I don't know if it's a five timer on the show or a conversation.

681
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,440
Something was just recently talking about.

682
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,360
I don't think it can be five timers.

683
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,880
I I a past guest of the show.

684
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,920
I should reach out to he did a very weird

685
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,840
poorly produced version of Tony and Tina's wedding.

686
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,840
I believe on Fisherman's worth worth in San Francisco.

687
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,320
Really? You were tugging at your collar like it was like making you nervous.

688
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,960
It was that it was to help you.

689
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,800
I have to ask him. Was it you?

690
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,680
No, no, it was Avery.

691
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,680
Oh, interesting.

692
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,560
OK, I know somebody else who did it, too.

693
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,560
So we can reunite a full cast reunion of Tony and Tina's wedding.

694
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,040
We don't talk about it. We just do the show.

695
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,240
In that way, the podcast is we have to do Tony.

696
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,760
I guess it's got to be a live show.

697
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,920
Oh, finally, a live show where I can eat

698
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,120
big CD on stage and not get yelled at.

699
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,360
Oh, be my gal, please.

700
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,560
I would love that was the gimmick.

701
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,640
Scott was out, but then he's back in after that.

702
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,720
This sounds like shit.

703
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,920
No, I'm taking only that element.

704
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,720
Jason needs big during the show.

705
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,920
I have to eat the candy thong.

706
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,080
It's going to be ill by the time

707
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,560
carted off stage.

708
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,480
Have a shot.

709
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,800
Have a shot.

710
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,880
Yeah, it should be Ned and Stacey's wedding.

711
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,680
Starring Jason.

712
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,680
That's what their IP should have been.

713
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,040
They don't do an airport bar.

714
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,880
They do a live immersive theater show to keep the characters in the consciousness.

715
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,360
Yes. So, yeah.

716
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,640
No. So I was saying this is going to ruin this ruins it, I think, because like no

717
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,280
one wants no one wants this just walking in.

718
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,560
I don't want to interact with if it was maybe if it was facsimiles of Sam and

719
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,600
Diane, maybe. But like, but but if you're at the airport,

720
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,000
you don't want to be part of an immersive just because you're like waiting to fly

721
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,680
to Chicago, you know, like it's not you're not prepared for it.

722
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,600
Immersive. I think you have to be prepared for it.

723
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,800
You have to know that's what you're getting into.

724
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,920
Mentally know like, OK, I have to like we have to play.

725
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,160
We have to play theater here for a while, which and as somebody that you saw how

726
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,200
much I bristled that Tony and teen is wedding just now, I don't ever want to get

727
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,680
ready to play.

728
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,320
That sounds awful to me.

729
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,320
Well, it depends what it is.

730
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,960
If it's like Disneyland and they're doing somebody's in Galaxy's Edge doing an OK

731
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,960
job of saying like bright suns. Oh, sure. OK.

732
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,280
So you mean the first week, the first for everybody doing that?

733
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,800
Yeah. Yeah.

734
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,560
But, you know, the immersive we went to like, OK, that's an hour long kind of a

735
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,120
show and we interact and like, OK, we're ready for that.

736
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,560
I'm ready for that. Yeah.

737
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,440
If it just like pops up at you when you're just trying to get a drink.

738
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,640
No. Yeah.

739
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,680
When you're when you're trying to get blitzed before your flight.

740
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,720
Right. Yes.

741
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,800
Wash away your flight fear.

742
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,400
Yeah. No, it's you don't want to you don't want to be part of a little play

743
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,640
when you're doing that.

744
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,400
Well, and especially because like so.

745
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,680
All right. So they take an acting class and the acting.

746
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:03,080
So now by you having taken the acting class, you can really make it seem like

747
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,960
you're a bartender at a bar.

748
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,160
Yeah, right. Which they are.

749
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,680
So now, now how are you in that seat?

750
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,160
Like, hey, can I get your order?

751
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,280
Go. Can I get you something to drink?

752
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,800
Now they're just like being the bartender that they are.

753
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,720
But with like 10 percent too much stink on it.

754
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,200
Yeah. Too much. And that unnerving energy

755
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,800
that you get when somebody's performing and you're not need some change.

756
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Yeah. For the most hostile crowd like

757
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,000
airport traffic.

758
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,560
I mean, I guess airports a little more restrained back in the day, a little more

759
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:45,440
relaxing Philadelphia in the mid to late 90s, like upgraded the airport.

760
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,480
And they were really pushing for like, hey, it's like a mall.

761
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,800
Come to the airport and get some shopping done.

762
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,720
Just hang out. And it's like, don't even think about it.

763
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,720
It's not a stressful thing at all.

764
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,600
We got rocking chairs all over these concourses with the floor to ceiling

765
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,400
windows so you can see the planes take off.

766
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,320
You must have loved that. Wait a minute.

767
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,040
There were rocking chairs in your childhood airport.

768
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,160
Yeah, those are still there.

769
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,240
The Philadelphia airport is pretty nice.

770
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,160
They have a lot of art exhibits and they have a lot of different local restaurants.

771
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,000
The campaign was right.

772
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,400
You're making fun of it, but you also agree with it.

773
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,520
The campaign was right.

774
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,400
But I don't know.

775
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,880
I don't think you can get past security nowadays if you're just like, hey,

776
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,440
it's one hit up the Wendy's in the luggage store.

777
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,680
You can't get that.

778
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,600
I don't think you can just go sit in a rocking chair if you feel like it.

779
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,040
But I'd have to check.

780
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,840
I need to tell you this, Jason, but there was something that happened like

781
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,560
20 years ago that changed.

782
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,480
I'm not sure if Jason knows about.

783
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,040
I don't know. I'm just saying there was something that happened.

784
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,240
I don't want to tell you about it.

785
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,280
Why? OK, yeah.

786
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,920
Some places got hit by it.

787
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,040
That's right. That's right.

788
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:59,160
So this is I feel like like there must be some broader topic or even a final four.

789
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,560
But Jason's favorite shares.

790
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,640
This is a recurring.

791
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,480
You have brought up a lot of shares that you're fond of.

792
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,160
I do. Look, I got I got some nice.

793
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,240
The Philly airport

794
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:18,440
in terms of like it's compared to L.A.X., which L.A.X. a little avoided at all costs.

795
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,360
A bit of a hostile architecture.

796
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,680
Only if you must.

797
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,320
Yeah. But the Philly airport, there's a bunch of

798
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:31,680
chicken, pizza, local Philly chain, a bar, bar and restaurant chain.

799
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,720
You got a mascot of chicken, pizza.

800
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,680
I don't know. I feel like sometimes they're there.

801
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,840
No. Wait, wait, wait.

802
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,000
What was the answer? Sometimes there's a mascot.

803
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,600
I don't really.

804
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,520
I just know mostly from the airport.

805
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,360
I can't say there's a ton of chicken pizza at this point.

806
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,880
It used to be a thing where it's like, oh, there's only one or two with them.

807
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,520
Peets, chicken, pizza, chicken, pizza, not on the USA Network.

808
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,600
No, not on the USA.

809
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,160
Not on the shore.

810
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,440
It's on some of the boardwalks selling crab fries, which are just French fries

811
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,680
with Old Bay on it.

812
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,600
I don't I'm not seeing a mascot.

813
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,560
There is not not even sometimes.

814
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,160
Your feet are represented.

815
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:12,960
I don't think so.

816
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,240
Huh? Jason, would you top chair of all time to sit in?

817
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,160
What would you think? Real quick, is it cherry from Pee Wee's Playhouse?

818
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,080
Is it I don't want to I don't want to answer for him.

819
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,960
I don't want to share talking at me while I'm trying to relax.

820
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,120
I love Jerry, but I'd rather sit in.

821
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,840
I'd rather stand in front of Jerry and have a conversation with Jerry.

822
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,160
Jason, what do you think about Jerry?

823
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,080
I like Jerry. Jerry's a friend.

824
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,920
Yeah, but would you sit on it?

825
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,280
I've invited.

826
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,080
I feel I would check in first.

827
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,920
Sitting on Jerry.

828
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,480
I wouldn't want to cross any boundaries, you know.

829
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,120
No, you would ask. You make eye contact.

830
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,560
Of course. I'm not saying he's doing it without consent.

831
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,840
Am I crazy? No, he's going to ask Jerry first.

832
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,520
Oh, really?

833
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,760
Now we're all thinking about Jerry.

834
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,400
I'm happening also at the same time.

835
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,320
OK, so what else do you do at this place?

836
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,640
You've got you got food, food named after the characters.

837
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,240
Sam's submarine sandwich, Woody's Polish hot dog.

838
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,200
And of course, Steins of Norm's Big Bruce ski.

839
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,520
Was there food at Cheers?

840
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,920
Very good question.

841
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,720
I don't think of it as a show where they were eating a lot of food,

842
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,520
but I imagine that there was some food hanging around.

843
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,840
But yeah, they all just had big mugs.

844
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,240
I just think of the mugs.

845
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,720
Cheers mug, iconic Cheers mug.

846
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,320
You're just saying that with a real look at those mugs.

847
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,560
I just think, you know, what do you think about those mugs?

848
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,920
It's it's all it's the voice I was doing.

849
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,560
I'm not sure. I feel like everything I say now is kind of just like that thing

850
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,960
that's been memeified, which is that what Australian show

851
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,440
that's a puppet dog and the woman who laughs at him.

852
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,080
Do you know what I'm talking about? Oh, the innocent men.

853
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,960
Yeah, we're just just normal men, just innocent men.

854
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,640
You ever seen this guy? No idea what this is.

855
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,400
I have zero context for this.

856
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,920
This was just sent to me a few months ago and it's I've it's everywhere now.

857
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,960
But it's just a clip. It's a kids show.

858
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,920
And it's just this weird looking puppet dog talking to this like co-host of this

859
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,840
this children's show. And I didn't know what it was for like a month.

860
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,880
And it's just this dog saying, you know, we're just normal men.

861
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,080
And she's like, we're just what?

862
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,720
And she starts laughing and he goes, we're just innocent men.

863
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,760
And then she like loses it completely. And then that's that's it.

864
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,440
That's just an ad lib, right?

865
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,160
Yeah. He was some inside joke he had with her or something.

866
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,240
But it's there's an account that just posts this over and over again.

867
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,400
And I do love it. It's great. OK.

868
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,560
But it sounds like I have to watch the real thing.

869
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,080
To watch the real thing.

870
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,240
He doing it half speed is definitely not going to give you the appeal of it.

871
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,520
I think there is a profile of that

872
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,120
presenter of the woman and she's like, yeah, I'm kind of haunted by that clip.

873
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,360
Can kind of can't escape it. Sure. Yeah.

874
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,960
I'm popular. Oh, well, we shouldn't talk if it ruined her life.

875
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,600
Then we really shouldn't give it more attention.

876
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,720
I don't think it's that far.

877
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,920
I think it's just like, yeah, I know.

878
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,200
We'll do an episode on the clip.

879
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,640
OK, get your voice ready. Keep it in good shape.

880
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,040
Yeah, I'm seeing that they did not.

881
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,360
I don't think there was a I don't think you're eating dinner at Cheers in the show.

882
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,800
Beer, nuts and pretzels.

883
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,160
And we do hear Norm reference cheese doodles several times throughout the show.

884
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,600
Well, that's hardly nice.

885
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,000
That's a factoid, but that's no yeah.

886
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,160
Doesn't mean they have it.

887
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,600
Now, I'm pro upgrading the idea of it.

888
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,920
I don't think that hurts it.

889
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,480
And adding food to probably need to have food if it's a port.

890
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,520
Right.

891
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:35,560
Um, there are so few pictures of this place.

892
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,880
No one bothered to document this.

893
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:43,000
And somehow there is one photo that exists of

894
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,800
what bizarrely is a location in Christchurch, New Zealand.

895
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,960
They were almost all America or Canada, except for this one in New Zealand.

896
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,720
And this and this is one of the only it's one of the maybe the only color photo

897
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,680
of the interior and it looks nice.

898
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,760
Good classic 80s bar.

899
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:06,840
But you zoom in on this and you get the detail that they have Carla's chow.

900
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,160
And beyond that, you don't really mean pizza.

901
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,960
That doesn't feel like the vibe of Cheers.

902
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:12,960
No, it's not.

903
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,360
Yeah, no, at all.

904
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,880
It would be more brew pub of a kind of menu.

905
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,200
You know, chips and salsa does not seem like the I mean, it would be like fish

906
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,600
and chips or something even.

907
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,040
I know that's not a British bar, but it still feels more like what would be

908
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,880
appropriate in that space. Yeah.

909
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,520
Yeah. But just call it so they like it's not they're not calling anything.

910
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,480
And that menu looks very like theme park.

911
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,680
Yeah. Yeah.

912
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,240
That's a very like not classy menu.

913
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,200
That's really selling out theme parks, calling them not classy.

914
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,240
Well, I'm just saying if I'm trying to be on theme for Cheers,

915
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,000
which is a classy establishment, you know, is it?

916
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:54,880
Well, OK, it's but it's it's not classy, but it's not it's not that I'm trying to

917
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,280
think of this bar.

918
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,040
It's like a working man's bar, but like a nice place for the nice people.

919
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,000
But it's not tourist.

920
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,040
It's not tourist trash.

921
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,520
It's a different type of was that too corporate of a menu.

922
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,120
Yeah, I mean, I guess they're showing their cards that this is a yeah,

923
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,840
this is a theme restaurant run by something called Host International.

924
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,240
So it's still too corporate.

925
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,840
Maybe that's what they're missing. Sure.

926
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,760
They have all the props.

927
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,560
They have the jersey and the world, sir, and everything.

928
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,880
But they don't have it doesn't have the heart.

929
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,720
Doesn't have the homespun because Cheers isn't a chain.

930
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,480
Yeah, they aren't just cranking out the signs of the graphic shot.

931
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,680
Right.

932
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,000
All right. So that's that's maybe something they miss.

933
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,920
However, here's something about this this place.

934
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,480
I mentioned that they opened to Detroit and Minneapolis.

935
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,240
And how many times do we talk about some

936
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:53,120
now defunct regional themed entertainment where it stops it to where there was one

937
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,920
that was thriving for a little bit and then it stops or then maybe one more.

938
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,720
And then this thing's dead in a couple of years.

939
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,360
And some guy ran it into the ground or whatever.

940
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,040
And there's always like plants to open three thousand three hundred.

941
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:08,200
There's an article somewhere that's ghostly, too ambitious of plans.

942
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,040
In this case, there were so many of these.

943
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,120
This was in so many airports across the country.

944
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,560
Cleveland, Kansas City, St.

945
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,200
Louis, Anchorage, Christchurch, New Zealand, Washington, D.C., Boston,

946
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,360
Las Vegas, Savannah, Cincinnati, Northern Kentucky, Memphis and Vancouver.

947
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:29,560
And every location is doubling revenue from the airport's previous tenant.

948
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,600
Whatever was in that space before it is getting doubled.

949
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,960
This is an immensely successful chain that now almost no one remembers.

950
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,120
Yeah, that is so interesting because I didn't get an airplane,

951
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,160
an airplane until nineteen ninety nine for the first time.

952
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:48,240
OK, so I'm not sure I would remember this, but I know I've never heard anyone talk

953
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,960
about this. This is a complete, like, huge success.

954
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,160
Something that was full black hole now,

955
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,000
right, that enough people would have at least passed by.

956
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,840
It's like it's almost like in the airport,

957
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:03,680
people are not prioritizing taking photographs of the restaurants

958
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,960
that are around in some of the terminals.

959
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,600
For some reason, they're saving the film

960
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,080
that they need to take photos with to use on their actual vacation.

961
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:18,120
Well, the photos that do exist to make it look like like a curse, like a.

962
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,400
Well, that's another true.

963
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,840
We'll get into robots.

964
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,200
But dads, but dads, look, this should have been like, oh, wow.

965
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,440
Your dad's favorite show is Cheers.

966
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,600
We're going to go. We're in Cheers waiting for the flight.

967
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,480
I feel like the dads across the country have to have pictures from this.

968
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,160
Yeah, they just aren't going public with that.

969
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:37,560
They are.

970
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,920
We've got them. If there's dads listening.

971
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:40,720
Yes.

972
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,240
Dads, if you're listening, I guess you'd have to be older than us

973
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,240
because you'd be dead 30 years ago.

974
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,480
But yes.

975
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,640
But if you if you took a photo in the Cheers bar because you're excited

976
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,040
because it was your favorite show, please post the photos.

977
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,640
Take it from these dads.

978
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,560
We take photos of every bit of nonsense we see.

979
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,280
We have more photos of nonsense than of our children.

980
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:01,840
That's correct.

981
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,960
And this is how it should have been for you, too.

982
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,440
I probably have photos of the Breaking Bad pop up.

983
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,520
I'm curious.

984
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,600
That'll be well documented.

985
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,320
Let me see if I have that food.

986
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,840
Not great. Yeah, yeah.

987
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,520
I would have taken what they did make chicken.

988
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,440
It didn't make you so I don't think I had chicken was edible chicken.

989
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,600
Yeah.

990
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,800
Anyway, but yeah, huge.

991
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,600
These, by the way, are open from 91 to 2001.

992
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,360
This is a decade of smash success.

993
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,120
That's the right.

994
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:30,960
Here's airport bars.

995
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,200
Yeah, that surprised me how long it lasted.

996
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:38,120
Yeah, especially given the gimmick, which we will start to get into here.

997
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,080
I would imagine.

998
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,920
But something with a gimmick like this, you would think that the game is where we

999
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,720
all love love the gimmicks, but you would think that would curse this thing

1000
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,600
to close immediately. Yes, yes.

1001
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,680
And yet

1002
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:56,000
it seems like it was part of it and it's the main reason we know it today.

1003
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:03,120
You know, this this guy Novak, he's got the question, how do you make cheers out

1004
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,800
in the real world? Well, you can put as much as many doodads on the wall as you

1005
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,880
want, but the only thing that really made you can also train the staff in acting.

1006
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,160
But what you really want are a couple of

1007
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,120
barflies who are always down at the end of the bar, Kraken wise.

1008
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,720
And I guess in that case, they weren't willing to shell out too many acting

1009
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:30,680
classes or have constantly employed performers only in this only in airport bars.

1010
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,960
So the solution became animatronics.

1011
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:40,840
There were two animatronics always sitting at this bar hunched over the bar.

1012
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,240
This is weird.

1013
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,800
Before even the characters, this is such a strange idea.

1014
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,720
A bar where there's animatronics down at the end.

1015
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,040
Yeah, I mean, there's I'm trying to think of like, I guess, like

1016
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,680
the Adventurers Club sort of they thought about doing.

1017
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,880
I mean, they obviously had a lot of stuff

1018
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,200
with live performers and then other things you could interact with.

1019
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,680
But I think there was one point was an idea of like there was a robot at the bar

1020
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,040
you would talk to, but that didn't I think that was a blue sky thing.

1021
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:14,920
There was some puppets and there was some there were other animatronics like far away.

1022
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:18,120
I'm just trying to think of anything that actually used

1023
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,480
robot permanent robots.

1024
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,920
It feels like a thing that's always cut.

1025
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,040
It's a very blue sky thing or the I door that like an August cantina kind of place

1026
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,560
that maybe there'd be a droid down at the end. Right.

1027
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,360
But it never happens.

1028
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,200
But it did happen at an airport in Savannah.

1029
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,120
Crazy. That's all crazy.

1030
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,480
All these boring airports.

1031
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,320
No offense to the Vancouver airport, but they had robots.

1032
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,960
Yeah, that's that is something like where I would post one of those conservative

1033
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:52,160
memes like this was what airports used to be like with themed entertainment robots.

1034
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,360
Everything used to be better.

1035
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,080
Well, and think about it, too.

1036
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,240
There's like a dozen of these locations, two robots each.

1037
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,240
So that's two dozen animatronics.

1038
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,520
Yeah. Throughout the country.

1039
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:09,040
I mean, cloned and saying the same like short script back and forth.

1040
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,720
I wouldn't dock them points for that, though.

1041
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,680
No, no.

1042
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,960
They commit it to the bit for sure.

1043
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,560
It's crazy. This is the world.

1044
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:20,080
We talk about wanting this world where in any boring strip mall, there's animatronics

1045
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,200
around every corner.

1046
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,640
And for a little while, it was true at the most functional place there is airports.

1047
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,200
I know I'm very jealous of that.

1048
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,400
Like you the best you would get as a kid would be.

1049
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,440
Yeah, there would be a big like Bugs Bunny statue with the Warner Brothers store

1050
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:40,600
or something now what you have you guys ever been to a mall where I don't remember

1051
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,840
what jeweler chain it is, I know you're talking about.

1052
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:48,880
There is a scary projected head onto kind of a blank surface.

1053
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:53,760
Like it's a female body and most of it is painted and has clothes.

1054
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,280
And then there's just a blank spot where they project a face.

1055
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,080
Yes. And it has a sign on it that says, please don't touch me.

1056
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,120
Yeah, yeah.

1057
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,280
And it's uncomfortably small.

1058
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,920
It's like our proportions, but then like four foot three.

1059
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:10,840
It's weird.

1060
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,200
This is at the Galleria.

1061
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,200
OK, it is.

1062
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:14,880
I believe.

1063
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,080
Yeah, but I've seen it elsewhere, too.

1064
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,120
Could be sales.

1065
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,320
I don't think it's sales, but it is a chain because there's a lot of these.

1066
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,280
I'm wrong. I've been to a lot of malls with this scary floating head.

1067
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,360
I've seen the floating head.

1068
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,320
Yeah, multiple places.

1069
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,440
But that must just be.

1070
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,440
Yeah, I wonder, is it like a chain exclusive character or is it something you

1071
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,080
can just buy that's designed to entice people to come into your store?

1072
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,640
That's the question.

1073
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:43,480
If it's if it's I think it's it is exclusive.

1074
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,080
It's always at the same chain, whatever that is.

1075
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,560
It might not be required that every outlet has it,

1076
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,640
but it is required that it be very scary.

1077
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,520
They keep they keep those standards consistent.

1078
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,720
It's terrifying.

1079
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:04,480
It's not quite a hologram, but it kind of looks like a hologram.

1080
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,320
Yeah. In a way, has anyone seen this?

1081
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,520
Have listeners seen this?

1082
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,280
I'm sure they have.

1083
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:13,360
If I look up hologram woman at mall,

1084
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,560
you might find I found it.

1085
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,880
What's the chain?

1086
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,200
And I found a video of it.

1087
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,040
Every kiss begins with K.

1088
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,600
K jewelers. No, I don't know.

1089
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,160
Hold on.

1090
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,960
No, I'm opening up a TikTok video.

1091
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,800
That's not what I wanted to do, but it's a TikTok video.

1092
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,000
Well, maybe I can see what the name of the place is here.

1093
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,480
OK, TikTok.

1094
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,360
It is Daniels.

1095
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,480
Daniels. Yeah.

1096
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,760
OK, yes.

1097
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:45,280
And this is this is her whole like the bottom is like her head is moving.

1098
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,840
Then the like chest and arms area are

1099
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:51,680
static and then she almost has like a practical bottom half.

1100
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,920
Yeah. So it gets less technologically impressive as it goes down.

1101
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:56,400
Yeah.

1102
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,480
I found an article about it from specifically a Palm Desert one.

1103
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:05,240
The article is called This Awful Hologram Thing at Westfield Palm Desert is Evil

1104
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,200
and should probably be destroyed.

1105
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,880
This is in 2015.

1106
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,680
They were way ahead of we're talking.

1107
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,360
How have we not talked about this scary jewelry hologram until now?

1108
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:16,000
Yeah.

1109
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,560
When the website Cactus Hugs dot com was up on this.

1110
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,600
This is meant to attract.

1111
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,760
I don't know. It's been there for 20 since like 20.

1112
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,600
I'm seeing a video from 2014.

1113
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,720
Creepy hologram at jewelry store.

1114
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:33,240
I don't know, because like that is a place that I would be uncomfortable and not know

1115
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,520
what to do. I would feel out of my depths purchasing a ring.

1116
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,920
Like that's high pressure.

1117
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,000
I don't understand jewelry and what's good jewelry.

1118
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,360
And I'm worried I'm going to get like soaked for a lot of money.

1119
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,880
Yeah. And then so I'm walking up and I'm already nervous about this exchange.

1120
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:52,040
And then a hologram is there with a sign

1121
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,280
pinned to her that says don't touch me.

1122
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,720
And maybe her hologram part isn't working.

1123
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,120
So the face is just blank.

1124
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,320
I'm running away.

1125
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,440
I'm out of this mall.

1126
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:06,040
The Daniels research has found there's a large quadrant of side pieces and gun

1127
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,720
malls who beg their men like, baby,

1128
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:15,120
take me to the baby, take me to the hologram jewelry store.

1129
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,720
I want to buy a ring next to the weird hologram lady.

1130
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,720
You said, wait, wait, side.

1131
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,160
Side pieces and what?

1132
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,160
Gun malls.

1133
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,200
Gun malls.

1134
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:29,680
Gun malls. Like gangsters, gangsters, like mistresses from a movie.

1135
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,160
Wait, so a gun mall means?

1136
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:31,880
Gun mall?

1137
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,000
Gun mall.

1138
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,080
I've never heard this phrase.

1139
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,160
G-U-N-M-O-L-L. Gun mall.

1140
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,320
Oh, mall, not mall.

1141
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,640
Oh, that's confusing.

1142
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,280
We're talking about malls.

1143
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,280
A gun mall.

1144
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,280
M-O-L-L.

1145
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,120
Boy, this is some Jason old timey stuff.

1146
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,280
This is some 1920s.

1147
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:53,280
These supportive women were also called gun malls, not named after the weapon,

1148
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,400
but for goniff, the Yiddish word for thief.

1149
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,040
Mall is a shortened form of the name

1150
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:03,240
Molly, longest synonym for a woman of ill repute for unknown reasons.

1151
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,240
So a side piece and a gun mall are similar.

1152
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,280
Gun mall seems more respected.

1153
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:10,800
That definitely.

1154
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,400
I was going to say, gun mall main, yeah, adds the fact that they're supportive.

1155
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:18,720
If a side piece, not necessarily respectful.

1156
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,040
OK, said the full disclosure.

1157
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,480
The most recent movies I have watched have been The Minions Rise of Gru,

1158
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:29,480
the Broadway Melody of 1940, and I started the Broadway Melody of 1936.

1159
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,480
So because I thought I was.

1160
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,120
No, I started the Broadway Melody of 1938.

1161
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:39,080
I thought I was starting the Broadway Melody of 1936, which has our pal Jack

1162
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,720
Benny in it. OK, great.

1163
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,200
Does he have a gun mall in that movie?

1164
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,160
I don't know.

1165
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,360
Jack Benny.

1166
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,160
We love Jack Benny.

1167
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,800
We're Jack Benny.

1168
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,360
We're Benny bros.

1169
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,080
We're Benny bros.

1170
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:53,040
You toxic Benny bros.

1171
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,400
That's true.

1172
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,720
Wow. Get your fucking fingers away from your cheeks.

1173
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,520
Stop doing those takes at me.

1174
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:03,920
No. And I look bored to the side or annoyed, slightly annoyed.

1175
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,400
OK, got it now.

1176
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,640
So gun mall, gun mall.

1177
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:13,240
That's that's the only that's who I'm guessing is intrigued by the robot,

1178
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,480
by the hologram robot.

1179
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,400
It's also so many dying malls in America.

1180
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,840
That's even the context of what we're saying.

1181
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,440
So you're saying the gun mall is going to be interested in the hologram woman at

1182
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,520
the Daniels jewelry store.

1183
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,160
They're a rub. They're a mark.

1184
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,320
No, but you're making the they're so supportive.

1185
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:27,920
Why would you call them rub?

1186
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,600
They are supportive, but they also want that ring.

1187
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,560
They want the ring, Tony.

1188
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,520
Jason, buy me the ring.

1189
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,520
When are you going to leave your wife?

1190
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,200
Henry.

1191
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:44,360
I want to talk to the hologram.

1192
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,640
I got to go back for my hat.

1193
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,360
I want to touch the hologram, Jason.

1194
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,080
Jason, I want to touch the hologram.

1195
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,200
I want to see if it stings me.

1196
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,960
What does the hologram feel like?

1197
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,640
The deleted scene from Goodfellas.

1198
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:00,320
We always forgot our hat next to the hologram.

1199
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,920
They didn't have the budget at the time to do the hologram.

1200
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,880
The helicopter was expensive.

1201
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:11,680
Jason comes to a recording once he's like, yeah, this year's this year's my gun mall.

1202
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,600
Her name is Trixie.

1203
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,040
Did I tell you I got a new gun mall?

1204
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,240
I got a new gun mall.

1205
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,520
Hey, nice to meet you.

1206
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,280
Nice to meet you, fellas.

1207
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,560
Also, the gun has double meaning.

1208
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,280
Like they say it doesn't, but it has double meaning.

1209
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,040
What do you mean?

1210
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,760
Because gangsters have guns.

1211
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,760
I know what you're saying.

1212
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,520
Gangsters have guns.

1213
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,760
Right. But what is it for?

1214
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,680
Well, they said it's from a Yiddish word.

1215
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,960
Oh, penis?

1216
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:35,920
A penis mall?

1217
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,360
No, I'm saying like guns.

1218
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,840
Gangsters, you know.

1219
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,000
Wait, what's the double meaning of gun?

1220
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,840
They said it was from a Yiddish word,

1221
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,880
but also gangsters are like strap they're carrying.

1222
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:47,560
Yeah.

1223
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,280
OK, so that's one definition of gun.

1224
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,280
What's the other definition is like it comes.

1225
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,920
Goni is the Yiddish word.

1226
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,920
OK, is Goni mean gun?

1227
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,640
No, I think that's two different.

1228
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,480
I think you're missing my point here.

1229
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,480
I am.

1230
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,440
For sure.

1231
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,120
I've been very confused since the gun mall came into the picture.

1232
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,560
Let's get back to Hank and Bob.

1233
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,080
All right.

1234
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,240
Let's get to Hank and Bob.

1235
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,720
So down at the end of the bar,

1236
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:14,800
you've got your favorite buddies from Cheers.

1237
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:15,960
Cliff and Norm?

1238
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,800
No, Hank and Bob.

1239
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,240
Perhaps sensing the possibility that there could be legal troubles or the need

1240
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:28,080
to clear the likenesses of John Ratzenberger and George Wendt,

1241
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:33,240
they decide to just change the names and have two sort of generic barflies,

1242
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:38,360
but who have sort of the same demeanor and by that I mean slump.

1243
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:39,400
They are slumped.

1244
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,600
Yeah, as those characters sometimes work.

1245
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,440
Yes. And it is a real choice here.

1246
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:48,080
And I feel like in anticipation of they knew it was going to happen.

1247
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:52,000
So that's why there was a red flag to begin with.

1248
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,600
If everybody thought everything was fine,

1249
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,920
they would have just called them the characters from the show.

1250
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,080
Yeah. Yes.

1251
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,200
Yeah, clearly they're they're skirting something with this Hank and Bob.

1252
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:06,840
And it's also very ballsy to say, well, I know that you like Cliff and Norm.

1253
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:12,800
And I know that they've been increasingly successful every year for the last nine

1254
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,280
years on television. Yeah.

1255
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,800
I think you're going to come to like these two creepy robots who are different

1256
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,040
just as much as the guys who show up in your house every week.

1257
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,960
Uh huh. Yes. No, this was this was hubris, I guess,

1258
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:31,720
to think that legally ill advised and hubris as well.

1259
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,880
Now, there's there's a lot of articles and odds and ends about this,

1260
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,200
about this weird choice to do these these animatronics and to give them different

1261
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:46,040
names. I feel like all of the articles downplay that they are scary.

1262
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,400
Really? These are so scary.

1263
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,160
There was I remember this being a weird little item.

1264
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:55,720
I think when the lawsuit came back in around 2000 and maybe I was even aware of

1265
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:01,680
this in like 94 or whatever, but they never the articles just said likenesses of

1266
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,080
they're not likenesses of George Winton, John Radzenberger.

1267
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,640
Those guys are nice. I like looking at them.

1268
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:10,080
Look at these things. They're horrible.

1269
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,120
Yeah, proportions are frightening.

1270
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:16,160
They have like really thick brows.

1271
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,840
You know what they're OK.

1272
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,920
First things first,

1273
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:24,440
to my eyes and I don't mean to you know, I'm glad these actors sued.

1274
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,160
They should have.

1275
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,400
But to my eyes, they don't look like Radzenberger and went.

1276
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:33,240
They look like, respectively, John Goodman and Peter Falk.

1277
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,080
Yeah, right.

1278
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,080
Aren't those so much closer?

1279
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,080
Yeah, for sure. That's who should have sued.

1280
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:42,120
It was different beloved television actors who should have gone after.

1281
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,840
I feel like they may be almost all.

1282
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,080
Yeah. Purposeful to do that.

1283
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,520
Yeah, maybe. Yeah.

1284
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,920
Marble like someone else like throw them off the track.

1285
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:51,880
We don't know.

1286
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,920
It can't this can't be a rip off of George Wynn.

1287
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,360
It looks like Colombo.

1288
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,560
Yeah, I think that's probably their logic.

1289
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,240
Yeah. And yeah, it still didn't work.

1290
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,680
I feel like they took I think they took

1291
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:08,600
molds of John Goodman and Peter Falk from wax museums and then just like

1292
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,480
stretched them out like, well, they're still wet.

1293
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:15,880
Just really stretch them, make them really wide faces and that'll throw

1294
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,040
everybody off the trail besides the likeness thing.

1295
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,280
So scary.

1296
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,600
So it's an aesthetic that reminds me a lot of a couple of things.

1297
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,840
The video Land of Confusion by Genesis.

1298
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,240
Yes, which big scary.

1299
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,440
But Reagan and I forget who else.

1300
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,080
Yeah. Yeah. Horrifying.

1301
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,800
And it's a kind of a similar vibe to that.

1302
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,240
If you can imagine the word upsetting being before Sid and Marty Croft,

1303
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,960
the show DC Follies, their their weird, scary puppet show.

1304
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:48,560
This was a real thing in the late 80s, early 90s was

1305
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:55,360
if there's a celebrity, a figure who we know, let's render them giant,

1306
01:02:55,360 --> 01:03:01,880
massive, maybe bigger than the people themselves and as like bulbous figures

1307
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:05,960
who look like they've had like potatoes surgically implanted into their cheeks

1308
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,720
and brows. I hate this aesthetic.

1309
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,560
Yeah. Like anything like this.

1310
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:11,560
Yeah.

1311
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,280
It reminds me of the thing that is was

1312
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:19,280
memory hold when it came out, there was a puppet show a couple of summers ago

1313
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,920
called Let's Be Real.

1314
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,400
Oh, yes. Well, this was a this was a smigel.

1315
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,360
I knew people who worked on this.

1316
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:25,360
Yeah.

1317
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,120
But it's scary.

1318
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,040
Puppets are scary.

1319
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,920
It's based on a French show.

1320
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:35,720
And I don't I remember seeing ads for it and I I don't remember airing.

1321
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:36,840
Yeah. Yeah.

1322
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:41,600
I think did not get a lot of this funny odds and ends on less and earned by those

1323
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:47,440
puppets than like they aren't as like disgustingly pasty.

1324
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,600
And then like the hand.

1325
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:49,800
Look at these hands.

1326
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,080
These are I also feel like I think Peter Falk here is supposed to be holding a

1327
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:59,360
beer and he's and he's not like they forgot to do they have to pour fresh beer

1328
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:02,160
for they had to waste beer on.

1329
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:07,920
It seemed like there was mention of bartenders occasionally serving

1330
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,600
cool. I mean that I yeah, I like that.

1331
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,840
But it make our friend Taffer really upset.

1332
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:13,400
Yeah.

1333
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,080
Throwing beers away.

1334
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,800
You're serving them to the public.

1335
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,360
Robots don't have a stomach.

1336
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,280
Puppets can't drink.

1337
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,600
How many of you serve Tankin Bob?

1338
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,320
Are you not keeping track?

1339
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,160
You're liable.

1340
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,680
This is why your kids ran away.

1341
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,320
I think he would also be upset.

1342
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,880
The whole thing with Taffer is like maximizing space.

1343
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:42,120
Oh, yeah. You're giving two seats all day every day to pump it.

1344
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,720
He like comes in with like a comically large calculator.

1345
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,200
He's like, OK, let me he's doing that.

1346
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,600
Like he has this quiet voice and he's like, well, you know, we're going to use

1347
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:53,840
Bartek dot com here and learn bartender.

1348
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,000
That's how you calculate.

1349
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,000
It's like usually ten thousand dollars a seat in some of these places.

1350
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,640
Does a complex mathematics.

1351
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:04,360
Somebody else does it and then he explains how much you're losing.

1352
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:04,960
Yes.

1353
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:09,440
And the permit if I were if I were a cheers employee who was forced to take an

1354
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,040
acting class, who he's yelling at, I might say, look, there's nothing stopping

1355
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,120
a customer from sitting in their laps.

1356
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:15,960
They are people.

1357
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,360
Anybody is welcome to sit in Hank and Bob's lap.

1358
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:18,680
Right.

1359
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,000
We would never stop anybody.

1360
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,640
These are seats

1361
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,560
and he wouldn't be able to say anything

1362
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,600
that would finally that would shut him down.

1363
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,040
Yeah.

1364
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,560
For the first time. Right.

1365
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,960
That'll be the series finale of Barresco.

1366
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,280
I'm a fraud.

1367
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,200
I've met my man.

1368
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,120
I guess I die.

1369
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,480
I'm out of my depths here.

1370
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:44,440
They remind me to of they're like big versions of the Garbage Pail Kids movie.

1371
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,960
Oh, yeah.

1372
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:47,960
They are.

1373
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,000
They're also those photos of them are

1374
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:57,080
particularly lit in a way that looks like the most seedy lighting you've ever seen.

1375
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,560
The black and white one looks like a nightmare.

1376
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:01,360
They look like those Polaroids.

1377
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,520
I got black and white right here.

1378
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:03,480
Horrifying.

1379
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,200
Yeah.

1380
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,800
Scary in a different way.

1381
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:06,680
They look different.

1382
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,120
Actually, the mold looks completely different.

1383
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:09,880
I don't again.

1384
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,120
I don't know which is which.

1385
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:15,320
This is where maybe Paramount has something and Host International has

1386
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,520
something in the case.

1387
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,720
They do not look like Ratzenberg.

1388
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,320
I know they're supposed to represent.

1389
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,000
I'm I'm on their side.

1390
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,400
I'm on the actor's side.

1391
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:28,200
Yeah. However, they look like anyone but George Winton, John Ratzenberg.

1392
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,080
Yeah. You know what?

1393
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:33,040
Maybe I'm not on the actor's side if I think about it because they changed the name

1394
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,400
and they don't look like them.

1395
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:41,640
So I guess the only thing is just in their placement at the bar.

1396
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:42,880
It's pretty similar.

1397
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,120
Yeah, that's part of it.

1398
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:49,800
So if you have facsimiles of when you use the word barfly,

1399
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,680
yeah, and they're slumped and they're in that spot, they're kind of like at the

1400
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:59,600
corner, then there you are infringing on Norman.

1401
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,560
Interesting. I mean, look, I'm all for anyone getting any money out of

1402
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,600
corporation they can. So I guess I have to support the actors.

1403
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,680
But it is mostly bar placement, I suppose.

1404
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,440
And maybe stature, I guess that's similar.

1405
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:17,040
So that's really what their objection was to.

1406
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:21,520
If I were them, I mean, trying to get the money sounds tempting.

1407
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,320
But in raising my hand to do this lawsuit,

1408
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:31,160
I'm telling the world that I think I look like this, that I look like I now I can't

1409
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:38,520
place the there's like the hideous old like right wing politicians who was there

1410
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,200
kind of Henry Hyde. Does that seem right?

1411
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:44,600
Yeah, you look like a little bit of a hastert.

1412
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,480
Yeah, yeah, I look like I look like

1413
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:55,040
disgusting bulbous political cartoons of hateful politicians like Ralph Steadman

1414
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,640
drawing. I look like a big piece of shit.

1415
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,960
And look at the side by sides, which will post.

1416
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,880
I think they look particularly handsome here.

1417
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:09,040
Ratzenberger, I think Ratzenberger can get it in this photo, not like this melting

1418
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,440
Peter Falk here.

1419
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,440
Peter Falk, a very handsome guy in his younger days, too.

1420
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,520
Yeah, other days, you might say as well.

1421
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,520
Quite certainly a charm.

1422
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,080
Silver Fox. But yeah, those early Columbus.

1423
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:26,720
Oh, there's that weird pre series Colombo where they like haven't settled

1424
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:30,040
everything yet, where he's like just holding his coat a lot.

1425
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,240
And his hair is real neatly combed.

1426
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,840
Oh, really? And figure it all out.

1427
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,680
Yeah. Like grabbing his head all the time.

1428
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:36,600
Yeah. Wow.

1429
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,640
There's also the spinoff series,

1430
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,880
Mrs. Colombo, in which he did not participate.

1431
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,400
And there's almost there's no interaction.

1432
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,960
There's no there's nothing indicating

1433
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,560
how people know each other other than the title, which marries them.

1434
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,000
Is that Kate Mulgrew?

1435
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,600
It's Kate Mulgrew.

1436
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,080
Right, right, right.

1437
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,400
Yeah. Insane.

1438
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:01,080
That's a that's a really weird pop culture asterisk, much like Gunmall.

1439
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,040
I watched a few Columbus lately.

1440
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:08,320
It's very funny because Peter Falk is doing like a very 70s kind of naturalistic

1441
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:13,920
acting and everyone else is doing that fake, stiff, like non-existent mid

1442
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:17,480
Atlantic acts like I thought we were going to the ball tonight.

1443
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:21,000
Like Peter Falk comes in all grungy and scratching his head.

1444
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,200
Oh, but you also you get a lot of good.

1445
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:26,880
You get every you get Leslie Nielsen, you get George Kennedy.

1446
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:31,240
Oh, yeah. You get you get so many greats in all of those.

1447
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:36,240
I can we do it second gate about the Colombo episode shot at Universal Studios?

1448
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,440
Yes, do sometimes involve like the shark.

1449
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,480
Oh, yeah. Actually, really just all because Murder She Wrote went there.

1450
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,160
So many. Yeah, yeah.

1451
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:49,240
I watch and love and love my heart opens up when I realize that the show is just

1452
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:53,600
using the back lot this week to find our way to that shark somehow.

1453
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:57,160
Was there ever a Kodak that used the had to be must have been.

1454
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,720
Yeah, well, look, there had to have been baby.

1455
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,280
We're going to find it. Damn it.

1456
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:06,800
I walk from the Sheraton right to the Jimmy Stewart gate entrance.

1457
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,960
The biggest obstacle is that the the Sheraton is pretty far from the shark.

1458
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:12,560
Yeah, you always.

1459
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:16,800
So there's got to be a golf cart and for sure he's not he's not doing it.

1460
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,880
He did. He just have his own golf cart parked in the Sheraton.

1461
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,880
Maybe. But he also like, hey, I want to be sloppy.

1462
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,080
I want to get sloppy.

1463
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,840
I don't want to worry about driving that thing myself.

1464
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,280
I need a chauffeur, baby, so I can drive it into the lake if I feel like it.

1465
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,920
Maybe I want to take a bath with the shark, baby.

1466
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:37,400
What a limiter on this thing.

1467
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,240
Ten miles an hour is too fast.

1468
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:43,320
Get it down to two so I can't do any damage.

1469
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:49,960
So what did Hank and Bob do?

1470
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:55,200
I like the detail that a Hollywood screenwriter was brought in to write jokes

1471
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,360
for them to say.

1472
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,720
And there's only one example that I could find.

1473
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,320
Basically, here's how it would work.

1474
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,000
Here's a quote from some other article.

1475
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:06,120
They sort of slump forward at the bar and then every few minutes they sit up

1476
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,280
straight, look at each other and have jovial conversations.

1477
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:13,480
And that would go something like, didn't the doc tell you to watch what you eat?

1478
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:18,400
I am. I'm making sure I'm watching to make sure I don't eat anything healthy.

1479
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,400
And then they and then like,

1480
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:26,640
a lot of sit there like the most depressed drunkards

1481
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,600
just staring into their beer, thinking about their life, thinking about it.

1482
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,720
I can make jokes about it all day, but I am going to die.

1483
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,280
My health is very poor.

1484
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,080
I'm ailing.

1485
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,960
I don't even go to a doctor.

1486
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,240
I'm afraid to.

1487
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:44,640
I sit in this airport for a flight that will never come until the Reaper arrives

1488
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,720
to take me if you were the last flight to hell.

1489
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,960
If you want to close enough to the robot, you would hear all these sentences.

1490
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,160
But it would be really a hush whisper.

1491
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,920
They did. They were rare robots programmed with an internal monologue.

1492
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,680
Yeah, if you got close enough.

1493
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,960
Yeah, you could hear over the machine worrying.

1494
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,160
Get me. Get me out of here.

1495
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,840
I know I'm no cliff.

1496
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,280
Who do I think I am?

1497
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,440
I was made to be an imitation.

1498
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,160
And if I break, they're going to throw me in the trash.

1499
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,080
Take me home with you.

1500
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,440
They said they got a screenwriter to write these lines.

1501
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:21,120
So it is possible that like the lance got half a million dollars.

1502
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,520
I have a land.

1503
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,760
It's not as good.

1504
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,200
His life is a joke.

1505
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,640
You think he's a joke writer.

1506
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,160
I feel like he might have.

1507
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,520
Probably did the stars.

1508
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,400
I should say that.

1509
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,960
Special is long. That is a story.

1510
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,360
You're right. Yeah.

1511
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,120
I couldn't can't be just David.

1512
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,280
Not David Kep.

1513
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:38,880
Yeah, he could be Bruce.

1514
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:40,160
Might have been kept.

1515
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,080
Might have been kept.

1516
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,080
That Carlito Heat.

1517
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,280
Something that I saw said this was a weird like.

1518
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,240
It wasn't really a fact oriented article.

1519
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:49,040
It was like a blurb.

1520
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,880
It might have been in the New Yorker that was discussing the legal situation

1521
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:56,840
with Wynn and Ratzenberger, but it was also really judging this situation

1522
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:01,880
and this this robot set up and it said this case lacks a certain frisian frisian

1523
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,600
because the robots are so unfunny.

1524
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:09,840
Quotes one person involved in the case who said they didn't bring in customers.

1525
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:13,600
And when they broke, they were generally thrown away,

1526
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,280
genuinely thrown away,

1527
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:18,680
generally generally thrown away.

1528
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,000
And genuinely, they were thrown away.

1529
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:28,640
So if you're out in New Zealand and your hank breaks and you don't really sense

1530
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:32,680
that Hank is bringing in the customers anyway and you don't want to get somebody

1531
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:38,160
from America in to fix Hank, maybe your solution is to throw Hank away.

1532
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,000
Give Hank his final flight.

1533
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,600
There had to have been a situation, though,

1534
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:44,720
where they just like threw a tarp over him for a while.

1535
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,000
He was probably heavy.

1536
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:46,560
Yeah.

1537
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,640
Yeah. Like I'm busy.

1538
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,200
I'm trying to get orders out.

1539
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:54,080
I don't have time to move this animatronic that's twice as heavy as me.

1540
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:54,640
Right.

1541
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,680
And then people are going to think I'm hauling a body.

1542
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:57,600
I'm going to get arrested.

1543
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,920
I'm going to get accused of being a terrorist.

1544
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,720
Right. Right.

1545
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,000
Hiding a corpse.

1546
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,320
I

1547
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,680
it's maybe it would be funny if they were all

1548
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:12,360
disposed of in the same place and there was just a mass grave of Hanks.

1549
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,560
Hank robots.

1550
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,200
It's like the E.T. video game.

1551
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,760
Yeah, right.

1552
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,840
Hanks as far as the eye can see.

1553
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,600
Two dozen Hanks.

1554
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,880
Well, if that's what I want out of the Breaking Bad, too.

1555
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,040
A big mass.

1556
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:29,440
That's sort of something real from the show.

1557
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:32,280
Just to quickly Doug Grave that Hank is thrown in.

1558
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,520
Right.

1559
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:37,440
If there was a chain of these in airports and there's always a Hank,

1560
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,440
in the restaurant, like looking out for clues.

1561
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:41,920
Right. And then he gets.

1562
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,440
Yeah, they bury him in the desert.

1563
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,880
He doesn't get dissolved.

1564
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,320
They don't have time. No, no, no.

1565
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,880
Yeah. Joe, the Nazi kills him.

1566
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,920
No, he's just tossed in there.

1567
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:59,480
I so yeah, the Hanks, the Bob's and Hanks just ended up in a giant grave together.

1568
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,360
They're rotting away. You can find that somewhere.

1569
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,080
It's either in New Zealand or Vancouver.

1570
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:08,960
It looks like it looks like the casino scene with Pesci and his brother

1571
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:12,040
where they take him in the desert and they bury them together.

1572
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:13,560
Brothers. Is it his brother?

1573
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,800
And then him.

1574
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,080
He's he's buried alive and the other guy's dead.

1575
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:21,680
They made this guy, Stan Novak from Host International do it.

1576
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:25,240
He had to he had to dig a grave that could fit 24 robots.

1577
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,560
Right. Took him out in the desert.

1578
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,920
Why are you bringing me here?

1579
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,960
You know, I just wanted to, you know,

1580
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:37,640
you've had such a nice career of cracking jokes about your doctor.

1581
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,080
I just wanted to give you a nice view, buddy.

1582
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,040
I'm trying to not eat healthy.

1583
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,000
I'm trying to not eat healthy.

1584
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,280
Yeah, we know, we know.

1585
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:51,240
Oh, it still makes me laugh as much as it did the first time I met you, buddy.

1586
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:56,000
Hey, the other robot just gets like his head sliced off.

1587
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,920
What did you do to Bob?

1588
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,640
I'm trying to eat healthy.

1589
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,240
I'm trying to eat healthy.

1590
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,280
That's right. Look at the rabbits.

1591
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,800
That's right.

1592
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:12,160
He only says it says the words, but in a different reflection, a fearful reflection.

1593
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,760
You don't eat healthy.

1594
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,120
Oh, so sad.

1595
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:20,440
Well, that's what that's exactly what happened to Bob and Hank.

1596
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,320
And besides that, they did this legal.

1597
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:28,880
So I think the legal troubles began circa 1993.

1598
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,560
I think right as Cheers was going off the air,

1599
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:36,560
what should have been just a fun time getting blackout drunk with Jay Leno instead

1600
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:40,000
turned into a nightmare for old Cliff and Norm.

1601
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:43,040
They spent the next eight years in court.

1602
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:45,200
I mean, probably not them.

1603
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,680
Oh, yeah, I know.

1604
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,800
They just had it bothered them sometimes.

1605
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,120
They're trying to do other things.

1606
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:55,360
You know, George is focusing on his lines and for the super fan sketches.

1607
01:16:55,560 --> 01:17:01,120
Right. And he and somebody tells him, hey, there's new progress in that Hank trial.

1608
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:07,080
It was a distraction for these great actors and still going in 2001.

1609
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,920
That's what this got a whole new round of press then because it made it all the way

1610
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,000
up to the Supreme Court.

1611
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,880
And there was this is September 2000.

1612
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:23,440
The Supreme Court, just months away from

1613
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:27,440
rigging the right US election

1614
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:32,640
from creating our horrible alternate dimension nightmare that we're still in.

1615
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,760
But they had to deal with this a lot.

1616
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:38,240
This was the innocent, more fun days for the Supreme Court.

1617
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:39,880
They're dealing with the case Wentz and

1618
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:43,240
Ratzenberger versus Host International and Paramount Pictures.

1619
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,040
I don't quite understand how this works.

1620
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:51,440
I think it was they didn't decide the case, but they did say this has to go to trial.

1621
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:53,840
Paramount, you've avoided this long enough.

1622
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:58,080
You have to in Los Angeles actually take this to trial.

1623
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,840
And they thought, well, that's not good.

1624
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:02,880
And Paramount had, by the way, had won previously.

1625
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:07,080
Yes, they were successful in some of these, but the actors kept fighting,

1626
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,880
made it to the Supreme Court many years later.

1627
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,000
Right. And they kicked it down, essentially.

1628
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,640
Yeah, they are not going to hear it.

1629
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,600
They said we will not be hearing this.

1630
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,280
They knew they had big plans.

1631
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:23,800
A few months they were they were making the hanging shad ballots themselves.

1632
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,520
They were preparing them to cause the confusion.

1633
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,680
They kicked it back to L.A.

1634
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,320
And yet Paramount settled.

1635
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:31,800
Paramount settled. Yeah.

1636
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,560
So these guys, they got something.

1637
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:37,160
Yeah. Ultimately, we don't know.

1638
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,480
I'm sure that was part of the deal.

1639
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:41,600
They don't say, yeah, yeah, how much they were compensated.

1640
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:47,600
But eased the pain and, you know, added a little bit of extra to Ratzenberger's

1641
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:53,600
bank account already appearing in all of the most successful animated films

1642
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,040
of all time. Yes.

1643
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:57,360
And the most successful sitcom.

1644
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:58,320
Hey, good for you.

1645
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,400
You know what? Good. That's great.

1646
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:01,920
Sure. Get money from Paramount.

1647
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:04,520
Yeah. I encourage anyone to sue Paramount.

1648
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:05,600
Just try it.

1649
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,600
There's probably a reason to.

1650
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,600
I just finished the Summoner Redstone book.

1651
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,400
There's a whole lot of suing of Paramount going on.

1652
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,080
Great. And rightfully so.

1653
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:15,840
Yeah. So do it.

1654
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:19,200
I found there's a post about this on that Reddit.

1655
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,840
Today I learned. Oh, yeah.

1656
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:26,000
Subreddit and it quickly devolves into people talking about whether Cheers

1657
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:31,160
holds up or not and some condescending like, well, if you don't remember the 80s,

1658
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:32,640
Cheers was a hit show.

1659
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:34,360
Like, oh, God.

1660
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,600
But there was a couple of posts of people who had been there.

1661
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:40,440
Oh, good.

1662
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:44,160
This user says, I had a couple of beers,

1663
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:47,920
one of these in a layover to Vegas in ninety nine.

1664
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:49,680
I think it was in Arizona.

1665
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:50,960
It was terrible.

1666
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:52,880
Got old in about 10 minutes.

1667
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:57,640
I can't imagine being a bartender and having to listen to Robot Norman Cliffs.

1668
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,920
Awful jokes all day.

1669
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:02,080
This is this one is better.

1670
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,800
This is more of our alley.

1671
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,800
I was a kid growing up in Alaska when they installed the one in the Anchorage,

1672
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,920
Alaska airport. I remember my parents pointing out the two dummies on the end

1673
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,920
of the bar thinking it was delightful.

1674
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:20,080
And I reacted like a startled animal.

1675
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:24,000
I can't look in the direction of that bar every single time.

1676
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:27,920
We I couldn't look in the direction of that bar every single time we passed

1677
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,880
through. Yeah. Yeah.

1678
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,520
This would have been for sure if we had gone in there as kids,

1679
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:35,560
we would have hated that because of those creepy robots.

1680
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,040
Yeah, here's a photo.

1681
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:40,040
Again, one of the only existing photos out there.

1682
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,680
Here is a color photo.

1683
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,360
And, you know, here is here is the bar and it looks pretty.

1684
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,200
This shows you kind of the design of the place and it does look nice.

1685
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:53,160
And then here's a bunch of real patrons and what from behind also look like real

1686
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:58,280
patrons. How creepy is that knowing that you might make it a few steps ahead and

1687
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:03,840
then look and go, ah, they're in their own little their own little corner.

1688
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:09,040
But it looks like the service and like they were next to the like like a waiter

1689
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:14,760
with a tray could like whang them by like you can show them if you're going by

1690
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,800
too fast. Yeah. Like the fluid starts leaking out of their neck.

1691
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:24,360
Yeah. Do you whiz by them and like cut the cut their main robot artery and like oil

1692
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,360
just shoots out that paring knife, that bar knife.

1693
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:32,360
This is like my my favorite.

1694
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:37,000
I wish in that reddit somewhere somebody said how, yeah, I was at the Boston

1695
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:42,960
location and one time a bartender was cutting a lime and a tiny drop of lime

1696
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:47,280
juice splashed onto Hank and he caught fire immediately.

1697
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:53,560
My dad was sitting next to them and my dad suffered second degree burns.

1698
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:57,280
Like it's in scratchy land.

1699
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:58,640
That's why there's no pictures.

1700
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:02,200
The camera flashes would make them go insane.

1701
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,160
Yeah, they got up and started smashing glasses.

1702
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:09,760
They started they would do they would freak out and start throwing their Stein

1703
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:13,040
mugs at anyone within 10 feet.

1704
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,040
Many flights had to be canceled.

1705
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,080
Yeah.

1706
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:19,680
When will that road construction project end?

1707
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:23,840
When will that Boston Road construction project?

1708
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:28,040
I wish now these started closing in 2001.

1709
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:34,120
It is just imagine for a minute the alternate version of history where at the

1710
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:41,360
exact at a perfect precise moment, some Bloody Mary mix spills onto Hank and Bob

1711
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:46,160
in the Boston airport and at just the right time they freak out.

1712
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:51,520
They start going Frankenstein running around and a couple of people clang right

1713
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:56,520
into those heavy robotic hands and history changes for changes.

1714
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:59,800
Yeah, it could have happened.

1715
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,320
But the robot, he knocked that guy.

1716
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,880
He had a box cutter hidden.

1717
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,800
They knocked him right out of his sleeve.

1718
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,080
They could have done what Mark Wahlberg said he could.

1719
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,160
He could have done.

1720
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,880
Oh, he claims he would have stopped.

1721
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:12,480
I think so. Right. Mark Wahlberg, the guy.

1722
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,080
Yeah. Yeah. He claimed he could have stopped.

1723
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,240
Wahlberg's Wahlberg's kind of a tank.

1724
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:19,160
He's a very cut guy, but he's no he's no robot.

1725
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:24,800
I think you need do you need somebody with the metallic heft of Hank and Bob

1726
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,040
to clock terrorists? I agree.

1727
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:30,360
Yeah. I don't remember the order in which it happened.

1728
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:33,040
But what if you were just saying, look, a box cutter.

1729
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:36,640
Let's warn the other airports and they get to them right in time.

1730
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,280
Entire thing averted.

1731
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:39,760
It all goes away.

1732
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:42,520
Hank and Bob are heroes and I could Bob are heroes.

1733
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,240
And then we watched George W.

1734
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:49,840
Bush give medals to Bob on television.

1735
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:53,800
This is the next Quentin Tarantino movie.

1736
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,680
It's another changing history.

1737
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:57,480
As for your writing history.

1738
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:59,920
Yeah, it's a really good idea.

1739
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:01,960
Cheers robots go haywire.

1740
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,000
Right. And what if it's?

1741
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,200
And let's just make it really convenient.

1742
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:09,880
And the Paramount has settled and they have to start removing them from the

1743
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,240
locations and these are the last two around.

1744
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,440
Every other Hank and Bob has been thrown

1745
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:18,560
into a mass grave at the request of Retsenberger and went

1746
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:21,240
and the only two left and it's their final day.

1747
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,960
They're going to they're going to like at noon.

1748
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:26,600
We're going to throw these guys into the pit.

1749
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,440
Right. But instead, magic.

1750
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:30,640
Wow.

1751
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:35,240
Wow. And then and Hank and Bob get the 2004

1752
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:39,120
Democratic nomination instead of Carrie and Edward.

1753
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:40,480
And they do it.

1754
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:42,240
They do it.

1755
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:43,560
They take it all away.

1756
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:44,400
Yeah.

1757
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,640
That convention was held in North Carolina.

1758
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,680
So there's probably a Hank and Bob somewhere.

1759
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,640
It's North Carolina. One of the plane one of the airports.

1760
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,400
Uh huh.

1761
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:56,320
Wow. Which in looking at the two and I don't know which is which.

1762
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:57,840
I think.

1763
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:58,680
Oh, here.

1764
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:06,200
I think the dark hair actually is I think Hank is Columbo and Bob is John Goodman.

1765
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,040
Right. Who seems more presidential to you?

1766
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:10,520
Hmm.

1767
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:13,400
Well, Hank Bob, Hank Bob, Bob, and I'm right.

1768
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,920
Am I right?

1769
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,880
I would say that in the modern time,

1770
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:20,480
like Hank looks like Theodore Roosevelt or something like he's definitely

1771
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:22,600
presidential, but in like an old timey way.

1772
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:23,800
Yeah, sure.

1773
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,960
But Bob, I guess maybe they're they're both far too young.

1774
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:28,800
That's true. Yeah.

1775
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,560
I mean, granted, this was the Bush and Obama era when we were willing to have

1776
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,640
presidents under 70. Yeah, right.

1777
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,400
Right. Well, thank God that's over.

1778
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:37,360
Yeah.

1779
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:42,160
But you get you gain knowledge and competence with age.

1780
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:43,880
That's right. All human beings.

1781
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:45,480
And you go out on top.

1782
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:48,200
You always go out the sharpest you've ever been.

1783
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,200
Is your brain has the most information.

1784
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,400
That's right. That's how it works.

1785
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:57,040
Yeah. People like I've heard people say nice things about is it whose governor of

1786
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,880
Illinois is a Pritzker, J.B. Pritzker, J.B. Pritzker.

1787
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:01,960
Oh, yeah. He's got to wait a few more decades.

1788
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,480
Yeah.

1789
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:05,080
Mike got so excited.

1790
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,520
He dropped his phone.

1791
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:07,600
Pritzker mania.

1792
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,160
Mike is Pritzker fever.

1793
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,880
Pritzker dressed up as a Jedi for Halloween one year.

1794
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:12,800
Wow.

1795
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,760
Pritzker is couldn't be.

1796
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,240
He's the most Chicago man alive.

1797
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:20,400
Yeah. Just if you look him up, more than Blagojevich.

1798
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:22,160
Yeah, more than Blagojevich.

1799
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,160
He's got a shot.

1800
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,800
Actually, wait, Hank kind of looks like Blagojevich.

1801
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,520
She's got that hair that's he does.

1802
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:31,640
We're way, way big, puffy hair that goes way down his forehead.

1803
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,920
Now, a fellow podcaster.

1804
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,040
Oh, yeah.

1805
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:37,840
Hey, shout out.

1806
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,200
Is it called the Rodcast?

1807
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,640
Oh, maybe.

1808
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,240
Did be. Could be on.

1809
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:48,440
He'll be on. I have one more little factoid about all this.

1810
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:52,480
And then this is a real story, not an alternate history.

1811
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:56,920
The guy who kind of saw this whole thing through Stan Novak.

1812
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:00,800
Well, he's he remained working in the

1813
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:07,200
the airplane, the airport restaurant business and in his dealings at the company

1814
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:14,360
that renamed HMS Host, why he had a meeting with a restaurateur

1815
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:17,080
and a sometimes musician, but that's less important.

1816
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:22,000
A fellow named Sammy Hagar and he approached Sammy Hagar and he said,

1817
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:27,680
what if our nation's great airports could have your great Cabo Wabo brand in them?

1818
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:30,320
And Sammy said, hell no, brother.

1819
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:31,520
I'd never do that.

1820
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:33,840
Cabo Wabo is a destination.

1821
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:38,000
That's the place you go on the airplane to relax and get away.

1822
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:40,760
That can't be what you pass when you're stressed out.

1823
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,320
No way. No how.

1824
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,680
No Cabo Airport.

1825
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:48,560
Guy says, would you do something else called Sammy's Beach Bar and Grill?

1826
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,280
Yeah, sounds good. Let's do it.

1827
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:52,040
We'll do as many as we can.

1828
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:54,720
Actually, how would you like to come work for me?

1829
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:57,200
And he did. This guy got lured away.

1830
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:03,000
The guy who masterminded the Cheers Bar is now a great business colleague of the great

1831
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,320
Sammy Hagar. Man, what a story.

1832
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,680
Honestly, a win for the guy, I think.

1833
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:08,600
Probably.

1834
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:13,960
Are you watching Sammy Hagar's Rock and Roll Road trip on Access TV like I am?

1835
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:15,600
Can you believe the answer is no?

1836
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:18,000
Well, that's where live from Darrell's House is on often.

1837
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,200
So I don't think I have any source of access TV at the moment.

1838
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,640
OK, where is it on Pluto?

1839
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:25,200
Where do I watch? I actually don't know the answer.

1840
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:26,920
But I have it on this.

1841
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:32,160
This is a channel that only people north of 55 and you have, I think, is like Mark

1842
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:33,680
Cuban interested in this.

1843
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:34,800
Cuban's involved.

1844
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:38,800
And it's just like somebody is pushing their like old, old rocker agenda with

1845
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,400
this station where it's just so many old rock and roll guys shows.

1846
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,320
I mean, it does. I'm sure I would watch something on this.

1847
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:47,040
Yeah. Yeah.

1848
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:50,120
So Sammy goes, just goes around and he chats with people and then they play a

1849
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,280
song or two. Wow. Yeah.

1850
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,960
Maybe sometimes this guy Fieri's like it all depends.

1851
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:57,920
I don't believe it. Those two.

1852
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:00,000
Yes. Would they get along to?

1853
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:02,400
Yeah. Believe it or not, they're like minded

1854
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:03,800
about a number of things.

1855
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,240
They're a Hank and Bob.

1856
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:07,600
Yeah. Real pair.

1857
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,000
I can't get Bob. Yeah.

1858
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:13,240
The other guy, McGrath, helped Bob a gum shrimp expand.

1859
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,720
Right. Oh, wow.

1860
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,000
OK. I salute him.

1861
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:17,720
And won some Tonys.

1862
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:20,960
Oh, really? Like it says Hare and Warhorse.

1863
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:24,160
Wow. These are like the hemi's in the industry.

1864
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,520
He's all the greats came out.

1865
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:31,560
If you look, there's one bond that ties together all the greats in business.

1866
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:36,840
They all worked on the Cheers Airport bar that tried to rip off George Wynn.

1867
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,440
It's like

1868
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:41,680
the date or was it

1869
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:42,720
the news?

1870
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:46,040
It was like the show that was like the first job for like Greg Daniels.

1871
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,160
Not necessarily necessarily the news.

1872
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:49,640
Yeah. Yep.

1873
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:55,680
They all said Caesar's your show of shows of themed experiential

1874
01:29:55,880 --> 01:30:01,040
bar restaurants based on really specific adults, not that kid friendly.

1875
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,400
Right. Right.

1876
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:05,600
Well, hey, thanks, guys.

1877
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,720
We sure know their names now.

1878
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:11,120
Yeah. Stan Novak and something McGrath

1879
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,760
and Hank and Bob.

1880
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:18,560
Names that will live in infamy, as will the phrase Gunmall.

1881
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:21,360

1886
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:36,600
Fun stuff to talk about

1887
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,920
and beautiful.

1888
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:43,480
Now I'm just dreaming of actually other quote in that San Diego story, fairly

1889
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,720
actual quote from him like, well, I don't know.

1890
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:48,000
Is there some other concept that you want to do in an airport?

1891
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:51,200
He said, how about a beachside Palapa?

1892
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:52,160
Oh, what?

1893
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:53,600
Yeah, that's a word I didn't know either.

1894
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,960
Yeah, I have the glossary.

1895
01:30:56,160 --> 01:31:00,040
But would have would have would have gone mall want to go to a beachside Palapa.

1896
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:02,760
Yeah, would she take me to a beachside Palapa?

1897
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:06,520
Would you take your side piece to a beachside Palapa?

1898
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:11,080
Well, when I look up what Palapa was, I'll have an answer for you.

1899
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:12,600
I'll get back to you next time.

1900
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:13,800
Yeah.
