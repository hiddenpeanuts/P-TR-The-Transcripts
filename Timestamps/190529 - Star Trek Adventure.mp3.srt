1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,920
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate,

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,000
where your Star Trek adventure continues.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,880
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,880
and Jason Sheridan.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,720
Hello.

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,080
And yes, we are here now to,

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,360
if you can imagine there's more Star Trek to talk about

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,960
besides the Incredible Vegas experience,

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,240
but this isn't the experience, this is the adventure.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,480
The adventure.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,480
But also the adventure is what the Hollywood one was called,

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,440
Universal Studios Hollywood.

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,060
In Florida, what was it, it was technically really called,

15
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,040
it was part of the Screen Test Home Video Adventure.

16
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,880
Right.

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,520
Yes, brought to you by JVC or MCA.

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,960
I mean all of them probably.

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,800
All of them.

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,640
JVC sounds right, I mean MCA owned the parks.

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,480
Yeah, it was a parent company.

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,000
JVC was presumably showing off videotape technology.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,160
But then also we're talking about

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,040
King's Dominion thing too.

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,360
This is just catch all other trick shit.

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,200
Yes.

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,040
Yeah.

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,400
So my experience with Star Trek in the parks

29
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,760
is mainly, I alluded to on the full length episode,

30
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,360
was at King's Dominion.

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,600
Now King's Dominion, we talked a little bit

32
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,760
about their history.

33
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,400
Came up a little on Kings Island, kind of a sister park.

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,320
So King's Dominion in Virginia,

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,800
growing up my family would go there occasionally.

36
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,400
And for a long time, the company that owned them

37
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,440
also had owned or had the license

38
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,760
for the Hanna Barbera characters.

39
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,380
So Yogi Bears walking around Scooby Doo.

40
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,360
We go to Yogi Bears Cave.

41
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,440
Flintstone, Huckleberry, Hound picture.

42
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,240
You had to get your picture with them.

43
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,400
Then in the early 90s, Paramount, the movie studio,

44
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,360
bought them and formed Paramount parks.

45
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,200
So then you would see things like,

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,160
here is a Wayne's World themed roller coaster.

47
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,360
You'd see Sumner Redstone walking around grabbing butts.

48
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,640
You'd see Sumner in his diaper walking around.

49
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,480
He would have his diaper with the hole for his boner.

50
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,320
The kids area, it's still a little bit

51
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,200
of Richard Scarry's busy town.

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,040
But then there's also a Nickelodeon water park

53
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,600
where you're gonna get wet.

54
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,880
That's another episode eventually

55
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,440
is all of the Nickelodeon bullshit.

56
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,440
Some of which was in the Star Trek adventure in LA.

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,840
The same space got used for something called

58
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,280
totally Nickelodeon down the road.

59
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,600
Lots of extraneous Nickelodeon crap.

60
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,680
Lots of stuff.

61
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,200
So when Paramount got in there,

62
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,560
there would be Star Trek aliens, crew members,

63
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,440
just walking around you could get your pictures with.

64
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,400
But my big thing, and this was a thing

65
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,400
that I think I've alluded to on the past on the show.

66
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,840
And at certain points I was like, did I just imagine this?

67
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,880
But sure enough, if you Google Star Trek on ice,

68
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,600
it's not a full show.

69
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,760
But there was a show called Paramount on ice.

70
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,840
And three quarters of it really reminds me

71
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,960
of the Simpsons gag, Hooray for Everything.

72
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,680
Like the upbeat variety show that's really about nothing.

73
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,080
There was a Super Bowl halftime show

74
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,160
where the alien lands and sings rock around the clock.

75
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,680
So this is ice skaters.

76
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,080
This is the era of the ice capades

77
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,960
and figure skating is getting very big.

78
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,360
So this is just like, it's an ice show.

79
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,640
It's in an indoor theater, people ice skating

80
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,880
to tunes of music from movies.

81
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,480
You gotta have danger zone with Top Gun, right?

82
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,320
Sure, of course.

83
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,560
That's a Paramount.

84
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,880
Like a foam jet fighter costume fit over their body.

85
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,720
Well, but that's the thing.

86
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,240
They're mostly in generic, like ice capade kind of costumes.

87
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,800
I think the most one was Dirty Dancing is the one,

88
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,600
or no, what's the one with the chair

89
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,760
where she dances with the single chair?

90
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,520
Flash dance with maniac?

91
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,920
There's a chair, someone's skating around the chair.

92
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,040
Around the chair.

93
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,040
Around the chair.

94
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,440
And then at the end of the show, they skate to Footloose,

95
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,960
Grease Lightning, I think they skate to at some point.

96
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,520
But then about halfway through the show,

97
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,880
there is a Star Trek segment where people in Starfleet

98
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,960
crew member uniforms start skating around.

99
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,800
Oh.

100
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,120
I'm gonna put this on the TV real quick.

101
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,960
Yeah, pull it up on the TV.

102
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,800
Because I actually have not seen this clip.

103
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,640
Do you have any?

104
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,720
It's like part three.

105
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,160
This is a Star Trek The Next Generation on ice.

106
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,960
Yeah, that's good.

107
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,960
So now it's a lot of very exciting Star Trek music,

108
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,120
but, and there's some spaceships.

109
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,320
There's too much fog.

110
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,400
You can't see anything.

111
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,160
They're playing a theme from Star Trek The Next Generation.

112
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,120
Uh-huh.

113
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,440
There's crew members skating around.

114
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,280
Circles.

115
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,400
The show seemed to do it, like Circles was the big move.

116
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,440
Yeah. Yeah.

117
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,880
And the background is not anything

118
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,160
that looks like Star Trek to me.

119
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,240
It looks more like the Emperor's

120
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,080
of the Royal Room in Star Wars.

121
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,920
It looks like you're looking at the Death Star.

122
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,960
The crew are not known for big kicks on the series.

123
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,280
High kicks.

124
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,080
Here they, I mean, every crew's different.

125
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,920
Every crew's different.

126
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,760
Right.

127
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,600
So maybe, yeah, there wasn't.

128
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,880
Now it's going to get pitch black.

129
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,640
And there's going to be some,

130
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,560
what I think are supposed to be aliens doing wire work.

131
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,400
Whoa.

132
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,520
And then occasionally skating.

133
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,520
These Dayglow costumes don't really show up well

134
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,920
on like ancient VHS.

135
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,440
On some guy's video

136
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,520
that he didn't know would be the only document.

137
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,360
Yeah.

138
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,720
So there you can see they're kind of being,

139
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,000
they're kind of skating.

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,360
I mean, they are skating.

141
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,640
But then like there's wires.

142
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,480
And they're flying.

143
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,160
Now they're getting flying.

144
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,800
And their outfits kind of look like

145
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,120
if you drew the human nervous system

146
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,120
on like the Night Man jumpsuit from.

147
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,200
If you put radioactive.

148
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,760
The Day Man, Night Man from It's Always Sunny outfit.

149
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,600
I'm going to finish.

150
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,960
If you put radioactive dye in someone

151
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,320
and then scan them with an x-ray.

152
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,320
So this was just a little segment from the show.

153
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,160
A little segment.

154
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,160
And then the crew members come back, they skate more.

155
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,000
There's no real aliens besides the wire work people.

156
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,840
Right.

157
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,680
And there wasn't a big,

158
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,000
not much of a narrative in this show.

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,920
Not really much of a narrative.

160
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,760
They're doing.

161
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,080
Kind of skate towards each other in point.

162
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,920
Yeah.

163
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,320
The complex dynamics and inter alien politics

164
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,240
of the series not conveyed here.

165
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,200
But like. Yeah.

166
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,120
Everything out.

167
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,360
I mean, I guess there's like a mall shop.

168
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,280
A fake mall shop sort of flat

169
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,120
that they skate in front of for grease light thing.

170
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,480
Like, but they spent all of their money on this show.

171
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,720
On this segment.

172
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,680
Yeah.

173
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,560
They got a days of thunder car and skated near it.

174
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,400
I wonder.

175
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,880
Well, there, yeah, there was that days of thunder.

176
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,880
That was the simula.

177
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,960
That was the big like show.

178
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,720
The big simulator show was, was days of thunder.

179
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,720
And then a Pierce Brosnan and James Bond thing,

180
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,680
which I never rode.

181
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,520
I'm so mad.

182
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,360
I always wanted to ride it.

183
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,200
And then there was like Stanley presents the superheroes.

184
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,880
Like one of the many Stanley invents another universe

185
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,720
kind of thing.

186
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,560
Mm hmm.

187
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,720
This, this, I'm, this is underwhelming.

188
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,560
This show.

189
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,320
Yeah, it's pretty underwhelming.

190
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,600
It's got the most dynamic music.

191
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,560
And then we're seeing that the crew is like unified.

192
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,040
They're working together and making shapes together.

193
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,880
Yeah.

194
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,720
And not.

195
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,200
And then the wire work aliens come back.

196
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,920
I will say that theme from Star Trek,

197
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,720
the motion picture that's playing is fantastic.

198
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,560
Yeah.

199
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,400
It's really great.

200
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,240
It's not John Williams, but it's very Williams-esque

201
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,440
from that era of Superman and all those great big scores.

202
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,760
So you can see it a little better.

203
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,040
They kind of look like big butterfly sorts of things.

204
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,040
Mike, do these look like any Star Trek aliens that you?

205
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,880
I don't know what that, no, it looks like.

206
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,520
It looks like the Spitter from Jurassic Park.

207
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,080
Yes, it looks like the Dilapis.

208
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,560
So whatever it's called, Dilapis.

209
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,400
So one thing you could say about this ice show

210
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,240
is that they own a CD you like.

211
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,560
Besides that.

212
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,400
Yeah.

213
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,240
Not a lot of.

214
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,080
That's it.

215
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,900
Nice work.

216
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,180
Anyway, that was the anti-climactic.

217
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,020
Star Trek on ice.

218
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,900
So that was my memory of Star Trek.

219
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,740
I saw that.

220
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,980
Yeah, I would have seen that.

221
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,980
Probably around that time,

222
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,300
there was a couple summers in a row,

223
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,980
we went to Kings Dominion and then over to.

224
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,140
Didn't audition for it.

225
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,220
Didn't consider being part of it.

226
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,700
No, no, if only.

227
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,540
Man.

228
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,380
If only.

229
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,200
I got that lower leg strength up.

230
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,260
I don't think I've ever ice skated in my life.

231
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,020
I was gonna say, you didn't.

232
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,980
My mom made me take ice skating lessons at like 12.

233
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,820
What?

234
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,340
Yeah, she was like, you're gonna need to know how to do it

235
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,460
cause you're gonna have parties

236
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,380
where you'll have to ice skate.

237
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,860
And then I was in a class with like,

238
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,100
my sister's only three years younger,

239
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,740
but when you're like 12, that feels like

240
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,940
I'm way older than my sister.

241
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,620
So I was in like a beginner's class

242
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,580
with a bunch of young kids.

243
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,380
And I felt like a real loser.

244
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,220
Yeah, that's kind of more fun.

245
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,420
I guess I was.

246
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,660
That's because you were.

247
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,780
Yeah, and I honestly, I think there was only one other

248
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,100
ice skating party I ever was invited to.

249
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,900
So.

250
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,180
I went to a, I went to an ice skating thing

251
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:14,180
with a school group where I had like the walker essentially.

252
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,380
Like, so you know, just like a pipe that I am teetering on.

253
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,380
And then I did one lap of that

254
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,660
and then didn't wanna do anymore.

255
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,500
And then I was ended up sitting just with a mom,

256
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,700
somebody's mom who was a cool mom

257
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,500
who could see that I needed help

258
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,940
and was a kid who needed to know what was cool and stuff.

259
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,860
And then a song came on at the ice rink

260
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,740
and she was like, oh, this is like a good new cool song.

261
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,940
You should know about this.

262
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,980
It's this band Soul Asylum.

263
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,540
It's called Runaway Train.

264
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,380
Wow.

265
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,580
I think you'd like it, Scott.

266
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,940
Yeah, I think I do like it.

267
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,500
And then I think all the kids came back from skating

268
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,020
and I probably immediately like,

269
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,500
hey, so you guys like Soul Asylum?

270
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,620
They ignore me, keep going to pizza.

271
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,540
But I've always appreciated that mom trying to help me out.

272
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,820
And she's right, knowledge of Soul Asylum

273
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,660
is as crucial today as ice skating is for you.

274
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,500
Wow.

275
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,860
We've all had a lot of great experiences

276
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,740
at an ice skating arena.

277
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,580
What do you call it?

278
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,420
An ice skating rink.

279
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,260
Rink.

280
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,100
Rink.

281
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,660
I'm sorry, I'm gonna say that your mom going,

282
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,540
you gotta know how to ice skate

283
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,340
might be one of the weirdest things you have ever said.

284
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,180
Really?

285
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,300
I don't know why that's so strange to me.

286
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,220
Your mom being insistent on this.

287
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,740
You're gonna have to know how to line dance.

288
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,740
You're gonna have to know, yeah, there'll be parties.

289
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,900
Yeah.

290
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,420
Is there, I'm trying to think, I guess,

291
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,260
I went to a couple roller skating parties.

292
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,220
Roller skating was more common and occasionally bowling,

293
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,420
but at a certain point in time,

294
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,260
we got sick of the bowling alley.

295
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,100
Oh, we had a lot of bowling.

296
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,660
We had a lot of bowling.

297
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,740
That's where the Ninja Turtle arcade was.

298
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,100
Yeah, all of these places had big arcades

299
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,220
and I was much more interested in that and the snack bar.

300
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,580
I was always scared that I would like

301
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,460
slice my own neck with my skate.

302
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,300
Yes, yeah, I'm afraid of that.

303
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,780
I was worried that that was gonna happen.

304
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,580
And anytime I'm watching ice skating,

305
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,020
there's a blade there.

306
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,260
They're gonna slice themselves open.

307
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,580
But it's most likely to happen if you're very good.

308
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,060
That's where a leg would get kicked up near a neck.

309
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,900
Yeah. Yes.

310
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:15,180
But the blade is gonna fly off the boot.

311
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,180
It is alarming.

312
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,900
It seems very scary to me.

313
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,140
It's a blade.

314
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,060
Yeah. Yeah.

315
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,900
True.

316
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,140
And it's just, people just do this all the time.

317
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,180
My sister, I skated as a little kid.

318
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,460
She did a couple of those shows.

319
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,940
There was a racket, essentially.

320
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,740
This is actually probably a good episode down the line.

321
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,660
There was a place called Santa's Village

322
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,420
and right next to it was the Polar Dome.

323
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,260
And it was in a ring.

324
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,380
It was a big rink and they taught lessons.

325
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,580
And they had, maybe my sister let us use the video.

326
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,500
They would basically, there was a big recital essentially

327
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,420
for all the classes and the show was just,

328
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,220
it lasted four hours.

329
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,940
You were sitting in this rink watching just kids.

330
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,700
There would be a couple features of kids

331
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,500
that were better than the other kids,

332
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,900
but mostly it was just like,

333
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,020
let's throw 28 year olds out onto the ice

334
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,860
and they'll make some formations and then play the music

335
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,700
and get them out of there.

336
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,420
All right, another round of eight year olds, got it.

337
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,060
And then they would sell you like a $30 VHS of it.

338
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,740
Oh, and I had to sit through a few of these as a kid.

339
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,660
If you like $30 VHS,

340
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,300
you're gonna love the main topic of today's show.

341
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,700
That's exactly what we're talking about.

342
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,140
That's the exact price.

343
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,980
It is.

344
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,820
Yeah.

345
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,180
It's so, that is so much.

346
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,700
For the early 90s?

347
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,260
For the early 90s.

348
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,300
My God.

349
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,540
I mean, I was reading a thing,

350
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,060
I don't know if it was Attractions Magazine.

351
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,420
Someone just had an article

352
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:42,060
about different theme park VHS tapes.

353
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:47,060
Both Disney's run of sending out VHS vacation planning tapes,

354
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,100
but then also the souvenir ones

355
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,220
of like a day at the Magic Kingdom

356
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,540
or the Universal Studios one hosted by that old man.

357
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,900
Joe John Forsythe.

358
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,860
And they did Hollywood and Florida.

359
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,820
Movies are the wizard's wand

360
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,020
with which cinema magic is made.

361
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,860
I mean, we gotta watch those.

362
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,980
Oh, we'll find a way to piece those.

363
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,780
Those are some of my favorite things.

364
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,620
Yeah, and the Disney ones that are like a fake home video,

365
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,300
sometimes following up a fake family.

366
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,140
Yeah.

367
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,740
Like so that they can capture it

368
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,500
as if you had a nice camera,

369
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,820
which you presumably don't.

370
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,540
And Universal very briefly,

371
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,700
when they first opened that second park,

372
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,780
had like two or three years

373
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,940
where they had vacation planning DVDs.

374
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,860
Didn't last long.

375
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,020
Yeah, I think now it's probably just all digital,

376
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,840
I'd imagine.

377
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,980
But yes, so this is both experiences we're talking about.

378
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,660
There's one in Hollywood and one in Florida,

379
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,140
and both of them devoted ultimately to selling you

380
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:46,140
a $30 VHS in which you are a star of Star Trek.

381
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,740
From the Hollywood one,

382
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,340
which opened in 1988, official literature.

383
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,180
At each performance,

384
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,960
members of the audience are selected to join.

385
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,000
Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock in battling Klingons,

386
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,760
fantastic space creatures and alien super beings.

387
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,280
Then only minutes later,

388
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,640
you see these scenes videotaped and edited

389
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,480
into actual Star Trek footage.

390
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,720
You may go in a spectator and come out a star.

391
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,880
And we'll clarify the difference between the two.

392
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,540
And I wasn't even clear until the last couple of days,

393
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,960
but there was a similar,

394
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,920
you make a video in Orlando and you're in Star Trek.

395
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,580
But in that one, it's a blue screen thing

396
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,180
and it's an experience only for you and your group,

397
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,760
but you get a tape at the end of it.

398
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,040
The Hollywood one was a show in a theater.

399
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,000
And even if you weren't participating,

400
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,660
you could watch this sort of like,

401
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,920
here's how TV shows are made kind of show.

402
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,080
It was in the theater, which became totally Nickelodeon.

403
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,400
It became some Flintstones thing.

404
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,760
And then for many years was the immortal,

405
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,000
the eternal Shrek 4D.

406
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,080
Yeah.

407
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,080
So this was, yeah, it's a combo.

408
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,680
It was a live show, but probably the main attraction,

409
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,760
you could be picked and be in it and be on one stage.

410
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,400
Like a superstar television.

411
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,760
Physical sets.

412
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,780
Yeah.

413
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,200
Good looking physical sets.

414
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,120
In fact, one of them, there is something that fans

415
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,160
were very excited because the bridge in this one is the,

416
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,480
you explained this already,

417
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,480
something about the Enterprise D or the Enterprise C.

418
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,400
The difference between the enterprises.

419
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,700
Yeah, usually when the bridge is replicated,

420
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,820
it's not usually this one.

421
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,780
Oh, okay.

422
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,620
Huh.

423
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,420
I'm trying to think, cause they, there were two versions.

424
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,500
So the 60s show was the enterprise was just the enterprise,

425
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,820
USS Enterprise.

426
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,300
And then in the movies, they like re-create,

427
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,980
they christened a new ship, which was the NC 1701A.

428
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,820
It's funny it's NC 17, but that's part of it.

429
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,100
Isn't that what it, I mean.

430
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,420
I mean, it's just funny that the film rating is in there.

431
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,260
Oh, I see what you're saying.

432
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,660
Naughty film rating that used by show girls.

433
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,500
Oh, is this your dirty mind?

434
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,620
Who's in this crew?

435
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,100
Gaspar No?

436
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,500
Oh, it's N, wait, you know what?

437
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,660
It's NCC 1701.

438
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,500
Oh, okay.

439
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,320
You're missing a C.

440
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,160
But that's pretty close.

441
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,980
And we got this, so then let's issue a correction.

442
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,820
I gotta edit the other one out.

443
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,180
You gotta edit some Cs into the other episode,

444
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,420
but it's too late, unless you do it right now.

445
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,500
So yeah, it's ship recreation.

446
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,820
There's a recreation of, I'd say, the main enterprise,

447
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,900
then you're on some Klingon ship.

448
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,100
And there's the, what is the official name of this?

449
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,380
It's the holodeck.

450
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,740
Yeah.

451
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,540
There is a, probably then the main way

452
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,460
that they advertised it, and the thing I remember

453
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,260
from watching it as a kid, I watched it,

454
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,860
but did not participate.

455
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,980
Too scared for that.

456
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,220
You get to watch audience members disappear live.

457
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,140
On the holodeck, and it's really well done.

458
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,020
I watch videos where it gets a round of applause,

459
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,980
and deservedly so, and thus, at the end,

460
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,380
you watch everything put together, right?

461
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,340
And some of which is like, here's a computer you've shot,

462
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,940
and in this case, they film a live effect,

463
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,380
and it happens right in front of you,

464
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,900
and they commit that to tape, and it looks really nice.

465
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,140
I believe it was a Pepper's Ghost sort of thing,

466
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,380
but it's the same technology that enables

467
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,900
the Haunted Mansion ghosts, and the many great holograms,

468
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,220
the hologram USA, the jewel of Hollywood Boulevard.

469
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,260
The greatest hologram experience ever.

470
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:29,140
Yeah, so it did seem like that was fun.

471
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,660
I'm trying to figure out, that does seem like-

472
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,980
That was one of Erin's favorite things as a kid,

473
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,500
going, I don't know if she was ever in it,

474
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,660
but she loved that Star Trek show.

475
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,620
It was a lot of fun.

476
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,660
You cover, the sets are really great looking,

477
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,060
you get to see clueless, dopey families

478
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,700
bumble around a Star Trek set.

479
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,540
I think there's a lot of comedy in,

480
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:56,340
oh, the lines are bad, or here's the part

481
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,460
where there's turbulence, and everybody falls this way,

482
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,060
and falls that way, and they have to explain,

483
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,700
well, it'd look better if you all fell the same way,

484
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,420
here, follow my hand, and it still doesn't work right.

485
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,620
Right.

486
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,340
So it's, I think it was legitimately fun,

487
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,860
and there weren't a lot of shows like this.

488
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,100
Did this predate, I guess it did,

489
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,660
this predated superstar television.

490
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,780
Is that right, 88? Yeah.

491
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,980
Yeah, 88. The next year,

492
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,140
a similar thing opened at Disney and James Studios,

493
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,900
where you're in the chocolate scene, and I love Lucy.

494
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,220
Right. Now, some big things that set this part.

495
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,780
One, there was no original footage shot for that.

496
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,020
They used existing footage

497
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,660
from the Star Trek motion pictures.

498
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,260
Yes. And two,

499
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,740
when they cut the inserts in, you can watch,

500
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,940
there's a few different families

501
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,780
have uploaded their videos to YouTube.

502
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,700
A lot, really.

503
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,940
The Hollywood one, the end product looks like shit.

504
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,220
It looks awful.

505
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,340
The Florida one, seemingly cheaper when you're there,

506
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,980
looks much smoother when they cut the footage in,

507
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,620
and has some great original footage,

508
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,500
original shot with.

509
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,060
The one they cast. The cast,

510
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,540
which we'll get to that, so.

511
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,820
Because in the Hollywood one,

512
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,060
in the Orlando one, they shot a bunch of video.

513
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,500
You're on video, and George Takei's on video.

514
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,180
Then the Hollywood one, you're looking at,

515
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,740
you're combining 35 millimeter film with.

516
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,820
That's true. Like a live variety show

517
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,580
you're filming in a theater.

518
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,700
But it's awfully charming.

519
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,020
The blend is a lot of fun. It's charming, yeah, yeah.

520
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,260
I'm sure these videos are fun to pull out,

521
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,580
and say, hey, send them our way if you have them.

522
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,500
I have not a longer clip, but I started,

523
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,460
I was like, do I try to find some moments

524
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,300
to play of this thing, but there's too many families.

525
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,300
It's impossible to pull apart too many moments.

526
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,460
Dozens of people have posted these on YouTube.

527
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,340
They're a lot of fun.

528
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:56,300
But there's this one part that struck me funny, especially,

529
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,340
where, okay, so there's the main crew,

530
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,500
and then there's a Klingon problem.

531
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,620
I don't know what's going on.

532
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,420
But then you're introduced to a group of Klingons.

533
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,460
And again, these are all volunteers from the audience.

534
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,620
I think all told, there are 30 or so opportunities

535
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,780
for audience members to be up on stage in the show.

536
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:21,020
Some are in uniforms, and some are in Klingon foreheads.

537
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,900
Not very good makeup, but you gotta just

538
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,740
throw them on in five minutes.

539
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,620
We're not talking Corvath. Corvath? Corvath?

540
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,940
Corvath. Corvath.

541
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,340
We're not talking Corvath level quality.

542
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,140
No, just tell them it's stripped on.

543
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,260
Did I read, they had to audition to be the Klingons

544
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,580
with your roar?

545
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,420
Yeah, you had to have the roar.

546
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,140
And that's how they would choose the Klingons?

547
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,980
Oh, that's fun.

548
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,940
I don't remember how it worked.

549
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,540
There's also, they made up a little piece of mythology

550
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,660
just for this show.

551
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,500
Let me find it.

552
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,060
But that's probably the funnest part is when,

553
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,460
okay, here's a bunch of Klingons all roaring,

554
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,060
the main thing you're called upon to do,

555
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,660
and reaching for the camera,

556
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,420
and then they also have a pet,

557
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,580
and the pet is played by a little kid

558
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,940
who couldn't handle a line,

559
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,260
but they can handle wearing a funny costume.

560
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,940
So a kid is brought on as a puppy lizard,

561
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,580
which is a Klingon pet described as a cute,

562
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,100
the combo of dragon and dog,

563
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,060
so in all these videos, you're watching this weird little

564
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,860
dragon guy ride around.

565
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,180
He doesn't quite merge with the Klingon world,

566
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,500
but it's very cute.

567
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,300
And then,

568
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,700
what's supposed to happen is an assistant,

569
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,940
like a lower ranking officer or something,

570
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,740
says in Klingonese,

571
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,580
I mean, I don't remember,

572
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,620
it's something about the enterprises try to contact you,

573
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,020
and then the leader is supposed to rip their arm

574
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,340
out of their socket.

575
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,740
And in only half of the videos did I see this work.

576
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,740
But then the main Klingon says,

577
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,940
I mean, it's in Klingon,

578
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,100
but he says essentially fire at them.

579
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,340
And all of the fire at them,

580
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,580
it was just all like especially,

581
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,940
it's definitely the comedy of dads.

582
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,420
It's definitely like dress him up, he's confused,

583
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,780
he's not gonna know how to do this.

584
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,220
And really quickly this morning,

585
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,140
I compiled a bunch of fire at them,

586
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,500
and I'll put this up on Twitter or something,

587
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,940
and apologies to all of the families that are watching.

588
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,700
And apologies to all of the families

589
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,540
that I stole this from,

590
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,940
but hopefully it's fun.

591
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,260
Here's a taste of that.

592
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,140
Luchane limboja!

593
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,020
Ha ha ha ha ha!

594
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,260
Luchane limboja!

595
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,580
Ha ha ha ha ha!

596
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,900
Ha ha ha ha ha!

597
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,460
Luchane limboja!

598
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,260
Ha ha ha ha!

599
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,500
Luchane limboja!

600
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
Ha ha ha ha!

601
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,340
Luchane limboja!

602
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,140
Ha ha ha ha!

603
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,980
And they start to get worse as we go.

604
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,060
Luchane limboja!

605
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,940
Limboja?

606
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,940
No!

607
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,700
My lime blimboja!

608
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,260
Ha ha ha ha ha!

609
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,620
Limboja!

610
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,140
Luchane limboja!

611
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,340
Ha ha ha ha ha!

612
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,980
Limboja!

613
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,980
Limboja!

614
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,940
Ha ha ha ha ha!

615
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,620
Luchane limboja!

616
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,020
Ha ha ha ha ha,

617
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,020
können!

618
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,020
Lin pain Kevin!

619
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,020
Wow.

620
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,020
Ha ha ha ha ha!

621
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,020
Luchane limboja!

622
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,020
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

623
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,020
Luchane limboja!

624
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,020
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

625
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,020
I like that one.

626
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,020
That's number one.

627
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,020
Yeah, there's some good ones in there.

628
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,020
Luchane blababla!

629
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,020
Kabbalah!

630
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,020
Blazin' off!

631
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,020
Blah!

632
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,020
I really enjoyed all...

633
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,020
Luchane limboja.

634
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,020
I'll try to keep that in my head.

635
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,020
I finally know some Klingon.

636
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,020
It's not as good as...

637
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:53,020
Well, it is Sivako or any of the Navi language, but it's close.

638
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,020
Well, that's a word of kindness.

639
00:23:54,020 --> 00:24:00,020
Luchane limboja is a line of war, and now we know it, should we end up in a space war.

640
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,020
So I'll throw that up on the Twitter.

641
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:11,020
A lot of fun dads, and at one point, like, cool guy who keeps his sunglasses on, like, under the forehead part.

642
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,020
That's funny.

643
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,020
So, you know, they get to do that.

644
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,020
I think everybody ends up, like, tied up in tentacles.

645
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,020
I think the Klingons get attacked by some alien.

646
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:25,020
And then there's a part where a bunch of, like, psychic brain creatures all speak with their hands.

647
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,020
Did you guys catch that?

648
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,020
Oh, yeah.

649
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,020
And they explain...

650
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:35,020
They were showing that, I don't know, they could get along.

651
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:42,020
Yeah, it was that, like, everything you just witnessed was a simulation, and it was to see if the species could get along, and if...

652
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,020
I don't remember if we passed or not.

653
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,020
Yeah, that's exciting.

654
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,020
I assume yes.

655
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,020
Yeah, hopefully.

656
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,020
They're kind of in that zone of the Clint Howard kid.

657
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,020
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

658
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,020
The big head.

659
00:24:53,020 --> 00:25:03,020
Oh, right, because the Starfleet crew members save the Klingons at one point, and then at another point, the Klingons save.

660
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,020
Because the Klingons wanted them to.

661
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,020
There's literally, like, murder us.

662
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,020
We have been dishonored by needing help.

663
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,020
There's, yeah.

664
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:15,020
And then they even the playing field by saving them.

665
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:20,020
That character appears, or one of the characters appears in the art for this, which I loved.

666
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,020
Did you come across, like, the promotional art?

667
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,020
Yeah, that art is great.

668
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,020
Really good paintings.

669
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,020
Yeah, I'm putting it up on the screen.

670
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,020
This one is just so good.

671
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:39,020
Oh, yes, those, like, those creepy holographic Spock and Kirk.

672
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,020
Yeah.

673
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,020
Those it's the brain creature.

674
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,020
Yes.

675
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,020
And one where Kirk and Spock are reversed.

676
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,020
Yeah, I see that.

677
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,020
I have that too.

678
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,020
Like two variations of it.

679
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,020
It's but everything underneath looks similar ish.

680
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,020
Yeah.

681
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,020
One thing I think is interesting.

682
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:04,020
The promotional stuff for this is refers to it as the Universal Studios tour as opposed to Universal Studios Hollywood.

683
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,020
Oh, gotcha.

684
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:14,020
I don't know when that shift happened, but you do see before, like, the park got built out a lot more than them pushing leading with the tour.

685
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,020
Yeah.

686
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,020
Well, I think it was sort of in the process of happening.

687
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,020
Yes.

688
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:21,020
And this is one of the first things that you could get out.

689
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:28,020
You might not know Universal Studios was initially just the tram and there'd be stops and you'd get out at the prop plaza or you do this little show.

690
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:35,020
But it was not a you don't walk into an entrance like Disneyland and you're in a theme park and the tour is one of the rides.

691
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,020
It was all tour.

692
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:42,020
So this thing was one of the first the Star Trek experience was one of the first things on the upper lot.

693
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:52,020
And this was opened along with you know, when you walk around Universal, there's all those like no attraction areas like the Moulin Rouge and Sherlock Holmes is London.

694
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,020
Right.

695
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,020
And all that stuff.

696
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,020
That was all supposed to be that was open with a lot of fanfare.

697
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:05,020
It was called the Streets of the World and there will be like it's as if these are back lot sets that we could use and they have been used in things.

698
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,020
But you can actually get out and walk around them and shop and go to restaurants.

699
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:23,020
So this is so Star Trek was part of like this initial early expansion, this open right after earthquake, which was one of their big, you know, also an early attempt at doing Disney caliber experiences in the T2 location.

700
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,020
Right.

701
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:29,020
I believe with this thing or no, no, no, Star Trek.

702
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:35,020
No, Star Trek was in what became the Dreamworks Theater and Shrek 40.

703
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,020
What was it?

704
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,020
Did it?

705
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,020
What was it in Florida?

706
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,020
Where was T2?

707
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,020
Was there some T2 connection with it?

708
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:50,020
Well, it's all there's a guy named Phil Hedema who headed the thing up and who yeah, the Hedema Group's a big themed entertainment company.

709
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:55,020
He's a guy who became a major figure in T2 3D, but he could like cut his teeth on this.

710
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,020
Also part of this, Gary Goddard.

711
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,020
Gary Goddard.

712
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,020
Fuck you motherfucker.

713
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:07,020
And he actually Gary Goddard apparently was brought in to tighten the experience up and get it down to like 25 minutes or so.

714
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:16,020
Because according to the Disney versus Universal book, the first time they opened this and got it on its feet, the entire experience ran an hour and 10 minutes.

715
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,020
Geez.

716
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:21,020
And when it was done, only 10% of the audience was left.

717
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,020
It was a disaster.

718
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,020
They ended up streamlining it and all of them.

719
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,020
You know, that's the thing.

720
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:36,020
It is very impressive that this was I don't know how the editing technology worked to where like all these things are going to happen live on stage and then you'll watch it all down in a six minute reel immediately after.

721
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,020
But it was not nearly as tight when it opened.

722
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,020
It was kind of a disaster.

723
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,020
So it needed a lot of retooling, but ended up being a very popular thing.

724
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:52,020
Ran until 1994 when it was replaced by a Flintstones show where they ride a big pterodactyl around inside the theater.

725
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,020
I remember that being very impressive.

726
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,020
Great.

727
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,020
You saw that live.

728
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,020
I saw that.

729
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,020
That was a lot of fun.

730
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:05,020
I loved live action Flintstones a lot to a degree that I probably couldn't justify today.

731
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,020
Movie?

732
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,020
Yeah.

733
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,020
Movies?

734
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,020
I loved the Flintstones.

735
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,020
Not movie.

736
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,020
I remember it by Viva Rock Vegas point.

737
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,020
But no, come on.

738
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,020
That's baby stuff.

739
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,020
I don't know.

740
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,020
Flintstones 94.

741
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,020
That is a adult drama about money laundering and fraud.

742
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,020
Colin McLaughlin.

743
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:24,020
Yes, very adult star.

744
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:28,020
But Viva Rock Vegas sends up one of your favorite vacation destinations.

745
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,020
That's a good point.

746
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,020
I should check it out for that reason.

747
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:37,020
I have this very specific memory of really wanting a sequel to the Flintstones and it kind of took too long.

748
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:42,020
By the time it got announced and there was going to be a prequel, you're like, oh, so it's not Goodman?

749
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:51,020
The big thing that they touted in the press release of Viva Rock Vegas, well, because we're going to Las Vegas and we're kind of simulating neon,

750
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,020
that we're going to be using some different types of rocks.

751
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,020
That was in the newspaper.

752
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,020
I read that.

753
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,020
I remember thinking.

754
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,020
You remember it.

755
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,020
Yes.

756
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,020
It really sticks with me that they thought that was a bragging point.

757
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,020
Little did you know, fake rocks would be such a thing down the line.

758
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,020
It would eventually be the most meaningful thing in my life.

759
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:14,020
I had, I think, a similar experience, but the timeline a little different.

760
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:25,020
Like when Rocky and Bowinkle Nickelodeon got the rights to air the old Rocky and Bowinkle cartoons, and I just remember going, wow, they're showing it on Nickelodeon and Nick at night.

761
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,020
That's cool.

762
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,020
Because it was like a prime.

763
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,020
It used to be a prime time.

764
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:35,020
What cartoon could work for both sides of the line?

765
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,020
For both.

766
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,020
That's wild.

767
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:44,020
And then shortly thereafter, maybe a few years after, was the live action Rocky and Bowinkle.

768
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,020
And I went in like with high hopes.

769
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,020
Really?

770
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:52,020
Because I remember the Tom and Jerry movie where they talk.

771
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,020
Right.

772
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,020
Which now that sounds weird.

773
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,020
That's years prior?

774
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,020
Yeah, there's years between those two movies.

775
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,020
But I was like, well, they did a good job with the Tom and Jerry movie.

776
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,020
I bet to do a good job with Rocky and Bowinkle.

777
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,020
What year was Tom and Jerry?

778
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,020
It's like 94, 95?

779
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,020
Yeah, 90.

780
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,020
It sounded like that.

781
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,020
And Rocky and Bowinkle is 2000?

782
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,020
Was it 2000?

783
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:15,020
I feel like I was heading towards adolescence by Rocky and Bowinkle, but I remembered like, well, I love the cartoons.

784
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,020
Tom and Jerry 92.

785
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,020
Wow.

786
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,020
And then that Rocky and Bowinkle movie.

787
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,020
I mean, there's one or two fun.

788
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,020
I mean, it's funny to see Renee Russo and Robert De Niro.

789
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:30,020
So I'm curious, eight years apart, you were remembering the Tom and Jerry movie?

790
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,020
Yeah.

791
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:37,020
Well, and I think they were like, look, it's Rocky and Bowinkle in their own movie with these movie stars in it.

792
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,020
Like, I think I was just like, this could be really fun.

793
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:45,020
And I think I remember walking out of it going like that wasn't that fun.

794
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:50,020
The only blotch in Robert De Niro's otherwise perfect career.

795
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,020
Yes.

796
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,020
Flintstones.

797
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,020
What's funny about Flintstones?

798
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,020
We saw it in the theater and I liked it.

799
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:03,020
But of course, like maybe Batman Forever and I guess Batman Returns, I remember the McDonald's promotion.

800
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,020
Yes.

801
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,020
So it was so large in my brain for that.

802
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:13,020
So like I almost like the McDonald's promotional campaign for the Flintstones movie more than I like the movie itself.

803
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:19,020
I had a very exciting moment where I won the ultimate honor for my kind of kid.

804
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,020
Lunch with a teacher.

805
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:26,020
I got to go to McDonald's with one of my teachers.

806
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:34,020
Thus, a bonus visit beyond when my parents would take me, thus opening up me getting one of the other houses that was available.

807
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:38,020
Like, so probably I had, I don't know, who else's house could you get?

808
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:42,020
Did I end up with a house of the in-law, Elizabeth Taylor, the mother-in-law?

809
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,020
Maybe.

810
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,020
I got Mrs. Slag Hoople's condo.

811
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,020
Well, how did you get to McDonald's?

812
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:51,020
Did the teacher drive you in her car?

813
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,020
I think maybe.

814
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,020
I think I was driven around by a teacher.

815
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:08,020
My school, like my school district had specific, like, teachers cannot drive students in their personal car for any number of liability reasons.

816
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:13,020
And as it should be, keep in mind I grew up in California where the rules are loose.

817
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,020
Yeah.

818
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:30,020
I mean, that would be a pain in the ass if like, there would be times in the summer, like this local summer community theater, like directors, if like parents couldn't make it or like we're running late, the staff who ran it would be like, I'll just drop you off, get in the car, fine.

819
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,020
Sure.

820
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,020
But they didn't have the school district, you know.

821
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:41,020
I reason that it wasn't weird because, you know, to some extent the teacher is a friend of my mom's, therefore not a stranger.

822
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:45,020
So because she was a friend of your mom's, is that why you got it or was it because you earned it?

823
00:33:45,020 --> 00:34:00,020
I think, now if I'm remembering correctly, this is a, my mom ended up becoming a teacher at the school and this particular teacher is still a family friend to this day, so that might have, I don't, now I know what you're thinking, how did I get that, student of the month?

824
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:06,020
I think this is the beginning of the relationship between my family and this teacher.

825
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,020
I don't think the wheels were greased.

826
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,020
Because of your academics.

827
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,020
Yes.

828
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,020
Your exemplary performance.

829
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:20,020
That was what kicked it off, but then my, that fun time at McDonald's must have really, that's really where the relationship became special.

830
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,020
Did you tell this teacher about soul asylum?

831
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:30,020
So I recently learned of, this, soul asylum may have been after my lunch with the teacher.

832
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:39,020
I might have been telling the cool mom about what a nice day I had having lunch with a teacher and about how much I love the different types of rocks in the Flintstones movie.

833
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:43,020
And she might have said, I better teach Scott about a rock band or two.

834
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:49,020
So this is, this was a reward at your school that you got to eat lunch.

835
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,020
Keep hanging out with a teacher beyond school hours.

836
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,020
Did you get to pick whatever you wanted off the menu?

837
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,020
I believe so.

838
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,020
Okay.

839
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,020
If she had suddenly been, I don't know, maybe there was a price limit.

840
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:02,020
I mean, maybe I couldn't have said 100 hamburgers.

841
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,020
Although now I wish I had.

842
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,020
My grades were very good.

843
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:13,020
And you were excited to go just to talk to the teacher one on one or just to get to go to McDonald's and order whatever you wanted.

844
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:19,020
I mean, McDonald's and during Flintstone times, keep in mind they were all RockDonald's.

845
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,020
Yes, of course.

846
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,020
Knowing that RockDonald's was a temporary thing.

847
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,020
I really wanted to be at RockDonald's, but yes, I love to learn.

848
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,020
I love getting very good grades.

849
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:33,020
And I threw my probably until high school, I could list a lot of teachers who I like had.

850
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,020
I like had relationships with beyond the school.

851
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,020
That sounds really, that sounds terrible.

852
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,020
I always got along with adults very well.

853
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,020
All right.

854
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,020
Okay.

855
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,020
Yeah.

856
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:49,020
Where you like see them out somewhere and like we actually connect.

857
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:52,020
I learned how to make small talk very young.

858
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,020
I got along with adults too.

859
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,020
Okay.

860
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,020
But how many were you friends with?

861
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,020
We all probably share this.

862
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,020
Yes.

863
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,020
I think so.

864
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,020
I think it's a trait that I would call wienerism.

865
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,020
Yes.

866
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:14,020
I like I like for instance, I started my middle school and I thought that it was going to help me out socially that I coming into middle school was like that.

867
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,020
My mom was friends with the principal.

868
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:21,020
I was like, I'll be the most popular kid in school because I know Mrs.

869
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:26,020
Hunter, a lady who wore big moomoo's and had a giant had giant helmet hair and it didn't help.

870
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,020
It ended up not helping.

871
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,020
I hate to say so.

872
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:37,020
Then it was a desperate bout of shouting soul asylum to everyone in earshot and it never went my way.

873
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:45,020
I convinced when there was there was a few different Marvel Comics promotions at Pizza Hut over the years, one of which it was like for four or five weeks.

874
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,020
There was a new comic you could get exclusively a pizza at every week.

875
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:56,020
And one of those weeks was a half day of school week because that was when they would do parent teacher conference.

876
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:01,020
He would just go for the half day and then the afternoon the parents would come in do parent teacher conference.

877
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:12,020
And so I convinced I I like sold it to a friend like well, I remember where I'm coming over to hang out that one day like we're hanging out that one day.

878
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:18,020
You know, there's a pizza hut down the road from your house and we both want these comic books.

879
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:21,020
He I think he was like, yeah, you're right.

880
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:25,020
And he got like convinced his mom to take us to Pizza Hut.

881
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,020
Was it a buffet?

882
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:31,020
I don't know. We did the but I think we just just did the personal pans.

883
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,020
Oh, personal pans. Yeah.

884
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,020
The personal pans is that the kid's menu was the pan, the soda.

885
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,020
That's what you would get for the book program.

886
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,020
Yes. Yeah.

887
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,020
There was a lot of tie in.

888
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:45,020
We must have all had our reward for book related activities was personal pan pizzas.

889
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:51,020
And I used to write comic books down on my list because I was such a bad reader and still am.

890
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,020
Yeah, me too.

891
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,020
Bad reader.

892
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:58,020
Well, yeah, all that promising that promising academic career got flushed down the toilet.

893
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,020
There's something with my attention span.

894
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,020
I think that's the problem.

895
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:06,020
Now you look very prolific as comic book page counts are just getting cut.

896
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,020
Oh my God.

897
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,020
Yeah.

898
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,020
Sometimes it's too much for me now.

899
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,020
Yeah.

900
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:16,020
But all of the look how much we all learn for all of these episodes information that helps us with nothing.

901
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,020
Yeah.

902
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:21,020
Day to day it helps us with the boring certain people at parties.

903
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,020
Yeah, for sure.

904
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:29,020
But when during these records, that's when that's our time.

905
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,020
It's very fitting.

906
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:35,020
We've got all our nerdy childhood neuroses out on the Star Trek episode.

907
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:43,020
I think you on this on you mean on the second Star Trek episode, the less good one, the less good one.

908
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,020
So yeah, so Hollywood.

909
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,020
Yeah, this one was a show.

910
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,020
This one had sets.

911
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:54,020
Did you get both of them were the same in that you had to buy the edited VHS?

912
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,020
I'm guessing it was an upcharge experience.

913
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,020
Yes.

914
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,020
And but your name was in the credits.

915
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,020
I mean, think about that.

916
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,020
That's true.

917
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,020
That they do Chiron.

918
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:07,020
Seeing your name on your TV and impossible feed at that time.

919
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:13,020
Well, now, so I yeah, I'm not surprised they charge for the VHS.

920
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,020
But wouldn't you want to be like, well, you're in the show.

921
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,020
It's ten dollars.

922
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:21,020
Like, wouldn't wouldn't be nominal fee like I mean, thirty dollars.

923
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,020
Theme park.

924
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,020
I know.

925
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,020
But but they used to when they would do shows, they would charge for the VHS.

926
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,020
They would give you a ticket.

927
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,020
They would give you like, thank you for helping us.

928
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:33,020
Here's a free and it was a free soda or free ice cream or something.

929
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:37,020
Yeah, that's what the people who do the animal actors, the kids who do animal,

930
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,020
I get a little certificate or something.

931
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:45,020
But it's a good lesson to learn that like congratulations, you made it as an actor.

932
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:51,020
And also now you will pay all of these surcharges and union fees and manager agent fees.

933
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,020
And I got those headshots that's going to cost you money.

934
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,020
And the real is going to kind of those classes you took.

935
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,020
That's all going to cost you.

936
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,020
Sure. Yes.

937
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,020
Yeah. Yeah.

938
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,020
Yeah.

939
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:03,020
Sorry. I was going to the kids who with the one that Harry Potter where it's like,

940
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,020
you're the special boy.

941
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,020
You've been chosen.

942
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,020
Here's the one.

943
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:10,020
By the way, make your mother pay sixty dollars for it.

944
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,020
Yeah.

945
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,020
The most special ones are the most expensive.

946
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,020
Yes.

947
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,020
I don't know.

948
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,020
So there's valuable lessons.

949
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,020
That's why Star Wars.

950
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:23,020
That's why Galaxy's Edge has a payday loan center in it to cover those insane lightsabers that they're selling.

951
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,020
There's a Unkar Plutz check cashing business.

952
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:35,020
You're going to owe money to like a bounty hunter is going to come to you at your home outside of Galaxy's Edge.

953
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,020
Yeah. Yeah.

954
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,020
You have to kill a grito.

955
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,020
Pay your debt.

956
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,020
Pay in blood.

957
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:51,020
I mean, that's pretty much all I have on the Hollywood one.

958
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:56,020
And so as we said, there's not even like a pre video.

959
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,020
There's nothing.

960
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:02,020
This is a fun thing and the sets are cool, but you don't get the presence of the actors.

961
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,020
Yes.

962
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,020
Other than in pre recorded clips.

963
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:15,020
But in Orlando in 91 when this opened a little after the park opened custom material from the entire original cast.

964
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,020
Yeah.

965
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,020
Crazy.

966
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,020
I don't know why you wouldn't do this first for the first one.

967
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,020
Yeah, I don't know.

968
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:26,020
It seems like I mean maybe they were maybe they might have been harder to get in a way they were still making the movies.

969
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,020
Although also they're like around and on Star Trek sets.

970
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,020
Right.

971
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:34,020
That's what I'm a little bit confused by why they didn't have any sense.

972
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:43,020
But this one, of course, and I think we've had a couple of episodes where we love things hosted by people that aren't the best on camera.

973
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,020
Yeah, this is incredible.

974
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,020
I didn't realize it had this.

975
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,020
Yeah.

976
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,020
And this is what I found a couple of months ago and I was like, Oh my God, thank.

977
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,020
Oh, this is the greatest.

978
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:58,020
Gene Roddenberry, creator of Star Trek, who he says you may know me as the creators.

979
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,020
What else am I going to know you for?

980
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,020
Right.

981
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,020
I don't know.

982
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,020
I'm related to you.

983
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:11,020
Well, it seems like you might know him for seeming like he's about to break down in tears as he's recording this because fall over or fall over.

984
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:15,020
I've never seen a man more nervous to be on camera.

985
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:23,020
The kids in the Star Trek shows, which there are some kids with real shitty grins on their faces the entire time they're doing these Star Trek shows.

986
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:30,020
So I will just play maybe the whole Gene Roddenberry intro because it's fantastic.

987
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:37,020
Hello and welcome to Universal Studios Star Trek Adventure.

988
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,020
Courtesy of Paramount Pictures.

989
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:43,020
I'm Gene Roddenberry and some of you may know me as the creator of Star Trek.

990
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,020
The episode you're about to see is a first.

991
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:52,020
It's the first time guest stars have ever played the roles of the captain of the enterprise and the Vulcan science officer.

992
00:42:52,020 --> 00:43:00,020
We'll now give you a peek at the rehearsal session that went on between our guest stars and their two directors, William Chandler and Leonard Nimoy.

993
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:04,020
And you get a little boom mic dip at the end of that.

994
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,020
Oh, yeah, yeah.

995
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,020
He there's some punch in.

996
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,020
And I don't know this is when this was in what?

997
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,020
Ninety one.

998
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,020
I hope Gene wasn't like sick and we're goofing on him or something.

999
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:17,020
But there's there's punch ins on him and he looks like a deer in the headlights.

1000
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,020
Like he looks like, oh, you found me.

1001
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,020
Like he's so scared.

1002
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,020
I don't know why they made him do this.

1003
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:33,020
Keep in mind, this is going to be your this is being shown in a regional upcharge experience at a theme park in central Florida.

1004
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,020
So, you know, dozens of people are going to see you here.

1005
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,020
Oh, I freak out.

1006
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:54,020
I freak out, Gene, possibly affected, afflicted with cerebral vascular disease and encephalopathy as a result of his longstanding use of recreational legal and illicit drugs, including.

1007
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:58,020
Oh, so you're saying it's fine that we goofed on him now because he was taking drugs.

1008
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,020
It's like a bad man.

1009
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,020
Cocaine meth.

1010
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,020
What?

1011
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,020
Meth.

1012
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,020
He did meth.

1013
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,020
Gene Rundberg did meth.

1014
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,020
Oh, it's quite loose.

1015
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,020
Sorry.

1016
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,020
It's the baby.

1017
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,020
All right.

1018
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,020
That's fine.

1019
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,020
Yeah.

1020
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,020
Yeah.

1021
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:15,020
Well, I mean, he did die in 91.

1022
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,020
Very nervous on camera.

1023
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,020
We're goofing on him now.

1024
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,020
And now we look like shit heads.

1025
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,020
So good job.

1026
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,020
That's behind the buying the paywall.

1027
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:27,020
We haven't proven how good we are from our pleasant teacher hangs.

1028
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,020
But don't put them on camera then.

1029
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,020
Yeah.

1030
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,020
Yeah.

1031
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,020
He had a stroke in 89.

1032
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,020
Oh, so like this is stroke.

1033
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:37,020
Alcohol and drugs have just destroyed his health and then he had a stroke.

1034
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,020
Oh, don't put them on.

1035
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,020
Yeah.

1036
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,020
It's their fault.

1037
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,020
It's their fault.

1038
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,020
Not ours.

1039
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,020
Universal's fault.

1040
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:51,020
Get somebody dude with presence like John Forsythe movies on a wizard's wand or bringing

1041
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,020
Hannah and Barbara.

1042
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,020
Oh, yeah.

1043
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,020
True to this as well.

1044
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,020
We haven't been making Star Trek for over 40 years.

1045
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,020
We sure ain't.

1046
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,020
We got nothing to do with it.

1047
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,020
Oh, we go get a sandwich.

1048
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,020
Did they do the Star Trek animated show?

1049
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,020
Oh, I don't know.

1050
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,020
It was a short lived Star Trek.

1051
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,020
I watched a lot.

1052
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,020
We don't know.

1053
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,020
We weren't paying attention.

1054
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,020
We don't.

1055
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,020
We probably did it.

1056
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:16,020
We hate being in the same room with each other.

1057
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,020
This is a comp.

1058
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:20,020
What you're watching right now.

1059
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,020
Joseph filmed two weeks ago.

1060
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,020
I sure did.

1061
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,020
Is that one take too?

1062
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,020
No, no, it is.

1063
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,020
Okay.

1064
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:32,020
This punches in on him and it's like clearly like maybe days later.

1065
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,020
Close up.

1066
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:42,020
And then what he introduces is a directing session in which there is the family.

1067
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,020
So, you're the family.

1068
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:48,020
You and your family went in to make this video and you're sitting on some director's chairs

1069
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:54,020
and on either side of you, current modern day, filmed for this Leonard Nimoy and William

1070
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,020
Shatner.

1071
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:59,020
This is, this is everything I want to play.

1072
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,020
Yeah, I'll play it.

1073
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,020
That's very good.

1074
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,020
Is the key.

1075
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:07,020
You must let the audience know that you are the captain of the ship.

1076
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:11,020
The trick is to remove all traces of emotion from your performance.

1077
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,020
Vulcan's actions are dictated by pure logic.

1078
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:19,020
And remember, the captain is the most important role in the story.

1079
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,020
The captain?

1080
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,020
The Vulcan?

1081
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,020
Come on Leonard, it's the captain that makes things happen.

1082
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,020
It's his story.

1083
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,020
Bill, get serious.

1084
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,020
The audience watches the Vulcan.

1085
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,020
Stop.

1086
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:33,020
This victory is pointless.

1087
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:35,020
It is most illogical.

1088
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,020
Not bad.

1089
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,020
I'd say they're ready.

1090
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,020
What about you, Leonard?

1091
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,020
Indeed.

1092
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:51,020
I think it's time to boldly go where no man has gone before.

1093
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:54,020
So in case you didn't know, those are the family members chiming in.

1094
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,020
Yeah, like as if they were ad libbing.

1095
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,020
And you'll see the video.

1096
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:02,020
And then my favorite, one of my favorite parts is that Leonard and Bill, Bill

1097
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:07,020
Shatner put their hands on the hands of the people sitting behind them.

1098
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,020
The family is just overlapping.

1099
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:15,020
Before you do a performance, you really want a director to touch your hand.

1100
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,020
Yes.

1101
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,020
It's so weird.

1102
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:21,020
Just ominously going backwards and their hands hovering.

1103
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:27,020
And also in that whole video, they are looking nowhere near the guests.

1104
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,020
The eye lines are way off.

1105
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:32,020
They have very thick blue screen lines around them.

1106
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,020
Just harsh shadows.

1107
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:37,020
And then when it cuts to singles, they're in an entirely different room.

1108
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,020
The color is so different.

1109
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:45,020
Leonard's close up is the color of the wall is it may as well be two different locations.

1110
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:47,020
They probably weren't filmed together.

1111
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,020
Yeah, I don't think so.

1112
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:49,020
Yeah.

1113
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,020
They hated each other at this point.

1114
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,020
They probably hated each other.

1115
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,020
They made up, but then they hated each other when Leonard died, I think as well.

1116
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,020
Oh, no.

1117
00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:00,020
It's really something that's really delightful.

1118
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,020
And that's all they could get them to do.

1119
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:05,020
The rest of the grunts though, all had to go.

1120
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,020
They showed up.

1121
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,020
Yeah, they showed up.

1122
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:10,020
And I got to say they're doing the work.

1123
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,020
They definitely are.

1124
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,020
Yeah.

1125
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:19,020
I'm confused a little by, I think I've, oh wait, is it DeForest or is it, Walter Koenig is?

1126
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,020
Chekhov.

1127
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,020
He's Chekhov.

1128
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,020
Which one doesn't have an accent?

1129
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,020
He's doing the Wessel.

1130
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:26,020
Well, Scotty is the engineer.

1131
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,020
He has an accent.

1132
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,020
That's Doohan.

1133
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,020
James Doohan.

1134
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:32,020
And then Chekhov has an accent.

1135
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:34,020
Sulu sounds like George.

1136
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:38,020
And then Nichelle obviously is Uhura.

1137
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,020
Who's DeForest Kelly?

1138
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,020
DeForest Kelly is Bones, the medical officer.

1139
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,020
He's the main guy in the footage.

1140
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,020
Okay, yeah.

1141
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:45,020
So he's the old crusty guy.

1142
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:46,020
He's a little man.

1143
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,020
Yeah, but maybe that's the character too.

1144
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,020
Yes, he is the character.

1145
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:49,020
He's over it.

1146
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:52,020
Like his character is sort of like crusty and over it in general.

1147
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:56,020
And I think he was in real life and obviously you have to do this.

1148
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,020
I'm sure he was like, oh, what is this shit?

1149
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,020
Yeah, you're filming an interactive theme park video.

1150
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:03,020
I believe they filmed this on the set of the other one.

1151
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:06,020
Like the Hollywoods, Universal had the Hollywood set.

1152
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:09,020
So they used that and shipped this over to Florida.

1153
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:12,020
Because it's a smaller, it's not the real set.

1154
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:14,020
It's a smaller scale version of it.

1155
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:16,020
And as we said, a lot more video-ish.

1156
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,020
Yes.

1157
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:22,020
Like you were watching, this is like a PBS Star Trek.

1158
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,020
Right.

1159
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,020
Made in 1976.

1160
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:28,020
But I like McCoy yelling at the family members.

1161
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,020
And you know what?

1162
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:32,020
They do need a more firm directing hand because some of them are really

1163
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,020
phoning in their performances.

1164
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,020
It is.

1165
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,020
Often, yeah.

1166
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:39,020
This one, the first one that pops up and we'll link to it,

1167
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:42,020
the video I was playing from, is I think the best one I've seen.

1168
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,020
That's like the primary, the first one that comes up.

1169
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,020
Their performances are so funny.

1170
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,020
It's like a, it's a mom and a kid.

1171
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,020
It's a mom and a kid and a dad.

1172
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,020
The mom at the Vulcan's pretty good.

1173
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,020
Yeah.

1174
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:56,020
But I think that's the kid who's a little too like pleased with himself.

1175
00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:00,020
Because of it, it's just so, it's the delay because of the way that they have to do this.

1176
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:03,020
So there's like a nice couple seconds before anyone reacts to anyone else.

1177
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,020
So there's this odd feeling in the videos.

1178
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:08,020
Did you guys find you had this for a long time though, starting to act in things?

1179
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:13,020
If a camera's on you, you're smiling like an idiot and you don't even know you're doing it.

1180
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,020
Yeah.

1181
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:15,020
That was like the big thing.

1182
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:18,020
I, now that I'm an actor really, but like when I corrected that, I was like, oh yeah, shit.

1183
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:25,020
Every time I've ever had any type of camera on me, I just have that like, huh, hey, look, I'm being filmed right now.

1184
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:28,020
I think some, there's some people who never lose it.

1185
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,020
Yeah.

1186
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,020
I think that that's, yeah.

1187
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:31,020
Yeah.

1188
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:38,020
One of the big things is people don't realize when the camera's on you, what weird, maybe it's not smiling necessarily, but it is something.

1189
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,020
There's some weird reaction.

1190
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:48,020
Cause I took a, when I took a commercial acting class, like eight years ago, the first time I was on camera, I yawned.

1191
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,020
Like I, I like kind of like looked strange.

1192
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,020
Like I was making a weird face.

1193
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:53,020
I wasn't smiling, but I looked strange.

1194
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,020
And then I yawned on camera.

1195
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,020
Whoa.

1196
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,020
And I didn't even know I did it.

1197
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,020
Huh.

1198
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,020
Like it was very odd.

1199
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,020
Wow.

1200
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,020
Like you're just, I think it does something when you're like, feel like you're being watched.

1201
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,020
I think you have some little ticky thing.

1202
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,020
You have a ticky weird thing that happens and it's different for everyone.

1203
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:13,020
And then you have to like know that you just keep your face like neutral for the most part.

1204
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:18,020
And then if you're doing commercial where you generally with commercials, like you don't even have any lines.

1205
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:22,020
So you just have to like look in the distance and be like, Hmm, like a neutral face.

1206
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,020
And that leads about right for most things.

1207
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:27,020
And you haven't, so you don't in most commercials end up having to ice skate.

1208
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,020
No.

1209
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,020
It did not come up.

1210
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,020
It's not.

1211
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,020
I have one of these days.

1212
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,020
Do you have it on your special skills?

1213
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,020
No, that's true.

1214
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,020
I don't.

1215
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:38,020
I've had to hang glide and stunt drive.

1216
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:39,020
Oh yeah.

1217
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,020
You've had.

1218
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,020
Oh yeah.

1219
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:42,020
I've had a couple.

1220
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,020
That's some weird ones.

1221
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,020
Oh yeah.

1222
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:45,020
Very weird.

1223
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,020
Yeah.

1224
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,020
Um, uh, stillness.

1225
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:52,020
I think, uh, Philip Seymour Hoffman had a quote once about like, Oh, you can tell really.

1226
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,020
I think it was him had like, yeah.

1227
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,020
Yeah.

1228
00:51:55,020 --> 00:52:00,020
Pros like when you look at them on camera or like in between, they're still, they're not

1229
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,020
fidgeting.

1230
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,020
They're not.

1231
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,020
That's the, yeah.

1232
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,020
That's the one thing I think is a younger person.

1233
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,020
I thought it was like, you want to feel like you're giving a lot of effort.

1234
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:09,020
You're like, I'm performing.

1235
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,020
So I here we go.

1236
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,020
I'm going to do a lot with my hands.

1237
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,020
That's a real amateur thing.

1238
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,020
It's like, I'm going to really react to it.

1239
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,020
Cause she's like, I have to make it feel like something.

1240
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:21,020
And it's like, no, do not do that ticks as possible.

1241
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,020
Yeah.

1242
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:28,020
I guess we can't hold these Florida families to, we should, um, they should have listened

1243
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,020
to Mr. Shatner and Mr. Neem.

1244
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,020
Those are two big directors.

1245
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:34,020
That's better than any of us had coming up.

1246
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,020
Three men and a baby.

1247
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,020
Yeah.

1248
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:41,020
And body wars and Star Trek five.

1249
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:46,020
That's one of the boringest Shatner, the worst Star Trek movie Shatner directed five is,

1250
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,020
but Nimoy directed four.

1251
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,020
And Nimoy directed three and four most difficult one at Wales.

1252
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:52,020
Four is fantastic.

1253
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,020
Uh, yes.

1254
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,020
And he made that sexy lady photo book.

1255
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,020
Yes.

1256
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:57,020
He had all this photo book.

1257
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,020
He took pictures of sexy ladies.

1258
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,020
Oh, he was a photographer.

1259
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,020
He was a photographer.

1260
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,020
Everyone loved him.

1261
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:05,020
I mean, except his son and he, they reconciled.

1262
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,020
There's a documentary about it.

1263
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,020
Oh good.

1264
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:12,020
But everything else, he, you know, Nimoy, when there's Star Trek cartoon rolled around,

1265
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:16,020
they tried to cut out like you hurrah and check off or like ensue.

1266
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:19,020
Like they just get different voice actors for cheap and not the real actors.

1267
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,020
And Nimoy said, no way.

1268
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:25,020
If you don't have me, you don't do, we don't, if you don't, you don't get me.

1269
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,020
If we don't do everybody.

1270
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,020
Wow.

1271
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:32,020
And everything like Shatner was not because Shatner very famously, huge asshole on the

1272
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,020
sets.

1273
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:39,020
Uh, they've stories about him like going and changing people's lines and closeups.

1274
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:41,020
Like you'd see him go off with the director and then it would be like, all right, you

1275
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:45,020
know, the setup is actually going to be over here and it's going to be on Mr. Shatner and

1276
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:47,020
it's not going to be on Sulu.

1277
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:51,020
And then like him just complaining about like photo shoots where he wasn't like featured

1278
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,020
as heavily.

1279
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,020
Did they also not get a lot of residuals from the original series?

1280
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,020
Isn't there a story about that?

1281
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,020
That's a good question.

1282
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,020
I'm probably not.

1283
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,020
When did the original series in around for like five seats?

1284
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,020
No, no, no.

1285
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,020
Less.

1286
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,020
Less?

1287
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,020
Yeah.

1288
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:06,020
Because that's the other two or two and a half ish.

1289
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:12,020
One of the press kits for this, these attractions was like from the very popular TV show.

1290
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,020
And I'm like, was it?

1291
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,020
I don't know that it was.

1292
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,020
I think once it hit them.

1293
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,020
No.

1294
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,020
They started making multiple movies.

1295
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:20,020
I feel like the movies did well if they kept making them.

1296
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:23,020
And the only reason the movies happened is because of Star Wars.

1297
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,020
Oh, yeah.

1298
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:26,020
Because Paramount was like, oh shit.

1299
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,020
Okay.

1300
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,020
We got one.

1301
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,020
What do we have?

1302
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:31,020
Oh, well, we have a star in the title.

1303
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,020
Okay.

1304
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,020
We'll just do the stars.

1305
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,020
We'll do that.

1306
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,020
Yeah.

1307
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,020
And then, yeah, that's how that reignited it.

1308
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:41,020
I mean, next generation came after both of these attractions or around the same time.

1309
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:42,020
When did that start?

1310
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,020
Well, that's in like 87.

1311
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,020
Oh, really?

1312
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,020
Yeah.

1313
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,020
Oh, okay.

1314
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,020
I believe, unless I'm...

1315
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,020
Hmm.

1316
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:52,900
I really like the Shatner's advice of you must let the audience know that you are the

1317
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,020
captain of the ship.

1318
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,260
That's, hmm.

1319
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,260
That seems like an understatement.

1320
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,180
It seems like you have to do more than that.

1321
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,180
Yeah, I know.

1322
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:05,020
This is a much, a very simplified version of advice.

1323
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:09,500
I would take that advice if I were in this video and just right before every line, I

1324
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,500
am the captain.

1325
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,500
And then, then the line.

1326
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,100
Just keep reminding you.

1327
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:17,660
And if I have like a name tag that says captain, just keep pointing to it over and over again.

1328
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:18,660
Man, I wish this...

1329
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,620
I'm the captain, Seth the Phaser's...

1330
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:24,340
They don't have enough experiences like this anymore at parks.

1331
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,900
Because I would do that now.

1332
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,460
We should do that now if it existed.

1333
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:31,700
I was trying to see, could we find this blank and then insert ourselves into it?

1334
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:32,700
Oh, yeah.

1335
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,700
That's such a great idea.

1336
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:34,700
I couldn't do it.

1337
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:35,700
If anyone...

1338
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,700
Here's one of those like weird source things.

1339
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,260
If anyone has, for some reason, the blank video.

1340
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:39,260
The elements.

1341
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:45,100
Have you guys been noticing this YouTube channel, Cow Missing, that is posting all of this source

1342
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:49,300
video like the Muppet Vision, the three monitors all lined up.

1343
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,300
Oh, yeah.

1344
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:55,780
Or the Captain E. O'Pree show, but not filmed off a TV in good quality.

1345
00:55:55,780 --> 00:56:00,740
So if for some reason this Star Trek take home video thing exists without any people

1346
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,820
in it and we could put ourselves in it.

1347
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:03,820
Oh, man.

1348
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:07,980
I was trying to think how do we culminate this episode into something, but we can't

1349
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:08,980
do that.

1350
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,420
You guys are both very tech savvy, Scott, you especially.

1351
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:17,220
I would say someone I saw online was plugging those videos like, oh, yeah, look at all

1352
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,220
this stuff up here.

1353
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,540
If you like them, hunt them down.

1354
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:25,700
If you really like them, rip them off that video because this website, this user could

1355
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,700
get banned.

1356
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,700
Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1357
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:28,700
Yeah, yeah.

1358
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,700
Well, I've done a lot of...

1359
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,700
Yes.

1360
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:34,460
Well, look, I was ripping many family's videos today for that thing earlier.

1361
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,460
Sure.

1362
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,460
Yeah, no.

1363
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,460
Well, certain theme park things.

1364
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,740
But now I think it's out there enough.

1365
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:43,780
There was this Captain EO work print that now has multiple, but I was like, this might

1366
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,780
be gone today.

1367
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,540
I need to grab this.

1368
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,540
It's fantastic.

1369
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,940
And you find out that EO was knighted.

1370
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:50,940
That's important information.

1371
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:51,940
Oh, right.

1372
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:52,940
Yeah, yeah.

1373
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:53,940
Not in the film.

1374
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:58,100
He goes down on one knee and the sword is taken to his shoulders and head.

1375
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,100
Oh, yeah.

1376
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,100
Very important.

1377
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:01,580
So he's Sir EO by the end.

1378
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:03,780
Unacknowledged mostly.

1379
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:10,740
Anyway, so what we're describing then, after all this intro from Gene Roddenberry, intro

1380
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:15,020
like a little coaching from the directors, then you and your family get to be the stars

1381
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:19,820
of a Star Trek story that is custom filmed.

1382
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:22,860
All of the other actors are in it.

1383
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:29,700
And it's a weird little tale where you end up beamed onto a Klingon ship and you're like

1384
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,980
right next to them.

1385
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:36,060
That was the part that jumped out of me that there's a part where a Klingon is saying to

1386
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:38,540
a little kid like I'm going to kill him.

1387
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:39,540
Oh, yeah.

1388
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:40,540
Yeah.

1389
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,740
And a little kid pulls out like essentially a grenade.

1390
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:43,740
Yes.

1391
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:44,740
Right.

1392
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:45,740
But it's not real.

1393
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:46,740
No, it's not real.

1394
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,780
It's a Star Trek.

1395
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,220
We fooled them with logic.

1396
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:51,220
The dialogue.

1397
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,220
Yeah.

1398
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:55,060
The dialogue is somebody says, what about the photon detonator?

1399
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:56,980
And the kid says, it's not real.

1400
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:00,260
It's a gag gift from a friend.

1401
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:01,260
Gag gift?

1402
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:03,580
In the 23rd century.

1403
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:04,980
But what was that supposed to be?

1404
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:10,140
How are you going to you start going and you go into school and you say, hey, look, a bomb

1405
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:12,620
and the schools shut down for the day.

1406
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:15,940
This was well, this is the military, though.

1407
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:21,020
Also maybe things are supposedly very peaceful on earth in the 23rd and 24th century.

1408
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:24,340
So maybe they're everyone could be darker with their sense of humor.

1409
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,340
I don't know.

1410
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:26,340
Perhaps.

1411
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:31,100
But this was one of two experiences you could have that the full name I found was screen

1412
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:35,020
test home video adventure presented by JVC.

1413
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:39,100
And the other is called Your Day at Universal Studios.

1414
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:42,860
So got to hunt that down because I'm very interested in what that is.

1415
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:46,860
I've seen that maybe on this same YouTube channel, in fact, or like Inside Universal

1416
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:47,860
or one of the others.

1417
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:51,940
But you can watch that being done by families and you can also watch it being done by Laurel

1418
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:52,940
and Hardy.

1419
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:59,540
Like the characters in the costumes do it to demonstrate how it works.

1420
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:00,540
Right.

1421
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:03,820
And yeah, you get you know what happens in it.

1422
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:04,820
I don't know.

1423
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:05,820
I walk around Hollywood Boulevard.

1424
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:06,820
The real things you do.

1425
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:07,820
Yeah.

1426
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:08,820
Yeah.

1427
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:14,340
But this is clearly the superior one because you spend 30 bucks and you get custom footage

1428
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,260
of the forest.

1429
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,260
Kelly.

1430
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,260
Yeah.

1431
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,260
You're kidding me.

1432
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:21,340
Forrest Kelly was talking to me.

1433
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:24,340
He was Kurt to me.

1434
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:27,380
I don't have much to say about the actual thing.

1435
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,820
I mean, the videos are a lot of fun.

1436
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:32,260
I mean, yeah, you have to watch the videos to get because we could play clips, but it's

1437
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:36,580
like so it's so specific to watching this family.

1438
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:41,980
You have to see this family because there's so family that you had where the kid says,

1439
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:46,220
I mean, mostly they keep it together pretty good, but there's one part where he says like,

1440
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:51,860
OK, we're being over be beaming over.

1441
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:52,860
That's a lot of fun.

1442
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:53,860
Fantastic.

1443
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:57,260
Do you find this to be a compelling story?

1444
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,220
Yeah.

1445
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,060
Hey, I was just ranking my Star Wars.

1446
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:03,860
Where does this beat any of the films?

1447
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:04,860
Yeah.

1448
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:08,220
Beat Star Trek five for sure.

1449
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:09,220
Star Trek five.

1450
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,380
Well, technically, Shatner directed this too.

1451
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:12,380
That's a good point.

1452
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,380
Victory for him.

1453
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,380
Star Trek five.

1454
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,780
Those Star Trek five is so bad.

1455
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,980
It kind of does come around the world a little bit into being good.

1456
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:20,980
Like this.

1457
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:26,100
The movie starts off with the three men, the Trinity of Star Trek, Shatner, Nimoy and De

1458
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:31,420
Forest Kelly in like a national park singing campfire songs.

1459
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:34,540
And then like they're like mountain climbing again.

1460
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:37,220
They're like very old already at this point.

1461
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:40,460
And they're like climbing and then like Spock Falls.

1462
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:45,060
And then he like has like rocket boots and he shoots up like it's such a bizarre.

1463
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:46,060
That's lucky.

1464
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:49,460
I was going to say now that I think about it, it's maybe the best five is actually really

1465
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:50,460
good.

1466
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,460
Oh, wow.

1467
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,460
You would like it in a dramatic turn.

1468
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,460
Five's number five.

1469
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:54,460
Actually, now number one.

1470
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,540
This is better than.

1471
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,420
One is very boring.

1472
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:07,420
Star Trek 10 is bad too, with Tom Hardy and Picard.

1473
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:10,580
Tom Hardy is like a young clone of Picard.

1474
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:15,020
And it's like kind of unpleasant and it's like not a great send off for the cast.

1475
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:16,900
So let's say Nemesis.

1476
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,260
Yeah, Nemesis. Thank you.

1477
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:26,140
And so let's say this one is better than 10 and one and tied with five.

1478
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:30,700
Wow. So the Star Trek home video and it probably depends on the cast too.

1479
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:32,060
Yes, that's true.

1480
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,820
The tank said, but this main family that you like.

1481
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:39,020
I wonder if do you think there was like a like a bunch of good actor?

1482
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:41,820
Like people have been like, we're fucking good actors.

1483
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:44,660
Let's roll in there and we're going to show all these families like we're going to have

1484
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,220
the best Star Trek tape.

1485
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:49,340
Like, could there be one with like famous actors, in fact?

1486
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:55,140
Hmm. Oh, maybe they practiced at home or before, like before they were famous.

1487
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,540
Have to be somebody.

1488
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:58,820
Do you think anyone got discovered off of this?

1489
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:01,340
I mean, it's possible.

1490
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:02,660
Yeah. I mean, we don't know.

1491
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:07,340
We didn't. Joseph Gordon Levitt is for he got all his early success.

1492
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:08,820
This got him third rock.

1493
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:11,780
Yeah. Yeah. They sent a tape of this and he was cast.

1494
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:16,460
Yeah. He said beaming over without any stumble.

1495
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:20,980
There's I was going to say Adam Scott, but I realized I was going to say that

1496
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:25,300
because Adam Scott is in Star Trek First Contact as a crew member.

1497
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:29,500
Oh, really? Like years before he would make a bold burst onto the scene and step

1498
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,980
brothers. Boy Meets World.

1499
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:36,580
Tork. Oh, and Tork.

1500
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:37,780
Yeah. Don't forget Tork.

1501
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:41,540
Yeah, that's the main thing. I wish we could do this.

1502
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:44,780
I wish we could still go into that blue screen room.

1503
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:50,420
Jason, I thought of you because the you know, this thing, this this room

1504
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:55,220
where you stood in a square in front of a blue wall was replaced by the Islands

1505
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:57,900
of Adventure preview center, which I don't know if you got to do it.

1506
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:03,300
But you must have been over by King Kong or the mummy.

1507
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:04,660
Right. It was OK.

1508
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:08,060
All right. That's I remember the preview center being in that part of the park.

1509
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:10,780
I thought this was more by like the fake

1510
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:14,980
Gardens of Allah or whatever the fake apartment building.

1511
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:17,860
Oh, I don't know. The fake like, huh?

1512
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:19,580
No, I'm curious.

1513
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,900
We should do close to New York in my head.

1514
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,300
OK, yeah, that that's where the preview center was.

1515
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,340
I have that very clearly in my.

1516
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:30,060
This like when they do like I went to a WrestleMania like,

1517
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:34,620
I guess it was like 22, whatever was in Chicago and they let you call a match.

1518
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:36,620
And it was free at the time, too.

1519
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:38,740
I'm sure they charge for something like that now.

1520
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:41,500
But but that's like I'm trying to think of there's any other equivalent

1521
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,500
of something like that.

1522
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:45,980
Does anybody have some make their own music video that we talked about this?

1523
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:49,540
Yes. I mean, that's what I maybe we should do an episode,

1524
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:55,620
maybe main feed episode of the best of all of these different types

1525
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:58,260
of video attractions or something. Sure.

1526
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:01,980
And we ask call for the listeners to send in their best ones. Sure.

1527
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:04,260
And then I will upload

1528
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,740
the one of my mother and I at MGM Studios.

1529
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:07,980
I'll tease it. Yeah.

1530
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:11,900
Golden grail or the yeah, the tape is over in is over there.

1531
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:13,620
I have it. Yeah. Wow.

1532
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:15,220
The room I need. I don't have it.

1533
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:19,460
Well, we have digitized maybe back in Chomberg, but I need to digitize it here.

1534
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,980
So, yeah, that'll be that's a big that's a big one.

1535
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:26,500
You're saying we're devoting an episode to make your music video booths

1536
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:31,340
where like, you know, two kids don't touch instruments

1537
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:34,700
while Gloria Estefan's one, two, three, four plays.

1538
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:36,860
That is what I'm saying.

1539
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:38,020
But there's got to be there's others.

1540
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:40,900
There's other versions of these types of rides,

1541
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,100
but it's the few and far between these days.

1542
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:45,380
Well, because anybody on your phone.

1543
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:47,340
So, yeah, you can just put yourself in it.

1544
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:52,540
Why would that photo booth technology you can put yourself in ancient Rome?

1545
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:55,300
You know, hey, you can look like you got

1546
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:59,420
bluebirds buzzing around your head or you can,

1547
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:02,980
you know, switch your gender in a Snapchat filter

1548
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:05,740
from the comfort of your own home.

1549
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:10,500
Yeah. But what you can't do is make a custom movie with George Takei.

1550
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,700
Yeah, I mean, that's

1551
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,860
there should be like a Fast and the Furious version of this,

1552
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:18,740
where they have all the actors with a new narrative and they plug in.

1553
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,460
They charge it now. What's inflation?

1554
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,980
Eighty dollars. I think it would be around $80.

1555
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:28,460
Yeah. Isn't that this one's almost weirder to me that to even do the experience

1556
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:30,740
you're paying that money. Yeah.

1557
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:34,340
You're already in Universal Florida and now there's this upcharge. Right.

1558
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:38,180
But if you're a big fan, you get to wear the outfits that too.

1559
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:41,420
That's an undiscussed aspect of both of these things. Yeah.

1560
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:45,620
You're wearing like, I guess not fitted, but you're wearing like vaguely. Yeah.

1561
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:48,700
Your size. Star Trek uniforms. Right.

1562
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,540
That's you ever worn a Star Trek uniform?

1563
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:53,060
I isn't I have not. Oh, wait.

1564
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:56,300
No, I did a comedy show and I was Spock once. Mm hmm.

1565
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:00,020
And I did one where I was Riker, but I wore like a robe. Mm hmm.

1566
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:01,020
As in that one.

1567
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:03,700
So I've worn like an approximation, but not an official.

1568
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:07,220
I've never also been to a Star Trek convention, which I want to go to the big

1569
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:11,300
one in Vegas. They have a big one in Vegas every year. Oh, so I would like to go.

1570
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:14,220
Why do they do that? Or why do I want to go?

1571
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,940
Why do you want to go? Because because I like all that bullshit.

1572
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:20,340
Uh huh. I want to go. I want to go take a look and see what's going on. Sure.

1573
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:24,940
I want to see every single person that's ever been on a Star Trek who go to this.

1574
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,780
You are all there. You are all there.

1575
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:29,660
Yes, it was over by the mummy who was in that area.

1576
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:33,820
That was all I've been looking at. You've been distant for four minutes.

1577
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:35,060
Trying to figure out where it was.

1578
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:36,380
And yeah, that's where this was.

1579
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:38,460
And that's where the preview center was.

1580
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:39,460
Friends of adventure.

1581
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:43,220
And then I found someone posted a video walkthrough of the Islands of Adventure

1582
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:44,460
Preview Center.

1583
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:48,140
And that's all I'm going to be able to think about for the rest of the day.

1584
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:51,060
Geez. Well, we'll have to do a Patreon on that.

1585
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:52,540
On that video.

1586
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:53,500
On just that video.

1587
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:54,420
On just that video.

1588
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:57,380
But no, I want to I want Mike to meet all his Star Trek friends.

1589
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,220
I want him to go to this thing.

1590
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:01,740
Yeah. Reginald, the guy who played Barkley.

1591
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:05,380
Reginald Barkley, the nervous crew member on Star Trek Next Generation.

1592
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:07,780
You can host some panels.

1593
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:10,500
Oh, I'd love to host some panels.

1594
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,060
Please. That's true.

1595
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:13,540
We should all be hosting a lot of panels.

1596
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:15,780
You could do like a roast of Jonathan Freaks.

1597
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:17,540
Oh my God. You could like emcee the Roaster Jonathan Freaks.

1598
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,820
That is a dream of mine.

1599
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:21,460
They do roasts or you just proposing that happens.

1600
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:22,780
I'm pitching that.

1601
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:23,980
I think that's a great idea.

1602
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:25,980
I would love to roast Jonathan Freaks.

1603
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:28,940
Make jokes about how big his dick is.

1604
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:31,140
Yeah. I would also be kissing his ass.

1605
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:32,420
Yeah. Yeah.

1606
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:34,180
This guy is so charitable.

1607
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:36,980
Let me tell you that you at some point were like,

1608
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:38,660
I would like him to play my father.

1609
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:42,300
Well, I pitched a show a few years ago where he would be my father.

1610
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:46,180
Yeah. So and who did everyone want to be Jason's father?

1611
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:49,060
Well, I've said I've there's two people, right?

1612
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:50,580
Was it one of the Wala Sean?

1613
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:53,780
You had an idea for something and I thought for ages, you would said

1614
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:55,980
Matt Walsh and I was like, yeah, I like Matt Walsh.

1615
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:58,980
He's great. And you were like, no, I said Wala Sean.

1616
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:03,340
And I had to go like, oh, OK.

1617
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:06,260
That's a very specific choice.

1618
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:07,420
But that is very funny.

1619
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:10,340
I would love to be acting.

1620
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:14,380
It would be an honor to to act opposite Wala Sean.

1621
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:19,020
And this show would be played in exclusively in retirement communities.

1622
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:21,620
In Mike's living room.

1623
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:23,700
A 70 and over only show.

1624
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:26,340
It's about two older men in a retirement community.

1625
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:28,940
One is the son, but they're the same age somehow.

1626
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:31,860
Whoa, whoa. My dinner with Andre is way too exciting.

1627
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:34,180
Let's slow this bad boy down.

1628
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:36,860
I discussion of where the keys are.

1629
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:41,060
We saw Lindsay and I and a friend of the show, Ryan Perez,

1630
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:45,940
saw Wala Sean play directed by Andre Gregory, his co-star in

1631
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:49,460
My Dinner with Andre and sitting behind us for the Star Trek

1632
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:54,900
connection, Armand Shimmerman, who plays Quark, Quark, who was a

1633
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:57,940
who they played Ferengi's him and Wallace played Ferengi's.

1634
01:08:57,940 --> 01:08:59,700
Oh, that's yeah. Wow.

1635
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:01,220
And so he went to see his friend.

1636
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:04,060
He is. I thought I was thrilled.

1637
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:06,460
We were like, I was running for I was like, oh, my God.

1638
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:09,580
That's wasn't it also one of their birthdays?

1639
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:11,620
It was Andre's birthday. Yeah.

1640
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:14,740
And we walked out into the lobby because it was at the Red Cat,

1641
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:16,780
which is a smaller theater downtown.

1642
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:20,540
We walked out in the lobby and we were like, it was the opening night of it.

1643
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:21,860
And it was a short run.

1644
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:23,580
But people were sort of congregating.

1645
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,780
And then Wallace and Andre were out.

1646
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:29,780
And all of a sudden we realized we were in the middle of Andre's birthday

1647
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:33,980
celebration and there was a cake and people started singing Happy Birthday.

1648
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:36,940
And then we were like, oh, shit, like we're we thought it was just like

1649
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:38,660
people milling about after the show.

1650
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:41,300
But I think it was like friends of theirs.

1651
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:42,620
So we were like, I don't know.

1652
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:46,620
And then we were like, should we if we get cake, would it be bad?

1653
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:48,740
Probably would be bad. We shouldn't get cake.

1654
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:50,580
We thought about it for a second.

1655
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:52,420
And then Perez almost did it.

1656
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:54,620
And then he decided not to do it.

1657
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:57,140
And then he instead, he just went up to the two of them

1658
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:59,060
and just said he likes them a lot.

1659
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:00,700
So that was fun. And that was a cue.

1660
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,460
And he was like waiting to like.

1661
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:06,100
And then he does a very good Andre impression, which I cannot approximate right now.

1662
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:09,420
But man, did I ever tell you about the time

1663
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:12,300
we suddenly ended up at Wallace Shawn's birthday?

1664
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:15,620
Let me tell you, we were so polite.

1665
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:18,020
We thought about taking some of his cake, but we didn't

1666
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:19,180
because we would have been in play.

1667
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:20,700
We didn't know. Yeah.

1668
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:23,620
We imagined so hard we would take his cake and then we stopped

1669
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:26,740
imagining that because I felt too guilty about even having the vision.

1670
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:29,180
I would take a slice of cake.

1671
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:30,180
Oh, I know. Yeah.

1672
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:34,780
Well, that's why that's the kind of like dynamic that why you need to be in a sitcom.

1673
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:35,660
Yeah. Yeah.

1674
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:38,380
I was also in the bathroom line with Armin Shimmerman.

1675
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:39,620
So there's that, too.

1676
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:42,620
You peed near Armin Shimmerman near him.

1677
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:45,340
Wow. So excited to pee near him.

1678
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:46,700
Great.

1679
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:50,540
That's not the peak of Star Trek fandom.

1680
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:52,220
Yeah. I know what is.

1681
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:55,540
Thanks for checking out more Star Trek on the on the second gate.

1682
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:57,380
Do we miss anything? Is there any?

1683
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:58,980
I mean, we got to the ice show.

1684
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:00,700
Yeah, I don't know.

1685
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:03,180
Please let us know if there was some Star Trek thing.

1686
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:05,620
We have not experienced internationally.

1687
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:07,180
That could be true.

1688
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,820
Well, I think one of these things, I think maybe Borg.

1689
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:11,940
The Borg was at a museum.

1690
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:13,420
Was it something in Germany?

1691
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:14,380
I believe.

1692
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:19,260
So if you went to Borg 40 in Bremen, Germany, let us know how it was different.

1693
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:23,980
Yeah. And let us know which Star Trek cast member you'd like to pee near.

1694
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:30,700
And email that to us at podcast the ride.

1695
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:32,100
Or I don't know.

1696
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,460
How much do I really want to get these? Yeah, I don't know.

1697
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:36,940
Well, I mean, I'll give you another answer for me, at least.

1698
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:41,620
John Delancey, who played Q in many of the different shows and played.

1699
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:46,860
He was that guy who killed himself on Breaking Bad in season two or three

1700
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:49,700
because of his daughter going in a plane crash on Trek.

1701
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:52,100
OK. So anyway, he I'd love to pee.

1702
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:55,500
He makes very pithy comments on the show, and I imagine he would be very

1703
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,900
entertaining while he was peeing.

1704
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:00,860
Who would have the best pee material?

1705
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:02,900
OK. All right.

1706
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:04,020
Well, I don't know.

1707
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,420
I don't have to give any more instructions.

1708
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:06,340
We could just end these.

1709
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:08,100
Yeah, let's do it.

1710
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,500
One more Star Trek sign off.

1711
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:10,060
What's another one?

1712
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:12,460
Oh, well, what do we do last we did?

1713
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:13,540
We did Live Long and Prosper.

1714
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:16,180
And you said Make It So, which was Picard's thing.

1715
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,980
Let's see, was that anything else?

1716
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:22,660
Keep on Trekking is what that one character said.

1717
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:24,420
Keep on Trekking, everybody.
