1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,320
Warning, the following podcast contains banana allergy

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,780
experiments, the universe hopping abilities

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,800
of Michigan J. Fraud, and a mysterious question,

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,280
who are the Centaur children?

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,120
Brett Davis joins us as we tackle

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,120
Universal's Kongfrontation today on Podcast The Ride.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,120
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the podcast about theme parks,

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,240
where at least two of the hosts today

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,840
have some major banana breath.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,400
I'm Scott Garner, joined by Mike Carlson.

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,960
Hell yeah, I'm one of the two.

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,320
Yeah, we were literally just eating bananas

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,440
before we recorded, can you believe it?

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,160
Not for show either, I just hadn't eaten anything today.

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,000
Same for me.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,840
Obviously it's a quick meal, or not a meal,

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,720
but a quick snack, I guess, a quick burst of energy.

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,920
Yeah, portable.

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,480
We found out Jason Sheridan, who's here,

22
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,080
does not have banana breath.

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,280
No, if I eat solely a banana first thing in the morning,

24
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,600
I get a tummy ache.

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,280
I can have it with cereal, or I can have it with.

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,920
The most persnickety stomach in podcasting.

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,640
That's interesting, I think I have a mild banana allergy.

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,400
Okay.

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,640
Because I have a little cough sometimes

30
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,840
after I have a banana.

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,680
Interesting.

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,200
And a past guest, Marissa Strickland,

33
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,800
was like, maybe you have a really mild allergy to bananas.

34
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,320
I don't know, can I test that?

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,800
Is that an allergy test I can do?

36
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,600
Yeah, I think you can do an allergy test

37
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,600
for most common items.

38
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,480
But isn't it just like rub it on your back?

39
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,160
I think they prick something on it.

40
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,000
And then put a little banana into my.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,640
There's some you can do with blood tests.

42
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,680
Right.

43
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,520
But I think the prick test is they just put it like,

44
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,200
whatever the item is on your skin

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,360
and see if you're allergic.

46
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,200
Basically, yep.

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,400
Are you gonna freak out in this episode?

48
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,120
No, I'm not, I'm just saying, I can do this at home, can't I?

49
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,680
Just put a banana on my skin and see if I get a rash?

50
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,040
Do you still have one in the house,

51
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,880
or did you eat the last one?

52
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,880
I do, do you want me to go do it?

53
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,040
Yeah, maybe while I introduce our guest,

54
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,120
why don't you go get a banana and rub it on your skin?

55
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,120
I'll rub it on my skin and see you at the end in 90 minutes

56
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,760
if it's a rash.

57
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,320
Wow, we usually don't have such cliffhangers,

58
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,160
that's exciting.

59
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,360
All right, while Mike grabs a banana,

60
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,000
we're happy to be joined by Forever Dog family member

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,640
from the podcast for laundry

62
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,240
and the National Lampoon Radio Hour, Brett Davis is here.

63
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,520
Hey, it's a true honor to be here.

64
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,520
Oh, geez, thanks, thanks for being here

65
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,840
and for taking up some of your trip from New York

66
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,760
to come over here.

67
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,560
I'm a big fan of the show.

68
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,400
Oh, thank you.

69
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,240
I'm happy to hear that.

70
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,120
Very flattered to be asked.

71
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,720
Oh, geez, absolutely.

72
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,720
Yes, and well, so you're out from New York for a little bit.

73
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,920
I know, because I saw you before,

74
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,120
a little bit of city walk time.

75
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,080
What'd you think?

76
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,080
Did it live up to your expectation?

77
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,520
Was it the best, has it been the best thing

78
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,080
of the trip so far?

79
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,720
Yeah, I think it's been the best thing of the trip.

80
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,720
I marveled at Jurassic Parking.

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,480
I sat and just stared at that giant screen

82
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,480
playing the worst music videos I've ever seen.

83
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,320
That's very true, I know.

84
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,320
And it's not like it's the top 10 hits of right now

85
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,680
and you're going like,

86
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,440
I guess I don't know what the kids are into.

87
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,080
You don't know what any of it is.

88
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,440
Yeah, well, the one I did pay attention to a lot

89
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,960
was Weezer's doing take on me now.

90
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,280
They're just an 80s cover bit.

91
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
Oh, this is perfect while Mike is off Mike.

92
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,360
Fantastic, yes, this Weezer shit.

93
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,960
Everyone on Mike agrees that the new Weezer,

94
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,440
the 80s Weezer covers are the worst things

95
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,400
that have ever happened and let's change topic

96
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,400
before Mike gets back to the microphone.

97
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,560
I'd argue they're not the worst things,

98
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,920
but it is pretty just shrug-worthy.

99
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,160
It's mainly that.

100
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah, you're right that maybe not specifically terrible,

101
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,360
but why?

102
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,520
They're just like, it's like the Gus Van Zant psycho.

103
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,120
Why did this happen?

104
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,840
It's just, we're just gonna do the exact same thing,

105
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,360
but with slightly less charisma.

106
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,360
They had Finn Wolfhardt play,

107
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,920
like he was the lead singer of this 80s band.

108
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,360
So more Finn Wolfhardt 80,

109
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,080
that's like, this is another iteration of that is his schtick

110
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,920
because he's just today's kid who's also an 80s.

111
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,920
Born in like 1998 or 2003 or whatever he was born in.

112
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,480
No idea how old this person is.

113
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,080
The music video that I always saw a lot playing up there

114
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,080
was the Coldplay music video with CGI apes

115
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,480
that I did not realize was Coldplay.

116
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,280
I've never seen CGI apes.

117
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,280
Yeah, like a whole crew of CGI apes dancing to a song.

118
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,920
I forget whether it's from Milo Zyloto

119
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,600
or another one.

120
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,420
Mike, do you know what?

121
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,260
What's the song?

122
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,640
Viva la Vida, I don't know the song.

123
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,520
Viva la Vida is from Milo Zyloto, yes.

124
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,480
How are we managing to talk about anything

125
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,200
but that you right now are rubbing little banana bits

126
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,840
onto your palm?

127
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,520
Well, the back of my hand.

128
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,400
Oh yes, sorry, that's the opposite of a palm.

129
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Well, I was just, cause everyone was just, you know,

130
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,720
I was just trying to figure out the best way to do it.

131
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,160
I think this is good.

132
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,880
I don't want it to be like getting the couch dirty,

133
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,880
but that's enough banana residue

134
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,000
to see if there's a breakout.

135
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,640
I think I thought this has been such a delicate process

136
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,560
and I think I thought you were just gonna take a banana

137
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,560
and just rub it whole really fast.

138
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,160
Do you want me to go back and do that?

139
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,960
No, no, no, I think this is fine,

140
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,280
but you did it very medically.

141
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,760
You did it, it's a little dab and then you

142
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,080
Really, if I just- Some gauze on it.

143
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,920
If I start gesticulating wildly,

144
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,920
I don't wanna rub banana on the couch.

145
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,800
Mm-hmm, does it smell like banana on your hand now?

146
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,280
Yeah, my hand smells like banana right now.

147
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,440
So like you're engulfed in banana bread.

148
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,280
Yeah.

149
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,160
I also like isn't going to like answer

150
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,760
a few of digestion issues on bananas.

151
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,240
Well, but I don't think that it's not digestion issues.

152
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,120
It's like some sort of like my body rejects it a little bit

153
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,600
because the cough would suggest not a digestion issue.

154
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,000
It would suggest there's something that incompatible.

155
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,040
Am I wrong here?

156
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,840
Kind of like- I have no idea.

157
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,680
I don't have an upset stomach when I have a banana

158
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,760
is what I'm saying.

159
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,960
So I don't think it's digestion.

160
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,600
I think it's simply a mild allergy

161
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,920
if it indeed is an allergy.

162
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,080
You might end up in 90 minutes where you might look

163
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,720
and you have a big Donald Duck kind of bump

164
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,600
on the back of your hand.

165
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,760
It's very possible.

166
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,680
Possibly you'll have to take me to the hospital.

167
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,600
We don't know.

168
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,080
I've never rubbed a banana on my hand before.

169
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,160
Well then if so, so there may be an edit at some point

170
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,960
where we, because we have to get to 90 minutes minimum,

171
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,840
if not two hours, if not two and a half hours.

172
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,400
So we cannot cut it off short.

173
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,960
So there may be an edit and that's where we will have

174
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,800
taking you to the hospital.

175
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,280
Brett, you have to stay with us.

176
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,920
Oh yeah, I'm gonna be at the hospital talking about-

177
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,760
Take the-

178
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,200
Well, it is like a thematic for us though,

179
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,920
because the big hospital in Burbank is Providence St. Joe's,

180
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,480
which is next to the Disney lot

181
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,480
and is the hospital Walt Disney died in.

182
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,680
Oh wow, okay.

183
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,520
We have all, yes, we haven't said this out loud I think,

184
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,560
but we all have a sort of a wish to die at that hospital.

185
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,200
That's sort of what we want.

186
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,600
Would it be too much of a stretch to do an episode

187
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,280
dedicated to that hospital?

188
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,400
Oh, not at all.

189
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,440
No, no, please.

190
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,280
Absolutely not.

191
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,120
Come next week.

192
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,640
Well, yeah, first things first, we have to get in there,

193
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,440
which maybe will happen today.

194
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,280
Yeah.

195
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,880
And then yeah, let's find the bed.

196
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,840
We've been to the, I don't know if,

197
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,680
well you've been out here,

198
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,240
there's this restaurant, the Tam O' Shanter,

199
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,680
which is where, like he, Walt went there all the time.

200
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,000
He had a table there.

201
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We've sat at the wall.

202
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,960
I actually have, I've just passed by the Walt table.

203
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,960
All right, so there's the Walt table.

204
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,960
We got to find the Walt hospital bed.

205
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,400
Oh my God, yeah, you think they have the same bed there

206
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,800
and there's like, it's like a little tribute to them?

207
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,640
Oh yeah.

208
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,680
And if you get brought in there in the ER

209
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,400
and they're like, oh, and you're like dying,

210
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,760
but you're like, oh, I got the Walt room.

211
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,160
Got the Walt bed.

212
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,640
The bed is really bad.

213
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,480
This old bed.

214
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,880
Or yeah, there's just like an old,

215
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,000
like it's an old room.

216
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,160
You're walking through and there's like a brown room,

217
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,000
weirdly.

218
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,840
What is this?

219
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,520
They haven't updated anything.

220
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,120
Smells like cigarettes.

221
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,120
Same dust.

222
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,840
Very mixed feelings, because it's like,

223
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,800
oh, this is historic, but also like, they didn't save him.

224
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,720
So like, that doesn't make me optimistic.

225
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,120
You're getting like out of the ambulance

226
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,760
and people are like screaming at each other

227
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,440
what's wrong with you and what they need to check,

228
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,280
like your blood pressure.

229
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,520
And you're like, excuse me, it would be possible.

230
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,360
I can't get it.

231
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,960
In the Walt room?

232
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,240
I don't mean to, it's okay if not,

233
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,600
but if it's not too crowded.

234
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,360
I'm gonna turn the front facing camera on on my phone.

235
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,320
They're like, no, sorry.

236
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,600
And you're like, well, did Roy die here?

237
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,480
Is Roy's bed available?

238
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,560
Did Annie Disney's?

239
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,080
Then you get it, then you're filming a YouTube video.

240
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,920
What up fam?

241
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,880
Dying like, this is dying like Walt.

242
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,960
Mike and I were at something lately

243
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,000
and we started to do a video and I jokingly said like,

244
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,040
what up fam?

245
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,240
Like sort of the like, fake YouTubey reviewer stuff.

246
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,480
And then someone on the other side of the table

247
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,200
about five minutes later started doing it sincerely.

248
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,320
And I immediately was like, oh my God, I feel so bad

249
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,280
that it's clearly doing it as a bit.

250
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,960
I don't think those people knew we were doing it

251
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,800
with any irony.

252
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Okay, okay, that's fine.

253
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,200
And we didn't do it after they did it.

254
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,200
I think they were just like, oh, another YouTuber.

255
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,040
Yikes.

256
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,400
And they probably were like, honestly,

257
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,960
he could use some more energy.

258
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,800
He wasn't doing that.

259
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,320
You gotta really dive into that what up fam.

260
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,320
Yeah, cause they did it much more energetically.

261
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,920
I think we're all right.

262
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,400
This is a, it is totally okay if you don't have an answer

263
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,800
to this question because this is a very specific question

264
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,600
and one I'd never considered till right now.

265
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,560
Have you ever, is there a dream hospital

266
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,000
you would like to die at?

267
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,520
Hmm.

268
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,560
You know, I don't contemplate death that much,

269
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,320
let alone where specifically I'd like it to happen

270
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,960
if it's a hospital situation.

271
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,240
Yeah, this is if we're lucky enough to be,

272
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,880
to have some help.

273
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,880
Yeah, I always say I wanna die in a tour bus crash.

274
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,040
I think it's the most taller way to go.

275
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,880
Oh sure.

276
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,840
And if I have my, there's 20th anniversary tour,

277
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,640
the Dane Cook Tourgasm bus crash.

278
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,920
But that's a few years away.

279
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,080
Now is that because you've been accepted

280
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,280
into the Dane Cook Tourgasm lineup

281
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,040
or because you're just like hanging out with them?

282
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,640
You know, I think I'd be part of the brotherhood.

283
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,400
I mean, I hope, I wish this for you, absolutely.

284
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,000
When is the original Tourgasm?

285
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,840
When was it?

286
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,480
So how many years are we away from 20?

287
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,320
2006, right?

288
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,240
That was peak Cook.

289
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,560
Yeah, so not far, we're not far.

290
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,720
For clarification though, his current tour,

291
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,240
I know for a fact is called the Tell It Like It Is Tour.

292
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,080
Oh really?

293
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,000
Tell It Like It Is Tour.

294
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,600
Oh, he's finally being honest?

295
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,040
Okay, cool.

296
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,120
I was at a, I ate at the Boston Market

297
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,160
behind him 10 years ago.

298
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,640
I was eating alone and someone was talking about Dane Cook

299
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,600
and I turned around and it was Dane Cook.

300
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,280
He was like, yeah man, and like, you know,

301
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,840
somebody was like, yeah, that's just Dane, man.

302
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,160
That's just Dane Cook and I turned around

303
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,120
and I was like, it is Dane Cook.

304
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,960
And like, we were like, there were four people in there,

305
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,640
three people including him at his table and me

306
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,320
at my table right behind him.

307
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,400
Wow, wow.

308
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,240
All right, I'm no longer impressed by Walt's table

309
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,160
at the Tamoshanter.

310
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,720
You've seen Dane's table at the Boston Market.

311
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,960
Which I believe is gone?

312
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,800
It is closed.

313
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,640
Yeah.

314
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,600
No, we should have gone in there

315
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,400
and seen if we could preserve it beforehand,

316
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,240
but we can't now.

317
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,080
At least the plaque?

318
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,080
You know, I don't think there was.

319
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,160
I did have many meals in that Boston Market 10 years ago.

320
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,000
But I don't think anyone.

321
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,400
Any meals at the Boston Market?

322
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,800
I used to be, I PA'd at the ranch.

323
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,960
Oh, you were at the Warner Ranch.

324
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,040
At the Warner Ranch, yeah.

325
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,120
The Warner Ranch, for people who don't live here

326
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,160
have never been lucky enough to work on these lots.

327
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,160
The Warner Ranch is where the Friends opening sequence

328
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,000
was filmed.

329
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,820
The Fountain.

330
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,720
That's where the real Friends fountain.

331
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,600
Yeah. Yeah.

332
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,960
And much of the music man.

333
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,800
Really, there?

334
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,640
Yeah.

335
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,460
Is that right?

336
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,300
I didn't know that.

337
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,140
I believe so.

338
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,200
The movie version, yeah, from the 60s.

339
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,280
I walked around the lot and I found the old giant WB sign

340
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,200
that they used to use in those promos.

341
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,520
You remember like Michigan J. Frog

342
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,260
would be like animated in the corner

343
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,400
and then you would see like this crazy lit WB sign

344
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,960
that they would do like all these angles around

345
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,200
for their like bumpers.

346
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,520
It was sitting, at least it was there 10 years ago,

347
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,400
just sitting back there on the lot.

348
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
Just decaying?

349
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,920
Yes, just decaying.

350
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,020
I really recommend anyone that is at least peaked by this

351
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,040
to go and watch all of those old Michigan J. Frogs

352
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,760
like bumpers.

353
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,760
They are insane.

354
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,280
And it's like this weird shared universe

355
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,040
where like all of the actors

356
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,440
and like some of the cartoons know each other.

357
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,600
And like you'll get like Superman interacting

358
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,740
with like Jackie.

359
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,820
And like, yeah, it's just this weird world

360
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,700
like John Witherspoon talking to like James Vanderbeek.

361
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,540
It's very strange.

362
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,580
He would bring Cameron and like Marvin the Martian.

363
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,400
Yeah.

364
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,240
That sort of.

365
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,260
Cause when he bridged the gap between like WB kids

366
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,620
and the WB network, like the prime time.

367
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,780
Michigan J. Frog could walk in all worlds.

368
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,620
Yeah.

369
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,440
Yeah.

370
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,300
It's like the day walker.

371
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,180
It's like the lead.

372
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,500
Will we do an episode on just Michigan J. Frog?

373
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,340
Yes.

374
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,160
Yes, sure.

375
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,000
Yes.

376
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,840
Can you Skype me in for that?

377
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,680
Yeah, of course.

378
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,520
Oh yeah.

379
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,360
Yeah, I'll be like, yeah.

380
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,880
You know, this was, I gotta see if it,

381
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,460
is it in my notes for,

382
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,920
I was trying to remember why this came up.

383
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,340
And I think it's because we just,

384
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,320
I don't know if it's out by now,

385
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,160
but we did an episode about the roller coaster

386
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,560
Kingda Ka with Dan Klein.

387
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,440
And for some reason,

388
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,440
I think that is why I found out that there was some song,

389
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,520
or was this because, wait a minute,

390
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,840
this might be because I was looking up the Six Flags song,

391
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,480
the Venga Boys.

392
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,860
I don't remember why,

393
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,220
but I discovered through all of this research

394
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,360
that there was a commercial for the

395
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,760
Sylvester Tweety mysteries,

396
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,360
which was in Kids W.

397
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,200
I remember that.

398
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,120
Where there was a, just in the promo,

399
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,600
the Wikipedia noted that in the promo,

400
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,560
Tweety like raps to the Venga Boys song,

401
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,920
something like that.

402
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,040
And he said, the phrase he says is like,

403
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,440
gotta get that putty.

404
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,440
Give me that putty, give me that putty.

405
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,440
And if you're a podcast completist,

406
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,840
and you are aware of the work of our friend Bug Mane,

407
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,240
Buzz Buzz, Skittle Skattle,

408
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,000
give me that putty sauce.

409
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,640
I just really jumped out at me.

410
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,360
The rapping about putty.

411
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,240
I was meaning to mention this to you guys.

412
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,120
Putty cat is what-

413
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,840
Yes, he calls him putty cat.

414
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,920
He would call Sylvester.

415
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,000
So that it is from Tweety Bird,

416
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,840
but did you have a clip of it?

417
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,080
I don't, after I discovered this,

418
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,920
I was looking up as many Sylvester Tweety mysteries

419
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,440
promos as I could find.

420
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,920
I'm sure a listener knows exactly what it is

421
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,440
and will tweet it at us right now

422
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,520
as they're listening to this.

423
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,080
We're going to the Paley Center right after this.

424
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,200
We have to find these promos.

425
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,240
Oh, here it is, okay, yes.

426
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,880
Well, it's because I was gonna, I'll do this now.

427
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,240
I wanted in that episode to propose that we do,

428
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,200
I don't know why this hasn't occurred to us yet.

429
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,160
When are we gonna do a full second gate episode

430
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,040
about Mr. Six?

431
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,880
Oh, of course.

432
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,880
The old, the Six Flags old man.

433
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,840
That is an epic.

434
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,320
Yes, so let's get that up there.

435
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,760
What an original name.

436
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,280
That's his name.

437
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,680
Could have been Mr. Flags, but instead it's Mr. Six.

438
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,640
So that, thinking about Mr. Six led me to the official

439
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,520
Wikipedia for the Vengabus.

440
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,200
And in the section in popular culture,

441
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,120
which needs additional citations for verification,

442
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,080
it says this song is used for promos

443
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,520
on Sylvester and Tweety mysteries,

444
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,560
and I'm sorry I was wrong, it's We Wike Da Poodie.

445
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,680
We wike, we wike da Poodie.

446
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,480
Why is he saying?

447
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,080
Buz, buz.

448
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,960
Didn't they fight?

449
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,840
Didn't Sylvester and Tweety fight?

450
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,480
I believe by the mysteries,

451
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,960
they were working together. Oh, I guess they were teamed up.

452
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,800
They were working together.

453
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,840
Oh, the Wikely pair, yes, yeah.

454
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,680
And they had to put their differences.

455
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,320
They had a common enemy, unsolved homicides.

456
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,800
That he had to get to the bottom of.

457
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,160
And then they caused all of America

458
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,520
to have a common interest.

459
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,400
This potter's field, we're getting to the bottom.

460
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,920
We're getting justice for everyone

461
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,640
buried in this potter's field.

462
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,880
Sorry, I'm just glad you unlocked all this in my brain.

463
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,440
It's been buzzing around for the last,

464
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,200
it's been buzzing around for the last month.

465
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,440
So if you're interested in Poodie,

466
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,680
subscribe to Podcast Thride, The Second Gate.

467
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,240
No one liked it, you both just got the most stern faces.

468
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,600
Well, I'm thinking about Mr. Six now.

469
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,520
It's always nice to be thinking about Mr. Six.

470
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,840
Is there more than one Mr. Six?

471
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,320
I think it was in the commercials,

472
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,200
always played by the same guy.

473
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,040
Okay, I had a hunch when Ronald changes.

474
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,160
You're like, wait a minute.

475
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,200
I felt like one year they had a separate Mr. Six.

476
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,800
They might have, but I believe the original Mr. Six,

477
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,440
and I don't wanna say too much

478
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,960
because obviously we should save this for the episode.

479
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,720
But what I discovered about Mr. Six

480
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,880
is that Mr. Six is hot.

481
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,000
Yes, the real man.

482
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,800
Was I reading about him a week ago?

483
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,640
Yes.

484
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,440
How has this not gotten in the air before?

485
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,640
We briefly brought him up, I think,

486
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,480
but for whatever reason we haven't.

487
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,520
There's only one, he wasn't like an old man

488
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,560
they had to replace, basically, that's all I'll say.

489
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,800
He didn't pass away?

490
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,920
He didn't pass away.

491
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,080
In which case.

492
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,880
Can I see the Mr. Six room, please?

493
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,720
Yeah.

494
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,680
Now you have an answer, you should die

495
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,360
where Mr. Six died. Oh my God.

496
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,240
Yeah, he's a stud.

497
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,200
I just showed, I can't turn it all the way around.

498
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,120
Jason just saw Mr. Six.

499
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,200
The real, yes.

500
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,440
Does that make you? The little tease,

501
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,920
the real Mr. Six actor was like a hunky dude.

502
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,120
Okay, I believe that.

503
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,160
Here, I'll show it from my phone, can you see that?

504
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,920
Oh yeah.

505
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,480
Ripped guns.

506
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,880
Yeah, that was Mr. Six.

507
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,000
Anyways, we'll get on this, Six will come soon.

508
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,840
Six will come.

509
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,280
Six will come soon.

510
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,320
So anyways, oh boy, I'm delighted by all that,

511
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,320
but let's get down,

512
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,800
because hey, we're covering a huge thing right now,

513
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,680
and I'm so glad you wanted to talk about this.

514
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,400
Confrontation, and I love the specificity

515
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,240
of you bringing this up,

516
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,600
because clearly confrontation

517
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,240
equals the very specific ride in Florida,

518
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,040
and not just all of King Kong in the parks,

519
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,600
which there is so much.

520
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,720
Why confrontation?

521
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,200
What's the attachment there?

522
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,960
Well, it was my favorite ride.

523
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,840
As a kid, they'd have that scrolling Universal Studios ad

524
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,160
where it's just. On the tapes?

525
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,000
It was on the tapes.

526
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,200
Yes, inside the letters, one of my favorite things.

527
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,560
Yeah, where you'd have the words Universal Studios,

528
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,560
and then you'd see King Kong, you'd see the Out of Time car,

529
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,480
you'd see all of these things.

530
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,280
Jaws jumping out, Yogi and Boo Boo,

531
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,720
yeah.

532
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,880
Hitchcock walking into the silhouette.

533
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,280
You can ride the movies, unbelievable,

534
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,280
and I never got to go as a little kid until I was 12,

535
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,600
so I had a slightly adulter appreciation of it.

536
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,480
Every kid had gone to Universal,

537
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,520
all I wanted to do was ride this King Kong ride,

538
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,720
because that's the one that stuck out in the ad for me.

539
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,960
I loved King Kong as a kid.

540
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,480
I remember renting Son of Kong and Mighty Joe Young,

541
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,560
and these movies are not meant for six-year-olds.

542
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,760
Yeah, some of those Kong movies are really violent.

543
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,600
King Kong versus Godzilla is very weird.

544
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,560
So King Kong was like, that was the,

545
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,040
I was going to Disney, I was going everywhere,

546
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,360
but King Kong was the main attraction for this whole trip.

547
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,520
Wow, sure.

548
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,800
And probably at 12, you're chasing thrills a little more.

549
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,640
Yeah.

550
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,460
You want something scary.

551
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,160
It's a little scary, but once I realized

552
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,080
I could deal with it, I rode the thing three times.

553
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,920
Wow.

554
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,760
Yeah.

555
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,960
Yeah, it's a good, this was a really epic attraction.

556
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,520
And like, I mean, it's not scary

557
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,280
in the thrill ride way of scary.

558
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,680
It's just like, it's not even just the ape necessarily.

559
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,000
I think just the general veneer of it,

560
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,400
the fact that you're in this grimy subway station

561
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,560
for so much of it.

562
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,400
Yeah.

563
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,240
It's terrifying.

564
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,640
Yeah, 70s New York, the recreation of 70s New York,

565
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,120
you're going through a queue.

566
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,760
You may know from Joker.

567
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,600
Yes.

568
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,440
Sure.

569
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,560
No other films.

570
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,000
It's almost a character.

571
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,120
The queue just filled with graffiti.

572
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,020
Like they had actual graffiti artists graffiti the place,

573
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,820
and then of course people just added their own graffiti

574
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,900
over the years.

575
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,740
Cool.

576
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,460
I remember seeing like a curse maybe on the wall.

577
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,300
Yes.

578
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,740
Which is insane to see it, universal.

579
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,300
That's pretty cool that they like,

580
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,300
almost encouraged people to head to that tapestry.

581
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,420
But yeah, this could have been any,

582
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,420
this could have been like a, you know,

583
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,420
dressed up, now they have a cleaned up version of New York

584
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,580
with the Jimmy Fallon ride.

585
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,300
It's cool that they had like grimy, shitty,

586
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,660
Ed Koch New York.

587
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,060
Ed Koch does not appear on the ride, right?

588
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,900
I don't believe so.

589
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,720
No.

590
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,540
They have a real news anchor in it,

591
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,140
like an actual New York news anchor doing like,

592
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,860
evacuate, get out of here.

593
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,700
Yeah.

594
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,140
In the ride video.

595
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,340
You know, I went 1998 and he was still on TV.

596
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,660
So it was very kind of cool to see that.

597
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,500
Oh wow.

598
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
Was he the news anchor you grew up watching?

599
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,420
Yeah, he was on, I wouldn't say grew up watching.

600
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,940
He taught you everything you knew?

601
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,780
Yeah.

602
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,620
Mom, mom, the nightly news is on.

603
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,180
Mr. Rogers, this guy, Rollin' Smith.

604
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,020
Rollin' Smith.

605
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,180
He looked a little like a Vulcan.

606
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,100
Yes, thick eyebrows.

607
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,260
Yeah, very like a stern presence.

608
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,500
He was on the UPN affiliate.

609
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,060
I'm sure he was on like a major one

610
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,620
and then got bumped down over the years to UPN.

611
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,580
Most likely.

612
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,020
But yeah, he was the 10 o'clock news guy.

613
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,660
Wow, wow.

614
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,060
Was he New York or New Jersey?

615
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:37,300
I think the UPN one might have been based out of Secaucus.

616
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,140
Nice.

617
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,700
It's kind of been a big bump down.

618
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,580
They would play weird like New Jersey,

619
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,940
like shots of like New Jersey parks

620
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,420
at like a weird times of the day

621
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,060
when they just didn't have a commercial to play.

622
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,620
But yeah, it was the New York area.

623
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,580
Sure, yeah, yeah.

624
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,500
Affiliate.

625
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,580
I am very fond of Rollin' Smith also

626
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,900
because he was, it's not the same video.

627
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,580
So they got him twice because he also was the host

628
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,100
of the Tram Tour attraction.

629
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,100
And if you don't know the full breakdown,

630
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,660
King Kong was a stop on the Universal Tram Tour

631
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,220
and like a huge step up for them.

632
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,140
They had done Jaws and that was great,

633
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,940
but like the technological advance

634
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,340
to have that King Kong robot just really like

635
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,220
took the studio tour into the next, into another gear.

636
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,540
Then when Universal Studios Florida opened in 1990,

637
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,940
they turned it into this full blown huge attraction

638
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,460
in and of itself.

639
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,260
And Rollin' Smith was on both.

640
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,340
And I was like, let me look up some Rollin' Smith stuff.

641
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:46,340
Rollin' Smith has this odd, like a part of,

642
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:51,060
oddly Star Wars lore and a very specific Star Wars lore.

643
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,860
I'd never heard of any of this.

644
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,380
That the Star Wars holiday special

645
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,100
the tape that it was mainly distributed on,

646
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,500
because Star Wars holiday special lived as a,

647
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
people trade in tapes like this bizarre

648
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,380
can you believe this thing taped off TV.

649
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,900
And the main tape that was distributed,

650
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,700
like that people traded around,

651
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,900
had a very brief clip of him at the very beginning

652
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,780
doing a five second tease for what's on the news that night.

653
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,060
And his phrase was fighting the frizzies at 11.

654
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:28,060
Which presumably fighting the frizzies,

655
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,860
I don't think, I don't know that anyone ever saw

656
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,460
the actual story, but I think fighting the frizzies

657
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,180
has something to do with hair care.

658
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,220
I guess, maybe, we don't know,

659
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,420
unless there were creatures called the frizzies out.

660
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:44,300
Yeah, was this an in universe news probe look?

661
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,420
Oh, it's some like deep Star Wars thing

662
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,260
that we don't know about.

663
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,460
It's like wearing a robe.

664
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,700
A little Star Wars news teases is a very good idea.

665
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,220
The Empire Strikes Back at 11.

666
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,060
George would have put the frizzies in his sequel trilogy.

667
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,620
It was gonna be all about the frizzies.

668
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,700
It was gonna be about the frizzies.

669
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,180
They fight the force, they're little bad guys.

670
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,500
They're smaller than atoms.

671
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,860
The frizzies are very small.

672
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,300
But fighting the frizzies also has this odd,

673
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,780
what kind of has sustained that phrase in pop culture

674
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,340
is that one of the first episodes of South Park,

675
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,340
Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics in 1999,

676
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,340
because it's an old holiday special,

677
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,900
they started it with a shot of their editor

678
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,260
dressed up like Roland Smith saying,

679
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,180
fighting the frizzies at 11.

680
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,020
Really?

681
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,500
Yeah. Wow.

682
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:45,020
The South Park guys tributed this very specific sliver

683
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:48,180
of this news tease on VHS's tape.tv.

684
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,100
I can picture that as you're saying.

685
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,540
Yeah, it does ring a bell.

686
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,700
I can picture that episode.

687
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,660
And he looks like it, they gave him a stash.

688
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,860
It's a wonderful little clip.

689
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,940
Those are all on YouTube.

690
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,940
So, I mean, most news anchors, I don't feel,

691
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,980
have this amount of lore.

692
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,820
This guy is the King Kong news anchor

693
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,660
and fighting the frizzies.

694
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,740
Pretty major stuff.

695
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,500
And probably he's like a good journalist.

696
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,100
Whatever.

697
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,140
Or donated to causes or something.

698
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,260
Sure, who cares.

699
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,700
I mean, now it would be Pat Kiernan,

700
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,700
who's the New York One anchor and is just in everything.

701
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,100
Oh, okay.

702
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,460
He's in every Marvel movie.

703
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,900
Like anytime you just need a New York anchor

704
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,460
and don't wanna shell out to NBC or CBS,

705
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,740
you just get him and he'll say anything.

706
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,980
Like, vampires on the loose.

707
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,700
It's just like, that's his bread and butter now

708
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,660
as far as New York people go.

709
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,500
Oh, wow.

710
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,940
Okay.

711
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,580
I like those game news anchors.

712
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,140
Yeah, I think he also hosts trivia at a bar somewhere.

713
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:55,980
Wow.

714
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,340
Nice.

715
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,180
He's everywhere.

716
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,260
We have a weatherman here in Los Angeles

717
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:04,500
named Fritz Coleman, who also considers himself

718
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,860
a bit of a funny man.

719
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,740
Like does stand out sometimes.

720
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,700
Does he?

721
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,540
Fritz Coleman?

722
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,060
He had a one man show running

723
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,740
at the Gary Marshall Theater in Burbank for a while.

724
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,580
Really?

725
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,400
Yeah.

726
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,900
He's a Burbank fixture because I have seen him

727
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,940
several times at the Bob's Big Boy Starbucks,

728
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,060
which is essentially pretty much in the same block

729
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,580
as the Gary Marshall Theater and the Boston Market.

730
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,460
Yeah, that we were talking about earlier.

731
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,060
I love how many locals we're talking about.

732
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,380
Toluca Lake, Burbank, like really coming through today.

733
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,380
Five minutes from the hospital, Walt died.

734
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,060
Wow.

735
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,540
So in the same, we could go see the Fritz table,

736
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,820
the Dane table and the Walt bed.

737
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,660
Yep.

738
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,180
It would take a half hour.

739
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,660
Damn, let's do it.

740
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,820
This is dangerously off topic,

741
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:56,460
but he's not the Mr. Wacky guy, right?

742
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,380
No.

743
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,220
Okay.

744
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,180
What's Mr. Wacky?

745
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,820
It's a video where they're,

746
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,780
it's like a morning news weekend and they're like,

747
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,740
well, what's going on at this parking lot?

748
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,260
And it's like, well, we've gotten a big inflatable slide.

749
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,180
It's just a bunch of like very tired volunteers,

750
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,860
first thing in the morning.

751
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,700
And they meet,

752
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,260
this anchor's doing the worst possible job

753
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:27,420
anyone's ever done in doing like a fun segment.

754
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,420
And so I've heard that he's, you know,

755
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,420
he's bombed a few of these.

756
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,260
Oh, okay.

757
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,100
Oh, interesting.

758
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,820
Wait, so why Mr. Wacky?

759
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,140
Is it this video?

760
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:37,980
Yeah.

761
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,740
It looks like that's San Diego.

762
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,580
Oh, okay.

763
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,460
Nevermind then.

764
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,580
Yeah, but I do wanna watch this.

765
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,180
It's really, really great.

766
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,780
I really recommend everyone watch it.

767
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,180
When you first, I was wondering why Mr. Wacky

768
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,740
sounded familiar to me and I was like,

769
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:58,140
that's not what Robin Williams calls his penis, is it?

770
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:58,980
No, that's Mr. Happy.

771
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,020
I'd say Mr. Happy, yeah.

772
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,980
Oh, Mr. Wacky, ho.

773
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,980
You could imagine maybe once in a while

774
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,940
he called it Mr. Wacky.

775
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,100
He might've tried that out as an alternate name.

776
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,820
Mr. Wacky is the best comedy sketch

777
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,140
that's ever happened in real life.

778
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,980
I'll say that much.

779
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,780
Wow, okay, okay.

780
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,620
I will.

781
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,860
Yeah, we have to look at this.

782
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,180
Okay, so, back to Kong.

783
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,540
Roland Smith, great job, great work.

784
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,540
Yeah.

785
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,540
You know who else acts in this ride?

786
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,500
There's a lot of VO and a lot of the SWAT team voices

787
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,420
and everything.

788
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,060
Ron Knight, who is also the voice

789
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,140
of our favorite theme park character, Botanicus.

790
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,780
He also has voices in Jaws, apparently.

791
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,020
I've made an effort to try to get him on the show.

792
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,260
Yeah, what happened with that again?

793
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,380
Or is there no response?

794
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:46,980
He did respond in an interesting cryptic manner.

795
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,100
It was like teasing stories that he has.

796
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,460
And then he never responded again.

797
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,940
So I don't know.

798
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,100
I really like to talk to Ron Knight.

799
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,300
Do we have to interview Cotswinkle too?

800
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,340
Who did respond to me?

801
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,780
Botanicus is his creator.

802
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,060
Oh, oh.

803
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,900
The author.

804
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,620
The author of The Green Planet.

805
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,140
He created all the ET ancillary characters

806
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,900
and the characters from the ride.

807
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,580
This man, William Cotswinkle.

808
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,420
Did you make it to,

809
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,820
are you fond of the ET adventure as well

810
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,340
from those, from Florida trips?

811
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,940
That's a close second of the worst things

812
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,580
I was excited about.

813
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,020
I didn't know that this was a sequel,

814
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,340
but yeah, that was unbelievable.

815
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,180
Yeah, there's a book,

816
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,500
he wrote a book in the 80s called The Green Planet

817
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,620
and that's where most of the lore from the ride comes about.

818
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:36,060
We did a whole Patreon on Botanicus and all this lore,

819
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,500
but I emailed him.

820
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,580
And just as a little spoiler from that Patreon episode,

821
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,740
he emailed back and he said,

822
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,020
I asked him if he created Botanicus and he said,

823
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,380
dear Mike, thanks for your email,

824
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,540
except for ET himself,

825
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,860
I created all the characters

826
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,260
in the book of The Green Planet

827
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,540
and that includes Botanicus.

828
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,780
Good luck with your podcasts.

829
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,780
Best wishes from ET and me, Bill.

830
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,740
Wow.

831
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,020
Which is like, does he also think I'm 12?

832
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,620
I like that ET also gave me a best wish,

833
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,740
but also it was.

834
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,260
I don't know that he had the authority

835
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,580
to speak on behalf of ET.

836
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,780
That's questionable.

837
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,220
I could send this to Amblin

838
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,460
and Spielberg would sue his ass like crazy.

839
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,100
ET did not authorize this hello.

840
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:24,100
ET does not wish you well on your podcasts, 12 year old boy.

841
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,500
Nonsense, he loves us.

842
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,020
He said, the last time I went on the ride,

843
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,300
he actually said my name.

844
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,340
But I have Kotzwinkle's email now.

845
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,180
Wow.

846
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,020
So.

847
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,860
Kotzwinkle.

848
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,420
If you can get the voice,

849
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,420
if we can get an interview with him,

850
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,260
combine it with an interview with Kotzwinkle.

851
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,100
Boy.

852
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,020
Can we speak to Botanicus?

853
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:50,020
He's Botanicus with you right now?

854
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,380
It's Botanicus' favorite curse word.

855
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,300
And then he's like, oh, you could speak to ET too.

856
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,300
It's like, no, no, no.

857
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,300
No, no, no.

858
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,580
Shit from the movies, we don't care about that.

859
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,420
Yeah.

860
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,660
Okay.

861
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,700
Kong, very popular.

862
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,700
This ride, very popular.

863
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,060
Yeah.

864
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,020
Long lines, usually.

865
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,620
Prone to breaking down.

866
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,020
Lot of moving pieces, helicopters,

867
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,420
multiple Kongs, a very unique suspended ride.

868
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:25,380
This is like a very, much larger scale kind of Peter Pan

869
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,660
like hanging from the ceiling.

870
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,980
To the point I found out this was replaced

871
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,900
by Revenge of the Mummy in 2004.

872
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,540
The tracks are still in the ceiling

873
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,420
because they built the tracks for Kong into the building.

874
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,140
And it is too difficult to remove them.

875
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,940
So they just left them up there.

876
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,140
So it's possible.

877
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,100
I mean.

878
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,940
Bring them back.

879
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,780
Yeah.

880
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,620
Bring them back.

881
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,380
Or just put the Kong vehicles and have it go

882
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,340
with the coaster.

883
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,180
Oh, sure.

884
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,020
Could you do.

885
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,460
Concurrent rides.

886
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,140
Intervals, just intervals.

887
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,860
Roosevelt Island tram ride.

888
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,700
Yeah.

889
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,940
Yeah.

890
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,140
Haunted pyramid.

891
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,380
It's like the Indiana Jones,

892
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,900
what they were gonna do with two rides at once.

893
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,140
Remember they were gonna have them go through

894
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,380
like the people mover or something.

895
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,220
Yeah, why not?

896
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,060
Yeah.

897
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,900
Well, I mean, yeah.

898
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,740
Well, you say why not?

899
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,660
We don't have to look at the mat,

900
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,300
like the actual blueprints to see if that's impossible.

901
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,140
That'd work.

902
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:17,980
It would work.

903
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:21,260
Fill those like, you know, Roosevelt tram rides

904
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,420
with like hard hats with crowbars going like,

905
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,500
you don't.

906
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,820
You don't mess with Brendan Fraser in Motaps.

907
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,020
You mess with them, you mess with all of us.

908
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,460
Spider-Man ending.

909
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,940
Yeah.

910
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,660
Actually, though that's a good thing to say

911
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,220
that this is like to make all of these,

912
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,140
cause there's universal Florida open with three attractions

913
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,060
that were all based on the tram tour.

914
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,860
And thus they all like there had to be three separate rides

915
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:52,380
that essentially had tram-esque ride vehicles.

916
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,620
And they went a lot bigger.

917
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,460
Yeah.

918
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,620
And they were big because they had to make it,

919
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,500
they were competing with Disney on Disney's turf.

920
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,340
Uh-huh.

921
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,660
But so it's, you know, it's boats and draws.

922
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,340
It's a subway car in earthquake.

923
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,620
And then in this, it's the Roosevelt Island Expressway.

924
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,180
As a New Yorker, do you have any experience

925
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,780
with the Roosevelt Island Expressway?

926
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,060
Yeah, it's a great ride.

927
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,500
It's just this, a swipe of the Metro card.

928
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,500
Okay.

929
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,060
And you get to fly over the city.

930
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,380
I think I liked it because I liked King Kong so much.

931
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,220
Right.

932
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,220
And then you go to the, like a weird little island

933
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,780
that doesn't feel like it should exist.

934
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,460
That's what's there on the other side?

935
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,340
Roosevelt Island is like a very small,

936
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,820
like you could walk across it lengthwise

937
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:43,820
in like five minutes, if that.

938
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,940
And then it's got some restaurants

939
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:50,220
and it's got some campuses for, you know, Verizon

940
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,300
and like I think a college is there.

941
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,620
It's just a very, it's a weird anomaly

942
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,740
of no reason to go there unless you happen to work

943
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:02,900
in these places or whatever, but it's a fun ride.

944
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,020
Some people live there.

945
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,860
There are apartment buildings.

946
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,580
There is some apartment buildings there,

947
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,900
which is also strange.

948
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:13,900
Yeah, it's just a big mystery why it exists.

949
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,540
And you could really only get to it,

950
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:20,060
well, you could get to it by bridge, I don't know.

951
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,420
I read an article, like in the last 10 years,

952
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,900
like in the New, like the Times or Buzzfeed,

953
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,980
like big places where they were still like,

954
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,620
we don't quite understand Roosevelt Island.

955
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,100
Like it was a feature on Roosevelt Island,

956
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,700
but they're like, it's even among New Yorkers.

957
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,220
It's a conundrum.

958
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,060
It feels like you're in a different city.

959
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,980
Yeah.

960
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,100
There's like bridges very close by.

961
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,820
It's just a strange place.

962
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,940
And then now that they've got all these like campuses

963
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,060
that moved in, there's like this kind of like

964
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:57,060
AstroTurfie field and it's just got a strange vibe

965
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,820
all around.

966
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,900
Could it work as an evacuation spot

967
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,220
if a giant ape invaded New York?

968
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,740
Well, that's the big question.

969
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:10,420
I'm not really sure what he's doing over there.

970
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,100
It's as baffling as why any people would be there.

971
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,820
Or why you enter Penn Station,

972
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,860
you wind up taking a Roosevelt Island tram,

973
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,380
which is about 30 blocks away.

974
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,180
Oh, I didn't think about that.

975
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,620
This is also a little strange inconsistency.

976
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,860
Yeah, yeah, right, right.

977
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,140
Weird.

978
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,620
I like that in putting in the mummy attraction

979
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:36,180
that they didn't have to change the exterior too much.

980
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,940
They put that kind of like gold museum type overlay,

981
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,420
but that the exterior's fantastic.

982
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,260
Yes.

983
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,180
I'm really glad that didn't have to come down.

984
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,340
And all of it in theory,

985
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,380
because originally Universal,

986
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,300
the idea was that you could use all of these as sets.

987
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,140
Right.

988
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,860
Like you could shoot movies here,

989
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,300
but I don't think anyone ever did.

990
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,620
What's the most prominent thing

991
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,420
that was shot at Universal Florida?

992
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,140
Is it the Jimmy Buffett,

993
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,220
or no, that was out here.

994
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,060
There's a bigger music video.

995
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,540
Or is Fruitcakes here?

996
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,380
No, Fruitcakes was Florida.

997
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,660
That's Florida, yeah.

998
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,340
Jimmy Buffett shot one of his most famous music videos,

999
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:15,420
Fruitcakes, the song Fruitcakes, at Universal Florida.

1000
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,420
Universal Florida.

1001
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,620
Universal Florida is doing a lot of heavy lifting.

1002
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,460
Yeah.

1003
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,020
One of his most, how would you dispute

1004
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,860
one of his most famous?

1005
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,700
What is his most famous?

1006
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,540
Also, how many music videos does he have?

1007
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,180
My statement stands.

1008
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,500
One of his most famous.

1009
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,540
He wasn't really doing a ton in music video era.

1010
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,140
So he didn't have his November rain.

1011
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,460
Five O'Clock somewhere,

1012
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,700
but I think of that as more an Alan Jackson music video.

1013
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,540
It is.

1014
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,380
That he makes an appearance in.

1015
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,220
Yes, it is.

1016
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,260
I agree.

1017
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,700
But yeah, what is the most prominent thing

1018
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,540
he shot at Universal Florida?

1019
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,660
I think there's a Creed music video

1020
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,980
where they filled the New York streets with water.

1021
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,820
Yes.

1022
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,660
Right, with a rowboat?

1023
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,480
Yes, you're right.

1024
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,320
Yeah.

1025
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,160
What is it?

1026
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,980
Is it my sacrifice?

1027
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,820
Is it my sacrifice?

1028
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,660
I think so.

1029
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,480
It's the one that's like,

1030
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,320
brrrr, brrrr, brrrr, brrrr.

1031
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,160
Brrrr, brrrr, brrrr, brrrr.

1032
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,000
Mm-hmm.

1033
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,820
That doesn't narrow it down.

1034
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,000
I know that's, I think only one's like that.

1035
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,980
Okay, so Riot itself.

1036
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,820
Yeah, all right, I really like that line.

1037
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,620
Really like, I like how there's real movie posters

1038
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,380
in there.

1039
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,200
Yes.

1040
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,040
For like Kramer versus Kramer,

1041
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,140
that like kind of, and Rocky, I believe.

1042
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,900
I believe they would rotate those.

1043
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,260
I believe I came across on that,

1044
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,820
and said they would update those with current movies.

1045
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:31,140
Even though the footage was always the 70s,

1046
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:35,100
because this is primarily based on the 76 King Kong,

1047
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:39,140
which starred Jeff Bridges, Jessica Lange,

1048
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,980
and Charles Grodin.

1049
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,580
And that's still, I do not,

1050
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,860
I have only seen clips of this movie.

1051
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,460
I've never sat and watched it.

1052
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,020
I really like the clip that they show

1053
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,500
in the line for the ride,

1054
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,580
where you're looking at the subway car's POV,

1055
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:57,060
as it careens into King Kong's palm.

1056
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:57,900
Yeah.

1057
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,660
Like he catches it, essentially.

1058
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,020
I think I know, yeah, I've never seen the movie either.

1059
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,820
It does sound like, people like it a lot.

1060
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:08,460
It was a big hit, Dino De Laurentiis produced,

1061
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,300
which comes-

1062
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,540
I feel like everybody hated this movie.

1063
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,660
I feel like I've only heard shit about this movie.

1064
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,900
Money-wise, it did well.

1065
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,660
Kind of notorious now, though,

1066
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:20,660
because Kong doesn't climb the Empire State Building,

1067
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,740
he climbed the World Trade Center.

1068
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:28,060
And I guess Dino De Laurentiis had the rights,

1069
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,740
or had something,

1070
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:35,180
they made a sequel called King Kong Lives in 86.

1071
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,660
Yes, now that I have seen.

1072
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,060
I was trying to remember the plot.

1073
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:44,580
I believe it is a story about King Kong having to get,

1074
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:49,020
give a, he's involved in a heart transplant operation.

1075
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,500
He's performing the surgery?

1076
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,340
No.

1077
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,180
Or he needs one.

1078
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,580
I believe, if I'm remembering correctly,

1079
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:59,260
that a giant mechanical heart is built,

1080
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:03,060
and they have to take King Kong's heart out,

1081
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,860
replace it, and put it in a huge tank.

1082
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:11,020
And we end up somewhere with King Kong being in love.

1083
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:11,860
What?

1084
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,060
There's a love story.

1085
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,900
This all, again, all of these movies I saw

1086
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,300
when I was six years old,

1087
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,220
barely comprehending anything,

1088
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,060
and it's like, oh, cool, King Kong movie.

1089
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,860
And then he's like sick for most of it.

1090
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,180
Yeah, he's in a coma.

1091
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,700
And in love for the rest of it.

1092
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,740
It seems like it starts with him,

1093
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,180
like they're like, okay, so he fell off

1094
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,060
the World Trade Center, he's alive in a coma,

1095
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,780
and scientists are studying him.

1096
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,740
This movie was not a success.

1097
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,940
None of the actors came back.

1098
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,500
Do you know De Laurentiis?

1099
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,220
And the director came back, John Gillerman,

1100
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,100
who apparently was a real hard ass.

1101
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,220
His Wikipedia basically goes like,

1102
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,380
no matter what he was making, he was very strict.

1103
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,460
He was very intense, it seems like.

1104
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,420
I think this movie has a part where

1105
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:07,060
King Kong sees a giant crocodile,

1106
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:10,180
and they have a shot of a crocodile,

1107
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,540
and he kind of lights up, mm,

1108
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,860
and then it cuts to a wide of the guy in the suit

1109
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,740
picking up a lizard,

1110
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,340
what is clearly, they're trying to do a scale thing.

1111
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,180
Okay.

1112
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:24,220
And then that's supposed to be a crocodile,

1113
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,020
and he drops it into his mouth,

1114
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:31,020
and then I believe it cuts to just full crocodile bones

1115
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:35,300
just being tossed onto a pile of lots of crocodile bones.

1116
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,380
So he's eating a normal size crocodile, basically?

1117
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,580
It's just large for us.

1118
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,260
Yeah, but there's no question when it cuts to the guy

1119
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,860
in the suit, it's like a little gecko or something.

1120
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,340
But you're saying it's real,

1121
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,900
they found a real panfibian or lizard or something.

1122
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,340
Yeah, yeah, I have to go into my tape of it.

1123
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,820
I know there's a couple parts of this movie

1124
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,220
that are funny as shit.

1125
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,060
Oh man.

1126
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,060
Oh sorry, I'm gonna go.

1127
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,900
I was just gonna add to the movie

1128
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,340
it's based on the King Kong from the 70s.

1129
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,180
70s, right?

1130
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,460
Yeah, 76.

1131
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,220
There was a, what I remember is funny,

1132
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,100
but again, haven't watched it in years,

1133
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,500
funny post-911 SNL sketch.

1134
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,580
Yes, I know this.

1135
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:21,740
This particular film where they're showing

1136
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,420
a post-911 edited version,

1137
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,980
and it's like, instead of going up the World Trade Center,

1138
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,500
oh no, he's climbing up the Chrysler building.

1139
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:35,500
And then it cuts to a bunch of new scenes

1140
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,700
with the worst actors you've ever seen,

1141
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,700
and then they delay the information that the actors,

1142
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,060
then they cut to a station break,

1143
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,220
and the actors you've been watching

1144
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,620
are the news anchors for the station

1145
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,700
who now are improvising a new ending to King Kong,

1146
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,740
and incorporating the other things the station owns,

1147
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,340
like Superman, like if they look out the window,

1148
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,660
look, Superman, he's heading for Kong.

1149
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,700
Oh no, he's gonna attack that bar.

1150
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,900
Cut some cheers.

1151
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,740
Cheers.

1152
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:08,020
That's one of those end of show unarchived sketches

1153
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:08,860
I'm glad you brought up,

1154
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,540
because there's some of those things,

1155
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:13,340
if nobody saved them, it feels like a fever dream,

1156
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,180
like it didn't happen.

1157
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,700
I don't think, yeah, I don't think you've seen it.

1158
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,620
I've only seen the Kong sketch with the boner.

1159
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,700
Oh, that's a great sketch.

1160
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,540
Which is also a good sketch.

1161
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,660
I really like that sketch.

1162
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,100
Let's get it out of here.

1163
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,100
You're shaking the shit.

1164
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,300
Oh yes, yes.

1165
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,820
And we're calling as an erection in the building.

1166
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,660
Yeah.

1167
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:29,500
Yeah.

1168
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,300
Just so funny that they can cut to that,

1169
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,260
and it's not a problem,

1170
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,180
because they don't show the head or the balls,

1171
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,580
or it's just a big furry thing.

1172
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,740
You can show that on TV.

1173
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:39,580
Oh yeah.

1174
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,420
It's not a problem.

1175
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,260
Yeah.

1176
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,340
Oh, good job, SNL.

1177
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,540
Some great Kong sketches.

1178
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,900
Great Kong sketches.

1179
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,580
Okay, wait, so what have we not said?

1180
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,940
Okay, oh, well the ride vehicle,

1181
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,380
I really like how the,

1182
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,100
yeah, that suspended nature of it,

1183
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,220
and how it's this weird accordion,

1184
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,380
if you watch video of it,

1185
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,180
it's a big zigzag X kind of pattern,

1186
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,980
which allows for it to do dips and die.

1187
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:10,220
And I guess the crux of this ride,

1188
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:15,220
when they, not Imagineers, but Universal Ears,

1189
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,460
whatever you call them,

1190
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,780
we're talking about, okay, it's so huge on the tour,

1191
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,660
we gotta bring it to Florida,

1192
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:21,820
how do we make it bigger and better?

1193
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,300
Well, what if King Kong actually picked up your tram

1194
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,780
and threw it?

1195
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,460
And that's kind of what it leads to,

1196
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,580
it's the climax.

1197
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,420
Yeah, it's crazy.

1198
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,620
I'm, is there anything else like this at the moment?

1199
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:36,340
Like anything that's a suspended ride,

1200
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:40,140
it's like Peter Pan, it's Peter Pan.

1201
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:40,980
ET.

1202
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,820
ET technically.

1203
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,660
Yeah, you're right, ET.

1204
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,860
20,000 leagues in Tokyo.

1205
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,100
That's true, yeah.

1206
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,020
But nothing like this aggressive.

1207
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:48,860
Yeah.

1208
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:49,700
No.

1209
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:50,540
And it's huge, yeah.

1210
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,380
And it's big.

1211
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,860
And there are like two story buildings too,

1212
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,540
that like you're kind of.

1213
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,900
Yeah, they're really big.

1214
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,740
Maybe three story, like it's a very large ride.

1215
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,380
Where I live in Brooklyn, I'm in Bushwick,

1216
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:10,180
and they have kind of like two story high train platforms,

1217
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:14,420
and I like it because it reminds me a little bit of King Kong.

1218
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,900
Wow, I love how it's like part of your New York,

1219
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,500
it's a self mythology.

1220
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,340
It was very impactful for me.

1221
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,500
Do you ever imagine like you're walking along

1222
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,020
and you like kind of just like drift off

1223
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:28,140
and imagine Kong climbing a building?

1224
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:28,980
Oh, I see him.

1225
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:29,820
Yeah, I see him.

1226
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:30,660
You see him, yeah.

1227
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,500
Sure.

1228
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,620
I see him in your heart.

1229
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,980
If a newscopter, if you see a copter in the sky,

1230
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,980
it's like, well, they're gonna be a pain in the ass.

1231
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1232
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,780
I don't know if I've ever seen a newscopter in New York,

1233
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:42,620
to be fair.

1234
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:46,660
There's a section of the 110 when you're going downtown

1235
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,540
to like towards the 10,

1236
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,980
and there's a lot of building, high rise buildings,

1237
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,340
and I do admit, I've probably said it to you

1238
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:54,500
and it's very embarrassing.

1239
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,420
I oftentimes picture Galactus from the Fantastic Four

1240
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:01,020
as if he was to scale with the buildings.

1241
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:01,860
I'm like, what?

1242
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,260
You've never said that to me.

1243
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:06,620
Like this is a common thing my brain does as we're going,

1244
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:09,420
because like that's the most like height you get

1245
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,340
in Los Angeles really is when you're going down the 110.

1246
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,460
So like I'm like, what if he was real?

1247
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:18,180
And Galactus by the way, is a giant Jack Kirby designed man,

1248
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,540
he's a God, I guess, sort of a God character.

1249
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,100
He's the eater of worlds,

1250
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,300
and he comes down and he like eats planets.

1251
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,820
So anyway, I'm saying I do that bizarre thing

1252
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,900
I just made a comment about.

1253
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,860
The tunnels to Toontown in Roger Rabbit

1254
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,860
is like one of the worst exits like in LA.

1255
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:37,700
Oh yeah.

1256
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:38,520
Oh yeah, yeah.

1257
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,460
I mean, that's a fun thing to go like,

1258
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,100
oh, this is the tunnel they had to go through

1259
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,500
to get to Toontown, but like it's like,

1260
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,300
you have to pretty much slow your car down

1261
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,460
from like 60 miles an hour to like 20 miles an hour

1262
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:53,660
to make a 90 degree like exit.

1263
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,900
And it's built into a hill.

1264
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:56,740
Yeah.

1265
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,380
It's like you're doing like a race.

1266
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,780
Yeah.

1267
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,780
We can talk about bad weird freeway stuff later.

1268
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,940
But that's really nice that you like, you know,

1269
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,500
cause like sometimes you gotta go downtown for,

1270
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,540
I don't know, you haven't gone to court.

1271
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,380
I was gonna say like,

1272
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,060
you have to go downtown for unpleasant things.

1273
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:13,900
What am I talking about?

1274
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:14,980
Sure you did.

1275
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:15,820
Yeah.

1276
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,100
Have you, yeah, well, is that true?

1277
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,740
I've never done jury duty.

1278
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:21,260
I have a system I think I have to beat it.

1279
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,100
Oh.

1280
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,220
That's in your checking wheelhouse.

1281
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:26,060
It is, yeah.

1282
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,900
How to defeat jury duty.

1283
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,980
I've only really been called once.

1284
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:30,820
Oh, you know what?

1285
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,660
I'll just say it here.

1286
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,480
This is not some secret.

1287
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,320
Like everyone try it.

1288
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,500
If anyone is listening to this,

1289
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,540
if anyone listens to every podcast

1290
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,900
to try to find potential juries.

1291
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:40,740
Yeah.

1292
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:41,580
And I'm not doing anything wrong.

1293
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,420
People who have been escorted jury duty.

1294
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,820
There's nothing I'm doing that's wrong

1295
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,100
or would get me in trouble.

1296
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,540
My system is what they have at least in Los Angeles

1297
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,700
is you're supposed to call in.

1298
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,860
Once you get like served or whatever a notice,

1299
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,300
it says call in the night before

1300
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,980
and we'll tell you if we need you.

1301
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:57,860
So what I did was it says like call from whatever,

1302
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,300
eight to midnight.

1303
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,140
I call it 1159.

1304
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:05,100
Theory wise that they fill up the juries

1305
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,820
as the night goes on.

1306
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,300
Cause it can't be truly random

1307
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,700
because you would, you know,

1308
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,220
you would be filled up already.

1309
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:14,100
Like there's no way they would just reject

1310
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:14,940
the first 10 people.

1311
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:15,900
Cause how do they know for sure

1312
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,220
everybody's gonna call in?

1313
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,060
Yeah.

1314
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:18,900
So they have to fill people up.

1315
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,300
So you call in at the last possible second

1316
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,540
and I did it and I never got called.

1317
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:24,660
Could be a coincidence.

1318
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,500
I don't know.

1319
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,820
Try it in Los Angeles.

1320
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,700
If you've been given a letter

1321
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,460
that says you have jury duty.

1322
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:31,860
I'm interested to see,

1323
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:34,340
cause I've had other people do it with success,

1324
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,460
but I'm not declaring it a full victory yet.

1325
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,000
I was, as you were saying all that,

1326
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,700
I was flashing to your plan of how to defeat

1327
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:44,420
the dreaded parking garages at City Walk.

1328
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,780
The like the canceling the movie tickets

1329
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,580
the moment that you arrive.

1330
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,500
Have you done that plan since?

1331
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,100
No, I haven't done that plan since.

1332
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:54,140
I have recommended it.

1333
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:55,380
That would probably get me in trouble.

1334
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,020
If there are universal people listening,

1335
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,180
they will not like that.

1336
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:00,540
The plan to buy a movie ticket,

1337
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:01,640
get the discounted parking

1338
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,180
and then cancel your movie ticket.

1339
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,300
So you're more afraid of the universal people

1340
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,540
than the city.

1341
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,380
Yeah, well honestly yes.

1342
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,380
I'm sure they're more on top of things.

1343
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,100
I'm sure they're policing more vigilantly.

1344
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,340
You remember Jason was afraid of them

1345
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,420
when we suggest recording at City Walk.

1346
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,780
He didn't want to get arrested.

1347
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,620
Yes.

1348
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,460
Well yeah.

1349
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,700
We were involving a hypothetical scenario.

1350
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:25,940
We were involved in a lot less events

1351
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,720
where like there's just,

1352
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,680
I guess now at parks they just expect people

1353
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,700
to be vlogging and like carrying.

1354
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,260
But we were describing a scenario

1355
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:37,540
where we stole the Blues Brothers car

1356
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,900
with the big megaphone and did a bum rush live show

1357
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:45,020
and you were like mad about that idea of doing that.

1358
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,100
I don't remember that.

1359
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:46,940
I do.

1360
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,340
No memory.

1361
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,480
Back to Kong.

1362
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:55,220
To make this ride vehicle,

1363
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,580
to test the height dynamics

1364
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,580
and the idea that Kong would drop you.

1365
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:02,260
Somehow this led to the,

1366
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,100
we gotta start,

1367
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,100
we have to come up with an official name

1368
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,260
of what universal Imagineers are called.

1369
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,860
It's universal creative.

1370
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:11,260
Okay so talking about the ride mechanism itself,

1371
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:16,260
to test the idea that you would get dropped somehow by Kong

1372
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,560
and how was that going to work.

1373
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,660
In figuring out options for this,

1374
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:25,560
the universal creative person,

1375
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,020
is it Peter Alexander?

1376
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:28,860
Peter Alexander.

1377
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,820
Alexander and I think you have it in front of you too.

1378
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,820
This book we cite sometimes universal versus Disney

1379
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:36,060
by Sam Genoway.

1380
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:39,840
This story is in this book where he,

1381
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:44,700
this guy, they wanna test some harness thing

1382
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,860
and nobody volunteers,

1383
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:48,740
nobody's willing to do it

1384
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:51,980
so the main guy in charge of this ride says,

1385
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,320
I don't know, I'll give it a shot.

1386
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,580
So they go into a sound stage at universal Hollywood.

1387
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:00,820
He gets up on wires and they test the thing

1388
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,340
and it seems like it's gonna work

1389
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:05,340
but then a miscommunication caused the engineers

1390
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,500
to drop him at full free fall

1391
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,860
then jerk him to a sudden stop about three feet

1392
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,740
from the cement stage floor

1393
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:16,260
resulting in a double hernia operation some months later.

1394
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,380
This is a guy who thought of the idea

1395
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,740
what if Kong dropped you

1396
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,740
then he had to have a double hernia

1397
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:25,420
because of, because he lived his dream.

1398
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:27,220
He flew like a tram.

1399
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,320
That was kind of how they scaled,

1400
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,500
okay so less intense of a drop.

1401
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,300
Less of a drop.

1402
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,700
Because it wasn't that intense.

1403
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,340
I don't recall this part being super scary.

1404
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,220
It's not some Tower of Terror type drop.

1405
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:42,700
No I don't remember a lot of restraints on this.

1406
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,420
I mean it does, it did a good job at simulating that

1407
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,500
he picked you up and dropped you

1408
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,540
and then a police helicopter with a Gatling gun

1409
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,860
scares him off.

1410
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:52,700
Hit him.

1411
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:59,140
It's like, it seems to me like it reminds me of the,

1412
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,540
like when they're talking about Indiana Jones

1413
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,540
when they're like we wanted to make a ride vehicle

1414
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:05,580
that was, you know, like was gonna give you

1415
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:08,700
like shaking essentially so you would feel like

1416
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,460
much scarier, like in a much scarier situation.

1417
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,860
So it's like you're building like,

1418
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,380
it's a normal thing they've done before

1419
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:16,060
where you're suspended but then they're like

1420
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:19,280
trying to figure out how to like jerk your brain around.

1421
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,340
I guess so, yeah yeah.

1422
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:23,300
But it wasn't, I honestly, I never went on this ride.

1423
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,140
Oh you haven't talked about that.

1424
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:24,980
I never experienced.

1425
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,140
Oh okay, oh geez.

1426
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:28,580
Did you skip it?

1427
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,680
We didn't really go to Universal until I was like older.

1428
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,120
And was it gone by then?

1429
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:33,960
I believe it was gone by then.

1430
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,120
Because this was gone in like 2002?

1431
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:36,940
Yeah.

1432
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:37,780
That's a great one we went.

1433
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:41,960
Left in 2002 along with the Fantastic World of Hanna

1434
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,120
Barbera also closed in 2002.

1435
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,040
Another fun ride.

1436
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:45,880
That's a fun one.

1437
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:46,700
Yeah.

1438
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,080
That might have been my first of the day.

1439
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,360
Oh that's a good one.

1440
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,200
Yeah yeah yeah.

1441
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,360
Yeah you kind of hit a fork and then you either go

1442
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,480
straight up towards where Hanna Barbera is

1443
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,520
or you go the right like towards Lucy.

1444
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,360
Yeah.

1445
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,200
That used to be the choice.

1446
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,400
Ooh, the Lucy exhibit, it just came back to me

1447
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,640
that I spent an inordinate amount of time there.

1448
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,800
As a kid I was a big I Love Lucy fan.

1449
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,960
Me as well, yeah.

1450
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,120
So I was like genuinely interested in the layout

1451
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,040
of the stage and stuff and the miniatures.

1452
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,500
But then also I remember walking outside

1453
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:19,400
and my grandma was deep in conversation

1454
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,280
with a man in a wheelchair in full kiss makeup.

1455
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,160
He's in a wheelchair.

1456
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,240
Like wearing a kiss shirt.

1457
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,080
And in.

1458
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,320
And like Gene Simmons like paint.

1459
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,160
Whoa.

1460
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,120
I don't know if like they ever like

1461
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,240
I don't think she knows what kiss is.

1462
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,720
That seems like if you were a grandma at that time

1463
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,200
you would have missed that part of culture.

1464
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,080
And that wasn't an employee.

1465
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:44,960
Not an employee.

1466
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:45,800
Yeah.

1467
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,640
Yeah.

1468
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,460
Whoa.

1469
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,800
I wonder what they were talking about.

1470
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,720
I couldn't imagine.

1471
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,580
My grandma was like a pretty like conservative person.

1472
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,560
Can't imagine her just starting a conversation

1473
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,040
with a man in like kiss makeup.

1474
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:01,880
Yeah.

1475
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,240
Was there a kiss based event anywhere?

1476
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,320
I don't think so.

1477
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,920
Cause I remember thinking about that

1478
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,400
and I'm like well there must be like a concert here

1479
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,120
or something and I don't think there was.

1480
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,080
Wow.

1481
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:16,520
Nor was it an ICP event.

1482
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,120
It was not an ICP event.

1483
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,140
I was down with the clown back then

1484
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:23,000
so I would have been a little more excited.

1485
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,160
But if anyone knows what it was going on

1486
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:28,600
around spring 98.

1487
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,680
Let a ninja know.

1488
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,520
Yeah.

1489
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,440
Well I don't think the ICP was there.

1490
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,840
I think it's safe to say that there wasn't an ICP concert.

1491
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,680
You're too interested.

1492
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,280
1998 Lucille Ball and Shaggy Too Dope.

1493
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,120
Yeah.

1494
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,280
This guy who I brought up, Peter Alexander,

1495
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,320
I kept going down the rabbit hole with

1496
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,960
because when I was,

1497
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,200
he's an interesting figure

1498
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,000
and seemed involved in the Jaws attraction

1499
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,240
and the E.T. adventures.

1500
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,680
Definitely factored into things we've talked about before.

1501
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,440
And in Googling him, just like oh yeah okay so King Kong

1502
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,000
and he has his own company now okay.

1503
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,760
And Scientologist okay.

1504
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,600
Oh what?

1505
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,720
Whoa.

1506
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,440
He is an escaped Scientologist.

1507
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,440
He made it out and speaks at events frequently about,

1508
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:22,720
he basically, this guy was like royalty in Florida

1509
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,200
because one of the best jobs in Florida you could have

1510
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,080
is building all the main universal rides.

1511
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,200
And when he was doing it in the early 90s,

1512
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,960
he was still full fledged Scientologist

1513
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,640
and still lives in Florida.

1514
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,640
He's like the king of Tampa.

1515
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,760
Wow.

1516
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,240
Clear water is down there.

1517
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,760
Him and Bubba the Love Sponge.

1518
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,560
They tried for years to get Bubba the Love Sponge.

1519
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,400
I'm fine man, my head's great.

1520
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,680
Is this what you were alluding to last night?

1521
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,480
Yes.

1522
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,320
Having about him?

1523
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,720
The oddity about this guy.

1524
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,760
I had something else about this guy.

1525
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,080
What's your thing?

1526
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:05,080
So he went on to form a company called.

1527
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,400
Totally Fun.

1528
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,280
Yeah Totally Fun.

1529
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:12,120
And one of his jobs after making all these universal rides,

1530
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:16,120
Totally Fun made a pilot for Nickelodeon that did not go.

1531
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:19,800
And then he wrote the treatment and drew concept sketches

1532
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,360
for one that did go.

1533
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,640
Nickelodeon Guts.

1534
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,480
Guts.

1535
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,320
Wow.

1536
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,240
Do ya have it?

1537
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,080
Yeah.

1538
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,120
Yeah, crazy.

1539
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:29,960
This guy's a legend.

1540
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,720
This guy thought of all these rides,

1541
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,760
thought of the drop in the King Kong ride,

1542
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,160
was injured himself trying it.

1543
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:41,680
Then invented Guts, then escaped Scientology,

1544
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,720
which by his own quote, he said,

1545
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,320
he made it all the way, he made it up to all the levels.

1546
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,320
He made it up to OT seven or whatever.

1547
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,160
Wow.

1548
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,400
I'm the Scientology agro-craig.

1549
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,880
He got to the very top.

1550
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,160
He got the final crystal off the top.

1551
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,000
Wow.

1552
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:06,120
And he gave an interview where he said,

1553
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,240
once I figured out it was all about aliens and stuff,

1554
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,800
then I'm looking around the world and going,

1555
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,320
well I'm not seeing any aliens.

1556
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,440
What am I doing?

1557
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:15,800
And by that point in time, he had given a million dollars

1558
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,240
of his own money to the Church of Scientology.

1559
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,080
Whoa.

1560
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,480
He just had the sudden, what was any of this?

1561
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,000
He got into it in that very slow way

1562
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
that people get into it where it's very self-helpy

1563
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,840
and all these classes and they're helping me.

1564
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,960
And then just realized, oh, I didn't,

1565
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,920
it crept up on me, this is a cult, what was I doing?

1566
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:35,480
And he decided to do something about it.

1567
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,800
He's gonna share his story

1568
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,080
and not just go talk at events, which he does,

1569
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:45,600
he's going to, in a narrative form, tell his story,

1570
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:50,600
which he did in a film in 2001 called The Prophet,

1571
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:55,320
the name of the CNBC show that we enjoy very much.

1572
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:59,240
And it is also a 2001 anti-Scientology film

1573
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,520
made by the guy who did the King Kong ride.

1574
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:07,640
In this film, an author who's kind of gone off as rocker

1575
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:12,800
named L. Conrad Powers has become the leader

1576
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,080
of an organization called

1577
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,560
the Church of Scientific Spiritualism,

1578
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:22,320
which lures people in with the promise of self-help

1579
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:27,320
and these tests that they perform involving mind meters.

1580
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,160
Okay.

1581
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,000
And this film.

1582
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,280
So, you may as well call it schmoy and schmology.

1583
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,320
Why did Paul Thomas Anderson even bother

1584
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,280
with the master after this?

1585
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,160
It's been done, dude.

1586
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,520
And the Shamwell guy did the same thing.

1587
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,400
What? Really?

1588
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,640
Yeah, he took his Shamwell money and like,

1589
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,600
I don't know if he made a movie.

1590
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,080
I know he took money and made a movie

1591
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:53,360
and then also used the money to fight Scientology.

1592
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,200
Wow.

1593
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,040
Wait a minute, the guy,

1594
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,560
because is the Shamwell guy the guy

1595
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,880
who made the underground comedy movie?

1596
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,600
Yes, Vince Offer.

1597
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,080
Vince Offer, yes.

1598
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:05,000
That thing that they used to advertise on cable?

1599
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:05,840
Yeah.

1600
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:06,680
The underground comedy?

1601
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,500
Wow.

1602
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,200
That's how he got involved in the Shamwell

1603
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,960
and the Slap Chop is that he was,

1604
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,920
he so successfully sold this weird little movie

1605
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,400
via infomercials that infomercial people approached him

1606
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,120
and were like, you got something.

1607
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,320
Why don't we put you on camera and sure,

1608
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,080
but before you know it, he's the Slap Chop guy.

1609
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,240
And he was a Scientologist?

1610
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,560
I've never heard any of this.

1611
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,600
Yeah, any declared war.

1612
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,880
Whoa.

1613
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,600
And we don't, we have to figure out

1614
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,400
the machinations of that war.

1615
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,760
He didn't, but he's done something.

1616
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,600
Right.

1617
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,040
That's amazing.

1618
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,320
Wow, good for Vince Offer.

1619
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,160
A flawed hero.

1620
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,280
It's not a full endorser.

1621
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,480
Yeah, doesn't he get, he was in some trouble, right?

1622
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,320
Yeah.

1623
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:50,080
There were some messes he could not clean up.

1624
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,520
Also mentioning Nickelodeon Guts, I was like,

1625
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,880
that must be the most popular thing filmed

1626
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,520
at Universal Orlando.

1627
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,360
Maybe so.

1628
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,240
But then I looked it up.

1629
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,960
We've got a family feud with Steve Harvey.

1630
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,800
Whoa.

1631
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:05,640
Oh, cool.

1632
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,480
Yeah.

1633
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,600
Certain episodes of Deal or No Deal on CNBC.

1634
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,440
Right.

1635
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,280
Very good.

1636
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,520
And then total nonstop action wrestling.

1637
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,360
Oh yeah.

1638
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,000
And WCW Monday Nitro.

1639
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:18,840
Yep.

1640
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:22,360
Portions of Fear Factor and major scenes

1641
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,200
of the movie Parenthood.

1642
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,760
That's right, that was the arbitrary one they chose.

1643
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,000
They were like, something has to come filmed here

1644
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,840
so we can say something filmed here.

1645
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,680
Right.

1646
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,400
And it was that, because that was in the early 90s.

1647
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,280
They don't even have Jimmy Buffett's food cakes

1648
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,840
on that list.

1649
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,160
Yeah, no, I didn't see it on there.

1650
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,000
Hold on, Gliss is this.

1651
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,160
Oh, and The Tonight Show, if that counts.

1652
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,160
The Tonight Show, yes, they did some weeks there.

1653
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:47,160
Yeah, most studio-based NBC Comcast-owned properties

1654
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:50,280
will do a few days in Universal a year.

1655
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,560
I think Ellen does, that's Warner Brothers.

1656
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:55,400
Every one of those shows does a few days

1657
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,400
at Universal every year.

1658
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,080
Today's Show, that's what it's named.

1659
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,040
Sure, sure.

1660
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,720
Really quick, but just before I move on from The Profit,

1661
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,000
The Profit is available entirely on YouTube.

1662
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,520
This is a film that Scientology fought into the ground.

1663
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,880
They aired it, they showed it at theaters

1664
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,560
in Clearwater, Florida to fuck with Scientology

1665
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,320
in their own backyard, and they called it,

1666
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,840
we call this thing the lack of profit,

1667
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,680
that's what we say it is.

1668
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,440
And they disparaged the film and they said,

1669
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:26,120
it looks like it was shot on somebody's home video camera.

1670
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:29,640
And I gotta go with Scientology on that one.

1671
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,080
And there is a part, I didn't watch the full film

1672
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,480
because I barely found out about this,

1673
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:37,880
but I did put on, there's a part where it zooms

1674
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,600
into a dying El Conrad powers.

1675
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,440
Oh my God.

1676
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,280
And this is like Halloween store makeup.

1677
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:48,240
This is like, they slap a gray wig on him.

1678
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,160
A couple, all right, how do we show that he's old?

1679
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,960
Lines, let's put a line on his face.

1680
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:58,040
Do you think this is on par with the slightly teased

1681
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,600
Lance Burton movie that we talked about

1682
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:04,000
on the David Copperfield Patreon, Billy Toppett.

1683
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,560
The very cheap looking Lance Burton movie

1684
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:11,120
about a magician named Billy Toppett.

1685
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,920
We haven't done Billy Toppett yet.

1686
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:13,760
We haven't.

1687
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,800
We gotta do a film series, Billy Toppett.

1688
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:16,640
That's what I'm getting at.

1689
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:20,240
The profit and the underground comedy.

1690
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:25,240
Available for unrated version, $3 on Amazon right now.

1691
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:29,760
So when I order my copy of, what's the TV show,

1692
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,120
what's the DreamWorks TV show?

1693
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,520
Father of the Pride.

1694
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,360
Yeah, we gotta do that too.

1695
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,560
An Amazon cart with Father of the Pride

1696
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,080
and underground comedy movie,

1697
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:40,360
and then the FBI will be at my house very quickly.

1698
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:44,600
Billy Toppett, master magician.

1699
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:45,440
Oh my God.

1700
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,920
Jesus, the cover.

1701
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,200
You've never shown us that.

1702
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,040
Yeah.

1703
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,080
We watched the trailer before.

1704
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:50,920
Garbage.

1705
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,200
It's no Burt Wonderstone.

1706
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:59,440
Peter Alexander also has the Spielberg connection.

1707
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,880
I came across a few different things.

1708
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,440
One is saying that the Universal versus Disney book

1709
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,400
says that Spielberg hired Alexander

1710
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,880
after all the rides were open.

1711
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,680
One video online was saying he was so impressed by Kong

1712
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:19,960
on the studio tour that he tasked Peter Alexander with,

1713
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,000
all right, think of some back to the future ideas

1714
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:22,840
for a ride.

1715
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,320
Oh, huh.

1716
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,600
But while we're talking Spielberg,

1717
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,000
there's that famous story that Spielberg

1718
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,960
did not wanna do the big drop on Jurassic Park

1719
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,560
because he's scared of heights.

1720
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:37,120
And that was not the first time he pulled that

1721
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:42,120
because he came to Universal Orlando before it opened.

1722
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,800
And apparently they say in the book,

1723
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,520
Spielberg was not fond of heights

1724
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,120
and suggested that he wait for his guests

1725
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:53,720
at the exit of Kongfrontation.

1726
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:54,760
Like Killjoy.

1727
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:55,600
Yeah.

1728
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,440
Yeah, geez.

1729
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,000
He wouldn't even do Kongfrontation.

1730
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:58,840
Wow.

1731
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,960
Feels on par with me though, not long ago.

1732
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,880
I feel like a kindred spirit within.

1733
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,280
If he was on the podcast regularly,

1734
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,200
he would have worked up to it.

1735
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,040
Yeah.

1736
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:10,860
And now he could do it.

1737
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:12,280
Spielberg's just not being conditioned like I am.

1738
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,120
Yeah.

1739
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:16,320
The book also makes a point to point out.

1740
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,200
They were having a lot of troubles with Jaws and Kong

1741
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,420
when it first opened.

1742
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,480
There was no way to be certain that Kong

1743
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,960
would not malfunction and stick his hand into the tram car

1744
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,360
and nail somebody in the third row

1745
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:32,640
or that the tram car would not break off Kong's hand

1746
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,960
in the process.

1747
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:34,800
Wow.

1748
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,880
Jesus.

1749
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:36,800
What?

1750
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,600
It might have just reached in and.

1751
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,280
Wow.

1752
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:45,320
So probably for the best, Steven sat it out.

1753
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,320
Yikes.

1754
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,760
Yeah, I read that on opening day

1755
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,000
that all of the mechanized stuff broke

1756
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,600
and they were just operating it practically.

1757
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,720
So like all day on opening day,

1758
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,680
there were just people in the control room

1759
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,240
just doing it live.

1760
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,080
Fuck it, we'll do it live.

1761
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,640
Fuck it, we'll do it live.

1762
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,360
That's like if there were like 100 people

1763
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,720
doing Pirates of the Caribbean

1764
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,240
and they just had to be there all day

1765
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,520
like puppeting the mouths essentially.

1766
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,360
God.

1767
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,880
Making the woman chase the man with the rolling pin.

1768
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:12,720
Geez.

1769
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,240
Like, I'm bored.

1770
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,400
I'm gonna make him do a jerk off gesture.

1771
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:18,920
Who cares?

1772
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,800
All right, now I'm feeling good.

1773
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,800
I'm gonna make him do the hang 10 sign.

1774
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,160
Hang loose.

1775
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,640
Could you make him talk?

1776
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,360
If they could manually do it, could you like,

1777
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,040
you could make him talk and play it over the loudspeaker.

1778
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:32,880
Oh yeah, probably.

1779
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,040
He thinks everybody by name.

1780
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,880
Oh my God, that would be the greatest.

1781
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,680
Good my, Brett.

1782
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,080
This is gonna have to be quick.

1783
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,320
The vehicle is much bigger.

1784
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,720
If you're struggling with your life,

1785
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:45,280
you may have what are called feet

1786
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,760
and strapped in your body.

1787
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:51,760
What, these are buildings?

1788
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:00,040
I thought they were Kong sized E-meters.

1789
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:02,240
I'm just trying to get my head straight.

1790
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:09,520
Wow, we gotta find out if that's possible to like manually,

1791
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,400
I guess it has to be,

1792
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,320
manually program all these robots.

1793
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,120
Sure, but they're all gone now.

1794
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:16,840
I'm just saying all robots in general on these rides.

1795
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,280
I'm saying that opens up the potential.

1796
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,480
Could you do Lincoln and truly have somebody

1797
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:26,280
just making the mouth move as they talk

1798
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,400
and you have him do a totally different show

1799
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,600
at great moments with Mr. Lincoln.

1800
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,880
Where he like responds to people and roasts them?

1801
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,080
Yeah, he does crowd work.

1802
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,360
Look at this guy in the front row.

1803
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,400
What a chowder head.

1804
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,960
Is this your wife?

1805
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,360
What happened lady?

1806
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:53,640
You look as thick headed as the morally corrupt leaders

1807
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:57,240
of the Confederate army.

1808
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,560
Well, I think you've made a good case right now

1809
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:00,920
for you being the voice.

1810
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:01,760
Yeah.

1811
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:02,600
All right, I have to do live.

1812
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,720
Someone let us know,

1813
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,720
we have listeners at work at Disneyland.

1814
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:07,680
Is this possible?

1815
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,240
Obviously we can't do it unless we do something very

1816
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,920
against the rules, but is it possible?

1817
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,560
I just like to know.

1818
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:18,600
Your hat looks silly and not at all like a stovepipe.

1819
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,800
Honestly, people would love that if he was like,

1820
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,080
it was like turtle talk with crush, but Lincoln.

1821
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:26,920
Yeah.

1822
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:29,920
And he just lightly made fun of you

1823
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,800
with only references he would be available to him

1824
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,160
at the time he was alive.

1825
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,240
So he couldn't do a Rickles roast.

1826
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,360
He couldn't call somebody a Nazi in the front row

1827
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,320
because he didn't know what that was yet.

1828
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,840
He comes from a more innocent time before Nazi.

1829
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:48,680
I guess he could say war.

1830
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,520
I'm jealous of Lincoln.

1831
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,520
I guess you'd be like, what are you, a Confederate?

1832
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:53,760
What is this guy?

1833
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,600
Confederate?

1834
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,640
Logs for brains?

1835
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,840
In which case I'm a fan of you.

1836
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,280
I love logs.

1837
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,400
Big fan of logs.

1838
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,120
Quickly scanning all the things I know about Lincoln

1839
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,000
in my head and I might be out.

1840
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,680
He was good.

1841
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:14,800
Sullen.

1842
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:15,640
Sullen, say, he was depressed.

1843
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:18,480
Mellon Colley, he was a sad, sad man.

1844
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:24,160
A couple real quick Kong things.

1845
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,480
I always liked the logo.

1846
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:27,000
I thought the logo was real fun.

1847
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,080
Oh yeah, all the art associated with it is so great.

1848
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:34,040
And the photo op, you would come down this big ramp

1849
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,280
at the end and there was, I don't think my family ever

1850
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,600
did the photo op, but there was a giant Kong

1851
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,640
and you could get in his hand as if he was picking you up

1852
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,960
and get your official Kodak photo op memory.

1853
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,120
And it was so, I mean, nowadays people would be lining up

1854
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,880
for something like that.

1855
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,480
I mean, they wouldn't make any money off it

1856
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,800
because everyone would just use their phones, but.

1857
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:58,320
There is a similar thing at, at least in New York,

1858
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,760
but probably elsewhere, at Madame Tussauds, similar photo.

1859
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:02,600
Oh, great.

1860
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,000
And I know this because I was going to see Knives Out

1861
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,400
a few weeks ago.

1862
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,600
Went to Times Square and some guys like,

1863
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,440
hey, you want to get into Madame Tussauds for free?

1864
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,600
Did he say it like that?

1865
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,280
Yeah, like quietly.

1866
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,560
Like to me and my friend, we kind of looked at each other

1867
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:18,920
and were like, yes.

1868
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:24,160
You come in, you walk around at the end, there's a survey.

1869
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,200
You put my name down.

1870
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,560
My name's Tyler.

1871
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,520
You do that, get in for free.

1872
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,160
And then we were like, yeah, deal.

1873
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:35,440
And then he gave the guy the nod and then they waved us in.

1874
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,600
We got to explore a mostly empty Madame Tussauds.

1875
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,720
Yeah, what's on the more recent end of celebrities in there?

1876
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:43,560
Who'd you see?

1877
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:48,560
Oh, we got, there's a whole Marvel exhibit now.

1878
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,880
So Captain Marvel is pretty new.

1879
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,160
Kardashians.

1880
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,000
Oh, nice.

1881
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,160
Greta Gerwig.

1882
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,000
Greta Gerwig.

1883
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:57,840
Is there a Greta Gerwig?

1884
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,400
Is there a Florence, I don't know how to say it.

1885
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,240
Florence Poo?

1886
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:02,080
Poo?

1887
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:02,920
Poo?

1888
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:03,760
Poo?

1889
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,600
I don't know.

1890
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,600
I think it's poo.

1891
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,440
Is it poo?

1892
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:07,280
Florence Poo?

1893
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,120
The cast of Parasite, Poo Dameron.

1894
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:12,320
Oh yeah.

1895
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,720
I was gonna say Poo Dameron.

1896
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:15,560
Sure.

1897
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,360
Yeah, the thing with Greta though, it's like,

1898
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,160
it's Frances Ha.

1899
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,400
Yeah, it's Frances.

1900
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,000
It's always a few years behind.

1901
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,960
Like, I wanna take a picture of Greta Gerwig,

1902
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:25,800
not Frances Ha.

1903
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,640
Right.

1904
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,720
Yeah.

1905
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,920
They have the Safdies, but it's him in good time,

1906
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,840
and which in retrospect, it's a little weird.

1907
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,600
He was playing kind of the handicapped guy,

1908
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,440
and I don't want a picture with that.

1909
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,080
Yeah, the 824 section was really funny.

1910
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,080
That was packed.

1911
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,280
That section was packed.

1912
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,000
Yeah.

1913
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:50,880
Oh, souvenir.

1914
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,400
This was a big souvenir, I feel.

1915
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,360
Stuffed gorilla.

1916
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,760
I believe I went to this with my grandparents.

1917
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,440
We went, took them to Florida once,

1918
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,600
and I believe my, for my cousins who were not there,

1919
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,960
I believe my grandfather bought a stuffed Kong.

1920
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,160
But I remember that was a big merchandise

1921
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,520
when Universal first opened,

1922
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,240
was stuffed sharks and stuffed gorillas.

1923
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,200
You know what I really like are those

1924
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,040
in surrounding stuff and artwork, like you said,

1925
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:20,760
I really like when the billboards that were outside,

1926
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:23,680
if you guys have seen pictures of the billboards

1927
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:26,480
in Florida promoting, and because they had texture,

1928
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:31,480
it was like a weird, too many details, like plastic Kong.

1929
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,600
They didn't just do flat billboards.

1930
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,120
They were sort of odd and scaly and creepy.

1931
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,080
I don't know why I immediately thought of the board game

1932
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,720
life with the weird, the mountains

1933
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,880
that were like three dimensional.

1934
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,840
That's not the best example of what you're talking about,

1935
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,040
but that's what popped into my head.

1936
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:47,880
I know what you're talking, I know what you mean.

1937
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,960
I like inserting those into the.

1938
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,680
Yes, that was very satisfying, we're on the wheel.

1939
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:54,480
Dimensionality.

1940
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:57,600
This in general, I'm very sad that I didn't get to do this

1941
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,360
because it feels like the ultimate

1942
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,080
Universal ride of the time.

1943
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:02,920
It's got all the different things

1944
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,080
that differentiate it from Disney.

1945
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,840
It's a little scarier.

1946
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:10,000
It's different tonally than anything.

1947
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,040
I guess MGM Studios was opening up

1948
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,720
and they were gonna have a gangster hijack your car,

1949
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,720
which is the closest, I don't know,

1950
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:19,360
feeling of terror you'd get and danger.

1951
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,880
Both of these parks had a lot of real fire,

1952
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:22,920
which is fun.

1953
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,440
Real fire.

1954
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:29,080
Hosts in the car, like Jaws, like cast members in the car,

1955
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:32,560
which probably contributed to both those rides downfall

1956
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,720
because that's expensive to have people in every car,

1957
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:38,880
although both real people leaders too.

1958
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,640
They could get a lot of people throughout.

1959
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,840
There were anecdotes about cast members on Jaws,

1960
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,880
cast members on King Kong were trying to,

1961
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:48,480
it was competitive to see how many guests

1962
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,520
they could get through per hour.

1963
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,320
Also on Jaws, they were armed.

1964
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,640
Yeah, they were armed.

1965
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:56,240
This would have been helpful on Kong, but.

1966
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,080
They weren't expected.

1967
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,000
This is an evacuation mission.

1968
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,280
They don't expect to be taking a best Kong.

1969
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:04,840
But it feels like the rise of the resistance of the time,

1970
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:08,040
where all of Universal's tricks are in there.

1971
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,760
It's the best of everything they can do.

1972
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:12,440
It's possible at the moment.

1973
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:16,240
Yeah, I think it really did push the limits.

1974
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,920
Because it broke down all the time.

1975
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,360
It broke down a lot, yeah.

1976
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:22,960
But I love that it was big on the tram tour

1977
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,560
and then they go, how do we top one Kong, two Kongs.

1978
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:27,880
Skylar, we haven't talked about that.

1979
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,200
You get to see two robots.

1980
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,240
That's really neat.

1981
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,640
I was so, I remember seeing these commercials

1982
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:36,360
and I was so scared of the idea of it.

1983
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:39,280
I wonder if I was six if I would have refused to do it.

1984
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,640
I might have.

1985
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,520
Because it was scary and when I'm watching these videos,

1986
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,200
I go, oh my God, I would have been terrified.

1987
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,760
Because we've talked before about,

1988
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,520
when did you go on this?

1989
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,720
How old were you, Scott?

1990
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:55,440
It might have been down when I was there in the 90s.

1991
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,360
I might not have done this till like 99.

1992
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,880
Would you have been freaked out with your big things

1993
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:01,840
in a smaller space sphere?

1994
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,200
Probably, yes.

1995
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,040
That's one of my questions.

1996
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,400
Because I have. He's huge.

1997
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,040
I've talked about before my fear of giant

1998
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:11,680
car dealership balloons out front as a child.

1999
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:12,920
To the point. Have you talked about that?

2000
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:14,240
Have you? Yeah, have you?

2001
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:15,680
No, I don't know if you have.

2002
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:18,240
You might just hear it so much in your head,

2003
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:19,720
that and Galactus.

2004
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:20,560
I'm thinking about Galactus.

2005
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,360
Will Galactus defeat the car dealership balloons?

2006
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,360
I'm thinking about Galactus all the time.

2007
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,120
I've never mentioned that.

2008
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,800
I really have not mentioned that I was afraid

2009
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,840
of like big giant balloons before on the show.

2010
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:32,760
No. Wow.

2011
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:34,320
No, really?

2012
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,160
Afraid of them.

2013
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,880
They're also silly and friendly.

2014
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,080
Well, because they were just so big,

2015
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,600
they were abnormally, you know,

2016
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,520
you don't see a giant inflatable ape

2017
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,200
in front of a car dealership.

2018
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,040
I would like, I kind of look away.

2019
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:49,320
I would look away in the car when we'd be driving by it.

2020
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:53,480
Wow, much less in giant sunglasses and giant swim trunks.

2021
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:55,160
Yeah, there was right by the,

2022
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:57,880
right by the Rosemont Horizon,

2023
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:59,800
which is now the Allstate Arena.

2024
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,600
I remember there was something they were promoting

2025
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,600
and there were like seven of them in a row

2026
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,960
along the like the expressway.

2027
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:07,800
And God, I was scared.

2028
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,120
Even though they were far away,

2029
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,720
it wasn't like they were coming up to the car.

2030
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,080
But then my dad once, there was one,

2031
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:17,600
there was a giant balloon, just it was balloon shaped

2032
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,640
next to the Toys R Us on Gulf Road.

2033
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,520
And he made me go up and touch it.

2034
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:27,400
He like, he forced me to like, yeah, get over it.

2035
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,440
It mostly worked.

2036
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,080
I think I was still a little uncomfortable,

2037
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,080
but it did like.

2038
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,960
This was a facing fears moment.

2039
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,680
Yeah. They touched the balloon.

2040
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:37,320
Yeah, I remember it very, very vividly.

2041
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,920
I assume I was like six, seven.

2042
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:40,760
Wow.

2043
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:41,960
Walked up to it and touched it.

2044
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:45,360
I don't know if that's really the best way to do it,

2045
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,600
cause it wasn't like I was thinking

2046
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,800
it was actually gonna eat me

2047
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,000
or that it wasn't real or something.

2048
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,720
So I don't know why touching it was.

2049
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,320
It's just tackling your fears.

2050
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:54,680
Yeah. Putting your hands on your fears.

2051
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:55,880
He should have just like sat me,

2052
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,880
like made me sit there for an hour and stare at it.

2053
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,040
Desensitize me to it.

2054
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:06,040
For every tear, I deduct $1,000 from your inheritance.

2055
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:08,560
He should have, I mean, maybe it was a bribe.

2056
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,240
Maybe I got bribed that day.

2057
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:11,960
Cause I got bribed for other things,

2058
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,480
like scoring a goal in soccer.

2059
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,840
Like my dad told me. Was that successful?

2060
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:19,120
I was bad at all sports.

2061
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,120
I didn't want to play.

2062
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:21,280
I was on defense.

2063
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,000
And then I one day,

2064
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,760
I don't know if he like talked to the coach.

2065
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,960
They put me in on offense for soccer.

2066
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:29,640
And my dad came up to me before I was about to go in

2067
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:32,280
and said, I will buy you a toy if you score a goal.

2068
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,840
And I fucking scored a goal so fast.

2069
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:38,840
It's unbelievable how fast I scored it.

2070
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:40,920
And I got a Ninja Turtle vehicle out of it.

2071
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,600
And I was thrilled.

2072
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,360
So I wonder if there was some sort of bribe.

2073
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,560
I have to ask my dad.

2074
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:48,200
He, and I will say all of our dads

2075
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,120
should be bribing us in this way.

2076
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,720
I'll get you a toy if you sell a TV show.

2077
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:55,560
Oh my God.

2078
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:56,400
And I just did it.

2079
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:57,400
Yeah.

2080
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,240
Honestly, I need the motivation right now.

2081
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,080
Sure.

2082
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,040
So I'm jealous of not going on it,

2083
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,000
but I wonder if I would have been too scared as a kid.

2084
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Well, he wasn't inflatable.

2085
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:07,880
I was a little scared.

2086
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:09,880
Now I'm thinking, I was about 10.

2087
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:11,320
So it was like 98.

2088
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,160
Yeah.

2089
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:14,520
And I think I was still a little,

2090
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,880
I mean, maybe like we were in the vicinity

2091
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,880
and I was like, maybe we check out another ride first.

2092
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,760
Like, let me build up my.

2093
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:22,600
That's a good move.

2094
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:23,440
Let's go back to Lucy.

2095
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,280
Let's go back to Lucy.

2096
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,400
Cool, like, for a minute.

2097
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,240
Oh man, if they can drive across country,

2098
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,520
I can face God.

2099
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,040
That's the thing, my wife Erin is extremely fond of,

2100
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,880
the game where you drove them across country

2101
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:38,280
by answering trivia questions.

2102
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,120
Oh my gosh.

2103
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:39,960
The questions were hard though.

2104
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:40,800
Very specific questions.

2105
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,120
They still had it like seven years ago.

2106
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:44,160
And Lindsay took a picture of me excitedly

2107
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,240
playing the I Love Lucy game.

2108
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,320
Wow.

2109
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:52,120
We haven't talked about the biggest selling point.

2110
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:53,680
Oh yeah.

2111
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:55,440
I remember it, maybe it was even like

2112
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,320
in the pamphlet or something,

2113
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:00,000
or on like the Beetlejuice hosted infomercial

2114
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,720
that just played on repeat at the hotel.

2115
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:05,440
Wait, maybe I don't know there was that.

2116
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,280
Oh yeah.

2117
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,120
Fuck.

2118
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,960
That I kept watching and annoyed my family.

2119
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,320
Cause he hosted it?

2120
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:15,240
It was like the Beetlejuice actor at the park being like,

2121
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,760
you want scares?

2122
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:17,720
Get on jaws.

2123
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,920
Like whoa, wait a minute.

2124
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,080
He was sort of the MC.

2125
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:22,320
I've never seen this.

2126
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,160
Have you seen this?

2127
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,520
In which hotels are we talking?

2128
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:26,600
Well there used to be hotels,

2129
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:30,840
not like partner hotels across the highway, right?

2130
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:35,480
I'm gonna say this was at a Days Inn somewhere.

2131
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,080
Like whoa.

2132
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:40,520
That had, so they gave all of these hotels,

2133
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,520
Beetlejuice videos?

2134
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:45,120
An in hotel chat when I got like stuck

2135
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,320
in Vegas once, like this no name hotel had like

2136
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:52,480
the Vegas channel, which was very much like a theme park.

2137
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:53,680
So I think like,

2138
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:54,520
These can exist.

2139
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:58,360
There can be like the Disney channel

2140
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,440
and the universal info channel.

2141
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:01,280
Okay, okay.

2142
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,760
It was just like for tourism.

2143
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,160
Oh man.

2144
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,200
So Beetlejuice told you about everything?

2145
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,040
Yeah.

2146
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,200
I wanna see this really bad.

2147
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:11,760
He set the groundwork for my excitement.

2148
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:12,600
Wow.

2149
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,600
He was kind of the master of the ceremony.

2150
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,480
Original universal, I feel like.

2151
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:20,320
So he'd tell you about Kong though.

2152
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:24,640
So he said Kong, and I remember this was a big selling point

2153
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,200
was the banana breath.

2154
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,440
Oh wait, that was the opening joke

2155
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,480
and then we haven't talked about it.

2156
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,000
Yeah, yeah.

2157
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,900
Smell that banana breath.

2158
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,680
Which the one here did too

2159
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:37,700
and I smelled it on the daily when I worked there.

2160
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,480
It's great.

2161
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,200
That is a lot of fun.

2162
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:42,840
It's a really smart idea.

2163
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:43,960
They didn't have to think of it.

2164
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,240
They could have missed that.

2165
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,360
But it's really funny.

2166
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:47,200
I mean, yeah.

2167
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:48,600
Like they, yeah.

2168
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:51,200
There was nothing, there was no banana smell

2169
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,840
anywhere out before this, right?

2170
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,960
They really innovated with banana breath.

2171
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,160
I think so. Yeah.

2172
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:59,920
There may not have been a ton of theme park smells

2173
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,720
up until this point.

2174
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,800
Did this innovate the theme park smell?

2175
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,280
I think they had to go to a fragrance distributor.

2176
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,720
Like they had to go to someone who sold scents

2177
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,680
to like get this scent.

2178
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,840
Interesting. And then get it in bulk.

2179
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:15,200
Like it's artificial banana smell.

2180
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:16,040
Yeah. Yeah.

2181
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,640
Which is odd.

2182
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,840
Because bananas don't really smell like anything.

2183
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:23,960
Right, but did you ever have the Nesquik banana flavor

2184
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,960
like I did as a child?

2185
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,060
Yeah.

2186
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:28,080
You'd have those like little,

2187
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:32,240
they came in like a very satisfying like metal or like tin

2188
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:34,400
and you'd scoop out a scoop of it.

2189
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,360
We had it in strawberry and banana

2190
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:37,800
and you put it in your milk

2191
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,840
and it was the most artificial banana smell possible.

2192
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,960
Yeah. It's like fake watermelon.

2193
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,240
That kind of like flavor.

2194
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:47,080
There's fake banana.

2195
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:50,640
I guess a lot of bananas together have a smell

2196
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,920
but not like one.

2197
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,960
Speaking of which, how's your hand doing?

2198
01:21:55,960 --> 01:22:00,680
My hand is, there is no sign of anything going on

2199
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,000
in the banana spot.

2200
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,740
Does it smell like bananas?

2201
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,000
Yes.

2202
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,040
Wow.

2203
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,360
Oh. So they do have a smell.

2204
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,480
They do have a smell. They do.

2205
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:14,480
But it's not like the Runtz candy version of banana.

2206
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:18,120
It's more of a, it's a subtle, it's a more subtle smell.

2207
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:19,240
Yeah.

2208
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,240
So I'm not an idiot

2209
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:24,680
but why would Kong's breath smell like bananas?

2210
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:25,640
Yeah.

2211
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:26,480
Yeah.

2212
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,320
You know.

2213
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,160
We need a train and a helicopter.

2214
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,000
It's not like motor oil.

2215
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:30,840
Requires a lot.

2216
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:34,680
Ripping apart crocodiles or something you said, right?

2217
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:37,080
So, well, where in the timeline is it?

2218
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:39,320
Has he been made to perform in the show?

2219
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,000
Right.

2220
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,480
As, when he was backstage at the show,

2221
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,680
did they, was there crafty?

2222
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:49,400
Was there like a big pile of bananas?

2223
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:50,640
Blue almonds.

2224
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,360
They put out a lot of things for him.

2225
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:56,240
You know, they had, they had barbecue chips

2226
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:57,320
and the trail mix.

2227
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,160
But like.

2228
01:22:58,160 --> 01:22:59,160
A little last sprint just in case.

2229
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,000
Yeah.

2230
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,920
I don't like, yeah, with somebody on,

2231
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,120
like the amount of bananas he'd have to have

2232
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:08,280
to feel satiated would be insane.

2233
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,880
You'd have to have somebody peeling the bananas.

2234
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,040
Or did he eat them with the peel?

2235
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,640
I guess his digestive system can handle the peel.

2236
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:14,480
Probably.

2237
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:15,320
Probably.

2238
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,160
He can just eat a crocodile.

2239
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:20,440
Jason's digestive system can't handle a regular banana.

2240
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:22,840
Well, I just need a little toast or a little cereal first

2241
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,680
to prime the pump.

2242
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:25,520
Prime the pump.

2243
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,840
Prime the tummy pump.

2244
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,720
You can't have just a banana in there in the morning.

2245
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:32,160
It's so much sugar immediately, I feel like.

2246
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:34,280
Could you have like a strawberry first thing?

2247
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:36,040
I think that'd be fine.

2248
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,240
What else is on your list?

2249
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:38,080
What can't you have?

2250
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,720
What's on the no-no list?

2251
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,560
I don't know.

2252
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:41,400
No, no, no, no.

2253
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,440
I don't have bananas no more.

2254
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,600
Hmm, I'm trying to think.

2255
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:51,320
I mean, some mornings it's like I wake up

2256
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:54,560
and something savory sounds disgusting to me.

2257
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:57,720
But some mornings something sweet sounds disgusting to me.

2258
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:59,480
But that's more of like a taste thing

2259
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:02,320
than like a this will fuck me up sort of thing.

2260
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,440
But a banana would fuck you up.

2261
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:06,040
But it sounds like a banana is the one rule you have.

2262
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:07,480
No bananas first.

2263
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:09,160
No bananas first, yo.

2264
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,480
But anything else is on the table.

2265
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:14,040
You would eat like a pancake or a chocolate chip pancake?

2266
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:14,880
Sure.

2267
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:15,720
Cold?

2268
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,680
Well, as long as I have caffeine to balance it out.

2269
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:18,560
I think the sugar.

2270
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,240
I think too much sugar early in the morning.

2271
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,600
Do you put a lot of sugar and cream in a coffee?

2272
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,440
No.

2273
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:25,280
Not at all?

2274
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:28,880
No, maybe I'll get a vanilla latte, but only one pump.

2275
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,000
Would you eat a piece of cake first thing?

2276
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,200
Yes.

2277
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,520
But that's incredibly sugary.

2278
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:36,400
I need a cup of coffee to balance out the sugar.

2279
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,360
So balance it out the banana with coffee.

2280
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:40,960
Yeah, yeah, that would probably work.

2281
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,160
But I would need to have some of the coffee first.

2282
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,600
No question about the cake.

2283
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,720
The cake is the flaw in this.

2284
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:49,040
Up till that I think I was with you.

2285
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:50,080
But if it's the cake.

2286
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:55,120
I think, well, I think the wonders of sugar processing,

2287
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:55,760
probably.

2288
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:57,120
So the raw sugar.

2289
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:00,840
Yeah, the fiber, the stuff from the earth.

2290
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:01,600
I needed a little more.

2291
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,440
We need a listener to weigh in on this.

2292
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,920
Is there scientific evidence, what Jason's saying,

2293
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:12,160
that banana sugar would be rarer and more tumultuous

2294
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,360
inside Jason's stomach?

2295
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,160
It's the morning.

2296
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:16,200
I can't have all that real sugar shit.

2297
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:17,840
Give me cake.

2298
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,120
Give me a sheet cake.

2299
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,240
I have one real little thing.

2300
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:25,320
Breakfast sheet cake.

2301
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:33,240
So here's a thing for our theoretical movie series.

2302
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:36,560
The Magic of the Movies Souvenir VHS cassette,

2303
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,760
which they would sell at Universal Florida,

2304
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:41,320
and I believe Universal Hollywood too.

2305
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:42,800
Hosted by John Forsythe.

2306
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:43,320
Oh, yes.

2307
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:44,000
Well, I love this.

2308
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
This is my favorite tape.

2309
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,400
It was back when there was a very short window

2310
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:51,680
where theme parks would be like, here's a souvenir VHS

2311
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:52,920
to remember your trip.

2312
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:56,040
It is $40.

2313
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:57,880
Now it is free on YouTube.

2314
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:01,600
I scrolled through to find, when does he talk about Kong?

2315
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,440
And how does he talk about Kong?

2316
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:07,200
So of course, the Kong footage is that very stylized,

2317
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:11,400
like Kong squatting at you and the tram and the helicopters.

2318
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,200
But John Forsythe setting it up is just

2319
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:18,240
him talking about the thrills of Kong

2320
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:22,240
while he is on a slowly drifting boat.

2321
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:26,000
He's on a boat in the middle of the water in Universal Florida.

2322
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,120
And it's like a two-tier boat.

2323
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:30,200
He is in the galley.

2324
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,560
He's in the living room area of this boat

2325
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:35,720
that is either on a rope at the dock

2326
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:37,000
or just in the middle of it.

2327
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,840
And it's just kind of drift.

2328
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:40,640
You see the background just drifting.

2329
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:45,600
And John Forsythe, who is old at this point,

2330
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,040
is just setting up Kong.

2331
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,800
But there's no context.

2332
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:52,800
He's just on a slowly drifting boat.

2333
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,280
When you're thinking about the movies,

2334
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:59,400
you don't notice where you are, why you're drifting,

2335
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:01,920
where to, if the boat was sinking.

2336
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:04,720
I wouldn't even give it a thought.

2337
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,480
But I mean, that VHS, I truly am wondering,

2338
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:12,440
was this directed for children to remember their trip?

2339
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:16,280
Or was it more for the era of the last remnants

2340
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:18,920
of people making slides and giving,

2341
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:21,920
here's, you gotta look at the slides from my trip.

2342
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:25,440
Was the John Forsythe VHS for very old people

2343
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,120
who were used to seeing slides

2344
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,200
of friends and loved ones' journeys?

2345
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,240
John Forsythe involvement is maybe a hint.

2346
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:33,080
I think so.

2347
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:36,400
Like I maybe would have chosen Beetlejuice

2348
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,920
if given the choice of MCs.

2349
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,520
Far too crass.

2350
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:42,000
I definitely have watched that

2351
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,840
and probably wanted the VHS as a kid.

2352
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,280
Yeah. Yeah, I definitely eyeballed it.

2353
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:48,880
I might not have known it was there.

2354
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:53,240
I was a big fan of the movie side of Universal Studios.

2355
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,360
Like I loved the Hitchcock exhibit.

2356
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:56,640
I was really into that.

2357
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:59,000
I obviously loved the Lucy thing.

2358
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,240
All of those kind of attractions really appealed to me.

2359
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:03,080
It was like a nerdy tenor.

2360
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:05,880
What that led to was just a generation of people

2361
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:08,280
who are weirdos in the entertainment industry,

2362
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:09,440
who are comedians.

2363
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:10,680
Yeah.

2364
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,440
Yeah, it spoke to us.

2365
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:14,520
Murder She Wrote, you see the Murder She Wrote show?

2366
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,360
Or was it Hercules and Xena by the time you were?

2367
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,040
It was Hercules and Xena.

2368
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:20,920
I was not even, I didn't just watch the show,

2369
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:22,200
I was part of it.

2370
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:23,360
Damn, whoa.

2371
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,600
We haven't talked about Hercules and Xena at all.

2372
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,080
I was a centaur child.

2373
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:28,400
I was the centaur child.

2374
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,240
Whoa.

2375
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:30,080
Yeah.

2376
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:30,920
Okay.

2377
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:33,160
The centaur children have found each other.

2378
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:35,200
A late reveal in the episode.

2379
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:36,040
Whoa.

2380
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:38,560
I also at this time, I loved,

2381
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,560
like it was my favorite thing on TV,

2382
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,920
the action pack of Hercules and Xena.

2383
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:44,760
Wow.

2384
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:45,880
I loved it so much.

2385
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:48,480
It was such a thrill to be part of that world.

2386
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:49,640
Wow.

2387
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:52,720
The centaur children.

2388
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:53,800
The two centaur children.

2389
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:55,200
From across the country,

2390
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,920
they managed to find each other.

2391
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,240
I've never seen the show though.

2392
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,200
What did the centaur children do?

2393
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,240
I think we just celebrated.

2394
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:06,120
I remember going, woo.

2395
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:10,520
Well, someone was attacking Hercules and Xena

2396
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:14,280
and then there's footage of centaur shooting crossbows.

2397
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,120
Yeah.

2398
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:20,120
And then it cut to two adult centaurs and a centaur child

2399
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,240
and Hercules and Xena are like, thanks.

2400
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:25,520
And then it cuts to us in front of a green screen.

2401
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,280
Yes, we killed that man.

2402
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:30,720
We killed that man to help you.

2403
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:32,400
Oh my God.

2404
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,800
Oh, both of you, wow.

2405
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,760
I mean, these Hercules and Xena crossovers,

2406
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:39,480
they didn't come, there was once in a blue moon.

2407
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:41,600
It was a big deal when they meet again.

2408
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:42,440
Yeah.

2409
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:44,040
And you got to be part of one.

2410
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:45,400
I got to be part of it.

2411
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:46,800
You're part of the universe now.

2412
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,440
Wow, that's amazing.

2413
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:49,600
What if you had just been in it

2414
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,240
and you didn't know what the context was gonna be?

2415
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:53,320
It's gonna cut to you and then you wave and celebrate.

2416
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:55,080
And then if what that ended up being is like,

2417
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,200
Hercules and Xena got slaughtered,

2418
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,240
just wrecked and their bodies are dead.

2419
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:00,080
Oh no.

2420
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,400
And then the villain gives you a thumbs up

2421
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:04,320
and you're supposed to like, yay.

2422
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,280
Their blood is on our hands.

2423
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:07,640
And right before it cuts to you,

2424
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,600
they like throw a little blood on you.

2425
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:10,440
No, no.

2426
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:14,800
Thank you centaur children.

2427
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,560
You finally banished those bastards to hell

2428
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:18,400
where they belong.

2429
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:22,760
Take me back to Mills driving.

2430
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:24,680
I need a milkshake to calm down.

2431
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,880
But not a banana if it's the morning.

2432
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,440
They should have sold videos of that.

2433
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:31,960
That's a big thing they didn't do.

2434
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:34,320
They didn't give us like anything.

2435
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,600
Like I thought I'd get a video at the end.

2436
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:39,280
Yeah, the MGM studios version

2437
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:40,480
when they would have you been like

2438
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,280
being the soap opera and stuff.

2439
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:44,800
They didn't sell a video to that either I don't think.

2440
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,920
It seemed like such a missed opportunity.

2441
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:51,000
Someone be inserted into home improvement episode.

2442
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:51,840
Oh.

2443
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:52,680
Disney World.

2444
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:53,520
Yeah.

2445
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:54,920
That was a Disney World thing.

2446
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:59,000
What did you guys wear to be centaur children?

2447
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,720
There was some armor.

2448
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:03,760
I'm sure I was also wearing maybe like a bugle boy

2449
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:04,920
sleeveless shirt.

2450
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:07,760
Was it wig?

2451
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,160
That was my style.

2452
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:11,200
Yeah, like a long haired wig maybe.

2453
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:16,840
Guys, both of you Halloween idea for this year.

2454
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:17,680
Oh yeah.

2455
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:18,520
You made it.

2456
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:20,680
Send tweet pictures at each other.

2457
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:23,000
The boys are back in town.

2458
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,760
Centaur boys are back in town.

2459
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,680
Forever Dogs Halloween promotion.

2460
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:28,520
Yeah.

2461
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:31,720
It's two different O's on two different coasts.

2462
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:33,080
Just the centaurs.

2463
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,240
Should really change the name of the podcast network

2464
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:38,560
to Forever Centaur.

2465
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:39,640
Oh yeah, yeah.

2466
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:42,240
Forever Centaur.

2467
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:46,120
Any final thoughts about Kong?

2468
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:49,400
About anything while you have the mic?

2469
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:54,400
It was the most exciting week of my life

2470
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:58,320
until I was maybe 18 and had a car

2471
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:02,560
and was kissing people and graduating school.

2472
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:05,680
It was such a big trip for me

2473
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:08,360
because it had been built up and other kids got to do it.

2474
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:11,680
So by the time I was 10 and doing it, it was huge.

2475
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:13,800
And King Kong was the centerpiece of it.

2476
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,200
Man, hell yeah.

2477
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:19,320
There's entire years of my life missing.

2478
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:21,080
I don't remember a day.

2479
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:21,920
I don't remember what school was like.

2480
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:25,920
I remember every second of the Disney or Universal trips.

2481
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:29,440
I had all the, I would take every, any like free thing

2482
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:34,440
like I had and I would just look over again reminiscing.

2483
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:39,960
Yeah, it was such a fun time to be, yeah.

2484
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:41,840
And it was pre-Islands of Adventure.

2485
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,160
They're still using that neon sign logo.

2486
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:50,200
It's just like aesthetically really still in the head.

2487
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:52,840
Man, hell yeah, absolutely.

2488
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:55,360
Well, Centaur Child, Brett Davis,

2489
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,320
You Survived Podcast, The Ride.

2490
01:32:58,560 --> 01:32:59,400
What a blast.

2491
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:01,080
Thanks so much.

2492
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:03,440
And let's exit through the gift shop

2493
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:04,880
with the King Kong photo op.

2494
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:07,360
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2495
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:11,800
Check out the podcast for laundry on Forever Dog,

2496
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:15,240
the National Lampoon Radio Hour on Forever Dog.

2497
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,080
Did a weird TV show for a while

2498
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:18,760
called The Special Without Brett Davis.

2499
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:20,080
That's still up there.

2500
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:21,720
And there's like, that's on YouTube.

2501
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:22,560
And it's on YouTube, yeah.

2502
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,400
You can watch moments for that, wonderful.

2503
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:27,440
I know, Brett Davis, RIP on social media.

2504
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:29,080
Cool, cool, all right.

2505
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:32,760

01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:48,840
Lucy tribute coming soon.

2512
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:51,040
Yeah, this one's really looming now.

2513
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,600
The Lucy one, I think we promised

2514
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:54,200
a two and a half hour episode.

2515
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,520
I'm not sure that we have, but you clearly did just now.

2516
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,840
We might have to do a retreat to prepare for that.

2517
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:04,080
We might have to go to Big Bear or something.

2518
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:04,920
Yes, I think.

2519
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:05,760
And run out of house.

2520
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:08,240
We gotta drive across the country from New York to LA.

2521
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:09,080
Oh, yeah.

2522
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:11,960
We have to find William Folly's relatives.

2523
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:14,560
We have to, like how we found Cotswinkle

2524
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:15,760
and the guy who did Botanicus.

2525
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:19,440
We need to find the great, great grandson of Bill Frolly.

2526
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,520
You wanna ask about who?

2527
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:22,360
Bill?

2528
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:26,400
Forget about Bill, that old son of a bitch.

2529
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,920
No way he had any kids, right?

2530
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:29,760
I don't think so.

2531
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:30,600
I don't think so.

2532
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:31,440
I believe he had.

2533
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,280
Not on purpose.

2534
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:33,880
Yeah, no, not on purpose.

2535
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:34,720
See, where he'd be.

2536
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:35,640
Damn it, I'd have it again.

2537
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:39,000
He seemed like he'd be put out by it accidentally.

2538
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,680
He seemed to be put out by the act.

2539
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:43,200
He doesn't seem like a guy

2540
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,800
who would love the act of lovemaking, no.

2541
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:51,760
Also presumably dead before either of these Lucy zippers.

2542
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,040
Oh, yeah, he died a couple years.

2543
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:55,960
He was on My Three Sons for a couple seasons

2544
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:58,800
and then he got replaced because he was ailing

2545
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,680
and then he was dead pretty soon.

2546
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:03,320
And he was 25 years older than the rest of them.

2547
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:04,960
Walked outside of his apartment building

2548
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,320
and died on the sidewalk.

2549
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:09,200
Yeah, he like lives in a one-bedroom apartment still.

2550
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:13,400
The same efficiency apartment for years and years.

2551
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,040
I forget which one, I used to know which one.

2552
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,160
We need to find it.

2553
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:17,000
We gotta go.

2554
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:17,840
We gotta find the apartment,

2555
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:20,840
we gotta find the hospital bed he died in as well.

2556
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:22,640
I wanna die in now.

2557
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:25,080
Or the sidewalk he died on,

2558
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:26,520
depending on where it actually happened,

2559
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:28,640
where the expiring happened.

2560
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:30,360
It depends on what part of town I'm in.

2561
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:31,680
Is this LA we're talking about?

2562
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:32,520
The Boulevard.

2563
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:35,240
Oh yeah, it's like by Paramount, I think.

2564
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:36,800
I think his apartment was right around there.

2565
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:37,640
Oh really?

2566
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:38,480
Yeah.

2567
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:40,640
Yeah, go find it.

2568
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,480
So that we know in advance.

2569
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:45,640
All right, if we're on one side of the hill,

2570
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:46,720
take me to the walled bed.

2571
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:48,240
If I'm on the other side of the hill,

2572
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:49,080
take me to the walled bed.

2573
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:49,920
The Frawley sidewalk.

2574
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:53,120
The Frawley, I wanna die on the Frawley sidewalk.

2575
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:56,760
Which piece of cement did Bill Frawley die on?

2576
01:35:58,040 --> 01:35:59,920
Excuse, yeah, police man walk.

2577
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:04,200
Officer, hey, do you know?

2578
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:08,080
Where's that, hi, where's that famous sidewalk in Hollywood?

2579
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:09,440
With the stars?

2580
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,200
No, no, no, hell no, I don't wanna see that shit.

2581
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:15,040
Take me to where Bill Frawley collapsed and died.

2582
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:18,960
That would be the tour I would start in Hollywood.

2583
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,520
I would drive people around in a van.

2584
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:23,680
It would be mostly about Bill Frawley things.

2585
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:25,320
You'd start at the apartment building

2586
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:27,400
then drive up the sidewalk slightly.

2587
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:28,240
All right, get it out.

2588
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:29,080
All right.

2589
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:29,920
Yeah.

2590
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:30,760
Tour's over.

2591
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:31,680
Tour's over.

2592
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:36,880
Also, if Kiss Makeup Guy is out there,

2593
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:40,160
please reach me.

2594
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:41,000
Yeah, I'm serious.

2595
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,880
He kinda look like Harry Knowles, if that helps.

2596
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:45,680
I don't know how much that nervous it is.

2597
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:49,640
Harry Knowles with the little Jane Simmons makeup.

2598
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:52,480
So this has been a great mystery in my life.

2599
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,520
Wow, wow, an old family friend, yes.

2600
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:55,640
Let's make the reunion happen

2601
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:57,480
just like the Centaur Chaud reunion.

2602
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:00,480
Thanks for listening everybody.

2603
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:02,640
Fighting the frizzies at 11.

01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:03,480

2605

2606
