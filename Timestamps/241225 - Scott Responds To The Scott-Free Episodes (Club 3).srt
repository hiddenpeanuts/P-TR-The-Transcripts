1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Club 3

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Daddy's home and he's pissed.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's right. You and your little tee-hee-hees.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Tee-hee-please.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Scott Free. More Scott than ever there be.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Here on Club 3. That's right.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, he's speaking in rhyme.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't know why.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Uh-oh.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes, kind of like limerick or pirate or something,

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
which is not applicable whatsoever because this is Christmas, actually, is what this is.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Merry Christmas.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Merry Christmas. Christmas Day.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's happy.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You there, what day is it? Why, it's the day Podcast Rides Club 3 comes out,

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
where Scott responds after weeks of Scott Free episodes.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes, that's right. If you are with your family currently

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and you would like to go have a several-hour block to yourself,

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
it's completely unrelatable to your family,

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
something that they, as soon as you start explaining,

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
they will not ask any follow-up questions and they will let you go be on your own.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is that episode.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah, it's exciting. So, Merry Christmas.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Merry Christmas. I'm not sure that we've had an episode come out on literal Christmas before,

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and I started feeling kind of self-conscious that the schedule dictated that it be this.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But then I started thinking, well, you know what?

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What says holiday gathering more than criticizing your loved ones?

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah, that's true.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's one. This is a broader thought, and we'll get into it.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This is the episode where I'm responding to all of the episodes that I missed while I was gone.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
One big note I have, having gotten a little busy for a second,

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
how do we do so many goddamn episodes? It's crazy.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I got a time-consuming job for a minute, and I'm like, I haven't heard all these fucking things.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The point was for me to listen to, I listened to a lot of them, but I couldn't keep up.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I literally haven't had the time. How does anybody do it?

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's what my dad was telling me last night. He goes, I'm so behind on these episodes.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I go, I know, I'm sorry. That's just what the people demand, though.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah, it's a lot of content.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's a content hose. We are blasting people at full fire department levels.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah, but like Morning Zoo...

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's a riot control level of content hose.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But Morning Zoo people are like five days a week, four days a week.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's true.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And they do it early, and they reroute their entire lives to make it happen.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We should be thankful that here, well, that anyone wants this, first of all,

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and that we can do it at our leisure, that we can do it in reasonable hours.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Right, that's true. But I mean, there might be some people that want us to do it daily.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And maybe if the call comes in right now on the Patreon...

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Scott's going to have a lot more to respond to.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Five days a week, and maybe they do want us to do it live at 7 a.m.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh my God.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And if the call is strong enough, we may as well heed the call.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's all I'm saying.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
One of us will stay normal. You'll still be Mike, but I'll have to turn into initials.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll have to be SG, and then Jason will have to become the Hooter or something.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Or the Buttmaster.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And the Buttmaster.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah, that's Dacey on FCC-controlled radio, but that's about as far as you can go.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's what Howard Stern fought for when he was fighting with WNBC.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He was fighting to be able to say Buttmaster,

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and now Buttmaster is just a regular morning Zoo Crew show

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
that mainly talks about theme parks.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
VTR radio with Mike, SG, and the Buttmaster.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
7 a.m., five days a week, clapping those cheeks.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
7 a.m. to 2 p.m. every day.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
There's one from Foreigner.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Hot blooded chickens.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That would be fun to play music during this show.

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I've never even thought about that.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's how we would get through it.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
There's a Clip 3 idea, one where we have to...

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And the topic can be random.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The parenthetical would be...

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It could be, what's a random triceratops spin?

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Is that a ride?

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's jumping jellyfish, but you have to do it like a morning Zoo Crew.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And you have to hold for song breaks, and we play the entire song.

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And now here's It Takes Two.

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
There has to be a list of approved songs, though,

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
like it was K. Earth or something, right?

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah, pulled from the 20s.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So we're throwing, once again, the Chainsmokers.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We'll be back with more Golden Zephyr talk.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This ain't a bad idea, actually.

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Let's just see if we can...

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We need kind of a whole new switcher, I think.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We'd have to do it live.

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't want to edit in the songs.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah, yeah.

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And you'd have to do that thing where...

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Back with more PTR here on PTR Radio.

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Taking care of biz.

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It has to overlap with the guitar.

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Well, they call it a talk-up, is when you do the intro.

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Is that the term?

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The intro is a talk-up, where you talk up right when the vocal comes in.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I think that's a real skill,

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and I think it'd be a great skill for us to learn,

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
because it really has to gather speed.

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
See, I mumbled, I couldn't do it.

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You've got to gather speed all the way up to the point of where Hot-Blooded begins.

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
PTR Radio.

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Don't stop believing starts, but you talk right up until the vocal comes in.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's a really good one for radio,

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
because you've got a lot of instrumental to do ads

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and talk about giveaways you're going to do

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
that we'll be hanging out at the...

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
at the Kia Forum, giving out passes for Summer Bash,

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
right here on PTR Radio.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But ours would be like,

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
stay tuned after this tune to hear a new anecdote about Al Lewis.

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Who does a small town...

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And stay tuned for discussion about whether Madam is Mama,

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
right here at PTR Radio.

115
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So that would be a little different.

116
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I like the idea of a format buster.

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That sounds good.

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I mean, look, what I feel at this point,

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
given the, I would say, the pole dominance of what we're doing right now,

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
of the desire of this topic,

121
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
the desire for me to respond to what I missed,

122
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
as well as the strong second place performance of my vice topic,

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Bugmane does whatever he wants,

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I feel like there is a mandate for change coming into the...

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
A desire for a new type of show, a new type of Club 3.

126
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I feel this very strongly.

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Interesting.

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And that's why, you know, again, you know,

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
because we try to tee up the next month as we do this thing.

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And I just want to say, you know, like I look at these comment sections

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and after the hate and the division and the vitriol that I see in there,

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
you know, people fighting tooth and nail against particular topics,

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I think it's time to all come together

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and coalesce in the spirit of love and harmony

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
behind our new leader, Bugmane.

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
To just like give, what's the...

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
There's like a let go and let God.

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Let go and let Bug.

139
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's time to let go and let Bug.

140
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
After all of this, please just do the right thing,

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
cast your vote for Bugmane, does whatever he wants,

142
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and we can stop all this division and this...

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Oh, it's been so nasty in there.

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Wouldn't you agree?

145
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah, it has been nasty, yeah.

146
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hopefully everyone will just coalesce

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and they'll all say, you know what, it's time.

148
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yeah, I think so.

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Sure.

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
By the way, I don't want to put you guys on the spot.

151
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Well, you know what, I won't even lead the conversation.

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't think you've really said your thoughts

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
about the notion of letting Bugmane do whatever he wants.

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Because I think this is attributed to me.

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This is made very much a Scott thing,

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
but Bugmane is a friend of us all.

157
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Well, offend of every man, woman, child, person on the planet Earth.

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes, yes.

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And in the voice memo that I sent you guys,

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
to make the point, he is a big Theme Park fan.

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He's a good guest to talk about theme parks.

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I thought if I made that point, it would help.

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I think it only made things worse.

164
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Oh, the discord that started occurring there.

165
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I don't know why people can't cut this mere entertainer a break.

166
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He's just trying to make you laugh.

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He's trying to do a little song for you.

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He's just a Lanuba boy, you know?

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Ultimately, look right there, you know?

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That's what I've been thinking.

171
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He's in that universe where he is hosting a podcast about this kind of stuff.

172
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
About, I don't know, like an old Cirque du Soleil show or something.

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He has opinions about it.

174
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He's told me about that.

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But what are your feelings? What are your guys' feelings?

176
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Because if your feelings are you don't want him around...

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
No, no, I don't. I want him around.

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
There's uncertainty when he does whatever he wants.

179
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Sure.

180
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If he did...

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Isn't that the thrill?

182
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But that's the thrill.

183
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You know, I like to roll with things.

184
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Let's do it. Let's fucking go, I say.

185
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You're always saying that we cut that before every record.

186
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Right.

187
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Right before we start.

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Like, are we ready? Mike's sounding good?

189
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah.

190
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yeah. Let's fucking go.

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah.

192
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And that pumps us. I know that revs me up.

193
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm sure the same for you, Jason.

194
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It revs me up, too. Yeah.

195
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I mean, Mike has that prime energy drink sponsor.

196
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Logan Paul's energy drink.

197
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Just Logan Paul's energy drink.

198
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You always pound those things. You crush the can on your head.

199
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah.

200
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And then you turn off Mike

201
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
because that's an unpleasant sound to make the listeners hear.

202
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Right.

203
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah.

204
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But I'm ready for him to do whatever he wants.

205
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I think it seems like the time...

206
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I feel like we're out. Jason? Jason?

207
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh, I like a leap before I look topic.

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You know that.

209
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah.

210
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah, I'm open to it, you know?

211
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Great.

212
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's fun.

213
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I am...

214
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Mike locked the door when we came in here,

215
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
but I'm still not convinced that he's not going to show up today.

216
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Oh, now this was presented.

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Because it's sort of a letting me do whatever I want kind of thing as well.

218
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah.

219
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So, yeah, there was the notion presented

220
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
that I would come in with this so that you'd suddenly hear from the back.

221
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You'd find a way.

222
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You'd get in through the vents even though we locked the doors here at Forever Dog Studios.

223
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Right.

224
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I mean, I'd say the biggest hurdle to that

225
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and to this even happening in January,

226
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
he's been real light on the text responses lately,

227
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
which, again, I think it's worth the vote

228
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
just to see if you do the vote and then the episode doesn't happen.

229
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah.

230
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's definitely possible.

231
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He's like on a level of like Bill Murray.

232
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Will he show up? Will he respond?

233
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Plus all the great stories, the stories.

234
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah, the murricane going to the parties

235
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and his family not seeing him for years and, you know, all those wild stories.

236
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Screaming at people.

237
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You know what? I don't think I even want to equate Bug Main.

238
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yeah, no, I shouldn't go that far with it.

239
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm just saying the unpredictability is the specific thing.

240
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh, well, it's really more like Belouche.

241
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's more like the Belouche.

242
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's the danger, the danger of Belouche, Jim Belouche.

243
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You never knew what the guy was going to do.

244
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Was he just going to talk like a normal guy?

245
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Was he going to talk to Curly Sue?

246
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Is he going to bust out a harmonica solo

247
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and dance in a way that like clearly visibly wore him out

248
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
where he's like having trouble breathing after half of a song?

249
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
How long will the harmonica intro to Sweet Home Chicago be?

250
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Will it be 20 seconds? Will it be 25 seconds? We don't know.

251
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And can he properly pantomime a harmonica solo

252
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
that is clearly being performed by a better harmonica player just off stage?

253
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Oh, no.

254
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You know what? I feel like maybe we've got to,

255
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
in terms of like 2025 shotcalling,

256
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I think we've got to do Blues Brothers.

257
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

258
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Because that's a theme park topic.

259
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yes, it is.

260
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Blues Brothers.

261
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And don't start suggesting that for Club 3

262
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
because that's a main feed if I've ever heard one.

263
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, sure.

264
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I mean, that street show has been going

265
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
since the opening of Universal Florida.

266
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So many men over the years have hopped around on one foot

267
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and jingle jangled their hand to the delight of dozens.

268
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I think it's time.

269
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And the people still love it.

270
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What's that?

271
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Are they still?

272
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Like, I know that Joliette Blues Brothers Con

273
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
had its last Blues Brothers performance by Dan Aykroyd,

274
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
but it was unclear.

275
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You know that. We all know that.

276
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
They do a Blues Brothers Con in the last two years, I feel like,

277
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
three years at the prison in Joliette where they shot the movie.

278
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And then there was some announcement about it

279
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
being the last Blues Brothers performance at Joliette.

280
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Like, it was unclear language if Dan was retiring,

281
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
performing or not.

282
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And I still don't have an answer, so I'm wondering if...

283
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Because all of a sudden, he'll just, like,

284
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
pop up doing, like, three shows at a casino with Jim Belushi

285
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
and then nothing.

286
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And you're like, what is that? Why?

287
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah, yeah.

288
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So I wonder. I'm just going to quickly Google and see.

289
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
No, no, no, check it.

290
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Doesn't it feel like the Blues Brothers performing at a prison?

291
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Doesn't it feel like a hat on a hat?

292
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Because I think any Blues Brothers live performance is already a prison.

293
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Now, this is where things get odd, right?

294
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Because here I am responding to things that I missed.

295
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Here I am completely game to talk about this unrelated nonsense,

296
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
because it's unrelated nonsense I have a bizarre fascination with.

297
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That's true, yes.

298
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And really what starts to happen, the division occurs

299
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
when there are these things that I just don't,

300
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
that I don't have any interest in.

301
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And, you know, I think it's why it was perfectly fair

302
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
in the time that I was gone that you guys explore some things

303
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
that, you know, where you know that I would start glazing over

304
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
if you were doing it with me.

305
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Did you feel like you enjoyed the freedom

306
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and that you got to seize the freedom to its fullest extent?

307
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
To its fullest extent, no.

308
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I don't think we actually did go to the fullest extent.

309
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Were there plans that didn't come together?

310
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Were there things that you,

311
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
because there may be Scott Freira's in the future, I don't know.

312
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Do you have already earmarked what we'd like to do if this happens again?

313
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't know that I have any concrete plans.

314
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I gotta say, I'm shocked Mr. Morrow didn't show up.

315
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I was anticipating that every time a new episode dropped.

316
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That was a thought I had had, and then that didn't,

317
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
not that it didn't come, we didn't have time to do it.

318
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Sure.

319
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
We didn't have time to do it.

320
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And I also wanted to get him in person.

321
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't want to Zoom.

322
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
We had to do Matt Cardone on Zoom, I get that,

323
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
but like I wanted Morrow in person.

324
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yeah.

325
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Well look, I had a great time with him on stage there.

326
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm not saying get Mr. Morrow to do without me.

327
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I would love to hang with Mr. Morrow.

328
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
He can come any time.

329
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I thought that there'd be some play to plant him permanently in the third seat.

330
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah, that was a thought.

331
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I do think there's a lot of listeners that are still sort of casually listening.

332
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So part of me, and then we didn't know how long you were going to be gone.

333
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So there was a larger idea in my head to make some sort of like finite little events out of it,

334
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
but I didn't have the exact time frame,

335
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
and we had already recorded some with you and without you.

336
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And also it was not that long.

337
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And also it wasn't that long.

338
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Perhaps we were making too big of a meal out of this.

339
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yeah, you could have taken another month or two if need be.

340
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Paternity leave is kind of different around the world.

341
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So it was different, yeah.

342
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's the thing, I didn't take paternity leave at all.

343
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Take it at all.

344
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
This was insane how much I did not get a break in order to do this.

345
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But this was a very exciting time of my life if overwhelming in a lot of moments.

346
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So if you had said I'm gone for eight weeks, starting at the start of November,

347
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
we're done at December, there would have been maybe a much more planned event that happened

348
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
where we auditioned, because there was some grander ideas.

349
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Well, we're going to audition a third host as a joke.

350
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But then I'm like, yeah, there's a couple of people.

351
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But then also I'm like, because it's easier when it's Las Vegas month.

352
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Here it is, there's the month.

353
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It was unclear.

354
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It was left unclear.

355
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So it was hard to figure out a structure.

356
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So we really just sort of dabbled in little indulgences.

357
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Now, I will say, and people have heard this already by now,

358
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
because I've said it on a couple of episodes,

359
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
really what happened was digging into certain avenues

360
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
that maybe we would not dig into quite as hard on the regular show

361
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
has whetted my appetite to do a real hardcore version of it.

362
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
For instance, points.

363
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
We've talked about this.

364
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I know now after doing the first credit card points episode,

365
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
how to do a second points episode.

366
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And I did, of course, on Santa's Secret invite Nick Weigert to be the guest on said episode.

367
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Wow.

368
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So in 2025, Mike's credit card points, I would like to just call it points too.

369
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Points too comes in 2025 at some point.

370
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Not for a while.

371
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You have the confidence in the franchise to where like there's a short end now.

372
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's points.

373
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's points.

374
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Well, he started telling us about a whole other.

375
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Right.

376
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Weigert's on a whole other thing.

377
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So really what's happened is certain things that we've discussed.

378
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Now I feel like now that we've sort of done the first version,

379
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
now we've done a new hope, I'm ready to do a lot of Empire Strikes Back.

380
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But the problem is you're here now, so you may have to be involved.

381
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I truly thought you were going to say now that we've done a new hope,

382
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
we can do a new hope special edition.

383
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Well, that's almost what this is.

384
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
We're almost doing the remastered version by letting me go in and alter things in past episodes.

385
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That's what that is.

386
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah.

387
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm doing the Lucas special edition.

388
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm adding my McClunkies right here and now.

389
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah.

390
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So really what you saw on these episodes was the birth of new avenues.

391
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Okay.

392
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
They weren't the full stretched out versions of what they would be.

393
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
The Frankenstein's monster of out of control app talk and mobile order talk.

394
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
This was just the beginning.

395
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
This is the problem I think you face now.

396
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh, boy.

397
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I have kind of an order in my head.

398
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm going to build it because I think there's things to address here.

399
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I've had thoughts about how to make everybody happy,

400
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
given the new information that we have and the response to certain episodes

401
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
and certain lines of thinking while I was gone.

402
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I think there's places where I know how to proceed.

403
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
But let me go through in kind of the order that I was thinking.

404
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
First, I will read the topic suggestion, the official quote.

405
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
This is from C. Allen Kelly, a Club 3 topic winner veteran.

406
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I looked it up.

407
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
C. Allen Kelly was responsible for Griffin Newman does whatever he wants.

408
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Wow.

409
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
He's got a read on the Club 3 zeitgeist seemingly.

410
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Wow, yeah, really.

411
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So the official suggestion, if Scott is back, then I would like a Scott listens to

412
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
and responds to all the episodes he missed episode.

413
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I feel like he's going to have a couple opinions.

414
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Correct, Allen.

415
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Edit to be clear, all episodes, including Second Gate and Friday episodes.

416
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Thank you for that clarification.

417
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Now, I feel like I have already failed the assignment because there are certain ones

418
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
that I did not and not due to any lack of interest, in some cases lack of time.

419
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
There's one I can say right off the bat.

420
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I gave a real college try to Generation X.

421
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And to me, Generation X was as if you recorded an episode entirely in Portuguese.

422
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah.

423
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I just don't.

424
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I just have.

425
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I mean, OK, you might have got you might have explained this further at some point,

426
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
but I'm I listen for I'd say for like 15 minutes or so.

427
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And I was left going, what is Generation X?

428
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't know what Generation X is as opposed to the X-Men.

429
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I did like for an X-Men lay person, I have no fucking clue what this was.

430
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm pretty sure we said it was the teenage version of X-Men.

431
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It was the new class.

432
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
They've done a few versions over the years of like the new class.

433
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I said it was like the night.

434
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I felt like a 90s thing of like the teens are happening.

435
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And now we're going to do with the X-Men.

436
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So and it launched the comic launched with a lot of fanfare.

437
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Did you want an explanation now?

438
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
No, not necessarily.

439
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
By the way, maybe you said it in the time I was listening and I just glazed over it.

440
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That's distinctly possible as well.

441
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But here's what when you guys talk about X-Men, I feel like what happens is.

442
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
So today, Generation X.

443
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Now, this is, of course, reflects the the Ralph Stedman era of illustration.

444
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
He drew things, you know, in a very active, you know, in a very like it was kind of a revolutionary style of.

445
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And I'm like, what is it?

446
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Wait, basics.

447
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Give me the first line of that Wikipedia or I'm in a lot of trouble.

448
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Well, it made up the movie that came along two years later that we talked about the made for TV movie.

449
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It aired on the episode for you right now.

450
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I was asking for trouble.

451
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But Mike found the like I just watched a master copy that was uploaded.

452
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But when it aired, it aired with interstitials.

453
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It was Mardi Gras.

454
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:58,000
So there was body man on the street segments hosted by a number of of correspondents, including a young Jimmy Kimmel.

455
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Well, also Jim Belushi was on it.

456
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Oh, Jim Belushi was in one.

457
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And Mardi Gras.

458
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yeah.

459
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Was he the was he the king of Bacchus?

460
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
We discussed this feels like this must have come up before because I've previously.

461
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
This is something that would be way up our alley is that the people who are the Mardi Gras king of Bacchus.

462
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Do you know this notion?

463
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's always like this like gregarious.

464
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Just like, you know, like like imagine like a John Goodman type sort of just like, you know, kind of a loud larger than life party guy.

465
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yeah.

466
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And they always designate somebody to be king of Bacchus.

467
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And I guarantee if you go through that list, it's entirely people we like.

468
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I think it's this might be.

469
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
When is Mardi Gras?

470
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Maybe that's an episode we can do that is going through rating our favorite kings of Bacchus.

471
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
OK.

472
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Is this the right phrase, by the way?

473
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
God of recovery and excess.

474
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah, I think so.

475
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
That's that seems right.

476
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I mean, just like if you just skim through it really fast.

477
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Oh, wait, sometimes they say crew of Bacchus.

478
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
That must be some other.

479
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
This is not a really unhelpful Wikipedia.

480
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Crew of Bacchus is a New Orleans Mardi Gras super crew.

481
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
OK, well, if you explain what crew is first before.

482
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
But you look at the list and it's like Shatner, Gutenberg, Jackie Gleason, Phil Harris,

483
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
voice of Baloo, Henry Winkler, Glen Campbell, Gandolfini.

484
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's always.

485
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yeah, I don't want to spoil all of the names, but I've just noted this before that like,

486
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I don't know any materials we can find about who the king of Bacchus is.

487
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And anyway, I wonder if Belushi was one of those.

488
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I hope.

489
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Anyway, did that successfully pivot off of Generation X?

490
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I don't know. I don't know.

491
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Jason, Jason might explain more about the X-Men, though, I think to you.

492
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
We saved you.

493
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
The other big Marvel made for TV movie at the time was Nick Fury.

494
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I will be here for as a major.

495
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Saved Hasselhoff for you.

496
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
That does sound good.

497
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And this this kind of connected in like Fox in the 90s had these.

498
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
A lot of these made for TV movies, a lot of the magic specials we talked about.

499
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Alien autopsy.

500
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Sure, sure.

501
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
All right.

502
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Yeah, yeah.

503
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Fox 90s, I think, is proven to be in our.

504
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I think there was I think that I think we did.

505
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I think we said the things you're talking about,

506
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
but they were sandwiched in between talk of Chris Baccholo, Scott Lobdell.

507
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And I think at a certain point, that's like that wasn't an underlining generation.

508
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So Scott Lobdell, let's talk a little bit about Scott Lobdell before we explain

509
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
the basic tenets of what I think there was.

510
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yeah, I think I think we came a little later.

511
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
All these one. Yes.

512
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
But it was Jason's birthday, you know, and I can't pick that.

513
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So you gotta again, that's what I was saying.

514
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
That was one where I just backed off.

515
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm like, you know what?

516
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Not for me.

517
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You guys have your fun.

518
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Let Jason be the king of birthday Bacchus.

519
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Well, in Max Headroom, we called the shot Max Headroom episode next year.

520
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
OK, which I want to do.

521
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I've always been ambivalent about Max Headroom, but that's fine.

522
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I don't have specific content.

523
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
There's enough content there that there's got to be something.

524
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
As opposed to and I know that whenever I do this, this just only leads to the episode happening.

525
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But I started listening to Mike's credit card points with a lot of trepidation.

526
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And then I was like jump scared by things I wasn't even prepared for,

527
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:23,000
such as when Jason started talking about how he's been getting a lot of ads for Mama's Family Live for Vicki Lawrence as Mama in Las Vegas.

528
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And at this point, I am trembling.

529
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm like, Dear God, do not.

530
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
We've already we know that Madam's inevitable.

531
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I know this. I'm aware of this.

532
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But Mama Mama is a bridge to at some point.

533
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
This podcast has to be about things that are happening in this decade.

534
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Well, it is a show that's happening in the decade.

535
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Yeah, it was content.

536
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm not saying I'm ready to do it.

537
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm just saying it is a new at least it's new mama content.

538
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I watched a Vegas video recently and she was playing one of the station casinos, one of the bigger station casinos.

539
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
OK, good.

540
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
That doesn't mean we have to talk about Mama.

541
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
By the way, you are causing this nowhere on the episode.

542
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Did I even say we got to do Mama's episode?

543
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Like I was more of a haunting.

544
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I was being haunted by Mama.

545
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I really want to talk about the more we're going to end up.

546
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I know that I'm just going to cause it.

547
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:20,000
The thing and you and in that conversation, then Mike, you were saying how Madam is scary and that we avoid like mad.

548
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I my objection to Madam isn't remotely that Madam is scary.

549
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
My objection to Madam is that Madam sucks and Mama sucks about five times more.

550
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
That is some old out decrepit unfunny shit.

551
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It wasn't funny then.

552
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
We can not guys.

553
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You're we are not arguing to do it.

554
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
You're the one causing it.

555
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Now it's I guess we have like it's making me closer to wanting to do it.

556
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I thought I never argued that we should do Mama.

557
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I walk right into it.

558
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I guess I don't exist.

559
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
All right.

560
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I have to stay.

561
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
But it's but I look I've been tasked to talk about things.

562
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
No, I understand that.

563
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I should I should go back to this is what bigger fish to fry.

564
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
You're hearing things in these episodes that didn't exist.

565
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You're you're like, I don't want to do Mama.

566
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And if you go back and listen, we never women show half Mama, half Vicki Lawrence.

567
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
They got Mama covered.

568
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I disagree.

569
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
This is not a I don't believe this for one second.

570
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I think I think I feel like you're listening to Mama and your little gears are turning well.

571
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Mama shaped gears.

572
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
There's other things, though, that we said on these episodes.

573
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Let's do another. Let's do that.

574
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Let's do that. There was no time when he said, Mama, maybe I think I chuckled that we moved on.

575
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I don't think I ever said.

576
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Well, then maybe my objection is Mama coming up at all.

577
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I think that's what I've only added more.

578
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I realize that's what I do.

579
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Some of this is going to be about me processing and me learning.

580
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
That's fine. I'm just saying that if things get that things, probably a lot of things did just fly under the radar without me.

581
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Yeah.

582
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And then I come and I put a spotlight on them like as if like on prison prisoners trying to escape.

583
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Clunk clunk. Right.

584
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And now like now everyone's aware of it.

585
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And then now you're talking about Mama.

586
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I forgot that we talked about Vicki Lawrence and Mama.

587
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I know I don't dislike Vicki Lawrence, but I don't care about Mama.

588
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
That's the problem. If you don't dislike Mama already, then we're not we're not operating at a good level.

589
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
There's plenty of old characters from the old days that I don't care necessarily about at all.

590
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
But now I'm like, oh, maybe something here with this Mama thing.

591
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
He's really upset about it.

592
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Then we got it. All right.

593
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
OK, then moving on.

594
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
The rules of the Streisand effect have to take place.

595
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
We've said Streisand only made problems.

596
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
What was her problem? Was it about having was that about having a mall in her house?

597
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
No, no, no. What was the Streisand?

598
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
What caused the Streisand effect?

599
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
It was some sort of like gossipy thing, I think.

600
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And she just kept saying, I don't want to talk about that or like was trying to get lawyers to go.

601
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And it just made it more and more public.

602
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
This is me.

603
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I had an email open to an attorney to sign a cease and desist to get to make sure Mama was never talked about on the show.

604
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
We're seeing Mama so much now that the phones are hearing us.

605
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Then I'm going to start getting Mama and Vicki Lawrence stuff more so than already I would get.

606
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Listeners, by the way, it's Christmas.

607
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,000
If you have been taken by your family or someone in your family.

608
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Wait, someone in your family got or gave tickets to Mama Vicki Lawrence, a two woman show.

609
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Please let us know.

610
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I looked at it. I think this is way in the past.

611
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I think this occurred in September.

612
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I know who's still going.

613
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I thought it would run for like five years.

614
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You are correct. All the listeners will start getting pop up ads.

615
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Jason is so behind on his email.

616
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
He's getting four month old Vicki Lawrence ticket on sale.

617
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I know that like Jason has 16,000 unread emails or something to where you can't find your work email.

618
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
How many work emails are you getting?

619
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Well, you guys are forever dog rats, but I've started everyone.

620
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
This is almost no email.

621
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I know I deleted one of them accidentally when I was trying to clean.

622
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
You get two work emails a month and you deleted half of them.

623
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Yeah.

624
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I see six dates for Vicki Lawrence on the books here.

625
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
January, March and April and April and May and one in Branson in May.

626
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
So she is still doing this show.

627
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And I again, I don't want to do it.

628
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I don't. I had no interest in it.

629
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And look, there is a way where you mean not liking something does not have to cause you liking it.

630
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
That is not how this has to work.

631
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm just saying there's a feeling now.

632
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Maybe there's something there.

633
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
We know where this is going.

634
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
This is a Batman Joker situation.

635
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
We know this dance.

636
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
We know this dance.

637
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
We do.

638
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I guess.

639
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I guess we do.

640
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Luckily, the rules are I can't kill you.

641
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
What if Bugman doesn't show up?

642
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Can we book Vicki Lawrence on this Club 3?

643
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
What about Vicki Lawrence does whatever she wants on Club 3?

644
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Let's get the next month, January.

645
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Who wants Vicki Lawrence to get booked on Club 3?

646
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'll do my best.

647
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It might be more likely that it happens.

648
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Yeah, sure.

649
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Just if the money is right.

650
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
OK, look, I already fucked up.

651
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And I've already talked about a lot of things that are past the first thing that I wanted to talk about.

652
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Because before I even knew there was going to be this episode.

653
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And thank you, CL and Kelly.

654
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Thanks for voting for this so that I can stretch out with this.

655
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
But when there wasn't going to be this episode, there is one word that has been echoing in my head for months.

656
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And I knew when I came back, I had to say the word and ask more questions about the word.

657
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Immersive.

658
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Storytelling.

659
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
No, the word is cookieing.

660
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
We need to talk about cookieing, gentlemen.

661
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:44,000
This was in the episode about this year's Halloween haunts and such with Justin Michael and Marissa Strickland,

662
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
who were eventually permitted to talk after nine minutes about mozzarella.

663
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
The Toe Boys do that all the time.

664
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
They make you sweat like that.

665
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
A lot of podcasts do that.

666
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I guess it isn't unprecedented.

667
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It's not what we do.

668
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And these are good friends of ours.

669
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
That's why I felt comfortable making them wait.

670
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You shut them out at one point.

671
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You slammed the door down on them.

672
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Well, Jason and I were talking.

673
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
We had important stuff to finish before we brought them in.

674
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
They couldn't have participated in the mozzarella poll conversation.

675
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Here's what, Jason and I lock in now, especially these last few weeks.

676
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
We're locking, we have a thing going.

677
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I can't have that interrupted sometimes by a guest.

678
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It's sort of like jazz, right, Mike?

679
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Yeah, in a lot of ways when we lock in, it's like jazz.

680
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
He plays the notes that I don't play.

681
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
He fills it in.

682
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
This is something, maybe I should just dive into,

683
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
this will just be an all out of order kind of episode.

684
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Sure, go ahead.

685
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Because what you were saying has provoked,

686
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
this is a very specific thing that I've been thinking the whole time I was gone,

687
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
and especially in all the feedback, all the feedback that I've seen,

688
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
like what I've heard from you guys,

689
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
things that I've seen in the listener feedback,

690
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
things that guests have said.

691
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It's like jazz.

692
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Yes, so many people, everyone is saying that this is like jazz.

693
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
No, what is being said is this,

694
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
and I alluded to this in the episode with Kyle,

695
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
but this has been the theme of the whole thing for me,

696
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
is Scott hates tangents.

697
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
This is a, I will say a myth,

698
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
a myth that has been propagated in the time that I leave for one second,

699
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
and then this false rumor about me gets started,

700
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
that Scott is so buttoned up.

701
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
He needs, Scott, the guy who several times has planted a monster in the room

702
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
to come in and yell at Mike about getting off of deal accounts.

703
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
No, Scott, the guy who tries to turn the episode into a full time

704
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Jay Leno, Helen Kushnick podcast.

705
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Scott is so, he's just so buttoned up, you see,

706
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
and he doesn't let the guys explore.

707
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
He doesn't cut them, he's got them both on leashes,

708
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
and finally they're able, and jazz did occur to me,

709
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
because when I hear tangent, that is what I think.

710
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I hear tangent and I think, wild, just free form, improvisational,

711
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
do whatever you want, go wild,

712
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
and I'm like, so do people regard me as like,

713
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
it's the 1920s and I'm a nightclub owner,

714
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
and I've hired two musicians to entertain the folks tonight,

715
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
but there's rules, there's rules.

716
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
In order to get your check, here's what you must do.

717
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
You must play all of the notes here on this sheet,

718
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
and nothing more.

719
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
No solos.

720
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Dude, yes, no solos.

721
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Perhaps if I point to you and I deign to give you a solo,

722
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
then you can have one,

723
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
but your job tonight is to play the notes as written,

724
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
because how things will go haywire if not,

725
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
and then the show begins and then,

726
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
what is this, what is this music that I'm hearing?

727
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Jazz, you say?

728
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
This is too wild for my ears, my ears are burning,

729
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I cannot handle this, this is too experimental avant-garde for me.

730
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
But then, so I, and maybe the answer is,

731
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
is this how you, first of all,

732
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
is this square with your feelings?

733
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Am I the nightclub owner not letting you go,

734
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
go buck wild?

735
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
What it is really is that you're the owner,

736
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
and you will let us, like say you'll let us solo,

737
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
you'll let us play a song in the key of A,

738
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
you'll let us play in the key of C,

739
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
you'll let us play in the key of J,

740
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
like JB, JB Lushy, that's a thing we can do.

741
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Here's the thing though, sorry, finish your point.

742
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm just saying, but then there'll be certain scales

743
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
that we're not allowed to play in,

744
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
certain things that are like,

745
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
they feel too unpleasant to your ear,

746
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
maybe minor scales.

747
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Look, I don't want, first of all, let me say,

748
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I don't want to limit the notes,

749
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I don't want to dictate the scale that we're doing,

750
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
but if we have said that the point of tonight's performance

751
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
is songs in the key of C.

752
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Right, but maybe, you know what,

753
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
what it'll be is if we're playing in the key

754
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
of generation of X, we're playing in the key of X,

755
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
you say that solo can probably be 45 seconds,

756
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
but if we're playing in the key of JB, JB Lushy,

757
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
that solo probably can be three minutes, four minutes,

758
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
five, and of course, playing in the key of J,

759
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
that solo, as long as you,

760
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
that can be a fish concert length solo,

761
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
20 minutes, 25 minutes.

762
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
By J, you mean the key of J-A-Y.

763
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
J-A-Y, of course, yes, Jay Leno.

764
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Yes, okay.

765
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
So that solo can be a long solo.

766
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I see, I see.

767
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So that's really what the parameters are.

768
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Not that I feel so restricted by that, that's fine.

769
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Well, first of all, I'm no boss of this.

770
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I cannot, the only thing that's gonna happen

771
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
is that I am gonna tune out when it's things

772
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
that I'm not particularly,

773
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
because this is just to keep with the jazz metaphor.

774
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I hear this, and if that's the feeling,

775
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
then I acknowledge this and I understand this,

776
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
but then here's what happens is that I listen to the jazz.

777
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Okay, let's hear Miles and Coltrane rip here.

778
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Okay, here we go, headphones on, and what is it?

779
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Now, I use the My Panda Points Panda Express app,

780
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
but I don't care for the evaluation of the panda points.

781
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I think that for 90 panda points,

782
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
you should get a medium orange chicken,

783
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
not cream cheese rangoons.

784
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Well, now, that's when you're supposed to be listening

785
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
to the notes we're not playing.

786
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I would happily listen to the notes you're not playing.

787
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
That sounds great.

788
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Do you know what I'm saying, though,

789
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
that the notion that like, oh, Scott Gurr with his tangents,

790
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
let the boys cook, and then I hear the cooking,

791
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
and the cooking will be my other...

792
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
But the cooking to another person,

793
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
when we're talking about Jay Leno for the 50th time,

794
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
would be, what do these guys care about Jay Leno?

795
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
He's been off the Tonight Show forever.

796
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
This is fair.

797
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Panda points, certainly mundane topic,

798
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
but is certainly the listener can feel that this is a conversation

799
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Jason and I would have off mic.

800
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I think there was some idea that we were doing points

801
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
and talking about it, like, oh, man, we're getting early.

802
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Get Scott with this.

803
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
This is just what he and I talk about.

804
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
This is what we want to talk about.

805
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Also, direct democracy told us to talk about that.

806
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Well, direct democracy did tell us to talk about it.

807
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
That's true.

808
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Well, as direct democracy swung the other way.

809
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And you saw how many people love points.

810
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I did.

811
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
People love points.

812
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Yes.

813
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Well, and this is what leaves me in a strange situation,

814
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
that here I am thinking, but like, you know,

815
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
because when you say it's the kind of thing we talk about off mic,

816
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I'm like, yeah, I know.

817
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
That's why I'm worried about it.

818
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And now you have done the full off mic conversation on mic

819
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
and I cannot remotely hide behind the fact

820
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
this was a very well received episode.

821
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I acknowledge this.

822
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I can't deny this.

823
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I was not like cocksure about this being very popular.

824
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
This was when I was putting this together, I went, oh, ha ha.

825
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
That's funny.

826
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Somebody said something about credit card points

827
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
and my points in general.

828
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Let's put that on the list.

829
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I thought that was headed for number five as far as voting.

830
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I was shocked at that one.

831
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I was shocked that every other, I said it on the episode,

832
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
every other topic, I was like, oh, that's one of those is going to win.

833
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
You could explain to a lay person.

834
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Right. I said that you pulled someone off the street

835
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
and that wouldn't sound interesting to probably a normal person.

836
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And obviously maybe to other people, it wasn't interesting.

837
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
But, but to the podcast, the Ride listeners who have been listening,

838
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
many people, you know, are having similar brains

839
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
and thought processes to Jason and I.

840
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
So it isn't surprising to me that a number of our listeners

841
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
also seem to be preoccupied with the idea of points in general.

842
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Yes.

843
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
So I understand what you're saying.

844
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
But I also now in hindsight, of course, points was popular.

845
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Of course people want to hear points talk

846
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
and want to hear more points talk going forward.

847
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Well, this is where this and this is where I have a plan.

848
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And frankly, this is what I was going to build to.

849
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
But maybe we can, we can go, we can go back and kind of like skitter

850
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
scatter through other things that I, because obviously, yeah,

851
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
the big, the big way that the differences came to a head was the points episode.

852
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And at this point, with this point, with the reception of the points episode,

853
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I am left to, I almost feel bad that I have been holding YouTube back,

854
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
that I've been holding the audience back.

855
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And it's, and in fact, it's like the main thing that like I,

856
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
it was, this is a little experiment, right?

857
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I leave for the longest stretch of time since we started the podcast

858
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
and what happens immediately.

859
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It's talk about apps and points.

860
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
You're talking about mozzarella planks and all that.

861
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
It's the first thing you do when I'm gone.

862
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
It's a runner through all of it, all culminating in one giant points episode.

863
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I had no idea what a biological need this was for you guys.

864
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
How like strong the torrent of desire was to talk about points and apps.

865
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
And apparently that the listener has.

866
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:56,000
But this, the God himself came together to give us the venue to do apps and points,

867
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
both topics not chosen by us.

868
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
True, true.

869
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
The Lord Almighty, whatever you believe, maybe you believe in multiple gods.

870
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
If you just believe in the idea of the universe.

871
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
The world gave us a sign.

872
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
The universe told us, told you to do this.

873
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Converged.

874
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And taught me a lesson.

875
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I saw, look, I shouldn't even say it now.

876
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I saw American Idiot.

877
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
What?

878
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I saw the musical.

879
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Whoa.

880
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I was prepared.

881
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I thought this is fucking winning.

882
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I'm see, and I, this was all coming together.

883
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I know.

884
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I thought God was going to bless us with that.

885
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
You're like, I have to, I have to see American Idiot.

886
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
The listener is sure to force me to, I guess I better go to American Idiot.

887
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
That was something that was, that's coming.

888
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
American Idiot is coming.

889
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
That is something we didn't get to.

890
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And it's coming when you least suspect it.

891
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I'll say that right now.

892
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Oh my God.

893
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I saw it.

894
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I have thoughts on it, but I thought that was winning.

895
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But no, points and apps, app chosen by Jessica McKenna, points chosen by the listeners.

896
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
They desired, the other people desired.

897
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And finally Jason and I were to let it all out.

898
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
We finally, but that wasn't our decision.

899
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And it's kind of beautiful when you put it that way.

900
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Right.

901
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And that's why I'm not here to criticize and to butt heads on this.

902
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Right.

903
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Because I've, like it's something that I can't run from, that I have to acknowledge.

904
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And I've been thinking how this does kind of fit into a like relationship structure that I think might be helpful in guiding us forward.

905
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I feel like, you know, seven years we've been doing this.

906
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
That's a while.

907
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
That'd be a healthy amount of time for a marriage.

908
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:40,000
And imagine if, imagine a marriage where that is, that's rock solid, where everything's going great.

909
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And you know, you came together over shared interests and that was the original bond.

910
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And things have only blossomed and grown.

911
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And you've had a lot of fun in those seven years.

912
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
But something has kind of risen to the surface.

913
00:42:51,000 --> 00:43:02,000
And that is that one of the partners has certain needs, desires, predilections, you might say, that the other partner does not share.

914
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Right.

915
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Just for, just to, you know, just as a random example, let's say that one of the partners in the marriage has a strong interest in inflatable stuff.

916
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Right.

917
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It's popping.

918
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Right.

919
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And maybe the other partner is not so against it, not against it at all.

920
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Maybe even has a light interest in inflatable stuff.

921
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Right.

922
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:29,000
But the popping is just too, like ultimately, you know, the partner has to be true to themselves and say the popping is just not for me.

923
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And there will never be a point where I am into the popping.

924
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
That's just not where we started.

925
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And so I don't want this to be about popping.

926
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
That said, I see you and I respect you.

927
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And I know that you have this need.

928
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And I want to give you the freedom and a safe space to explore this interest, which is a perfectly healthy interest.

929
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
It's just not one that I share.

930
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Sure. Yeah.

931
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
And that's kind of how I feel with points.

932
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Because, look, there's things like American Idiot.

933
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I know the value that I can bring.

934
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I know that like sometimes it's kind of funny if I'm there and bristling and annoyed at what's happening.

935
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Points.

936
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I just I got nothing.

937
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I don't want to go anywhere near it.

938
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I'm not annoyed enough for it to be funny.

939
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I like I'm glad that you found this and I'm glad that the listener has responded.

940
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,000
But there will not come a time where I understand why points and apps are interesting to talk about on a podcast.

941
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
So that's why I am.

942
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Here's my proposal.

943
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
OK, go ahead.

944
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Topic hall passes.

945
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
This seems like, you know, very healthy thing to do in a marriage, I think.

946
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Oh, yeah, that really is.

947
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Is give hall.

948
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Let you explore.

949
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Go and have some freedom and then come back.

950
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
And then there isn't the resentment that you can't explore certain avenues.

951
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And this is what I'm saying.

952
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I want to when you guys are feeling the need, when you're feeling the urge, just say, Scott, I think it's time for a topic hall pass.

953
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
In an episode, not for a full episode.

954
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
No, for a full episode, I'm saying.

955
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Oh, you don't even have to guys.

956
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Guys, you don't even have to ask me if you are like, for example, Kohl's cash.

957
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Kohl's cash that like that is an episode like you guys.

958
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I want you to be happy.

959
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I want you to do this thing that you need and love to do.

960
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I don't want any part of Kohl's cash.

961
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
That's like popping to me.

962
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So don't even ask permission.

963
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
You guys get together in your own time.

964
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Do Kohl's cash.

965
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Get Wiger in if it feels good.

966
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I want you to have.

967
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I want you to be able to explore and be yourselves and and and and to not feel shame and judgment from me.

968
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Right. Go do Kohl's cash.

969
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
It's like I don't know.

970
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
How do you do this?

971
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Does it seem like a good plan?

972
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So points to is that a hall passage with Wiger?

973
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
You will.

974
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
You're saying you'll take you'll sit that one out.

975
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I think I set that one out.

976
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,000
OK, because then I'm because not only then then I'm I get the freedom to do it.

977
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I get the freedom to do something that I want to do, which is anything else but that.

978
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
You guys get the freedom of being able to talk without somebody button in.

979
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I realize something else about this, which is that, you know, a little thing that Erin and I have.

980
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
She loves The Bachelor.

981
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
She watches every season of Bachelor and Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise when they come out.

982
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
This is a rare activity that we do not share.

983
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And I've tried to find a way in.

984
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I'm like, maybe I'll watch.

985
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And you know what I'll do is I'll kind of like make snarky jokes about this as it goes.

986
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
And she's like, no, that's not what this is.

987
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
This is I watch this of all that this one's this isn't like watching a bad movie.

988
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
We watch this and it's pure.

989
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And that's what this is.

990
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And that's how I feel about this points thing.

991
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I don't think people want me button in and like and doing my little my little jaded buttons.

992
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I think I think you guys should be able to just just do it right.

993
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Hey, look, again, I'm going to let the universe decide.

994
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I don't even want to.

995
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I appreciate what you're saying.

996
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And I appreciate that you would say like, oh, I'll just I'll bud out because I feel like I would be a hindrance to the whole thing.

997
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
But I don't even want to leave it up to me.

998
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I want to leave it up to the universe.

999
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I want to let the God himself decide God themselves.

1000
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
So does that mean just points to have to get voted on?

1001
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:19,000
But listeners, I could even see a poll where it's points to with Scott points to without Scott.

1002
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And because then because then because I'm also thinking of the audience here, I want the audience to get what they want.

1003
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
And that's what you see what I'm saying.

1004
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
We're like, maybe my snark has a place in American Idiot.

1005
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I don't think it does in points to.

1006
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
But let's let them decide.

1007
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Well, I don't know if you want a precedent where the audience is voting on episodes with or without you.

1008
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I don't think that might be a good thing in general.

1009
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I'm not even because I know which way we'll go.

1010
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I just think that might start to be a bad precedent.

1011
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yeah, probably.

1012
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Probably.

1013
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Just a guess.

1014
00:47:51,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Just knowing how if I see one comment about an episode Jason and I did, I go, oh, it bumps me out for somebody's like, oh, these guys, I don't know about this episode.

1015
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I go, oh, no.

1016
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
How do you think I feel, Mike?

1017
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,000
How do you think I feel about the comments that people have already written based on what I've been doing for the last 15 minutes?

1018
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Look, I know this is a this is both a very popular episode and a lightning rod episode.

1019
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
That's what's going to happen with this episode.

1020
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Yeah, yeah.

1021
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Which, again, I'll say it was voted for.

1022
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
And also, it's Christmas.

1023
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
It's Christmas.

1024
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Do you have to be mean to the host of one of your favorite podcasts right now?

1025
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Come on, spirit of harmony, spirit of bug main.

1026
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I've also seen funny enough in these last so many weeks, I've seen both comments saying that Jason and I are out of control tangenting and seen comments saying we're more on topic than we are without you.

1027
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I've seen both both comments.

1028
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And I go, well, which is it?

1029
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I've also I've seen people say that what you've been doing without me is unhinged.

1030
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
The guys are unhinged.

1031
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Then I'll listen to things and I'm like, I've never heard anything more hinged in my life.

1032
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I'm talking about the quality of Wendy's lettuce.

1033
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
How is this unhinged?

1034
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Yeah, the Wendy's coming soon.

1035
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
The Wendy's lettuce got me on a doughboy's double to complete when.

1036
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Oh, that's great.

1037
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
He's expert.

1038
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Yeah, Wendy's expert.

1039
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Wendy's lettuce enjoyer.

1040
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Jason Sheridan.

1041
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Well, I was not alone necessarily.

1042
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Everyone had a lot to say about Wendy's.

1043
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Sure, I believe it.

1044
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
You mean them?

1045
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Of the hosts.

1046
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Of them.

1047
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Sure.

1048
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
But you know what?

1049
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
That's great.

1050
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
That is the perfect venue for that.

1051
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Maybe the perfect venue for points is the points, but the nasty little point boys podcast or whatever the hell you were saying.

1052
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
But you see how there is it like, you know, I started I entered into a theme park podcast.

1053
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I didn't enter into a points podcast.

1054
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:56,000
And I think it's fair to say that that's maybe that's like kind of outside of the bounds of what was originally discussed here.

1055
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,000
But if but if it's what people want to hear, then I just remove myself from the equation and then everybody's happy.

1056
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
That's what you want.

1057
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
That's fine.

1058
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
If you want to do that, I'm comfortable with that.

1059
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I think it is what I want.

1060
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I don't want to dictate that it is what that it's what you want.

1061
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
But I feel like it might be.

1062
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I think it might be.

1063
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I don't know.

1064
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I'm fine.

1065
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I'm comfortable.

1066
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I can roll with again.

1067
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I can roll with whatever it is.

1068
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And I look I think that I think that no matter who you talk to, you will find that points touch all of your life, everyone's life in different ways.

1069
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
So yes, here's OK.

1070
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Because another thing that struck me during all this, a lot of what you said about points are things that I do.

1071
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Like it was like a lot of it was about shore points.

1072
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
And I and it was like which I I checked my app.

1073
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I had a lot of I checked the app after that.

1074
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I realized I had enough for a regular sub.

1075
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Right. But not enough for a giant.

1076
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Not enough for a giant.

1077
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
No, which was a bummer, because obviously you want to split that giant up and save it for the next day.

1078
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Well, Jason, what are we talking about?

1079
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
It's a sandwich.

1080
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I agree with Jason on this.

1081
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Saving the sandwich the next day should be fine.

1082
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I sometimes a little way Mike's way, but that's going to be so fucking nasty.

1083
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
That is going to go.

1084
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
That's a sponge now.

1085
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I'm not a big Mike's way guy.

1086
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
But sometimes I add this question.

1087
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I'm not a big Mike's way guy.

1088
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
That's especially if it's like a giant.

1089
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I'm like, well, I'm going to.

1090
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Well, what?

1091
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I'm going to cobble this.

1092
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
So we get it.

1093
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Yes.

1094
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
You get it. Jason's way.

1095
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Usually, which is which is with the spread.

1096
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
That's what Hoagie's spread.

1097
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Yeah. Hoagie's spread.

1098
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Pepper, hot pepper spread.

1099
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Hot pepper spread.

1100
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And I like that spread.

1101
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
It's just I think it's not.

1102
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I think I always I it when I'm there and then I don't end up going to have it in the fridge.

1103
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Mike's way.

1104
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Sometimes it gets soaks into the bread the next day.

1105
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
It's almost even better.

1106
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
It's like a wet.

1107
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
It's a little wet.

1108
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
But you don't eat wet bread as much as I do.

1109
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I don't know.

1110
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Because like at Portillo's you get the beef and cheddar croissant and it's like the bread is kind of wet and it's good.

1111
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
And it's probably even better.

1112
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I get that in like I get that in like a French dip in the in the 10 minutes after it's been served.

1113
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Yeah.

1114
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
A next day giant.

1115
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I just don't see it's just not what I would do.

1116
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I don't know.

1117
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
But it doesn't mean I'm wrong.

1118
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Jay, you've never had a next day giant that was in Mike's way.

1119
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I think I've had like four hours later.

1120
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I didn't have time to finish my lunch.

1121
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So I just like wrapped it up and I don't like that.

1122
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I don't like a four hours later.

1123
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
So no, I think I think it would be fine.

1124
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
This is not to me.

1125
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
This is not a pizza next day situation.

1126
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I think I think Mike's Wade bread ends up nasty after the fact.

1127
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
But it's Mike.

1128
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
You know, again, I'm not here to dictate.

1129
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I've learned a lot about my opinions are not necessarily correct.

1130
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
They might be fully wrong.

1131
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
But this see what we just had here is interesting.

1132
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
It is an interesting little spark of a conversation.

1133
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
And that is the kind of thing you would bring to a points to episode.

1134
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:00,000
It's a strong opinion about having a day old Mike's Jersey Mike's Mike's way sub.

1135
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And that's kind of it.

1136
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
That's interesting.

1137
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
That's a new dynamic.

1138
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
And shore points are what we call the towns at the Jersey Shore.

1139
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
What sure point do you go to?

1140
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Oh, really?

1141
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Yeah.

1142
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
You didn't say that on the episode.

1143
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
That's interesting.

1144
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Yeah.

1145
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Let's sit and listen.

1146
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Wait, say that again.

1147
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Shore points are like the different towns.

1148
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Like, oh, what?

1149
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
You know, I give me an example.

1150
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Like Cape May or a barn again.

1151
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
So instead of saying like a little town or a city, you would say point.

1152
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
What sure point?

1153
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Yeah.

1154
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Oh, that's why it's called shore point.

1155
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I believe that is the point on the shore.

1156
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
It's word play.

1157
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Instead of city.

1158
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
It's the town.

1159
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
That is interesting.

1160
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Some people go to Wildwood.

1161
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Kind of interesting.

1162
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Some people go to Ocean City.

1163
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
See, and this is the thing about this is the thing that was the reason points the episode

1164
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,000
captured the imagination of so many people across the country and the world is that everybody

1165
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:59,000
does have opinions like you just exhibited that I don't want to eat a sub the next day.

1166
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
That's interesting that we all have little things we feel about fast food and points

1167
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
and the way we redeem.

1168
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Yeah.

1169
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
So everyone has a different redemption strategy.

1170
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And even if you're not thinking about it, which I think is your is your I don't want

1171
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
to say problem, but I was about to say problem.

1172
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Your problem with points is that these aren't you're not consciously thinking about your

1173
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
points use your fast food use and your all this stuff in general.

1174
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
But you do have opinions.

1175
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
You do have strategies.

1176
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
And are you saying that my opinions are valuable?

1177
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I am saying your opinions are valuable and interesting and probably reflect a lot of

1178
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
the listeners opinions as well.

1179
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
And I sometimes maybe if we can be criticized, Jason and I are on the same wavelength about

1180
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
a lot of things.

1181
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
That's something that I felt a lot is that like it becomes just a hive mind without me

1182
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
there.

1183
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
It's like one voice talking at the same time.

1184
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And then once in a while, he'll say something like my grandfather was ran security at a

1185
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
pencil factory.

1186
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
And then it will turn the voices off as far as unison.

1187
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And then I got no notes on that.

1188
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I got no I'll hear about the pencil factory.

1189
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I want to hear more.

1190
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I mean, this is maybe not the episode, but I want to hear.

1191
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I want you to dig in.

1192
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I got to figure this out because I am fast.

1193
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
And I think the pencil factory little nugget.

1194
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
A lot of people responded to.

1195
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And I am very curious.

1196
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Absolutely.

1197
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Here's the problem for me with the points stuff is that like I said, I use like, you

1198
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
know, like I'm on that.

1199
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I'm on that Starbucks app a lot.

1200
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I will definitely like right.

1201
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
You know, oh, OK, well, if I go four days in a row, maybe I can get my 50 stars.

1202
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Right.

1203
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,000
It would never in a million years occur to me that what I just said was a story worth

1204
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
telling on a podcast that people pay for.

1205
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Never.

1206
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
And if anything, I'm like, OK, if I'm learning that I'm wrong and that that thought is valuable

1207
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
that me said, like, like, is that allowed?

1208
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Like this whole time I've been thinking about how to keep things brisk and entertaining.

1209
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,000
And then it turns out that I could say so I got 86 stars right now.

1210
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
So I'm almost to 100 and then I can get a free iced tea.

1211
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Was that good?

1212
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
What I just did?

1213
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Well, when the discussion then rolls out into what your general strategy, what is the tea?

1214
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Do you ever add the extras?

1215
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Do you ever have the straw?

1216
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Like, because I sometimes you had strawberries to a drink.

1217
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I kind of think the points are too much.

1218
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Like when you start to expand on what you've just said, then it becomes interesting to

1219
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
a lot of people.

1220
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,000
And what I think also is that you clearly have just as many opinions and strategies

1221
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
as we do.

1222
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I do.

1223
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I've had a long I've just I've I've thought for a long time that those opinions are too

1224
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
boring to share.

1225
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Oh, that is where I've been coming from.

1226
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:41,000
And if this is everyone telling me to jump in the water and say all of these, I will.

1227
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
And then this all seems good.

1228
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
And this is progress.

1229
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I will say this should probably still be a podcast about theme parks, for Christ's sake.

1230
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Well, I agree with you.

1231
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
But the contradictions are too many to bear.

1232
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Like at this point, when you say it should be about theme parks, I agree with you.

1233
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
But there's too many examples of not being about theme parks.

1234
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Also, those little tricks and stuff.

1235
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Well, those little point tricks kind of these runs parallel to like, oh, OK, when I go to

1236
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
the park, try to get there really early, because then it's empty.

1237
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Then you do this first and you do this first.

1238
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Skip this.

1239
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Watch out for the parade.

1240
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
And what points?

1241
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I think points bond us together even stronger than theme parks, because you do points.

1242
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
You use points every week.

1243
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
People don't go to a theme park every weekend.

1244
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Do you mean us, like humanity?

1245
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Humanity.

1246
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
You mean people?

1247
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
People, yes.

1248
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
People on the globe, on the planet.

1249
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
So are you saying that if we, if the, I'm not, let's take we out of it.

1250
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Do you, if you two started the full Nasty Little Points Boys podcast, is that going

1251
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
to be, have we been wrong about theme parks?

1252
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Is that going to be the hundred times more popular, the way that you cash in, the way

1253
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
that you're big enough as a podcast now to have Trump and whoever runs against Trump

1254
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,000
next time on the show, to where like in four years you guys shape the election, because

1255
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Nasty Little Points Boys has become so much more popular than Podcast the Ride.

1256
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Jason's doing like a Tony Hinchcliffe.

1257
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Oh, it was good to say, no, we outpace Joe Rogan.

1258
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
We outpace Kill Tony, you know.

1259
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I think, I, yes, I mean, honestly, I think points is more of a universal topic than

1260
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,000
theme parks, probably by a factor of 50, 100, I'm not sure exactly, because I think

1261
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
people have a visceral, the people who love it, love it, but the people who don't are

1262
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
a little like, ah, what is, what's a point?

1263
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
But points, points and deals, people get behind.

1264
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Everybody loves deals.

1265
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Everybody loves points.

1266
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Everybody, I do, I do think that is what the attraction is about this specific topic.

1267
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Well, then what are you guys waiting for?

1268
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Go do Nasty Little Points Boys.

1269
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Maybe we will.

1270
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Again, I didn't think we were going to do it.

1271
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
This is all, this all happened to me.

1272
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I didn't choose this.

1273
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I chose some topics.

1274
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000
This, this points game chose me.

1275
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,000
So if there's a, if again, if the universe wants me to do a full points podcast with

1276
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Jay, fine, but it's got to choose me again.

1277
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I need another sign from the Almighty.

1278
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Well, okay.

1279
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I think this has to be outside of the poll.

1280
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Maybe another can, can the, well, this should just be a poll elsewhere is just this podcast

1281
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
happen.

1282
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
But now we're setting you up to like, this is a dangerous thing.

1283
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
We're setting you up to do a second podcast with Jason.

1284
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
No, I can't.

1285
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
You said that you want the universe to do it to you.

1286
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I know, but that's not just like, I have to be visited in a dream by three ghosts or

1287
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
something tonight.

1288
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Or like there has to be such a clear, or when I'm awake, let's that's okay.

1289
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
When I'm awake, I need to see a ghost dream.

1290
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I was going to say you're already as if you're not already dreaming about points.

1291
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Yeah.

1292
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I dream about, yeah, exactly.

1293
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,000
So I need to like on my way home, a ghost needs to appear in the car with me or something

1294
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:55,000
and then tell me his circadian rhythms are not consistent enough to hit three rims cycles

1295
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
where there would be three ghosts.

1296
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
You haven't gotten a three ghost sleep in years.

1297
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Yeah.

1298
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Right about that.

1299
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
That is true.

1300
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I barely, I barely dream.

1301
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Oh my God.

1302
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
My brain can't.

1303
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
My brain hasn't been able to like clean itself out in a long time.

1304
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I, Mike was involved in a dream I had recently in that I was looking at my phone and there

1305
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:29,000
was just a text from him that said 12 PM and I woke up with a start and I was trying to,

1306
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I thought it was real.

1307
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I thought I had fucked up.

1308
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
You were worried about being like missing a record or something.

1309
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Yeah, because I messed up the time on the Mazzotti episode and I never do that.

1310
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
So then I was super paranoid, double and triple checking on all the other ones.

1311
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I see.

1312
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,000
So it came into my dream where like Mike texted me, but in the dream it seemed like a threat

1313
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:57,000
or like a warning because he just texted 12 PM with nothing else.

1314
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
That's high noon.

1315
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Maybe I wanted to have a showdown with you.

1316
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Yeah, that's true.

1317
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Where we were going to sling a gun slinging or something.

1318
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Yeah.

1319
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Draw.

1320
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
We're going to have a draw basically.

1321
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
If that's where things had gone, like I leave for what, you know, seven episodes or something

1322
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
and like, oh my God, they got into a duel.

1323
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I guess the two of them didn't get along as well as I thought.

1324
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I think with that 12 PM, I think that's one of the ghosts.

1325
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
That was a haunting of Jason's brain.

1326
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I guess it has to be you, but I think that's Jason's brain getting incepted.

1327
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
That was a start time for the first episode of Nasty Little Points Boys.

1328
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Maybe.

1329
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Because note that I didn't get the time in my dream.

1330
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
That's true.

1331
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Yeah, that's true.

1332
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Well, we'll see.

1333
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
If there are two more ghostly signs, maybe it has to happen.

1334
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Okay.

1335
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Well, so that was approximately 20 minutes away, perhaps more from the initial thing

1336
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
that I want.

1337
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
A tangent, you might say.

1338
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Interesting.

1339
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
But on topic.

1340
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Yeah.

1341
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
On topic.

1342
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
On topic.

1343
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
All right, fine.

1344
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
On topic.

1345
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Doesn't count.

1346
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Not a tangent.

1347
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Doesn't count.

1348
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
So let me go back to the word that I said a while ago.

1349
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1350
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Because there's some other things to catch here.

1351
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Right.

1352
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
That is cookieing.

1353
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Cookieing was brought up as just the context here.

1354
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
And another thing that came up a lot was the notion that like Scott is screaming at his

1355
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
phone right now.

1356
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Yes, yes.

1357
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Right.

1358
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
When we can't place a fact or whatever it is.

1359
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
And I will say, Mike, you had a very good meter for that.

1360
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Yes.

1361
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Like when you said it was usually when I actually was.

1362
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,000
But one that was not flagged was the discussion of cookieing.

1363
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Okay, so you were in a maze, correct, Mike?

1364
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Yes.

1365
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Well, in a line to get into the maze.

1366
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Okay, okay.

1367
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,000
And when you suddenly felt grazed on the elbow by a stranger.

1368
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Probably a teen, but yes.

1369
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
By a teen, you say.

1370
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I'm guessing.

1371
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
A teen cookieed you.

1372
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
And this is said, and then that phrase doesn't make any sense to me.

1373
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Right.

1374
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:08,000
And then you further explain the phrase that this is something that Jason would do backstage

1375
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
in the old improv days.

1376
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
And that this might be accompanied with the line, hello cookie.

1377
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
It would be accompanied.

1378
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Well, yeah.

1379
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I mean, rehearsals.

1380
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
We were always goofing.

1381
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Jason's house.

1382
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
We would be doing rehearsals.

1383
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
That sent shivers down my spine when you did that.

1384
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Yeah, I was saying I was just being a nasty little creep and would make everyone laugh.

1385
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
So that was the point of it was to be, that was like a.

1386
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Just being a little weirdo.

1387
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
A bit of a creepy man.

1388
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
He would take his two fingers, okay.

1389
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I always thought three.

1390
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Oh, would you do three?

1391
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Okay, well he's the expert.

1392
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Cookie.

1393
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Yeah, no, explain the position of cookie.

1394
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
The first three fingers, including the thumb.

1395
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:57,000
And then as if he was examining like a diamond, sort of like turning it around in his three

1396
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,000
fingers, he would put those three fingers on your elbow and then kind of turn a little

1397
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
bit and say, hello cookie.

1398
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
And then we called, so we started calling a cookie.

1399
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Yeah, it was just like nonsense improv practice bits where it's like, yeah, explaining this

1400
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:19,000
to a human or a civilian will sound totally insane.

1401
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
It scared me.

1402
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
It scared me so much when you did it just now.

1403
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
The gesture is weird.

1404
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,000
If the listener could see these gestures and then mixed with that voice, oh my God, which

1405
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I guess.

1406
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
So again, if the intention was to be a creepy bit, then mission accomplished.

1407
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Yeah.

1408
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Do you want to come on over?

1409
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Do you want a cookie?

1410
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Oh dear God, I do not.

1411
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Oh, how much do I not want a cookie?

1412
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I think you should get cookie down the show, honestly.

1413
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I think you should get cookie.

1414
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Next stage show, baby.

1415
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:51,000
That'll throw, if you come to a Puck has the Ride live show and I'm like, hey, welcome

1416
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
to, my name's Sam, fuck no, it's not my name.

1417
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,000
If I'm really off, then you know that I just got cookie backstage.

1418
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
You got cookie backstage by Jason.

1419
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I think what, I mean, we're also in the bit realm territory, I guess, but it just reminded

1420
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,000
me so much of there's one, this was, this might've been said six years ago.

1421
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I don't know, but it has never left my brain.

1422
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And that was the, and this is, I think a close cousin to that.

1423
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:27,000
And this is when, because Mike and Lindsay are what, like seven months older than Jason,

1424
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:35,000
that that was enough of an age gap for Jason to frequently say, hello, mommy and daddy.

1425
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Jesus Christ.

1426
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:42,000
They just got their shit together for a certain I did, you know, respectful.

1427
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
It was respectful in my world was like an erotic thing.

1428
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Let's be honest.

1429
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
That's the thing.

1430
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
The tone is very, yes.

1431
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Right.

1432
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Hello, mommy and daddy.

1433
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Yeah.

1434
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
It was like a sexual thing.

1435
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Oh, I assure you.

1436
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
No, no, no, no.

1437
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Yeah.

1438
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
You don't have to assure me.

1439
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
I assume.

1440
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I know.

1441
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I know.

1442
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I get no matter how much a shirt, Michael never changes his mind.

1443
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Yeah.

1444
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Hello, mommy and daddy.

1445
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
He said it multiple times too.

1446
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
And I think he would say it to me and other people.

1447
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Like Marissa and I would like call mommy and daddy or something.

1448
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Like he would do that to other people as well.

1449
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
That's my thing.

1450
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
That's my memory.

1451
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I'm pretty sure.

1452
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I'm just always McGooing it through life, you know.

1453
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Mr. McGoo would not call people mommy and daddy.

1454
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Well, if you couldn't see them very well.

1455
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
You might think they were.

1456
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Mr. McGoo was old.

1457
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
His parents were dead.

1458
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
We don't know that.

1459
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
We don't know that.

1460
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
We don't know that.

1461
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Mr. McGoo may have had alive 127 year old parents.

1462
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:42,000
And if he thought he was seeing them, but was in fact running into a construction worker

1463
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,000
at the end of a beam that he climbed on, then he might say, hello mommy and daddy.

1464
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:52,000
How much sadder would the Mr. McGoo cartoons have been if not only was he blind, he was so out of it.

1465
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
He thought his parents were still alive.

1466
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
It's a totally different tone.

1467
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
That was a whimsical cartoon.

1468
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I mean, probably, you know, it wouldn't make it now of an old man who couldn't see.

1469
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
And that's the whole bit.

1470
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
But also he's losing his mind.

1471
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I've never watched a live action.

1472
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
There was Leslie Nielsen McGoo movie, right?

1473
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Yes.

1474
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Yeah, I've never watched that.

1475
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
You say that as if you know that's not good.

1476
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
You say that with curiosity.

1477
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I'm curious.

1478
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
What were you just doing that with?

1479
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,000
There was another movie that was a like clearly 90s piece of trick.

1480
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
You're like, I'm curious though.

1481
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Maybe.

1482
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Coneheads?

1483
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Probably.

1484
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
You've never seen coneheads?

1485
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Coneheads is a real mixed bag.

1486
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
It has its moments, but it has its...

1487
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Look, I like a lot of Dan Aykroyd's work.

1488
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
This man should not be shirtless.

1489
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
This man should not be mostly naked in things.

1490
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Same with Billy Crystal in Oscar's openings.

1491
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,000
A couple of shows, a couple of movies where Dan Aykroyd's shirtless, I feel like.

1492
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Or in like, Exit to Eden?

1493
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Is it Exit to Eden or East of Eden?

1494
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
You might be right. I'm not sure.

1495
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
I think it's Exit, but I could be wrong.

1496
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Doesn't matter.

1497
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Jason, don't be curious about that one.

1498
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I wouldn't even watch Exit to Eden.

1499
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
The one where Dan Aykroyd...

1500
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
It's a sex thing.

1501
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
It's a sex movie.

1502
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
He should watch it.

1503
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Which one?

1504
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Isn't it Exit to Eden?

1505
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I watched Exit to Eden.

1506
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
It has cooking in it.

1507
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Exit to Eden, yeah, 1994.

1508
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
And they're like in...

1509
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Rosie O'Donnell and Dan Aykroyd, they like are cops.

1510
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
They go undercover like as an S&M thing or something.

1511
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
How could this possibly have ended up being the poster?

1512
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
I've never seen it.

1513
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
How do you put that on the poster and think anyone will see this?

1514
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I don't know.

1515
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Directed by Gary Marshall.

1516
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
It is?

1517
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
What in the world?

1518
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
I never knew that.

1519
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Geez.

1520
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Well, maybe Exit to Eden, second gate next year.

1521
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Yeah, good idea.

1522
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Let's do it.

1523
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
A-okay, Mike.

1524
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Is there a flying check tackled Gary Marshall yet?

1525
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I feel like that's a big undertaking.

1526
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
That'd be an interesting one.

1527
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Yeah.

1528
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Although by the time you get to Valentine's Day...

1529
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Oh, you got to do all the days.

1530
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
How much are the days going to be?

1531
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Here's the thing that really has happened a couple times while you were gone.

1532
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I don't want to hijack this, but I brought up Country Bears again

1533
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
because any time we watch something, I feel like Jason goes,

1534
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I think this is pretty good.

1535
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
The only time he's ever not liked something was Country Bears.

1536
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I know.

1537
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
It just hit wrong.

1538
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
It just hit bad.

1539
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I got to go back.

1540
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I'm so mad.

1541
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I got to give it another chance.

1542
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
You haven't given a bad review to any piece of media, I feel like, in years

1543
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
other than the Country Bears.

1544
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Dinosaur was walked out on that one.

1545
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
But that's a long time ago.

1546
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
When did that come out?

1547
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Like nine years ago?

1548
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Ten years ago?

1549
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I'm just saying when we've been talking about stuff on the podcast.

1550
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Oh, when we've been doing the show.

1551
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Yeah.

1552
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
I was going to say let Jason watch Exit Teen, but he's going to love it.

1553
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
He's going to say it's great.

1554
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Have you seen this poster before?

1555
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Do you recognize them in S&M gear?

1556
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I don't recognize that poster.

1557
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I feel like the premise is more familiar.

1558
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I found that the key to some of the Jason movie opinions is like, did he see the

1559
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
poster when he was in a good mood after buying a comic?

1560
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
That is true.

1561
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
How could you like this movie?

1562
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Well, I had just gotten pizza.

1563
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Yeah, I was having a great time.

1564
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
We've got to sort of have a really great day for Jason and then have a bunch of

1565
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Country Bears.

1566
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Oh, that's true.

1567
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Have I told the Conehead action figure story?

1568
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Doesn't sound familiar.

1569
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Not recently.

1570
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
So I did get you Conehead action figures for Christmas one year.

1571
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I got you Beldar.

1572
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Thank you, yeah.

1573
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:34,000
When they came in the mail, he said, hello, Beldar and Primat.

1574
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Hello, French mommy and daddy.

1575
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I have a very clear memory of this one old historic department store in Ocean State,

1576
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
New Jersey was closing down stands.

1577
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
The space is now a co-op with little vendors and stuff.

1578
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
And it's very charming and it's great for the community.

1579
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:03,000
But when the department store was closing down, they had like all of these clearance

1580
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
things.

1581
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:10,000
They had just every department and the clearance in the toy department was just a

1582
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,000
wall of Conehead's figures and they could not get rid of them to save their life.

1583
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
What year are we talking?

1584
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
When did the movie come out?

1585
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
92.

1586
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:24,000
So this would have been probably 93, possibly 94.

1587
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:31,000
So just in no way it was, I don't think it was still open for a year or two in the

1588
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
mid 90s.

1589
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
But I just remember.

1590
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Did you buy them?

1591
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
No, I didn't.

1592
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I never bought any.

1593
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
So the story is that they were discounting figures?

1594
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
They could not get rid of them.

1595
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I didn't know.

1596
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I didn't want them.

1597
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I didn't know anything about the Coneheads.

1598
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
You should have bought them at least.

1599
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
There would have been a good finish to the story.

1600
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I guess.

1601
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I think we bought puzzles.

1602
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Coneheads puzzles?

1603
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Huh?

1604
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Coneheads puzzles?

1605
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
No.

1606
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Oh.

1607
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Now I'm settling back into some of the joy that I had when I was listening and I got

1608
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,000
to just hear Mike clarify what was the story.

1609
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,000
This was one that was kind of on my list and this is maybe, this is like a, I'm going

1610
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
to give you a big chance here, a stage.

1611
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,000
We tread these boards and I just want to hear you say it.

1612
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
This is from, what was the episode?

1613
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Tivoli Gardens with the Pell.

1614
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Can you tell us the story in a rapturing way of what happened to you at Excalibur?

1615
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
This story is better than this Conehead story though.

1616
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I will say that.

1617
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
There's something there at least.

1618
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I've only ever been to Excalibur once.

1619
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Okay.

1620
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
It was very dirty.

1621
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I waited in a line trying to get rewards like free play.

1622
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Watched.

1623
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
From the app, from the My Vegas app?

1624
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
This is not going to help the story.

1625
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
No, it's just color.

1626
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
There's color to it.

1627
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
It's adding color.

1628
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
You're trying to sell me on the story, Mike.

1629
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
He's treading the boards.

1630
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I'm not out of the story.

1631
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I'm helping him tread the boards.

1632
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
He is helping.

1633
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I am not a high roller.

1634
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I don't go to Vegas very often.

1635
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
But you love to gamble.

1636
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I do love to gamble.

1637
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Guys, this is hurting the story.

1638
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I'm helping.

1639
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
You are absolutely not helping.

1640
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
You wanted an engaging background.

1641
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
No, I wanted Jason to tell the story without Mike making it about points.

1642
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I'm painting a picture with words.

1643
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Great.

1644
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I know.

1645
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
I want you to do it, not Mike.

1646
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Here we go.

1647
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Go ahead.

1648
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
2021.

1649
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Okay.

1650
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:23,000
A mast recently reinstated in Clark County.

1651
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Mast indoors.

1652
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
We're all wearing masts.

1653
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
What's the population of Clark County though?

1654
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I don't know.

1655
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Say the name of the airport.

1656
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
That's something you like to say a lot.

1657
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Well, it was McCarran for many years and then it became Harry Reid.

1658
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
But people still call it McCarran.

1659
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
We are treading these boards now.

1660
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
So then what happened?

1661
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
We're all wearing masts.

1662
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
We're standing in this player's club line.

1663
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
N95s?

1664
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Huh?

1665
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
N95 masts?

1666
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I think it was just, we were doing surgical masts at the time.

1667
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Those don't work.

1668
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
We didn't know that at the time.

1669
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I'm just, all right, just continue.

1670
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
No bug main.

1671
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I'm voting for Mike's mask opinions.

1672
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
What kind of masks was Mike wearing in 2021?

1673
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Do people want to hear about my Fauci takes?

1674
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Everything's only like half open.

1675
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
There's kind of some crowds watching the Olympics.

1676
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
People are starting to have fun again.

1677
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Anyway, we're all masks.

1678
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Who was the president again?

1679
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
How soon was January 6th in the rear view?

1680
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I guess it would have been a few months.

1681
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
So everybody, we're all recovering.

1682
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
We're saying, let's make sure this never happens again

1683
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
with no clue what future we were headed for.

1684
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Fully vaccinated at that point.

1685
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
So we're all in this line of masks.

1686
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,000
And then there's a couple of like a 20 year old,

1687
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:46,000
like kind of skeezy looking guy and a much older woman

1688
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,000
with blonde and purple braids,

1689
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
just like full on make it out this line.

1690
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,000
And it's just a very strange sight to see.

1691
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
And we were in this line for a while

1692
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
and we got to the front of it and they said,

1693
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
oh, I'm sorry, sir, you've cleaned all your awards

1694
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
for this trip.

1695
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Now the story is taking a turn

1696
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
where the story is not about the purple.

1697
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Because I feel like when first told, the story was,

1698
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
I saw people kissing in a line.

1699
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Yes.

1700
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Is the story about the points?

1701
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
No, well, he's just adding color I think at that point.

1702
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
I'm adding color.

1703
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I'm trying my best.

1704
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I'm just Magoo-ing it.

1705
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I can't do a Scott Free story with Scott here.

1706
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Let me tell you, I'm going to steal a Tom Sharpling thing

1707
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
right now.

1708
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
I'm going to steal the Limp Pet Shuttle right now.

1709
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
This guy came up with Scott Free

1710
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
and he was so pleased with himself at that invention.

1711
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
And he was so excited.

1712
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
He didn't even realize it was Ridley Scott's production.

1713
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Every time.

1714
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I was shocked when I saw Glitter.

1715
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
That was a very good Sharpling.

1716
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Yeah, thanks.

1717
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Now I feel, okay, I don't know.

1718
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
That was one that I was listening to

1719
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
and like Mike in the episode,

1720
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
I was kind of confused as to why it was a story.

1721
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
It was a very just startling image

1722
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
as everyone around you is wearing masks

1723
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
and set this one May-December couple

1724
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
and they're just going to town on each other.

1725
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Jason was horrified by their love.

1726
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Show me your marriage license.

1727
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I think it's interesting.

1728
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
What I like about the detail is that the purple hair

1729
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
always comes into it.

1730
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
So the purple hair scared you on some level.

1731
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Seeing a senior citizen with very long,

1732
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:39,000
half blonde, half purple hair, like braids.

1733
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
That is very strange.

1734
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I would pay $500 to see a picture of this woman

1735
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
to see how old she was.

1736
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I bet she was 50.

1737
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Yeah, do you have a guess on the age?

1738
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
I would say 60.

1739
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
60 is not senior citizen, I wouldn't say.

1740
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Not quite.

1741
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Well, you can join the AARP at 50.

1742
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I've been checking.

1743
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Let's go over the women.

1744
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
This podcast is going to go long enough

1745
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
that both of you are talking about the benefits

1746
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
of the AARP protocol.

1747
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
It's entirely possible.

1748
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Absolutely.

1749
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
As soon as we are eligible,

1750
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
we will be talking about social security, AARP,

1751
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
our pensions.

1752
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Well, Jason and I will compare how much money

1753
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
we're getting from the SAG fund

1754
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
that we've paid into for all of our various commercial work.

1755
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
That's all fair game if this show goes on and on.

1756
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
$127? Why even send the check?

1757
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Well, that's not what Jason is going to show you.

1758
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Well, he's not going to say that. Are you kidding?

1759
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Jason is going to say, I've taken too much out of this.

1760
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Yeah, so that is absolutely, that will be happening

1761
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
in a few years.

1762
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
I don't pay for the racquetball courts at SAG headquarters.

1763
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I shouldn't be paying into the,

1764
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
there shouldn't be an IOA for me.

1765
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Is that the right term?

1766
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Maybe.

1767
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
HOA? HOA.

1768
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
HOA is Islands of Adventure.

1769
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Yeah, that's right.

1770
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
The first mention of theme parks in this episode.

1771
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
And the last.

1772
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Let me ask, I know you have a list of stuff.

1773
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Yeah.

1774
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Was there any theme park heavy stuff that you're like,

1775
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
oh shoot, or any episode topic in general,

1776
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
you're like, oh shoot, I like that.

1777
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
I did tell them not to do anything.

1778
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Well, you know what?

1779
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I mean, as I said, the one with Mazani was delightful.

1780
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I certainly would have had a lot of fun with you guys

1781
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
and Gio and Zach.

1782
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Let me say, look, very deep into this.

1783
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
There were a lot of great episodes.

1784
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
There was a lot of very funny stuff.

1785
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Oh, thank you.

1786
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
You provided comfort for me when I was way out of the comfort zone.

1787
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
And here's one I want to compliment.

1788
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
The one about the app with Jess McKenna.

1789
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Now, as you said, this is one that I signed off on.

1790
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I was going to do that.

1791
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,000
That is not some like, I think there's a lot interesting about the app.

1792
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And I like that it was kind of about, that it was like thematic

1793
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,000
and about like the, now the app robs you of your ability

1794
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
to be a Disneyland Sherpa and that kind of thing.

1795
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,000
And the way it forces everybody onto their phones

1796
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,000
and the broader themes going on, I think, really big.

1797
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
But there was a point, like over an hour in,

1798
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
where you said, now Scott is screaming at his phone.

1799
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
And you were exactly right.

1800
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
It finally got into just reading the names of that kind of,

1801
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
but I don't even remember what.

1802
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Yeah, I don't remember either.

1803
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
I will say this.

1804
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Sometimes there's, I feel like there's a lot of like foe rage

1805
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
at like the systems Disneyland puts in place

1806
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
and we have a new thing and a new name.

1807
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
You guys both love it.

1808
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
You love every bit of it.

1809
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,000
You love every new bit of hassle because it's funny to talk about

1810
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
and it's fun for you, Mike, to try to like climb over the fence.

1811
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
There could not be more systems added to it.

1812
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
It would never satiate.

1813
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
You guys, you love it.

1814
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
You love these things.

1815
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
There's some truth to that.

1816
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Yes, there's, well, I acknowledge on the episode as well

1817
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
that there is a, it's a double edged sword

1818
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
that you're getting dopamine hits.

1819
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,000
So there was an acknowledgement that some of it does prove satisfying

1820
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
for a certain type of brain.

1821
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,000
There are things, mobile ordering I love.

1822
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
I couldn't love it.

1823
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I love now pulling times for mobile orders.

1824
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
You keep double checking.

1825
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
You can pull times like fast passes for mobile ordering.

1826
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,000
So if you're a hungry bear, barbecue, jamboree, whatever it's called,

1827
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
as the time says, well, you can make one for 5 p.m.

1828
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Keep refreshing.

1829
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
You can get one for right now.

1830
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Let me tell you something.

1831
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
This guy, this guy, one time we're at Bengal barbecue.

1832
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
He mobile orders.

1833
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,000
He beats me to my order for by about 60 seconds.

1834
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Look, he gives the smug look because he has a little stick snack.

1835
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
60 seconds earlier.

1836
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
The look on this face.

1837
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Efficient.

1838
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
I would say efficient.

1839
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
You had 60 more seconds of chicken enjoyment.

1840
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Well, not more seconds.

1841
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
60 earlier seconds.

1842
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:03,000
60 earlier seconds than teriyaki chicken.

1843
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I think this is what he said when we interviewed Len Testa in his hotel room

1844
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
and I said something about checking and Len said, well, you're optimizing.

1845
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Yes.

1846
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Correct, Len.

1847
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Optimization.

1848
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
That had like a gold bloom to it.

1849
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Yes.

1850
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Yes.

1851
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Optimization, yes.

1852
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Yes.

1853
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Mike's taking over the wizard role in Wicked Part 2.

1854
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
He's practicing.

1855
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Bad news.

1856
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Yeah.

1857
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Well, if you like the casting.

1858
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I'll hold it.

1859
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
So it's half true, half true.

1860
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
I would get rid of that 7 a.m. wake up for the virtual queue,

1861
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
which when we go to Tiana, we won't have to do it.

1862
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Oh, yeah.

1863
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
They have turned it off.

1864
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Oh, yeah.

1865
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I'm so sorry.

1866
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Yeah.

1867
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
It's one less hoop you have to jump through.

1868
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
That must be such a bummer for you.

1869
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
That's 7 a.m.

1870
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
If you're not waking up at 7 a.m. already though,

1871
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
that sucks.

1872
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Yeah.

1873
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
So I am happy that that doesn't exist.

1874
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
That is insane.

1875
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Forcing PBI.

1876
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Look, I've been working about this.

1877
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Guardians is still on a virtual queue like that.

1878
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Really?

1879
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
In Florida.

1880
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
In Florida.

1881
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Oh, in Florida.

1882
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Yeah, sorry.

1883
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Is that the last man standing in terms of height and anything?

1884
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
I think Tron is standby at this point.

1885
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Yeah.

1886
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
And then Haunted Mansion went back already to regular.

1887
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
I think Haunted Mansion holiday out here.

1888
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
There is a standby.

1889
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Oh, I am so excited to figure out if I don't like the gift shop.

1890
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,000
We're not going to talk about it until October, but the gift shop has a lot of discourse about it.

1891
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Which gift shop?

1892
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
The Haunted Mansion gift shop.

1893
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Okay.

1894
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
The big building they built outside the exit to Haunted Mansion.

1895
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Yeah.

1896
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
And I've seen a lot of discourse and I obviously saw it being built, but I'm ready.

1897
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
They put up a sign that I will.

1898
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Spoiler alert.

1899
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
I don't like it.

1900
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
You don't like the sign already?

1901
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
It looks cheap.

1902
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
The sign looks cheap.

1903
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
We're already in a bad territory just with the sign.

1904
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
So this is something important right here.

1905
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Yeah, yeah.

1906
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
The sign looks kind of...

1907
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Did you see the sign?

1908
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Yeah, I don't know that I like the sign either.

1909
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I think they also...

1910
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
I don't know if they...

1911
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I think it's supposed to be like the mansion's carriage house.

1912
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,000
So the one side is supposed to look mansion-y.

1913
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:55,000
The other side is supposed to be copacetic with Tiana's.

1914
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Like a shed.

1915
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
That's a tough thing.

1916
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
And I don't know if they...

1917
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,000
I mean, they're the pros at that sort of thing, but I think they maybe cheaped out a little

1918
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
too much.

1919
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
We'll see.

1920
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Yeah, yeah.

1921
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
I don't...

1922
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
This almost feels like a...

1923
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
This is like a regular feed, maybe worthy observation.

1924
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
But maybe it's...

1925
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
But it's also such a nascent observation that maybe I save it here behind the double paywall.

1926
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
I got a bad feeling about Donkey Kong.

1927
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
I got a bad feeling about this ride.

1928
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
The videos are confused.

1929
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
The one thing...

1930
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
First of all, it's short.

1931
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Yeah.

1932
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Yeah.

1933
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Which is okay, but I picture you're standing in a two-hour line for that thing and you

1934
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
end up feeling like that was that.

1935
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I think the problem, if there will be one, is just that those indoor show scenes are

1936
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
underwhelming.

1937
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Yeah, they do seem...

1938
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
That's the problem, because I bet being in the big temple, the temple looks awesome.

1939
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Being outside, I bet the ride system...

1940
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Animatronics is good.

1941
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Animatronics are good.

1942
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,080
I bet the ride system does feel fun to feel like you're flying.

1943
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:54,000
It's obviously not going to be on the level of Hagrid's, but I do think the bummer is

1944
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,580
that it's just going to be short and those indoor sections aren't like, oh my God, cool.

1945
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:00,760
It's just a little bit, I don't know, janky.

1946
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:01,760
So it's not going to...

1947
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,600
I don't think it's going to be a failure, but it's not going to be like...

1948
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:05,600
It's not still going to be what we want.

1949
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,840
It's not Mario Kart.

1950
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:07,840
That's the bummer.

1951
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:08,840
Yeah.

1952
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:13,280
I was hoping it was going to be, well, this is it for Nintendo, and I agree it's not going

1953
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,280
to be...

1954
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:15,280
That it's going to rescue the entire endeavor.

1955
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,280
Right.

1956
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:17,280
Which we had questions about the quality.

1957
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,120
I don't think it's that, but then there's so much other stuff like Donkey Kong, the

1958
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,120
big suit.

1959
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:21,680
You saw the photos of that, or pictures?

1960
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:22,680
You know what?

1961
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:24,680
That suit's giving me the big things in small spaces.

1962
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:25,680
I'm scared of that suit.

1963
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:26,680
Oh, no.

1964
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:27,680
Yep.

1965
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:28,680
That's a scary suit to me.

1966
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:30,480
I'm impressed by it, but I think I would be...

1967
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:31,480
I'm excited about this suit.

1968
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,480
It's so big.

1969
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:33,480
Even if you're outside?

1970
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:34,480
They are testing.

1971
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,480
Yeah, it's outside.

1972
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:37,120
Yeah, that might...

1973
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,120
I don't know.

1974
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,120
It's still...

1975
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:43,840
You know, it was giving me a weird claustrophobia just in the frame of the video.

1976
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,060
This is a big suit.

1977
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:48,720
What if somebody were to inflate Donkey Kong?

1978
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:49,720
Would that...

1979
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:51,720
Jason, you can answer this, too.

1980
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:52,720
Okay.

1981
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,720
Again, a lot of people have backed me up on this.

1982
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:55,720
No, no, no.

1983
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:56,720
As I said, we're not saying it's fake.

1984
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:57,720
It's not my thing.

1985
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:58,720
It's just fascinating.

1986
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:03,780
It's a fascinating thing to now be aware of in my life, and I don't think it really helped

1987
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:04,780
with my metaphor earlier.

1988
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:09,340
It's a podcast fact now that you're the butt master and that you like inflatable stuff.

1989
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:13,980
I know you don't, but it's podcast fact that you're into inflatable stuff.

1990
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:14,980
With popping, I don't know.

1991
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:15,980
It's...

1992
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:18,100
We don't know about that, but I don't know...

1993
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:19,100
People have to maintain some air of mystery.

1994
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:24,860
The popping stuff is none of my business, but it's podcasts, it's kayfabe that you love

1995
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:25,860
inflatable stuff.

1996
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:28,540
I know you don't, but in the reality of podcasting, right, it's true.

1997
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,580
Have fun with the character that you play.

1998
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:31,580
Right.

1999
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:32,700
Donkey Kong is awesome.

2000
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:33,700
The land looks cool.

2001
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:36,580
Getting to see the rhino come out of the box and stuff.

2002
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:37,580
That's great.

2003
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:40,780
Seeing Mr. Miyamoto going around.

2004
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:41,780
That's all delightful.

2005
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:42,780
Yeah.

2006
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:44,820
I'm not counting it out.

2007
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:46,540
I wanted to watch that video.

2008
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:51,820
I hate to talk about theme park stuff, but have we seen the bioreconstruct, the footage

2009
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:56,140
of the lighting packages happening for Helios Grand and for the...

2010
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:57,140
A little bit.

2011
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:58,140
That's so good.

2012
01:25:58,140 --> 01:25:59,140
This place thing is magical.

2013
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:04,700
The roller coaster, whatever it's called now, because they had to change the starfall racers.

2014
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:05,980
Star dust racers now.

2015
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:09,980
With the lights off, it looks like a comet's going through the sky.

2016
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:10,980
I'm getting so excited.

2017
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:15,860
There's this crazy lightning effect from the Frankenstein castle or whatever, whoever's

2018
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:16,860
castle it is.

2019
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:18,780
It looks like it explodes somehow.

2020
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:21,020
It looks like there's a glitch in the video.

2021
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:22,020
The thing looks so cool.

2022
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:23,020
Wow, really?

2023
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:24,020
I haven't watched all of them.

2024
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:26,300
I just saw this, I think this morning, and it looks like...

2025
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:29,780
I couldn't tell what happened, but all of a sudden it shorts out and there's a huge

2026
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:33,420
explosion of light that looked like the video shorted out.

2027
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:38,260
There was some sort of electronic interference, and I was like, holy shit, this thing at night.

2028
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:43,900
It's light effects so wild that our existing cameras can't handle them.

2029
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:44,900
Right.

2030
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:45,900
I think that was from bioreconstruct.

2031
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:46,900
It was, I don't know.

2032
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:47,980
You know what?

2033
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:51,900
Send bioreconstruct to New Jersey to figure out what this goddamn drone situation is.

2034
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:53,380
You already know what I'm talking about?

2035
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:54,380
Have you seen these?

2036
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:55,860
This is alien stuff.

2037
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:57,740
Neither of you know about it.

2038
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:00,540
I think we might be in another I'm not into the popping situation.

2039
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:01,540
Jason does know.

2040
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:02,540
Jason does know.

2041
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:06,780
I think it's often turned out to be like FedEx flights or...

2042
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:08,420
Oh, Jason, you don't know.

2043
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:09,420
Some of them are drones.

2044
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:12,060
No, you do not know what you're talking about here, my friend.

2045
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,860
People are shooting at them.

2046
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:14,860
People are shooting lasers.

2047
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:19,620
We don't have time to talk about this, but this is 2020.

2048
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:23,900
This might be a tap out, but I would be interested to hear your feelings on UAPs.

2049
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:28,540
Maybe I should be part of them, but it's possible that this could be an example of

2050
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:34,860
a topic hall pass for both Jason and I to leave.

2051
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:38,020
Well, I don't know, because there's that Acroid UFO special.

2052
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:39,500
Yes, I own it.

2053
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:40,500
Yeah.

2054
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:41,500
I own a DVD of it.

2055
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:44,380
You put it on multiple times at your old apartment.

2056
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:47,540
Somebody also figured out, I saw on Twitter the other day, somebody also figured out the

2057
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:50,540
same thing I figured out, that he's wearing his Christmas with the cranks outfit while

2058
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:51,540
he's being interviewed.

2059
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:54,380
So he's probably in his trailer.

2060
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:55,380
Absolutely.

2061
01:27:55,380 --> 01:28:01,380
He's smoking chain smoking cigarettes in his Christmas with the cranks vest and shirt,

2062
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:04,940
and this strange man is interviewing him about aliens.

2063
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:09,540
Wardrobe loves when you return an outfit back to the smell of cigarettes.

2064
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:12,540
They know what they get with Mr. Acroid.

2065
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:16,020
Well, he's smoked on, but maybe he kept it.

2066
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:18,540
Anyway, enough Dean Park talk, enough alien talk.

2067
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:22,340
Let me carve out a little space for this.

2068
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:23,900
I thought that I had my list.

2069
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:28,220
I thought that I had my stockpile of the episodes that I wanted to hit and the moments that

2070
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:29,220
I wanted to hit.

2071
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:30,220
I thought it was done.

2072
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:34,580
And then you guys dropped a bomb, and the bomb was called Spirit Christmas.

2073
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:35,580
Yes.

2074
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:40,260
The Jason's trip report from going to the holiday equivalent of Spirit Halloween, this

2075
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:43,420
new store endeavor.

2076
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:47,020
This had so many, there was so many little things in here.

2077
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:50,100
I want to dive to this in our remaining time.

2078
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:54,780
Because those sweaters are so funny, and you're jealous you didn't write them, right?

2079
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:58,700
Let me really quickly, let me do my impression of the entire episode.

2080
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:02,300
I think in two lines, I can sum up the entire episode.

2081
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:04,540
So Jason, here's one.

2082
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:08,620
It says, Fa la la la la, la la la lit.

2083
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:13,140
And then Mike, now who would buy this?

2084
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:15,140
Who is buying this?

2085
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:22,940
Just like, it felt like, all right, and repeat 45 times and start.

2086
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:26,620
We got to Phantom Thread, the animated series, there were a lot of good things that came

2087
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:27,620
out of.

2088
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:28,620
Oh, no, no, no.

2089
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:29,620
There were.

2090
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:30,620
Oh, absolutely.

2091
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:32,820
And the listeners got the slideshow.

2092
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:33,820
We put the...

2093
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:34,820
Fa la la la la.

2094
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:35,820
Yes, indeed.

2095
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:36,820
Eat my ass.

2096
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:37,820
You know?

2097
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:38,820
Jingle, jingle.

2098
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:39,820
All right, here's one.

2099
01:29:39,820 --> 01:29:41,460
Jingle bells smell my balls.

2100
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:48,380
Now this is, now who, nobody would, who would ever, who would, that was a valid question,

2101
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:49,460
who would wear it?

2102
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:51,540
That's why I predicted they're going out of business.

2103
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:56,740
Like fucking normies, you know, bad Christmas sweater parties, that dumb trope.

2104
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:57,740
Yes, I hear that.

2105
01:29:57,740 --> 01:30:00,820
But that's for a small section, that's not the whole, a whole store, that's not going

2106
01:30:00,820 --> 01:30:01,820
to sustain.

2107
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:07,940
But it's, don't you think, and maybe Jason, maybe you agree, that this is a, like, these

2108
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:10,220
are meant to be purchased and never worn.

2109
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:11,260
I think these are gag gifts.

2110
01:30:11,260 --> 01:30:12,260
Well, I said it's a gag gift, sure.

2111
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:13,260
I think gag gifts.

2112
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:14,260
Very possibly.

2113
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:16,300
I think, and again, I enjoyed this episode.

2114
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:17,300
I'm not saying this is...

2115
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:18,300
Sure, sure.

2116
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:21,980
I'm not saying this to say, I think what is so funny to me is the indignancy.

2117
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:22,980
Mike's obs...

2118
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:29,500
Sometimes I feel like Mike is going to lead a Tipper Gore-esque charge against PG-13 sexuality

2119
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,300
in public places.

2120
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:36,220
Your glasses get so fogged about the lightest...

2121
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:39,420
But then you will start talking about, like, pegging and taints and shit.

2122
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:46,060
But it's like, either you need it to be all the way, or if it's that in between, if it's

2123
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:51,540
like, if it's in the PG-13 zone, you're like, you go red.

2124
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:55,660
If I can control the dirtiness, it's comfortable to me.

2125
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:59,260
If I see it in the world, it gets a little dicier.

2126
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:04,780
If I see it in just a random store that people wander into and you purchase items, that's,

2127
01:31:04,780 --> 01:31:06,980
I don't know, like, why would you do it?

2128
01:31:06,980 --> 01:31:08,260
Why would you buy it?

2129
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:12,540
But if I'm allowed to sort of run wild with the filthiness, then I think it's in, now

2130
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:13,660
I can control it.

2131
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:15,300
I can control sexuality.

2132
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:16,300
I can control...

2133
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:23,820
Listen to this handmaid's-tail shit this guy's saying, he wants to control sexuality over

2134
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:24,820
here.

2135
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:25,820
Well, not for the world.

2136
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:28,860
I'm just saying I can sort of, once you gain, I can gain power over my sexuality finally.

2137
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:30,740
You know, Jason's a comfortable sexual being.

2138
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:31,740
That's right.

2139
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:33,340
He wants to be comfortable with our sexuality.

2140
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:36,060
He explained that sex was fun a couple months ago.

2141
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:37,860
It was very helpful to me.

2142
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:41,820
You know what, and I don't want to be too graphic, but, and we didn't go all the, but

2143
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:47,980
my wife and I talked about it, and we are considering using sex to connect as partners.

2144
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:48,980
It's on our to-do list.

2145
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:49,980
Very cool.

2146
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:50,980
Lizzie and I are not there yet.

2147
01:31:50,980 --> 01:31:53,100
We're both working on it.

2148
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:57,940
But I think, you know, when I can be filthy, again, because by the end of that episode,

2149
01:31:57,940 --> 01:32:02,380
I was suggesting other filthy topics, then I feel right in the zone, but when I see it

2150
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:04,420
out in the wild, I don't know how to deal with it.

2151
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:05,420
I don't know how to grapple with it.

2152
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:09,980
You clearly don't, because this is, this portion is going to be a little bit of a court

2153
01:32:09,980 --> 01:32:11,380
transcript situation.

2154
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:13,980
Go ahead, yeah.

2155
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:17,940
You start talking about the main store of the parent company of Spirit Christmas Day,

2156
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:19,620
which is Spencer's Gifts.

2157
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:23,020
Here are some quotes that you say in describing Spencer's Gifts.

2158
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:26,140
You can buy wild stuff in a Spencer's.

2159
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:29,860
You can buy lingerie and dildos.

2160
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:32,560
It's still sort of lawless in there.

2161
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:39,240
They are an outrageous store and they are getting away with it still in 2024.

2162
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:41,080
Getting away with lawless.

2163
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:47,400
And then when specific examples are prompted, your examples are lingerie and dildos.

2164
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:51,880
Okay, lingerie, obviously that's silly to hear that written back to me, but you can't,

2165
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:55,520
are there a place, is there a place in Glendale Galleria that you could buy a dildo other

2166
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:56,520
than Spencer's?

2167
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,840
Is there a dildo store?

2168
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:01,560
Does the Westfield Mall regularly have a dildo store?

2169
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:03,880
I'm not saying that dildos are bad.

2170
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:05,520
I'm not saying vibrators are bad.

2171
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:06,520
I'm just saying.

2172
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:09,440
There wasn't that air in the way you were saying the sentence at all.

2173
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:12,280
I'm just saying it's shocking to have it in a mall like that.

2174
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:15,560
Target is carrying more like sex toy stuff.

2175
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:16,560
Are they really?

2176
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:17,560
Really?

2177
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:18,560
Yeah.

2178
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:19,880
Buy like the condoms and lube and such.

2179
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:22,280
Is it an actual vibrator or a dildo?

2180
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:23,280
Yeah, sure.

2181
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:25,000
There's a dildo in Target.

2182
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Yeah.

2183
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,440
You can buy a dildo, can I, mobile order?

2184
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:30,120
Can I pick that?

2185
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:31,520
All right, now I like the points conversation.

2186
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:35,800
Can we use Target red circle points to get a dildo?

2187
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:41,160
Can we have a dildo delivered here before the end of the record at least a vibrator?

2188
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:42,560
There was a deal.

2189
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:47,520
You get a $50 credit if you sign up for their $50 delivery service, which I did.

2190
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:52,920
So I could get a delivery sent here as long as we keep recording for another two hours

2191
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,680
or so.

2192
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:56,600
And let's see if we can get a dildo delivered.

2193
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:58,320
Just have it sent to your home.

2194
01:33:58,320 --> 01:33:59,920
I don't think we will be going by then.

2195
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,640
Just have it sent to your home unannounced.

2196
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:06,240
Lindsay gets the package and go, oh, I guess Mike does want to connect with me as a sexual

2197
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:07,240
partner.

2198
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:08,240
Okay.

2199
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:09,240
Okay.

2200
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:10,240
Here we go.

2201
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:11,240
There's a vibe.

2202
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:12,240
I mean, what's the difference between a vibrator and a dildo?

2203
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:13,240
Really?

2204
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:14,240
That's also a thing.

2205
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:15,240
Mike.

2206
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:18,880
Isn't a dildo is more like it looks like a thing.

2207
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,880
Yeah.

2208
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:21,960
Vibrator can be a multiple shapes and sizes.

2209
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:22,960
Right.

2210
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:23,960
But do they both like, what is this?

2211
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:24,960
Dildo also probably does not vibrate necessarily.

2212
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:25,960
That's what I was going to say.

2213
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:26,960
There's a motor.

2214
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:27,960
Correct.

2215
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:29,600
Okay.

2216
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:30,600
Okay.

2217
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:34,720
We can get a Hello Cake spin stroker vibrating men's personal massager.

2218
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:35,720
Oh my God.

2219
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:39,040
You can buy a, you can buy a flesh light at Target.

2220
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:42,320
Jason knows what he's talking about again.

2221
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:43,600
He's so comfortable with sexuality.

2222
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,760
He's buying flesh lights at Target.

2223
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:48,400
Jason, do you have this spin stroker?

2224
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:49,400
I do not.

2225
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:52,640
It's or, oh, first of all, I love the orange.

2226
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:54,000
That very fun orange.

2227
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,840
Very sexually appealing color.

2228
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:56,840
Can you buy it?

2229
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:57,840
Let's see.

2230
01:34:58,720 --> 01:34:59,720
Okay.

2231
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:00,760
This is not in store though.

2232
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:02,880
Let's see if the things are in store.

2233
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,000
That's really what I'm looking for.

2234
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,480
I am surprised about this information.

2235
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:07,400
I did not know that there were sex toys at Target.

2236
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:08,400
Pick up.

2237
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:09,400
Okay.

2238
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:10,400
Let's see here.

2239
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,920
Hello Cake, that seems to be the brand.

2240
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:17,960
You can get, okay, you can get, Hello Cake, this is a thrusting vibrator.

2241
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:19,280
You can get it at Target.

2242
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,280
Wow.

2243
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:21,280
Jason's right.

2244
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:24,680
So maybe my feelings, because there's a Target connected to the Galleria.

2245
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:26,240
My feelings are outdated.

2246
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:27,240
I guess so.

2247
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:33,480
What Jason has just proved is that there are multiple places to get sex toys in the Galleria.

2248
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:36,760
And I will go back and we will special edition that episode.

2249
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:40,880
And I will say, and I will say Spencer's is a normal store.

2250
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,680
There's nothing weird about it.

2251
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:48,320
Now, Target, it's a little like more reserved.

2252
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:55,000
Spencer's gift, it is weird when you go from like a Pickle Rick to like Simpsons posters

2253
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,400
to like a weird edible penis pasta.

2254
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:01,520
You're saying Target is a classier place to buy a sex toy.

2255
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:02,520
Low key.

2256
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:03,520
Target is the more.

2257
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:04,520
Spencer's is aggressive.

2258
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:07,520
Yeah, Spencer's is like Bachelor Party.

2259
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:13,480
You can buy like a vibrator with Shrek on it in Spencer's.

2260
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:16,480
Yes, that would be funny.

2261
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:17,840
The big green monster.

2262
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,560
Which is still wild, lawless.

2263
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:21,760
Because Shrek on a vibrator is lawless.

2264
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,440
So I guess in that way I would, I could still.

2265
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:29,520
I think what jumped out at me was the phrase, they're getting away with it.

2266
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:33,480
Mike, what do you want to happen to the people who run Spencer's gifts?

2267
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:34,480
Lock them all up.

2268
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:37,720
Clear, lock them all up.

2269
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:38,720
Still hanging on.

2270
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,920
A lot of them in malls.

2271
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:45,040
I saw someone like this, Spencer's gift has been here for like 40 years.

2272
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:47,560
And that's what, yes, that's the thing.

2273
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:51,560
This has been, you've had a lot of decades to acclimate to the fact that there is a store

2274
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:53,720
in a lot of malls that sells sex toys.

2275
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:57,240
And yet you are still using the phrase, getting away with it.

2276
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:03,040
And also, if lingerie is a problem for you, lingerie in the mall, I've got bad news, my

2277
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:04,040
friends.

2278
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:07,840
These, I'm doing these off the top, sometimes you say things and you listen back and maybe

2279
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,840
that was incorrect.

2280
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:11,040
So yes, of course lingerie is in the mall.

2281
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:14,000
It's a silly, I was just off the top of the dome.

2282
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,000
And we love, you love to see it as the lingerie.

2283
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,360
I put it everywhere and they'll put it out in the center court, I say.

2284
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:24,440
When I get a pizza slice, wrap it up in a teddy, I say.

2285
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:28,920
He's like Jack White, you know, he goes, like Jack White goes on stage.

2286
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:32,000
He says he goes off stage, doesn't remember what he just did.

2287
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Mike's just created.

2288
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
It's like jazz.

2289
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
It's like jazz.

2290
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
It's like jazz.

2291
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,480
I mean, that is true, by the way, I don't remember a lot of things I said.

2292
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:41,480
I'm the owner.

2293
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:44,320
So what's the name of your band, White Stripes?

2294
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,980
This will never, you did not play it as you played it on the record.

2295
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:47,980
You demand it.

2296
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:48,980
You'll never make it.

2297
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:51,700
Are you husband and wife or your brother and sister?

2298
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:53,300
What is with this tomfoolery?

2299
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:56,500
The audience needs to understand it or they'll never accept it.

2300
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:57,500
A mystery?

2301
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:58,500
That'll never work.

2302
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,500
Sutterfuge in rock and roll?

2303
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:03,140
This dirty conversation has put my left leg to sleep.

2304
01:38:03,140 --> 01:38:05,340
It's on pins and needles and I don't know why that is.

2305
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:06,340
What?

2306
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:07,340
Yeah, my left leg is numb.

2307
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:08,340
We broke him.

2308
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:12,180
We said lingerie isn't, you said vibrator's at target and now Mike is like struggling

2309
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:13,180
physically.

2310
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:15,540
His central nervous system is shutting down.

2311
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:21,080
You can buy Hello Cake vibrating stroker ribbed massager for him, which is like, look

2312
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:22,080
at this.

2313
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:25,920
This is just like a little plastic thing to put your thing in and I guess you rub it up

2314
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:26,920
and...

2315
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:27,920
Your thing.

2316
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,380
That was a very confident yes from Jason.

2317
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:30,380
I know, I caught it.

2318
01:38:30,380 --> 01:38:31,380
I like that as well.

2319
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:32,380
Yes, yes.

2320
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:35,540
Jason, are you familiar with the cake brand?

2321
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:39,660
Well, I am familiar with the cake brand.

2322
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:40,660
Thank you very much.

2323
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:41,660
I will say this.

2324
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:43,180
It's a reliable, trustworthy brand.

2325
01:38:43,180 --> 01:38:47,540
I love the design of these cake sex products.

2326
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:51,820
I think that they're very colorful and they're very whimsical in nature.

2327
01:38:51,820 --> 01:38:52,820
They almost look like...

2328
01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:54,860
The figure he's finding his way in.

2329
01:38:54,860 --> 01:38:59,940
He's finding sex toys that are bright and colorful like the barely alcoholic drinks

2330
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:00,940
that he drinks.

2331
01:39:00,940 --> 01:39:01,940
Right.

2332
01:39:01,940 --> 01:39:02,940
Now we've got it.

2333
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:04,700
Now we can understand why a sex toy might be.

2334
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:09,180
Bright pinks and purples and yellows and oranges and all the colors of the rainbow to stimulate

2335
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:10,540
all the different parts of your body.

2336
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:16,180
I was going to have to clear off a shelf for a different kind of tool.

2337
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:17,180
It's toys, Mike.

2338
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:18,180
It's completeness.

2339
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:19,180
Toys at Target.

2340
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:20,180
It's what you're all about.

2341
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:21,860
This has always been waiting there for you.

2342
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:24,060
There is a deal I think happening too.

2343
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:28,820
$10 or maybe that's just a broad deal, $10 off.

2344
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:31,700
They consider these beauty and personal care purchases.

2345
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:34,260
So if you spend $40, you get $10 off.

2346
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:39,820
And if you have that Target card, get 5% off automatically.

2347
01:39:39,820 --> 01:39:41,580
We talked about that, of course, on points.

2348
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:44,980
Plus one waterproof and rechargeable vibrating ring.

2349
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:49,180
Oh, this is like, is this like Green Lantern's ring or something, but it vibrates?

2350
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:50,180
Jason, do you know what this does?

2351
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:51,180
Yeah, that's right.

2352
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:52,180
Yes.

2353
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:53,180
I'm sure that's what the makers were thinking.

2354
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:54,180
It's just like Green Lantern's ring.

2355
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:55,180
But what does this mean?

2356
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:58,380
Does it mean you stimulate, you use, how does this work?

2357
01:39:58,380 --> 01:40:00,380
Mike, it's a cock ring.

2358
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:01,380
It is?

2359
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:05,380
That's my favorite thing that's happened since I've been gone.

2360
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:07,420
Jason, this is thick.

2361
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:09,500
This isn't going on your cock.

2362
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:13,060
Are you sure you think it is?

2363
01:40:13,060 --> 01:40:14,060
You think it is?

2364
01:40:14,060 --> 01:40:17,740
I think I, I don't understand the perspective I'm looking at here, but I would bet.

2365
01:40:17,740 --> 01:40:22,620
I thought a cock ring, I thought a cock ring has to be sort of the same circumference like

2366
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:26,100
a ring around your finger, like a wedding ring.

2367
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:29,180
I thought that it has to be there because it just has to restrict the blood flow to

2368
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:30,700
make it harder.

2369
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:32,980
That's my understanding of it.

2370
01:40:32,980 --> 01:40:34,620
Yeah.

2371
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:38,700
So you're saying Jason is, Jason is balancing how much he wants to say.

2372
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:42,780
And I'm excited to hear what he has to say.

2373
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:43,780
You know what?

2374
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:46,060
And I look, I've been, I've been giving it to Jason a lot, but I think it's fair for

2375
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:49,540
Jason to not now have to reveal all of the things.

2376
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:50,540
I do.

2377
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:55,140
I feel like I reveal quite a bit of myself on this show.

2378
01:40:55,140 --> 01:40:56,140
Even I have my boundaries.

2379
01:40:56,140 --> 01:40:57,140
Yes, that's right.

2380
01:40:57,140 --> 01:41:01,420
But I will say, I don't know what I'm looking at with that thick top of the cock ring, but

2381
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:05,700
I believe it as a, what do you, what else do you think it would be?

2382
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:06,700
Let me guess.

2383
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:07,700
Okay.

2384
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:11,700
You can just give me a nod if I'm okay.

2385
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:15,060
What it is then, if it is what you're saying it is, and I do believe that you know what

2386
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:16,300
you're talking about.

2387
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:21,500
This goes all the way to the close, like closer to your body on your penis.

2388
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:26,740
And when you're doing the thing, this is hitting the outside and it's vibrating.

2389
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:27,740
Yes.

2390
01:41:27,740 --> 01:41:28,740
Congratulations.

2391
01:41:28,740 --> 01:41:30,180
Very interesting, isn't it?

2392
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:32,380
This has been the most educational episode.

2393
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:35,140
It really has for, I assume Scott and I, but maybe not.

2394
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:36,140
Maybe he's being coy.

2395
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:37,540
I, no, I'm not being coy.

2396
01:41:38,380 --> 01:41:40,220
I honestly don't know anything about this area.

2397
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:41,220
Wow.

2398
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:42,220
That's interesting.

2399
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:43,220
I never thought about it.

2400
01:41:43,220 --> 01:41:45,700
I always thought about those things in a different way, but this is like a new technological

2401
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:46,700
achievement.

2402
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:47,700
Sure.

2403
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:48,700
This is good.

2404
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:51,220
We are witnessing an awakening with Mike because as soon as he's realized, he's realized a

2405
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:52,220
couple of things.

2406
01:41:52,220 --> 01:41:58,620
These are toys and you can use deals and apps and points to get the toys at a decent value.

2407
01:41:58,620 --> 01:42:00,460
I apologize to Spencer's gifts.

2408
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:01,460
I really do.

2409
01:42:01,460 --> 01:42:02,460
I apologize to them.

2410
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:03,460
I apologize to the people who purchase.

2411
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:06,020
You're making them a pariah, which they are not.

2412
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:12,260
What you found is the target is leading the industry charge towards affordable sex toys

2413
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:13,260
in our shopping malls.

2414
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:18,740
Now you can go into Spencer's gifts and feel a little more normal when you're buying your

2415
01:42:18,740 --> 01:42:21,540
smiling friends boxers or whatever.

2416
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:22,700
I've never seen this show.

2417
01:42:22,700 --> 01:42:23,700
This show's apparently huge.

2418
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:24,700
Yeah, people love it.

2419
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:25,700
I haven't watched it.

2420
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:26,700
I haven't watched it.

2421
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:27,980
I just haven't caught it.

2422
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:33,420
There's something called Tush Cush, which is Tush Cush lube for backside play.

2423
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:34,420
Correct.

2424
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:35,420
I mean, I know what that is.

2425
01:42:35,820 --> 01:42:36,820
Yeah, a lot of people.

2426
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:37,820
Yeah.

2427
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:38,820
Yeah, I get it.

2428
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:43,020
So now this is the new pattern of this episode is you just reading every type of toy, looking

2429
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:46,540
at Jason for acknowledgement with a look that's like, do you know about this?

2430
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:47,780
Have you used this?

2431
01:42:47,780 --> 01:42:52,500
Wanting too much information out of Jason, frankly.

2432
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:58,020
I don't think anything I've asked, most people would know actually the answer to the questions

2433
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:01,460
I'm asking is really, is really what I'm getting from him.

2434
01:43:01,460 --> 01:43:02,820
I haven't asked for anything specific.

2435
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:04,860
Well, that's where I'm like, I don't know.

2436
01:43:04,860 --> 01:43:07,580
I honestly don't know a lot of things that you're talking about.

2437
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:13,260
I think I just feel like I don't, I don't like, I just don't get so harumphy about the

2438
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:18,860
notion that there's lingerie in a store that's a wall separated from a Lego store.

2439
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:21,820
I accepted this about the world.

2440
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:23,900
I didn't call for them to be put out of business.

2441
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:27,420
Well, I just wanted to know what getting away with it means.

2442
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:28,420
Getting away with it implies.

2443
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:32,180
I didn't ask who the CEO of Spencer's was.

2444
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:35,180
Just saying.

2445
01:43:35,180 --> 01:43:40,100
A masked man used an extra vibrating cock ring to assassinate the-

2446
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:42,100
I did not, I did not ask.

2447
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:47,540
The 3D printed ghost cock ring to take the CEO of Spencer's out of commission.

2448
01:43:47,540 --> 01:43:48,540
My goodness.

2449
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:51,380
There's so many more things I want to say here, but we've asked two questions.

2450
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:57,300
He wrote, didn't I depose Pickle Rick on the murder weapon?

2451
01:43:58,180 --> 01:44:02,260
I am genuinely, I'm like, cutting, I have so many things that I'm not going to do, but

2452
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:07,220
there's, maybe, this might need a sequel, I don't know, but I love the ones that we

2453
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:12,340
landed on on the way out the door and we'll wrap it up, but because we're in spirit Christmas,

2454
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:17,380
I cannot let this episode end and not ask further questions about Mummum and Pup Pup's

2455
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:18,380
barrel of walnuts.

2456
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:19,980
Oh, the barrel of walnuts.

2457
01:44:19,980 --> 01:44:20,980
This was-

2458
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:28,980
I think it's an old fashioned thing if you were born in like 1917 or 1919, you know?

2459
01:44:28,980 --> 01:44:36,100
Yes, which is also when you would have to be born to be entertained by Momma's family.

2460
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:41,300
And again, this is a big thing I want to clarify, and I think it's a misunderstanding that listeners

2461
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:44,820
have and that people have, is that when Jason brings up something, it's not that we're

2462
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:46,980
saying we don't believe Jason.

2463
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:49,620
I know that there are probably barrels of walnuts.

2464
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:54,020
I've never, much like the type of cock ring you're showing me, I've never seen it, but

2465
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:56,300
I believe that it's real.

2466
01:44:56,300 --> 01:45:00,460
So barrel of walnuts, I understand, and this seems like a cherished childhood memory.

2467
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:01,460
Here's the thing.

2468
01:45:01,460 --> 01:45:03,620
There's no way this barrel was three feet tall.

2469
01:45:03,620 --> 01:45:04,620
That's madness.

2470
01:45:04,620 --> 01:45:10,580
There's no way that your grandparents had a full to the brim three foot tall.

2471
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:11,580
I think it is smaller.

2472
01:45:11,580 --> 01:45:16,860
I mean, it could have been two feet, but it was a sizable barrel.

2473
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:19,300
This might also help clarify for me.

2474
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:22,220
Do you think it was full to the brim with walnuts?

2475
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:29,540
Like is it walnuts from bottom to top, or is there some sort of like, is there some

2476
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:36,420
cushioning or like, is it halfway full so that the walnuts are only towards the top

2477
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:37,620
of the barrel?

2478
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:42,980
I think there were walnuts, chestnuts, maybe cons or Brazil nuts.

2479
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:44,780
It was on the floor, though.

2480
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:47,180
It was in the corner of the dining room, yeah.

2481
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:49,000
Here's the thing, though.

2482
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,320
If it was on the floor, it couldn't be one foot.

2483
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:53,140
You would put that on a counter.

2484
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:54,140
That's a good point.

2485
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:58,260
So that is an argument in favor of it being at least three feet, because if it was two

2486
01:45:58,260 --> 01:46:01,980
feet even, I feel like you're like, put that on a table.

2487
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:02,980
Mike's right.

2488
01:46:02,980 --> 01:46:03,980
I'm trying to figure it.

2489
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:07,780
So I would have been three feet tall for the kid.

2490
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:11,060
Three feet might be the right barrel size.

2491
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:15,820
Three feet is what's bothering me, because three feet is, I don't know exactly how tall

2492
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:22,420
my oldest son is, or, and I don't know how tall your daughter is, but that's a degree

2493
01:46:22,420 --> 01:46:26,580
of barrel that would bury your children for the most part.

2494
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:28,420
They're barely hanging on it.

2495
01:46:28,420 --> 01:46:31,620
My daughter's two inches away from going on Space Mountain and Big Thunder.

2496
01:46:31,620 --> 01:46:36,380
Well, that was an old thing, and you cannot make her go on all these rides.

2497
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:37,380
I never said I was.

2498
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:38,380
I was very concerned.

2499
01:46:38,380 --> 01:46:42,260
I was surprised that you could let somebody who was 40 inches, I thought that meant they

2500
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:43,260
were eight years old.

2501
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:46,580
I forget when that was, but I'm like, oh God, is he going to force her on a Guardian?

2502
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:47,580
What are we doing here?

2503
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:52,420
I am not forcing, Jess forced a family member on, that's what happens.

2504
01:46:52,420 --> 01:46:53,420
He throw Jess under the rug.

2505
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:56,740
Hey, I'm just saying, maybe you got confused.

2506
01:46:56,740 --> 01:46:59,460
I didn't say I was taking her on Guardians.

2507
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:05,860
She was the one arguing to you that size does not equal a willingness to do it, or being

2508
01:47:05,860 --> 01:47:06,860
ready to do it.

2509
01:47:06,860 --> 01:47:07,860
I'm not doing that.

2510
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:10,180
That being said, I think my daughter would love Big Thunder Mountain.

2511
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:11,540
I think she'd go wild for it.

2512
01:47:11,540 --> 01:47:12,540
I hope so.

2513
01:47:12,820 --> 01:47:15,900
If it was my first roller coaster, she would not, that anything, well, there's a little

2514
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:16,900
darkness.

2515
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:19,020
That's what I'm facing with my son currently too.

2516
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:21,140
She loves to be whipped around.

2517
01:47:21,140 --> 01:47:22,140
She loves.

2518
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:25,500
I think I probably went on it when I was in like third, first grade.

2519
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:29,220
I don't know that I went on it at two and a half.

2520
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:30,740
I am shocked.

2521
01:47:30,740 --> 01:47:34,660
I literally thought it's like, well, you have to graduate second grade to go on these rides.

2522
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:40,340
And the answer is no, you can be two and a half years old and go on Space Mountain.

2523
01:47:40,340 --> 01:47:41,940
And that blows my mind still.

2524
01:47:42,340 --> 01:47:46,460
It's hard to imagine doing, and that'd be a disaster for my son for sure.

2525
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:53,140
But this is, I just like, because the size next to our children, I think, makes me feel

2526
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:54,780
like there's no way it's three.

2527
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:56,820
And also three feet, I looked it up.

2528
01:47:56,820 --> 01:47:58,620
Three feet is a wine barrel.

2529
01:47:58,620 --> 01:48:01,460
That's like an industrial size.

2530
01:48:01,460 --> 01:48:03,820
It was skinnier than a wine barrel for sure.

2531
01:48:03,820 --> 01:48:04,820
Oh, that helps me.

2532
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:05,820
Okay, okay.

2533
01:48:05,820 --> 01:48:06,820
It was skinnier.

2534
01:48:06,820 --> 01:48:07,820
Interesting.

2535
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:11,740
But do you, I feel like, are you, are you getting closer to two?

2536
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:15,980
Because that seems, three feet just seems like, like the pure volume, the amount of

2537
01:48:15,980 --> 01:48:19,380
walnuts that would have to be, or I guess it was all a variety of nut is what you're

2538
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:20,380
telling me.

2539
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:22,380
But like, how many, here's a question.

2540
01:48:22,380 --> 01:48:25,940
How many people year round have access to this barrel?

2541
01:48:25,940 --> 01:48:33,420
Well, I think it's always accessible, but it usually wasn't like, I think my pop-up

2542
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:37,980
would fill it up at Christmas time when he was having people over.

2543
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:38,980
Okay.

2544
01:48:38,980 --> 01:48:42,300
And you get the crab crackers out.

2545
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:43,300
The crunchers, okay.

2546
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:44,300
Yeah.

2547
01:48:44,300 --> 01:48:45,300
Yeah, okay.

2548
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:49,540
And then that's a fun activity for the, I was just, I was just bristling at the notion

2549
01:48:49,540 --> 01:48:54,180
that, because like, imagine, imagine me picturing, let's go back to Donkey Kong, a Donkey Kong

2550
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:57,820
sized barrel that is nothing but pure walnuts.

2551
01:48:57,820 --> 01:49:01,700
I feel like we might be talking about like a thousand dollars worth of walnuts in there.

2552
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:02,700
No, no.

2553
01:49:02,860 --> 01:49:04,060
It was a smaller barrel.

2554
01:49:04,060 --> 01:49:08,300
I didn't mean to imply it was a barrel that I wear with straps, you know?

2555
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:13,420
It sounds almost like it's more of like an umbrella holder skinniness or something.

2556
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:15,300
A little wider than that.

2557
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:16,300
Okay.

2558
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:19,940
But yeah, I don't know, is it not barrel?

2559
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:20,940
I don't know what to say.

2560
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:22,540
But it was barrel shaped?

2561
01:49:22,540 --> 01:49:23,540
Yes, of course.

2562
01:49:23,540 --> 01:49:27,100
How does it, what Mike is showing, how does that, what would you, if you had to take that

2563
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:30,820
and alter it in Photoshop, where it was to hold it out, what has to be, imagine that's

2564
01:49:30,820 --> 01:49:31,820
three.

2565
01:49:32,180 --> 01:49:35,140
What do you do to that barrel to make it your childhood barrel?

2566
01:49:35,140 --> 01:49:36,940
Just shrink it skinny wise?

2567
01:49:36,940 --> 01:49:45,580
I yeah, I think a little skinnier, maybe a little shorter, but it was, I think it was

2568
01:49:45,580 --> 01:49:52,540
tall enough that an average size adult could reach in and grab some without bending down

2569
01:49:52,540 --> 01:49:53,540
too far.

2570
01:49:53,540 --> 01:49:54,540
Wow.

2571
01:49:54,540 --> 01:49:55,540
Wow.

2572
01:49:55,540 --> 01:49:56,540
I bet it was that tall.

2573
01:49:56,540 --> 01:50:01,740
But my question remains, like, is that, like, is it literally enough barrels to where there's

2574
01:50:01,740 --> 01:50:06,380
there could be, because like the barrels, I'm sorry, the walnuts down at the bottom

2575
01:50:06,380 --> 01:50:09,260
are not getting touched for years, potentially.

2576
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:15,540
Well, no, I don't think it was, it kind of, I believe it had a divider in it.

2577
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:22,140
And so it was, that was probably, imagine it was bigger than a popcorn tin, but imagine

2578
01:50:22,140 --> 01:50:23,500
how that split up.

2579
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:24,500
Sure.

2580
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:25,740
So we refills it every year.

2581
01:50:25,740 --> 01:50:29,020
I don't think stuff is lingering in there for too long.

2582
01:50:29,020 --> 01:50:30,020
Okay.

2583
01:50:30,020 --> 01:50:31,900
So it's true to the bottom.

2584
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:32,900
I believe so.

2585
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:34,940
Well, that's what you just said, divider.

2586
01:50:34,940 --> 01:50:38,940
That's what that's still what's bugging me is that filling up, like, don't you agree

2587
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:42,220
that that we're talking maybe hundreds of dollars worth of walnuts in there?

2588
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:43,220
I don't think so.

2589
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:47,860
No, I think or walnut prices 30 years ago.

2590
01:50:47,860 --> 01:50:48,860
Yeah.

2591
01:50:48,860 --> 01:50:55,260
So think about 30 years ago, he's buying like bags of the in the shell nuts, which I'm sure

2592
01:50:55,260 --> 01:50:57,460
are cheaper because they don't have to be processed.

2593
01:50:57,700 --> 01:51:01,540
You know, just because it's club three and people have to vote, why not walnut price

2594
01:51:01,540 --> 01:51:05,060
trends with Jason Sheridan on club three?

2595
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:09,460
That's such an insane, that's so out of my realm of expertise.

2596
01:51:09,460 --> 01:51:11,180
No, what are you talking about?

2597
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:13,100
I mean, I can look, I can...

2598
01:51:13,100 --> 01:51:16,980
You've made this man now, you've stared in his eyes to make him tell you what he knows

2599
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:18,420
about cock rings.

2600
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:21,860
And now we're going to make him research what walnut prices were in the 1980s.

2601
01:51:21,860 --> 01:51:25,940
I do have questions about that cock ring, I'll be honest with you.

2602
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:26,940
What's that?

2603
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:30,300
How many cock rings do you think would fit in one of these barrels?

2604
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:32,300
Oh, quite a bit.

2605
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:35,540
To me that seems, the cock ring seems unpleasant.

2606
01:51:35,540 --> 01:51:40,020
Someday when Jason becomes the pup pup and we have an even more, a sexually liberated

2607
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:44,820
society that's not full of a bunch of Mikes who want Spencer to get locked up, then his

2608
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:48,460
grandchildren will come over and he'll say, hey, go ahead and scoop into the cock ring

2609
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:49,460
barrel.

2610
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:56,300
Once you're imagining like a barren type, a benevolent barren type with a monocle, it's

2611
01:51:56,660 --> 01:52:04,260
like, ah, Lord Spencer, come let the children, the less fortunate in town pick what you would

2612
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:05,260
like.

2613
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:09,420
I have more than I could ever touch or know what to do with.

2614
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:13,140
Take whatever you'd like.

2615
01:52:13,140 --> 01:52:20,860
Nightmare before Christmas, ugly sweaters and vagina shaped pasta for all.

2616
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:22,780
Oh, watch out for Arthur Clown.

2617
01:52:22,780 --> 01:52:25,780
He might be hiding.

2618
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:28,820
How does Arthur Clown come up this much?

2619
01:52:28,820 --> 01:52:31,820
Arthur Clown was the big closer on Spirit Halloween.

2620
01:52:31,820 --> 01:52:33,820
There's no desire to watch the movie.

2621
01:52:33,820 --> 01:52:35,060
I mean, I'll get around to it.

2622
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:37,060
It's on like every streaming service.

2623
01:52:37,060 --> 01:52:41,620
You gotta get to Exited and Conehead and then the Mr. McCool.

2624
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:46,140
What did you also catch, and maybe you didn't fully listen to this episode, the episode

2625
01:52:46,140 --> 01:52:49,740
about Friendsgiving where Jason said that he was making a point to watch a lot of Christmas

2626
01:52:49,740 --> 01:52:52,220
or Christmas Halloween movies this year and he got to one.

2627
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:53,220
Yeah, I got fucked up.

2628
01:52:53,220 --> 01:52:55,220
I had a lot of doctor's appointments.

2629
01:52:55,660 --> 01:53:01,100
He said this year I'm watching a lot of horror movies and around October 29th he decided

2630
01:53:01,100 --> 01:53:04,740
to start and it did one and it was, what, Halloween 3?

2631
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:08,340
Yeah, I picked the weirdest one.

2632
01:53:08,340 --> 01:53:09,340
I didn't even get to it.

2633
01:53:09,340 --> 01:53:15,660
There's a Hulu original Halloween horror comedy, Chris Elliott and DJ Qualls, and I'm like,

2634
01:53:15,660 --> 01:53:16,660
I'm gonna watch this thing.

2635
01:53:16,660 --> 01:53:18,180
I love both of them.

2636
01:53:18,180 --> 01:53:19,180
You didn't get to anything.

2637
01:53:19,180 --> 01:53:20,180
DJ Qualls?

2638
01:53:20,180 --> 01:53:22,180
Yeah, I think he's great.

2639
01:53:23,140 --> 01:53:24,140
He's changed from love to like.

2640
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:25,140
I think he's great.

2641
01:53:25,140 --> 01:53:30,140
I didn't realize he's had a whole, he's been in like every TV show I haven't missed.

2642
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:31,140
I don't really have an opinion on DJ Qualls.

2643
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:32,140
I'm not mad at him.

2644
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:35,140
It was funny in all those 2000 comedies.

2645
01:53:35,140 --> 01:53:37,500
I think it should be a choice now.

2646
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:43,740
Maybe this is like whether you want to engage with DJ Qualls or take a hall pass in DJ Qualls.

2647
01:53:43,740 --> 01:53:48,220
Maybe Jason wants to do a solo episode about his strong love of DJ Qualls and then you

2648
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:50,940
and I can sit it out and go get some fresh air.

2649
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:53,700
If Jason wants us to leave.

2650
01:53:53,700 --> 01:53:55,700
I could probably talk to him.

2651
01:53:55,700 --> 01:53:57,700
It's just a whole career retrospect.

2652
01:53:57,700 --> 01:54:00,900
DJ Qualls, he probably lives here in LA.

2653
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:03,740
We probably have friends of friends, you know?

2654
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:04,740
Maybe we do.

2655
01:54:04,740 --> 01:54:11,180
If Jason wants, I would like Jason to sit with a mic alone and just talk about DJ Qualls.

2656
01:54:11,180 --> 01:54:13,180
Was that a potential?

2657
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:14,700
That could be Club 3 Jason alone.

2658
01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:16,020
That could dethrone Bugman.

2659
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:17,020
Jason's soul.

2660
01:54:17,020 --> 01:54:19,420
Is this something Jason wants to do?

2661
01:54:19,900 --> 01:54:26,900
The first Jason solo episode is just talking about DJ Qualls to no one.

2662
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:28,900
I mean, I am interested.

2663
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:30,900
I mean, I was texting about this.

2664
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:32,900
I was texting with Patrick Monahan.

2665
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:35,900
I feel like I could have a nice conversation.

2666
01:54:35,900 --> 01:54:37,900
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2667
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:38,900
This is Jason solo.

2668
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:42,900
I really figured solo episodes would be more monologue-y.

2669
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:45,900
Yes, a monologue about DJ Qualls.

2670
01:54:45,900 --> 01:54:48,900
It's like the start of a Marin episode.

2671
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:51,380
Some Mente music in the background.

2672
01:54:51,380 --> 01:54:53,380
Some David Lynch-esque music in the background.

2673
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:55,380
If you want to play music in the background.

2674
01:54:55,380 --> 01:54:59,380
If music keeps the spirits up, then yeah, it gives you the energy you need.

2675
01:54:59,380 --> 01:55:01,380
Yeah, all right.

2676
01:55:01,380 --> 01:55:07,380
So, Lynch-y in music while Jason just talks about DJ Qualls.

2677
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:09,380
Oh, I don't want to do this.

2678
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:11,380
Bugman's fucked.

2679
01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:13,380
This is going to be so...

2680
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:15,380
I'd rather research the walnut prices.

2681
01:55:15,380 --> 01:55:17,380
Well, there you go.

2682
01:55:17,860 --> 01:55:19,860
I want to be on the walnut episode, though.

2683
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:21,860
Oh, okay.

2684
01:55:21,860 --> 01:55:23,860
Do you want to all pass for that?

2685
01:55:23,860 --> 01:55:25,860
I don't know.

2686
01:55:25,860 --> 01:55:27,860
That is a little interesting.

2687
01:55:27,860 --> 01:55:29,860
It could be interesting.

2688
01:55:29,860 --> 01:55:31,860
I'll determine when I get there.

2689
01:55:31,860 --> 01:55:33,860
This could be a case-by-case.

2690
01:55:33,860 --> 01:55:35,860
You're right.

2691
01:55:35,860 --> 01:55:37,860
We won't put it in the audience's hand because that could be dangerous to start saying,

2692
01:55:37,860 --> 01:55:39,860
who do you want to sit these out?

2693
01:55:39,860 --> 01:55:41,860
But, you know, this was, I think, very educational.

2694
01:55:41,860 --> 01:55:44,860
This is a fascinating conversation that went in a lot of directions.

2695
01:55:44,860 --> 01:55:46,860
I didn't expect it to go.

2696
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:51,340
I'm excited to see where the future goes in terms of is it Hall passes or do I start...

2697
01:55:51,340 --> 01:55:53,340
Do I unlock my inner...

2698
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:55,340
Like, it actually...

2699
01:55:55,340 --> 01:55:57,340
There was something kind of touching about you saying that my points...

2700
01:55:57,340 --> 01:55:59,340
Opinions have value.

2701
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:01,340
They do.

2702
01:56:01,340 --> 01:56:03,340
And you don't even know it.

2703
01:56:03,340 --> 01:56:05,340
You didn't even know it until today.

2704
01:56:05,340 --> 01:56:07,340
Look what I've learned.

2705
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:09,340
So, I thank C. Allen Kelly for voting me.

2706
01:56:09,340 --> 01:56:11,340
I thank the universe for choosing points for you.

2707
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:13,340
I thank the universe for choosing this for me.

2708
01:56:13,820 --> 01:56:17,820
And just in terms of there being no hard feelings about various ribbings,

2709
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:19,820
Merry Christmas, boys.

2710
01:56:19,820 --> 01:56:21,820
Oh my god.

2711
01:56:21,820 --> 01:56:23,820
Whoa!

2712
01:56:23,820 --> 01:56:25,820
There you are.

2713
01:56:25,820 --> 01:56:27,820
Thank you.

2714
01:56:27,820 --> 01:56:29,820
Thank you for enduring.

2715
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:31,820
Can we add these sort of apps right now?

2716
01:56:31,820 --> 01:56:33,820
Let's see your speed.

2717
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:35,820
This is the duel, you guys.

2718
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:37,820
While I wrap it up, the duel is who can get the points loaded.

2719
01:56:37,820 --> 01:56:39,820
Now, I was wondering if you even like this.

2720
01:56:39,820 --> 01:56:41,820
Or if you don't like gift cards because you don't get to earn points.

2721
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:44,300
I was like, this might be a problem.

2722
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:46,300
Maybe I don't get it.

2723
01:56:46,300 --> 01:56:48,300
I love gift cards.

2724
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:50,300
Wonderful.

2725
01:56:50,300 --> 01:56:52,300
I like gift cards as well.

2726
01:56:52,300 --> 01:56:54,300
That's been a common thing to talk about.

2727
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:56,300
I don't know if you can add this, Jason.

2728
01:56:56,300 --> 01:56:58,300
I'm not sure that you can.

2729
01:56:58,300 --> 01:57:00,300
I believe I've added...

2730
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:02,300
All right.

2731
01:57:02,300 --> 01:57:04,300
My points idea is with value.

2732
01:57:04,300 --> 01:57:06,300
I believe I've put gift cards in the app before.

2733
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:08,300
You can use it.

2734
01:57:08,300 --> 01:57:10,300
I'm sure you're sure to purchase.

2735
01:57:10,780 --> 01:57:12,780
I believe you can, but I don't know that for sure.

2736
01:57:12,780 --> 01:57:14,780
And you know what?

2737
01:57:14,780 --> 01:57:16,780
If it doesn't work out, then I've given you an incredible gift, Mike.

2738
01:57:16,780 --> 01:57:18,780
Which is something to complain about,

2739
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:20,780
about the Shore Points app.

2740
01:57:20,780 --> 01:57:22,780
You should be able to preload.

2741
01:57:22,780 --> 01:57:24,780
You got it?

2742
01:57:24,780 --> 01:57:26,780
Fuzzy in the background on this gift card thing.

2743
01:57:26,780 --> 01:57:28,780
Point Pleasant Shore Point.

2744
01:57:28,780 --> 01:57:30,780
Are the numbers revealed?

2745
01:57:30,780 --> 01:57:32,780
Or do you have to scratch off with a coin or something?

2746
01:57:32,780 --> 01:57:34,780
I've been scratching.

2747
01:57:34,780 --> 01:57:36,780
You can do it with your nail if you've got a nail.

2748
01:57:36,780 --> 01:57:38,780
I will cover the space.

2749
01:57:39,260 --> 01:57:41,260
Jason, how many points do you have?

2750
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:43,260
I have 95 right now, but I can only redeem it for a regular.

2751
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:45,260
You have 158.

2752
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:47,260
You can get a giant, I bet.

2753
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:49,260
I still can get it.

2754
01:57:49,260 --> 01:57:51,260
Yeah, I never claimed a giant.

2755
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:53,260
And you can get one more giant with this.

2756
01:57:53,260 --> 01:57:55,260
Guys, I hope you have a great holiday season

2757
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:57,260
full of soggy giants.

2758
01:57:57,260 --> 01:57:59,260
Which incidentally is also something

2759
01:57:59,260 --> 01:58:01,260
you can mobile order from Target.

2760
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:03,260
Get yourself a soggy giant.

2761
01:58:03,260 --> 01:58:05,260
It's neon blue and pink.

2762
01:58:05,260 --> 01:58:07,260
I love it.

2763
01:58:07,740 --> 01:58:09,740
As you guys continue your duel,

2764
01:58:09,740 --> 01:58:11,740
you survived Podcast the Ride.

2765
01:58:11,740 --> 01:58:13,740
Thanks for subscribing to Club 3.

2766
01:58:13,740 --> 01:58:15,740
Your bravery saved the podcast.

2767
01:58:15,740 --> 01:58:17,740
Well done, Freedom Fighters.

2768
01:58:17,740 --> 01:58:19,740
There I am saying the things that you guys

2769
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:21,740
forget to say every goddamn time.

2770
01:58:21,740 --> 01:58:23,740
Just read it.

2771
01:58:23,740 --> 01:58:25,740
Just read it.

2772
01:58:25,740 --> 01:58:27,740
Mike, there was one where you

2773
01:58:27,740 --> 01:58:29,740
forgot the web address of our Patreon.

2774
01:58:29,740 --> 01:58:31,740
Yeah, that was recently too.

2775
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:33,740
What happened?

2776
01:58:33,740 --> 01:58:35,740
I didn't even get to Indiana Jones 2.

2777
01:58:36,220 --> 01:58:38,220
There's so many things.

2778
01:58:38,220 --> 01:58:40,220
But for now, I will say

2779
01:58:40,220 --> 01:58:42,220
thank you for a great 2024.

2780
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:44,220
Thanks for lots of great suggestions.

2781
01:58:44,220 --> 01:58:46,220
I'm sorry I missed so many Club 3s

2782
01:58:46,220 --> 01:58:48,220
specifically, but I'm happy to be back here

2783
01:58:48,220 --> 01:58:50,220
learning, growing.

2784
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:52,220
And I'm so excited that in January

2785
01:58:52,220 --> 01:58:54,220
we will be back with Bugmane in tow

2786
01:58:54,220 --> 01:58:56,220
to kick things off right.

2787
01:58:56,220 --> 01:58:58,220
A great January inauguration

2788
01:58:58,220 --> 01:59:00,220
you might say.

2789
01:59:00,220 --> 01:59:02,220
For a great beautiful future to come.

2790
01:59:02,220 --> 01:59:04,220
How are you guys doing?

2791
01:59:04,700 --> 01:59:06,700
You have to add it in

2792
01:59:06,700 --> 01:59:08,700
when you make an order.

2793
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:10,700
When you make an order, you select

2794
01:59:10,700 --> 01:59:12,700
add promo.

2795
01:59:12,700 --> 01:59:14,700
Have I given you

2796
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:16,700
a bad present?

2797
01:59:16,700 --> 01:59:18,700
Where's the garbage?

2798
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:20,700
I'm throwing this card into it.

2799
01:59:20,700 --> 01:59:22,700
Fine, fine.

2800
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:24,700
Look what I get.
