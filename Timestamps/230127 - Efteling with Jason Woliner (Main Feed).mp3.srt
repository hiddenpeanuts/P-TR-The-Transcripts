1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Warning, the following podcast contains cherub faced garbage cans, goats sitting at a table,

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,260
Jason Sheridan's secret identity, and many calls to heed warnings.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,640
Jason Woolner returns to talk Efteling on today's podcast, The Ride.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,080
Welcome to podcast, The Ride, a theme park podcast, which today is your home for horrendous

7
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
mispronun...

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,080
Sorry.

9
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,080
You did you mispronounce it.

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
Nice.

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,080
Keep it in.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,080
Keep it in.

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,080
So insecure about the mispronounce.

14
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,720
I was going to say horrendous mispronunciations of Dutch words.

15
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,920
Yeah, but you're also English words.

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,920
Seemingly.

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,320
Well, shit, Scott Gardner here fucking up from the get go.

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,520
Mike Carlson making fun of me all the way.

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,640
Well, no, I'm saying this is a mistake that we must embrace it.

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,680
This is part of the reality of podcasts and people love to, as Jason said, people love

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,160
to hear how the sausage is made.

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
Yep.

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
Well, this is Jason Sheridan.

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,160
Hi.

25
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,120
I've noted that this has been said a lot lately and I've found that you guys saying how the

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,080
sausage gets made just means a mundane fact about how we're recording right now.

27
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,160
Oh, I see.

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,000
Just to go into how the sausage gets made, it's 57 degrees right now.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Right.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,920
And like, just interesting sausage making.

31
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,320
Jason's wearing shoes with a white Nike swoosh logo on them.

32
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,000
Very healthy people like hearing how the sausage is made.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What the sausage looks like.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,840
Tiny mistakes the sausage makes.

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,280
Scott, I looked that up too, because I'm like, I'm going to mispronounce a lot of this.

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
Yeah, we're screwed on this one.

37
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,920
But I will say that the park today has a very good English language website and in

38
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,880
the Netherlands, while the official language is Dutch, you often hear, it's very common

39
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,880
to hear French, German, English.

40
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,880
So.

41
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,920
Oh, so we got a lot of different languages we can screw up early.

42
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,880
We butcher the English language a couple times a week.

43
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,680
So this will be exciting.

44
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,600
Hey, you remember when I, what did I call the agave?

45
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
What did I call it?

46
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
A guave.

47
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,680
A U, yeah.

48
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,680
It's not.

49
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,840
That's maybe my least, my worst one, I think.

50
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,840
Or no, no, you know what it is?

51
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,840
Multiple times calling Jan Wenner Jan Winter from Rolling Stones.

52
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
Oh.

53
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,800
That's my most humiliating mispronunciation, I think.

54
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,480
How dare you sail the legacy of a boring man that, like in a few years, the last person

55
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,800
who knows who he is will be dead.

56
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,840
No one will need to know what his name is.

57
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,200
That's fair.

58
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,480
Let's bring in our guest who is here to talk about Efteling, a big one, legendary theme

59
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,840
park in the Netherlands.

60
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,840
And we're here with somebody who's been and he's also one of our favorite folks.

61
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,800
He's of course the director of Borat's subsequent movie film and the director and creative mind

62
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,800
behind Paul T. Goldman, a fantastic series on Peacock, all six episodes of which are

63
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,680
streaming right now.

64
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,680
It's Jason Walliner.

65
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,680
Thanks, Scott.

66
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,680
Thanks, guys.

67
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,680
Very happy to be back.

68
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Yeah, yeah.

69
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,160
Happy to have you back.

70
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,560
And also, and I'm glad that you're willing to come back also, just given some of the

71
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
recent weirdness.

72
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,640
I don't think I need to say this.

73
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,360
People have seen the headlines already.

74
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:39,440
But of course, I am being charged by the Santa Fe district attorney with involuntary defamation

75
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,160
for all the times that I've called you the Alec Baldwin of Podcast The Ride.

76
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,080
Well, you know, I thought, yeah, I didn't think we'd get into that.

77
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,960
I know, maybe we're not supposed to and we can cut this if we're not, if we're not, we'll

78
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,320
run it by a lawyer or something.

79
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,000
But to me, that feels like that's for lawyers to sort out.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,200
The trial will happen.

81
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,480
But you know, you and I here, that problem is not between us.

82
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,840
You know that I first said it meant to be in a complimentary way.

83
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,680
And look, it's you being charged by the Santa Fe detective or sheriff's office.

84
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,120
I mean, it's not me.

85
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,800
To me, when you say Alec Baldwin of Podcast The Ride, I think that means I'm probably

86
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,640
one of the noblest guests you've had on one of the best human beings.

87
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
Exactly.

88
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
Yes, yes.

89
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,640
A most humble, not a murderer.

90
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,000
You have to think the context of when it was said.

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,360
And this is so getting charged.

92
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,320
This is what I'm this is going to be my defense.

93
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,840
You're telling me my own defense.

94
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,680
You're a great father like him.

95
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,680
Great father.

96
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,680
Strong father.

97
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,280
You've got to get a couple more going.

98
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,720
You've got to get a few more in there.

99
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,720
Strong voicemail parenting history.

100
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,120
You call you have young children, but you still you set up a phone line to call them

101
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,640
just to leave them like great wonderful love notes.

102
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,200
The best way to distribute life lessons to your kids is through a voicemail when you

103
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,520
tell them what they are.

104
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,720
Whenever you think of something, just call, leave a memo.

105
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,800
And much like Alec Baldwin, you do a killer Trump impression.

106
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,000
We love to hear it says I don't want to do it.

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't want to do it.

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,280
You usually charge people to do it.

109
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
So we don't want to.

110
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
Yeah, no, I can't.

111
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,280
But thank you.

112
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,280
Thank you, Scott.

113
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,080
Yeah, no, I'm glad we can start through this anyway.

114
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
All right.

115
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,920
Well, to move from one thing that you're you're known on the podcast for to another the mainly

116
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,120
people have been listening for a long time know, you know, what is what is I think a

117
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,800
great episode of the show, which is our failed parks series is the first that you came and

118
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:48,000
talked to us the two ambitious episode where we had two entire episodes worth about just

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,040
one of the failed parks, Hard Rock Park.

120
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,080
Well, it was also and the Sid and Marty Croft land was part of that.

121
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

122
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
Yeah.

123
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,960
Which we just had to gun it through to get into.

124
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,600
I still feel bad about it.

125
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Yeah, yeah, I know.

126
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,040
We gave it the short end of the stick.

127
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
It's wonderful.

128
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,000
There's been video of it going around lately, I feel like of that that pinball ride, which

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
is so nuts.

130
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, really good quality video.

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

132
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

133
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Like shot a nice film.

134
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Yeah.

135
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
And I want to start talking.

136
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,640
I mean, I've been talking a lot about my favorite show Club Random a lot lately, but I want

137
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,240
to start stop talking about that and start talking about Sid Croft's Instagram Live,

138
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,840
where he interviews like Adam Carolla.

139
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
Oh, wow.

140
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,080
I like there's different shows I want to talk about.

141
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,480
You're telling me there is a there is a weird low budget online only show that landed Adam

142
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,080
Carolla, believe it or not.

143
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,080
That's right.

144
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,840
OK, but I bring I bring all this up to say I just got curious.

145
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,760
Like in the last few years, we have not checked in on the former site of Hard Rock Park, and

146
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,400
I wanted to see if there was any update that I could give you since you're here.

147
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,120
And there's a pretty exciting one.

148
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
Oh, wow.

149
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,480
I'm excited to share this.

150
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,760
I looked it up.

151
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,560
There's been activity on the site very recently.

152
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:12,520
There's been newspapers, squatters, by activity, I mean, piss and shit, every human piss and

153
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,520
shit everywhere.

154
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,200
No, I so you know, it's just been sitting dormant for a long time.

155
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,800
People go wander around there still.

156
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,520
I think it's really is squatting.

157
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,760
But that's all about to change this spot in Myrtle Beach, where Hard Rock Park used to

158
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
be.

159
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,840
The newspapers have been buzzing about something called Project Crestfield.

160
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,240
Big mysterious kind of like code name of movie.

161
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,840
So what is Project Crestfield going to be?

162
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,400
And now it has come out in just the last few months.

163
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,480
Project Crestfield is the the mission on the site of Hard Rock Park to turn it into a mass

164
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,480
grave.

165
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:51,480
Project Crestfield has seen tailor made to be like the defendant in this case.

166
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
Project Crestfield.

167
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,480
Sorry.

168
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,320
Prozdgiv attorney Erin Brockovich.

169
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,400
Project Crestfield is supplying Ukraine with tanks right now.

170
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,880
Sorry, Scott.

171
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
What is it?

172
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,880
No, no, no.

173
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,880
Very exciting.

174
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
The grand reveal.

175
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,240
It's going to be a FedEx distribution facility.

176
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,240
Let's go.

177
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,240
Yeah.

178
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,240
All right.

179
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,760
Taking a work out like out of the existing buildings that are like someone's office going

180
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,960
to be that Knights in White Satin ride.

181
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,840
They have not figured out like, OK, there is good news.

182
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,560
There is a light in your office.

183
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
Bad news.

184
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
It is a strobe light.

185
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,680
It's just flashing rainbow colors all day.

186
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,760
I don't know if we've said this on the show before, but and I don't I'm not going to say

187
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,200
anyone's name, so it's fine.

188
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,560
Listeners went into the site of the old Hard Rock Park and there was just it's sitting there.

189
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,320
Merchandise is just sitting strewn about on floors of buildings.

190
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,160
Brought us some merchandise, some other urban explorers, untouched, untouched merchandise.

191
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,440
Other urban explorers found a similar like dead drop of merchandise.

192
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:06,160
But then other people also found I think it's a Brighton Films maybe like was exploring

193
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,680
it and they found like we found the agreements from the Eagles.

194
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,560
Like we found the licensing agreement of like bands.

195
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,960
How fast did they leave this place?

196
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,440
It's like overnight.

197
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,520
He's like, just get the fuck out of here.

198
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,240
We got to go right now.

199
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
We got to go right now.

200
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,960
We are wanted in this state.

201
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,000
That's rock and roll, baby.

202
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Winston, the punk rock dog is just scurrying out trying to get through a door.

203
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,400
Fill the dog costume with whatever shit can fit in it.

204
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,080
Let's get in the car.

205
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,600
We need to move faster than Led Zeppelin the ride.

206
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,160
I've got a bunch of Coca-Cola syrup canisters and I'm going to resell them.

207
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,200
Let's recoup our losses.

208
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,680
They've started demolishing the facilities and as of October there were still big signs

209
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,880
that said Freestyle Music Park everywhere.

210
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,280
Like the second name of it.

211
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,080
But it's so it's starting to go finally.

212
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,000
But this next new chapter is going to begin and imagine the pride of the FedEx workers

213
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,240
knowing the history.

214
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,560
Can I ask the name Project Crestville?

215
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,240
Is this sort of like the Florida project where if people caught wind that it was a FedEx

216
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,720
all these businesses are going to pop up around it because they're so excited and they want

217
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,840
to keep the prices down from buying the land.

218
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
Oh yeah.

219
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
That's what it is, right?

220
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,000
Instead of just saying FedEx shipping center.

221
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,600
Maybe people are just as excited about like a FedEx as they are about like a Disney.

222
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,360
FedEx is one of the most popular shipping companies in the world.

223
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,840
Yeah they're pretty accessible though.

224
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
Top three.

225
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,840
Yeah they're around though.

226
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
What's number one?

227
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,880
Is it FedEx or is it the post office?

228
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,720
I don't think it's the post office.

229
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,600
They're not I don't think they're doing very well.

230
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Right?

231
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
I don't know.

232
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,400
Jason will figure it out.

233
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Yeah.

234
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,200
I know I think people are just excited that like a that there will be a business in the

235
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,960
Myrtle Beach area that doesn't fail within four months.

236
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
That's fair.

237
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,960
Yeah I can see that.

238
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,440
That's why the boom.

239
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:15,040
Anyway, just excited that you know the next chapter to the story of Hard Rock Park.

240
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,640
Well, that keeps rocking on.

241
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,640
But we're not here to talk about that.

242
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
We're here to talk about.

243
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
I need to cut you off Scott.

244
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,120
I have another thing I need to bring up because Jason is here.

245
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,720
Because Jason one of the last times I saw him something happened that was very embarrassing

246
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
to me that I brought up on the show before.

247
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
What was this?

248
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,320
And I would like we haven't really talked about it in a second.

249
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,600
So I know you do know it.

250
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,840
You'll know it as soon as I say it.

251
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,200
But you were there when I freaked out about the Minotaur.

252
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

253
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
As soon as you said the word freaked.

254
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

255
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
That's right.

256
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,480
And we this is not your fault that you were having a physical reaction.

257
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,120
You were afraid of the Minotaur.

258
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,560
Who could fucking blame you?

259
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,560
That's all it was.

260
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,520
There was no other dimension to it.

261
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,080
It was just fully that I wish you could see how silly I did see.

262
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,560
I remember I stayed.

263
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,700
Oh wait, you I stayed and then I walked through.

264
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,440
So if you don't watch us on video, how did you actually know the Minotaur?

265
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
We saw you at the end when we did.

266
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
Yeah.

267
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,840
And then I saw I don't know that you earned being in that picture.

268
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,240
I said I didn't want to do it.

269
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
And everyone said I should.

270
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,120
And I said, no, I don't want to be in the picture.

271
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
But I am in the picture.

272
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
Photoshop him out.

273
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
Somebody Photoshop him out.

274
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,080
There was an escape room event that happens where you would go in and solve little puzzles.

275
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,080
And it was called the Minotaur.

276
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,560
I forget something was the Minotaur was in a subtitle.

277
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,400
Yeah, it's like Escape the Minotaur.

278
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40,680
It was a Russian, I think, escape room that they had carted over to L.A.

279
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,840
Yeah.

280
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,560
And you're in a dungeon.

281
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
You're solving puzzles.

282
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,640
It's like halfway between an immersive play and an escape room where you're encountering

283
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,360
actors, you're running through things, you're doing tasks.

284
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,520
But then every once in a while, the lights will go out and the Minotaur will come and

285
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,880
try to kill you, try to take one member of your group.

286
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,560
But the thing that would happen every time the Minotaur would come is they would play

287
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,520
this early 2000s drum and bass music.

288
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,520
I remember.

289
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,520
Yeah.

290
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,920
And so it was so funny that it could be scary.

291
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,920
It was like the Minotaur was like a DJ coming to get you.

292
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,160
So it was like if they had scary music, I would have lost it.

293
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,280
But it was so silly, the music they played, that it was just like you're suddenly in a

294
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
club.

295
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,840
Yeah, I remember because what happened was as we were getting the explanation, we were

296
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,200
all wearing jumpsuits and we're all wearing masks.

297
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,240
And I have some sort of like clothing claustrophobia in addition to like I remember this now, a

298
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,960
darkness sort of like claustrophobia too.

299
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,200
So I'm sitting there, they turn the lights down a little bit.

300
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,540
I remember my vision kind of like shrinking and I'm like, no, no, no, no.

301
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,240
And so in the middle of this, right before we go in, I have to like raise my hand like

302
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,200
I'm back in third grade or something.

303
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,760
Excuse me.

304
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,720
I'm having like a panic attack or something.

305
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,920
I'm having like a, I think I said a mask, mask based panic attack.

306
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,360
And the person looked at me like, we've never had this happen before.

307
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,920
Like, just like, like, is he joking?

308
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
Is it serious?

309
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:18,000
And was like, oh, oh, and like they're doing like a whole, like a whole like voice and

310
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,920
stuff for the mood and the atmosphere.

311
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
Right.

312
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,560
Like, yes, and then we'll go in this and then you'll, you'll confront the minutes.

313
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,560
And I'm like, excuse me.

314
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,720
And they're like, oh, well, you can just sit over, just sit over here.

315
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,720
So in my mind now I'm recovering from whatever this anxiety was and I'm hearing the dumbest

316
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,120
sounding shit.

317
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,960
Feet away.

318
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,520
In my mind, there was some massive dungeon urine.

319
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,520
It's feet away.

320
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
I'm hearing yells.

321
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,800
I'm hearing the whole thing play out.

322
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,240
I'm like, this is like as big as a garage.

323
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,240
Yes.

324
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,240
I'm sitting there waiting for you guys.

325
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,240
And then you guys came on.

326
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,240
Everyone was very nice.

327
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,240
No one was mean to me.

328
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,720
No one was even judging you.

329
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
No, I know.

330
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
It's not your fault.

331
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,000
But I'm just saying this is, we haven't, we haven't re-brought, I mean, we've brought

332
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,160
it up a little bit, but it's something now I have to conquer.

333
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
It's become like a mountain.

334
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,160
Let's go back.

335
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,160
So we're going to have to go back.

336
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,560
What are we, is, has this, has this come back?

337
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,560
Is there a chance?

338
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,240
I think this company was doing like a revolving, yeah, they had a couple of escape rooms at

339
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
this one place.

340
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,640
So yeah, we, whenever you want, let's go face your fears.

341
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,320
We will go face my fears.

342
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,640
Well, first things first, just listen to a lot of early 2000s drum and bass, psych yourself

343
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
up that way.

344
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,640
That's a good idea.

345
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
Which shouldn't be a chore.

346
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,680
Was that part of the deal?

347
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,480
If it was carted over from Russia, did they have to like, we have an ironclad deal with

348
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,480
the composer.

349
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,480
Something like that.

350
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,760
Yeah, no one in America would have made this choice.

351
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,280
When the lights were on and then I walked through, I said this before on the show, the

352
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,800
Minotaur's just standing there.

353
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,440
The costume couldn't have looked shittier.

354
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,880
Well, yeah, the lights were on.

355
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Well, of course.

356
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,320
I'm just saying like, there was, it was so much more embarrassing to see what it was.

357
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,680
And again, I wasn't actually scared of the Minotaur.

358
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,960
I was scared of the dark.

359
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,640
Let's be clear.

360
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,200
I wasn't scared of the Minotaur.

361
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,440
It's more reasonable to be scared of a Minotaur.

362
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
I know.

363
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
I was scared.

364
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,320
I mean, literally, I think I was scared of the dark.

365
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,480
And so, hey, you know what happens?

366
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,480
It happens.

367
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,200
No, no one was making fun of you.

368
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,200
No, I know.

369
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,400
I did not think that, but it is one of the most humiliating things that's happened to

370
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,640
me in the last 10 years of my life.

371
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
Well, that's good then.

372
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,840
That means that really humiliating things haven't happened to you.

373
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
That's a good point.

374
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
It's a very good point.

375
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,760
We've done a bunch of live shows and never in any of them have your pants fallen down,

376
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,320
you tripped, and then the audience all vocalized, hey, look at his tiny dick.

377
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,800
That does not happen.

378
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,920
You've successfully kept your pants on.

379
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,920
That's true.

380
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,160
We're in the dark about how big your dick is.

381
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
That's true.

382
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
It could be huge.

383
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
They don't know.

384
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
Jason, did you know they don't know how big it is?

385
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
Oh, no, I saw it that night.

386
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,160
Yeah, because you came on and I didn't have my pants on.

387
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
Yeah, yeah.

388
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
He said you had to calm down.

389
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:00,640
Sorry, just cleaning up here, cleaning the shit off of my dick from when I shit my pants.

390
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,040
I was changing my own diaper is what was happening.

391
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
Sitting on a booth.

392
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
Oh, yeah.

393
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,080
And then that's when the other employee from the other one came out and looked at me like,

394
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,080
oh my God, are you okay?

395
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,080
And I went, yeah, I'm fine.

396
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,080
I'm fine.

397
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,080
I'm fine.

398
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,880
No, he probably thought something really bad had happened.

399
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,800
We have no training for this.

400
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
It has not happened.

401
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,320
We're told not to worry about it.

402
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
It will not happen.

403
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,480
We're getting paid by PayPal and the head of this often forgets.

404
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,480
Anyway, you feel okay?

405
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,680
Yeah, yeah, I feel okay.

406
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,920
I'm going to call my shot Minotaur.

407
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,920
We're going back to the Minotaur.

408
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
Okay.

409
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,920
I hope there is a Minotaur to go back to.

410
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
Let's do it.

411
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,760
And it'll be good because Jason's coming with us.

412
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,760
No, we are.

413
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,760
Yes.

414
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,760
I mean, sure.

415
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,760
Yeah, no.

416
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,360
Our good friend Eva is big into that stuff and our friend Landon.

417
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,840
We should get a group together.

418
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,080
We're going to get a group and do it.

419
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,080
Maybe I have to do it.

420
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,080
I don't know.

421
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,640
Maybe I'll be scared of the Minotaur just due to the...

422
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,740
Now you have it in your head that during the intro part, that's the time to freak out.

423
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,320
So maybe it'll make it come true.

424
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,080
And if they hide something later that's actually the scary thing, like an Ernest doll or something,

425
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,840
if it's anything like Ernest goes to Splash Mountain, then I'm out.

426
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,280
Okay, we got to get into the mega part that we're here.

427
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,800
We're here to talk about that also is like, I'm sure we've all had the thought of this

428
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
is a big one.

429
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,120
We're not going to be able to get to everything about Efteling.

430
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,880
So we should just take the pressure off for it to be a definitive Efteling episode.

431
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,800
Unless, Jason, that feels rude to you though, Jason, to like, if we're telling you this

432
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,120
isn't going to be the...

433
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,640
Would you like us to close it out and never talk about it again?

434
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,640
No, no, please.

435
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,560
Let me contribute just a little part to whatever this becomes.

436
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,000
You're the trailblazer, you're the early adopter.

437
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,920
Yes, the first guest, and I'm sure we've had people on who have been there, but you're

438
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,160
the first to grab it and talk about it.

439
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
I'm so honored.

440
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah, no, I think our friend Marissa Strickland has been there.

441
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Oh yeah, sure.

442
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh, bro.

443
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yeah, yeah.

444
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

445
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,120
I went there in 2016, back when it had a lot of attractions that I recently found out while

446
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:22,640
I was doing research for this are very thankfully not in the same state or there anymore.

447
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

448
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,640
That seemed to be one of your...

449
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,640
Maybe can we get into that in this episode?

450
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,960
It just seemed like, yes, what you can bring to the table.

451
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,240
Yeah, this was one of your knee jerks about talking about Efteling was some of the somewhat

452
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,240
offensive things.

453
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,160
And then, yeah, we started looking...

454
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,440
I think they're all gone, unless they've like...

455
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,680
I think they're gone, but they were very...

456
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
It was a process.

457
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
They were unhappy about it.

458
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
Yeah, we should get into it.

459
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,720
But also it's not...

460
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,080
I was like, oh yeah, we should talk about Efteling, the racist Dutch Disneyland.

461
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,920
But in researching and remembering it, that's way more than that.

462
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,920
It's great.

463
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,960
It's one of the best theme parks in the world, probably.

464
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,960
It's crazy.

465
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
This is a question.

466
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Is it because...

467
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
I've never...

468
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,760
I've almost stayed away from looking at it too much in a spoilers way.

469
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,520
And probably we thought, do we not cover this until we've been?

470
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,480
But now, there are children in the picture.

471
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,480
Travel is hard.

472
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,480
I don't know when we're going to go.

473
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,480
I would love to go.

474
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,480
I'd really love to go.

475
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,960
But let's at least start and dive in.

476
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,960
This is a good excuse to link.

477
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,840
I'm saying it's worth leaving your family to go just for a few days.

478
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,880
This was Mike's master plan, I feel like, all along, was to like, now we have a reason.

479
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,040
We can say it's for work.

480
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Leave for anything.

481
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,880
Do any dumb shit.

482
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
That's right.

483
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
2017...

484
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I said it to him.

485
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You could like, go to...

486
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,440
Because in researching this, I was looking at what's that, Europa...

487
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
What's the one in Germany?

488
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
Europa Park?

489
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
Yeah, like, that looks crazy too.

490
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,440
Yeah.

491
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,720
I might try to go there this year.

492
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
Yeah, yeah.

493
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,040
The ones we did a little like, European vacation month and that place, Fantasia Land, has been

494
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
in my head ever since.

495
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,040
And then like, the cruddy ones.

496
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,440
Yeah, the cruddy one I'm really excited about.

497
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,440
And Popeye Village.

498
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,440
Oh yeah.

499
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
In Malta.

500
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
Oh yeah.

501
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
Yeah.

502
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I remember that one from the movie that I didn't tear down.

503
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yes.

504
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It looks crazy.

505
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And there are Popeyes walking around.

506
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yeah, they like, danced to pop music.

507
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,440
They danced to early 2003 music.

508
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,440
Just like Popeye.

509
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
That's right.

510
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:28,520
But yeah, I think we'd love to go, but I basically, it had just always been like, this legend

511
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
in my...

512
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,480
We've only heard it in this utterly breathless way.

513
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,480
And seeming...

514
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:40,400
What I thought about it was grand scale, you know, things being done in this ornate way,

515
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,320
full of animatronics, full of original IP.

516
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,000
We got no movie tie-ins.

517
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,080
The closest thing to IP are fairy tales and stuff, but it seems like, basically, I've

518
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,840
always just heard it talked about in the same breath as Tokyo DisneySea in terms of huge

519
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,840
scale.

520
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,680
You can't believe, like there's none of the cheapening out that might happen in the American

521
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,360
parks.

522
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,480
And I just always hoped that it lived up to that legend.

523
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,080
Everything I saw made me think, yes, but Jason, you're the person to ask.

524
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,040
It really fit, like just thinking back, you know, it's not like you're walking past gift

525
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
shops and everything.

526
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:23,600
Like you're really walking through like a forest full of like incredible, like multi-million

527
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,360
dollar dark rides and roller coasters.

528
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:33,960
So it was, I guess, built in 1952 as it was a park and then they added this like fairy

529
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,440
tale walkthrough, which they still have.

530
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,160
And so you just walk around a forest and then you'll find, you know, a talking tree or like

531
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,120
a guy with a long neck or...

532
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,080
But there's a lot of like weird European fairy tales that I'm sure none of us have ever heard

533
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,080
of like...

534
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,360
And you'll just like find a house and look in and there'll be like a family of like goats

535
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,960
in human clothing sitting around the dinner table, like moving and talking to each other.

536
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:59,680
Like it's really creepy and weird, like as fairy tales are, but it's not...

537
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,600
It's just like, it's a good place to wander around.

538
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,400
And yeah, the rides are crazy.

539
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,400
I sort of grew up from there and then they made this like haunted mansion kind of thing.

540
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,800
I forgot what year that was, but yeah, no, it just, it seems to have like kind of just

541
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,600
grown organically over a long period of time.

542
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
And it doesn't feel...

543
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:25,760
I mean, I went there, I think off season and I went there on my honeymoon and me and my

544
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,480
wife, we just bounced around Europe and I was like, we got to go to this place.

545
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,960
So we were in Amsterdam.

546
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,060
I think you take like a two hour bus ride down.

547
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:38,480
We stayed there for I think two nights.

548
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,480
And you stayed at Efteling?

549
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
Yeah.

550
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,480
In the Efteling hotel?

551
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
Yeah.

552
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,720
There's like an enchanted village of hotels and you're around a lake with a little castle

553
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,000
on an island in the middle of it.

554
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,400
And you just walk around and then we broke into the park at night.

555
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,600
We hopped the fence and just went right back in and just walked around.

556
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
It wasn't anything crazy.

557
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,080
Like you couldn't get deep into the ride buildings, but like there was no guards.

558
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
No one cared.

559
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
Whoa.

560
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,440
What were you near at that point?

561
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,600
What was the, what was the sneaking around part?

562
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
I don't know.

563
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,600
We just wanted to see what it was like at night and I guess it closed pretty early.

564
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,440
But I was just looking through all my photos and yeah, I have a picture of Becky, my wife

565
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,360
jumping, jumping over the fence.

566
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,640
And then I think I was afraid to take more pictures.

567
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,560
But like, yeah, it's just a cool, it's a cool, crazy place.

568
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,960
It's yeah, it's a, there's lots of stuff to it.

569
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
Yeah, geez.

570
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,240
I, we're, we're, we're to dive in even.

571
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,200
We can start picking up like, well, I mean, anything general, you kind of gave us the

572
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
general history.

573
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Mike, what do you think?

574
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,800
I was just gonna say like the, if I'm correct, like where it is geographically feels also

575
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,360
kind of like a special, am I wrong?

576
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,280
About this.

577
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,280
It feels like you have to travel.

578
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,280
It's not near anything.

579
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,280
Yeah.

580
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,760
No, it was hours away from a few hours away from Amsterdam.

581
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,080
I feel like doesn't that add to the mystique of it?

582
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
Definitely.

583
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
Yeah.

584
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
Yeah.

585
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,160
It's in a pine forest, like a real like very wooded pine forest.

586
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,240
It does seem like when the views that you get from anything with a, with a drop or anything

587
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,240
where you go up high, it is not like, it's not like looking into no offense, Mike, Buena

588
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
Park.

589
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,000
It's you're maybe getting a stronger, a more beautiful view.

590
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,560
I think, I mean, it just depends on your taste.

591
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:24,960
If you like trees and vistas, but if you like seeing the big rock and bruise guitar or the

592
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
claim jumper that's.

593
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Is there a rock?

594
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,960
Yeah, but you get to see long neck.

595
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,040
You get to see my man long neck and the paper gobblers.

596
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,040
Paper gobblers.

597
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,240
So there's a, all the trash cans are these chubby kids that you walk by and you hear

598
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,720
they like play a recording.

599
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,560
They're like begging you to put paper in their mouth and other trash.

600
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,560
Yeah.

601
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:53,360
I made an effort to look up the name of this one because, and this like, cause I, and I,

602
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,720
my guess would have been way the hell off.

603
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,200
Wait, can I even do it?

604
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,240
I tried to write it out phonetically.

605
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,640
Hola Bola Heish.

606
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,080
Hola Bola Heish is the name of the, the paper guy.

607
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,720
Heish is how you, is how you say G I J S.

608
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,920
This is why we're screwed pronunciation wise.

609
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,440
I saw one video where they were calling them Holy Boli guys.

610
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,720
That's probably the translation.

611
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,720
Yeah.

612
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
Yeah.

613
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
Holy Boli guys.

614
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,080
I mean, I like that better.

615
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:31,160
But yeah, I saw it's in, it seems like it's an entire little garden of little like characters

616
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:37,600
with cherubic faces and gaping wide mouth holes that all, if you, I mean, and you fed

617
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,480
them I assume you put something in there.

618
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,920
You feed them your garbage and they, you know, thank you.

619
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:48,440
I saw the copy somewhere, feed them with all the papers you've got or else they'll yell

620
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,320
a lot.

621
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,360
And it's all manner of characters.

622
00:26:53,360 --> 00:27:00,160
This kind of like, you know, cherubic man boys, but then like giant twins who cry because

623
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,080
they don't have paper.

624
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:09,240
And I, here I have a, let's just listen to the sweet sounds of what I'm going to borrow

625
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,120
the Holy Boli guys.

626
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,120
Let's hear some Holy Boli guys for a second.

627
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:24,400
I guess paper here.

628
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,280
That sounds like it unlocks the Manchurian candidate.

629
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,360
Like it unlocks some sort of programming.

630
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,520
There might be a listener somewhere who's been activated.

631
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,960
He's going to kill a politician right now.

632
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,600
Here's a couple more, all variety of pleasant sounds.

633
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:50,480
What the list is this technically ASMR?

634
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,160
Could be depending on your taste.

635
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,320
If you're psychotic, the, the, what you got with the listener is not seeing also are these

636
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,560
like gigantic helm, these perfectly round helm mouths.

637
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,280
So maybe given current company, I should ask, are the Holy Boli guys cute?

638
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,760
I love all the creatures.

639
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,720
Well, but that's not the answer.

640
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,000
That's not the answer to the question.

641
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Yes.

642
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,440
Do you think baby heish is baby heish who we're looking at?

643
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,520
And let me play the clip and then you can determine cute or not.

644
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,280
It's a giant baby with like a, like a mushroom hat.

645
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:44,280
Yeah, there's a whole like family tree of like, this is, this is the one.

646
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
This is the sun.

647
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,280
What is Jason?

648
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,680
I'm waiting on the answer to the question.

649
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,640
I mean, I think they're pretty cute.

650
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,640
All right.

651
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:58,560
For a trash can for stuff that's like, in the scheme of things.

652
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,560
Baby Aladar is cute.

653
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,040
Baby Grinch to me is cute.

654
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,480
Is this baby cute?

655
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
I think they're pretty cute.

656
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,160
You know what?

657
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,160
I'll qualify.

658
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,160
I'll say, I'll say no.

659
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
All right.

660
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
You say no.

661
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,160
That's a scary baby.

662
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,800
It's important to hear these from you sometimes to know you're being honest.

663
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,840
I like the baby though.

664
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,160
I do like the, I would love to feed any of these babies.

665
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,400
I would love to hear these papyrhirs in person.

666
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,960
Wait, I think this is the most horrifying one.

667
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,080
This kind of like giant, this like 50 year old man looking guy.

668
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,160
You think that's cute?

669
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,440
They just say long to eat paper.

670
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,000
That's all they crave, you know?

671
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
That's what's cute about it.

672
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,480
It keeps asking, not once are simple, you see.

673
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
Yeah.

674
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,080
I think in the con trying to contextualize, like Jason, as you said, a European-

675
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,480
If you need context for why it's cute, I think it's not cute.

676
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,520
Yeah, I think you guys have to say cute or no.

677
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,520
There's a different standard.

678
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,760
A European fairy tale is often a lot more dark or grim.

679
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,760
So for a European fairy tale, it's cute.

680
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,440
By American standard, I mean, Disney is soft enough.

681
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:10,560
If that was in America, okay, the hubbub is, if that was in America and there was no like

682
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,000
trash component to it, would you still think it was cute?

683
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,200
I will at least go to intriguing, but I think-

684
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,200
Oh, see, that's it.

685
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,200
It's nice or not cute?

686
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
I'm not moving the trash.

687
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Do you think long neck is cute?

688
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,200
Do you like long neck?

689
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,200
I don't like long neck.

690
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,200
I'm a little scared of long neck.

691
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,200
I love long neck.

692
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,640
I'm a little scared of long neck.

693
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:34,240
The cutest thing in Efteling is more disturbing than the most disturbing thing it is.

694
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,240
Yeah, that's right.

695
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,240
Yeah, for sure.

696
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:43,040
Like it's just, there's something inherent about European like caricatures that are just

697
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,040
grotesque always.

698
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,040
Yeah.

699
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,040
Like there's always, they're always like just disgusting inherently.

700
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,600
Like nothing, like they don't have that kind of like any of those like hallmarks of cuteness,

701
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,880
like big eyes or smooth skin.

702
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:03,080
Yeah, or like symmetrical, everything's bulbous and like heads are like plunging off of necks

703
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,540
and out of clothes.

704
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:10,680
Baby looks like an 80 year old man and that's as good as they can do.

705
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,360
Which part of the history of it, I don't think I, maybe I don't have the name, but the like,

706
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,280
the initial, oh no, Anton Peake.

707
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:25,320
From 52 to 74, everything here was designed by Anton Peake, who was an illustrator of

708
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:30,240
terrifying fairy tales in the Netherlands and probably elsewhere in Europe.

709
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:37,240
So it has, everything physicalized has the feel of the like too detailed, too many lines,

710
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,160
terrifying fairy tale drawings.

711
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:46,560
Yeah, and they, everyone, like the guy who took over after him is named Ton Van Deve

712
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Van.

713
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,840
What is that right?

714
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,120
Ton Van Deve Van?

715
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,360
Ton Van Deve Van, yeah.

716
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:59,040
He from like the 70s to like 2002 was like the guy.

717
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,040
This is not a tour.

718
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,040
And he retired in 2002.

719
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,040
Yeah.

720
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,040
Everything, like basically two guys.

721
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,680
Well, he's kind of overseeing everything.

722
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:11,760
And I was like, I was saying to you, Jason, before we did this, like it all, this whole

723
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:21,200
park feels like an alternate dimension Disneyland where like the peaks of the place are really

724
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:27,140
similar to Disneyland's like started in the fifties was like, you know, little fun things

725
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,340
for little kids, charming.

726
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:33,560
But then in the seventies, it ramps up and expands and it's roller coasters.

727
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:38,960
And the original guys are no, are no longer there, but it gets taken over by the new wave

728
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,160
Like Ton Van Deve Van is alternate universe Tony Baxter.

729
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
Tony Baxter.

730
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,720
Two of them knew each other.

731
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,120
They were friends.

732
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,840
And Tony Baxter, like always pointed to Efteling, said Efteling's great, helped it win a Thea

733
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,840
Award.

734
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,080
Consulted them before they did Disneyland Paris, I believe.

735
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,080
Really?

736
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,080
I saw that.

737
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,080
Yeah.

738
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,080
Wow.

739
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,080
Wow.

740
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,080
And then, and then like, and due to this guy.

741
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,080
You consulted them.

742
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,080
What's it like being a theme park in Europe?

743
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,200
Any advice?

744
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
You need to make it.

745
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,200
Thanks.

746
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:15,360
You need to see the horror.

747
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,360
You need to up the grotesqueries.

748
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,520
That's the, that's the, I've said this before, Tony Baxter talking about that.

749
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,880
Like there's all these like European rules that he talks about that I'm still a little

750
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,800
suspicious of them actually being rules.

751
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,760
Like he's like, the French don't understand funny and scary.

752
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,240
They just understand scary or funny.

753
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,240
And I'm like, is that true?

754
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,040
He says it with authority.

755
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
So I go, Oh, I believe that.

756
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,400
And then I think about it for a second and I go, Oh, maybe was there like ever a Jerry

757
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,800
Lewis ghost movie?

758
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,880
I don't know.

759
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,600
I feel like he must have run away from a ghost at some point.

760
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,680
But they thought in France they found it scary.

761
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
Yeah.

762
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
They were right.

763
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
It was, it was played.

764
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,680
Yeah.

765
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,680
It was played.

766
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,680
It was a serious ghost movie starring Jerry Lewis.

767
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,680
Even though he's yelling.

768
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,680
Yeeeah!

769
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,560
He was a guy wearing a sheet, but it was no laughs.

770
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,120
No played for no laughs.

771
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:13,600
But basically like because of this guy, much like Disney in Tony Baxter's run, the 80s

772
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,200
and the 90s are fantastic for like that.

773
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,440
That's something I didn't know about the history is like, are these, is it all attractions

774
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,260
that are grandfathered in from the 60s and that are classic?

775
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:28,080
And in fact, no, they add something new and incredible, like at least every two years,

776
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,080
if not more.

777
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,000
Like so many of the great stuff here is very recent.

778
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,040
Yeah, like recent dark rides that you would, I feel like would fool you into thinking it

779
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,000
was there for 50 years.

780
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Yeah.

781
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Yeah.

782
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,360
Let me, before I get to newer things though, original classic charming stuff, one of them

783
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,240
will not try to say the Dutch version.

784
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,840
The American version, the English version is the, it's a donkey from the table, the

785
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,480
ass and the stick.

786
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,680
Is that the donkey that shits gold coins?

787
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,680
That's right.

788
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,280
Did you see that?

789
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Did you do this?

790
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,280
Did you get gold?

791
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,280
Yeah.

792
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,280
Yeah.

793
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,280
We got a token.

794
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,280
Yeah.

795
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,280
Kids, kids gather around the donkey.

796
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,280
I think it's actually plastic, but yeah, I know it, it does that.

797
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,280
That's cool.

798
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,280
That's great.

799
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,640
I like it's like, everything's like a little more like it's, it's a little edgier than

800
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:24,280
American parts of being a little body, little body or down to what would you classify this

801
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,000
as body that like in, in articles that were like, yeah, see, it's a little more European.

802
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,560
One of the things they mentioned is that there's Ariel, this little mermaid.

803
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,360
She just, she's a topless.

804
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,360
Fully topless.

805
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,360
Yeah.

806
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,320
Well, and now European standards, like Jason was saying that isn't maybe body, that's just

807
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,320
normal.

808
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,320
That's fully closed.

809
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,320
Yeah.

810
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,320
By European standards.

811
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,320
Right.

812
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,480
They managed to get more naked than regular people.

813
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
Yeah.

814
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,480
Yeah.

815
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
Yeah.

816
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,720
And American, yes, I am a little offended by it, but sure.

817
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,720
If it's Europe.

818
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,880
In terms of body, can we get into the carnival festival?

819
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,880
A little early for that.

820
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:09,400
Some of the compilation videos I watched sort of gloss over carnival.

821
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
I can show.

822
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,400
Yeah.

823
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
I have a video.

824
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,120
I recorded the whole thing because I was so blown away by it.

825
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:20,440
So basically they have their own fully a knockoff of it's a small world.

826
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,120
That was one of the two extremely racist, right?

827
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,560
It's like a very racist.

828
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,760
It's a small world where the, you go through parts of Africa and Asia that are just like

829
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,400
jaw-droppingly shocking.

830
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,200
And they did remove this, I think in what, 2017 or something recently.

831
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,040
Still in 2017, they figured it out.

832
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,040
So that's good.

833
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:49,480
Oh, he got this was a different time.

834
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,040
Pre pandemic.

835
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,600
It's world was different.

836
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:58,400
I don't want to specifically describe what you saw.

837
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,220
All I can say is that it's like, okay, it's, they aren't even, everything is scarier than

838
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,340
the small world dolls.

839
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:11,240
It's like everything is huge and bulbous and just big circles and exaggerated features.

840
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,480
And I will leave it to the listener to think about or don't think about it.

841
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,160
But everyone could not think about it.

842
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:23,200
But I think what was not changes in the France section, there's definitely a sex worker standing

843
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,560
on the corner, trying to pick up a client.

844
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,560
Wow.

845
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,560
There's a, this I like, this is good.

846
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,400
Knott's Berry farm has sex workers.

847
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,440
You wouldn't see that in a small, it's a small world.

848
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,920
I think the Dutch are more open about all parts of society.

849
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,920
90 minutes from Amsterdam.

850
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,920
You know?

851
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,920
Yeah, no, exactly.

852
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,920
Yeah, I know.

853
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,040
Not to jump her out, but do not let Palti Goldman know about this to make sure he never

854
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,040
sets foot in this.

855
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:04,760
I, it like, the ride besides these things, it's like, it's definitely a lot more, it

856
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:10,400
seems a lot more like claptrapy and annoying, even then it's a small world, which famously

857
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,360
gets shit for being an annoying song.

858
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,440
But this seems like a lot more grating.

859
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,960
Am I wrong?

860
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,480
Maybe it was different to be there.

861
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:27,800
I was just in shock going through not expecting the Africa or Asia sections that I was not

862
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,800
bored.

863
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,800
I wrote it again.

864
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,160
I was, I couldn't believe that was 2016.

865
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,160
I could not believe that was real.

866
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,920
So I know, I think they closed it and they removed, they said about a hundred dollars

867
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,920
and redid it.

868
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,120
And I think 20,

869
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,800
Only a hundred dollars were offensive.

870
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,800
This was 2019.

871
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,800
So this was only four years ago.

872
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,800
A little over so.

873
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,320
Two hundred were perfectly passable.

874
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,560
But there were two rides that absolutely should never have existed.

875
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,880
Or one could say needed an update.

876
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,520
And so the other one was way like more offensive.

877
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,280
It was called Monsieur Cannibal.

878
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:15,840
It was like the tea cup, rip off the tea cups ride except with a just horrifying caricature

879
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,240
of an African person.

880
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,240
Just the craziest thing you've ever seen.

881
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:27,200
And when they changed Carnival Festival, the small world one, they made a point to be like,

882
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,880
we're not changing the other one.

883
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:37,400
And they were like, look, some people, I read an article where the quote was like, we understand

884
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,520
some people are offended by this because they did not grow up with this ride.

885
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,520
I was like, well, that's not why.

886
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,520
That's not a good rationale.

887
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,520
It's the most incriminating thing I've ever seen.

888
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,520
If you grew up with this awful thing, you would understand.

889
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,000
Also, they said when they changed this thing, and I mean, like, I mean, I don't know if

890
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
you guys have seen this picture.

891
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
It's the craziest thing you've ever seen.

892
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And you're all, the ride vehicles are the, the, the, yeah, you're being cooked by a cannibal.

893
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:09,600
You're spinning around this cannibal character that's, it's like, you know, you won't believe

894
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,600
what it looks like.

895
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,600
But, um, and you had no, you didn't know this was coming out.

896
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
No, no, I didn't know going in.

897
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,400
But they said, a spokesperson said, we have to keep moving with the times, emphasizing

898
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,640
that the attraction is over 30 years old.

899
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,640
Over 30?

900
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,640
Ancient.

901
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,640
That's not, this was younger than us.

902
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,640
It's not that old.

903
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,640
It's not old.

904
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
Jesus.

905
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,640
It's not just a different time.

906
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,280
It's not just a different time.

907
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,280
It was a different time on top of a different time, on top of a different time.

908
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,520
They, uh, consulted with Disney PR on how to run.

909
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,760
They talked to the Splash Mountain people who ran interference for decades.

910
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,120
And they're like, what do we say?

911
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:49,720
And it's like, let me tell you, if you didn't grow up with that, a lot of these defenses

912
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:56,880
also seem like, isn't, isn't a Christmas thing in, in Amsterdam involve blackface?

913
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,880
Yes.

914
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,400
Pete, something Pete, that character.

915
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,080
Oh no, you don't understand that Santa's helpers.

916
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,080
And it's like, what?

917
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,080
Yeah.

918
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
I don't understand.

919
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,080
No.

920
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,800
They just keep saying the same.

921
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,240
Let me explain it again.

922
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,040
Black Pete is the name.

923
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,040
Is it really?

924
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,040
Oh, all right.

925
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,040
Yeah.

926
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,480
So you look up black Pete.

927
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:23,200
I mean, the Dutch have a history of extreme racism.

928
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,120
I would say that's an accurate statement, but yeah, they all go in blackface and wear

929
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,200
like curly haired wigs.

930
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,040
I mean, it's so yeah, that's the culture.

931
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,040
And so I guess you could see why they were like, what, why, why would we change this?

932
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,040
It's fun.

933
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,000
Well, and that when it was finally to this one was a 2021 change.

934
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Yeah.

935
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,840
So eventually finally got rid of a Monsieur Cannonball in a.

936
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,160
Which had a song on it.

937
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,200
Also, like an old French song that played that must help.

938
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,200
Oh yeah.

939
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,560
A French song from the fifties with the same title and message.

940
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,280
Yeah, they were cool with their colonialism for sure.

941
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,960
This yeah, 2021.

942
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,720
Yeah, it's wild.

943
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:11,040
And then like, here's the thing that in the fallout of this, I read this and I thought,

944
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,240
well, things are kind of the same everywhere, aren't they?

945
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,720
In a way, because you can woke cancel culture is ruining everything.

946
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,720
Right, Scott?

947
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,240
Here comes the rant.

948
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,240
Yes.

949
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,720
Welcome to Clor Random.

950
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,320
It's a randomization of podcast.

951
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,320
Right.

952
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,520
So let's bring in Adam Carolla at this point, Adam.

953
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,800
We've been drinking man.

954
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,280
Greer this whole time.

955
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,280
And you know.

956
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:45,360
No, this they took this ride out and most people are like, OK, we are finally stepping

957
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:51,960
up to the times here, except for right wing politician Geert Wilders, who tweets angry

958
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:57,080
stuff about how they're giving into politically correct, inclusive, lefty nonsense.

959
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,600
And I'm like, well, I guess, wow, across an ocean, it is the same bullshit.

960
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,120
Yeah.

961
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,360
DeSantis and woke Disney.

962
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,560
And we have DeSantis and they have Geert Wilders.

963
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,360
There is one of these everywhere.

964
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,880
You have the fan art for Splash Mountain.

965
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,120
This is rare lives matter, which I saw today.

966
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,120
Good Lord.

967
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,120
Wow.

968
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,760
Oh, yeah.

969
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,600
Boy, yeah, it's been a wild little little week.

970
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:29,960
I mean, they didn't have to do that public execution of rare rabbits in critter country

971
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,600
this week. That was a little much firing squad.

972
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,720
And you know, Disney no smoking, so they wouldn't even give them a cigarette on the way out.

973
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,440
Let's do an empty costume.

974
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,440
Don't make somebody.

975
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,880
What's done is done, though.

976
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,600
And that it's you know what?

977
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,160
They didn't declare him dead on site.

978
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,560
Rare lives matter.

979
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,120
Off the body off site.

980
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:52,680
That's what they do.

981
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,600
Their lives matter.

982
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:53,960
Wow.

983
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,680
Human being.

984
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,480
That's the one that really did that.

985
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,440
That's the one that really made me go, oh, like, exhale.

986
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,800
I don't the TikTok screen grab of like the woman holding a baby.

987
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:09,880
That one's like, oh, I got to tell them the ride they were named after is closed.

988
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,320
And what was that?

989
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,360
What was the name?

990
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,360
What does that mean?

991
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,120
It's going to be hard for that kid when they show up in elementary school

992
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,600
and have to tell everyone their name is Uncle Remus.

993
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:25,640
Oh, I have the real answer.

994
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,320
It was the name.

995
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:27,480
Yeah.

996
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,200
Briar.

997
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,320
It's Briar.

998
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,480
Yikes.

999
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,600
What?

1000
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,720
Yikes is right.

1001
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:38,400
Beyond the connotation like that, that you would name a child.

1002
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,440
That I don't know.

1003
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,640
It sounds like dryers.

1004
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,200
The ice cream.

1005
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,880
So they can get Brian, which is a name that's probably at the hospital.

1006
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,600
So wait, sorry, Brian.

1007
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,040
No, no, no, no.

1008
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,960
Have you not been on Splash Mountain?

1009
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,640
Briar.

1010
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,160
We keep getting the birth certificate wrong.

1011
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,320
You got to fix it.

1012
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,760
OK, we've been through this for Jack.

1013
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,480
Not saying it's back again.

1014
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:02,880
Don't worry.

1015
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:08,000
There's plenty of thorny vine bushes out there.

1016
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,040
There are still plenty of briars.

1017
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,720
Sorry, kid.

1018
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,720
You're saying it's a thorn is still an acceptable name.

1019
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,800
Well, isn't it?

1020
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,160
I never mind.

1021
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:21,760
OK.

1022
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:29,360
I just meant a briar patch, like a thorny patch of like.

1023
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,040
You're saying so the name is still relevant.

1024
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,360
Like there is still tangles.

1025
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,520
This is Jason arguing that the name is a good name.

1026
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,480
That's what it sounds like to me.

1027
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,600
We've all seen the patches.

1028
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,360
It's a good name.

1029
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,000
Uh-huh.

1030
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,760
It's named after a famous patch, a different patch.

1031
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:48,800
But there's rides that are not defensive and haven't needed to be changed.

1032
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,280
I think.

1033
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,840
Are those the ones or are they like lingering?

1034
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,680
I mean, you never know.

1035
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:59,720
I mean, there's so there's this incredible ride, Fata Morgana.

1036
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:00,520
Uh-huh.

1037
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:06,320
That is based on the legend of the 1001 Arabian.

1038
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,040
I said they're knockoff of pirates of the Caribbean.

1039
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,000
And it's great.

1040
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,800
It's got hundreds of animatronics.

1041
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,080
It's got songs.

1042
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,840
It's you know, it's like it's great.

1043
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,680
It's it's like very, you know, it's probably borderline.

1044
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,560
Yeah, I guess given the subject.

1045
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, for sure.

1046
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,880
It's like you go.

1047
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,080
I mean, you go.

1048
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:31,920
I don't know those stories well, but you I mean, you you flowed through on a boat

1049
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:39,440
and everywhere you look is like suffering and begging, toiling, drowning.

1050
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,600
What are Arabian nights like?

1051
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,600
Pretty tough.

1052
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,520
You pass a guy looking into another guy's mouth for some reason,

1053
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,320
just steal something, perhaps.

1054
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:54,000
Then you go past a a man in a dark alley screaming at you.

1055
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,560
And then then you go.

1056
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,200
Then you see a tiger.

1057
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,960
And then you go through the only time you see women are you go through a harem

1058
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,760
slash opium den.

1059
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,760
Do I do I want to go to this place anymore?

1060
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,240
It's incredible, though.

1061
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,200
I know I saw I look at pictures.

1062
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,440
So angry and bummed out.

1063
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,720
And then you go under you go underneath this like giant squatting genie,

1064
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,440
like basically like grazing his balls with your head like there's.

1065
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,680
All right, I'm back in.

1066
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,560
But it's a it's a marvel to behold, though.

1067
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,080
I mean, it's it's a great dark.

1068
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,720
It's just massive and very long.

1069
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,720
It's like seven minutes.

1070
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,960
And to a place like this with this huge sprawling pirates level

1071
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,000
bride that is based on nothing and that it doesn't come from some

1072
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,480
gigantic corporation either, because I think the way this is straight,

1073
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:54,080
I think it all there's there's the Efteling Foundation or it's some foundation

1074
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,120
that pays for it. I just saw the explanation that like ultimately,

1075
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:01,960
Efteling does not owe a bunch of money to shareholders somewhere.

1076
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,680
So all of the money stays in the park, goes back into the park,

1077
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,040
keeps everything looking nice, keeps them making new rides.

1078
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,600
It's not like feeding into, you know, in the surrounds of executive pockets.

1079
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,560
Right. So it all gets it's it's all the money's on screen.

1080
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,160
They make these rides or they like contracting Sally Corp and places like that.

1081
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,720
There's some of that. There's definitely some of that.

1082
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,560
Included, there are rides for sure that are made by like

1083
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,360
places that have made stuff that we've all been on.

1084
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,080
One of them being there's

1085
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,360
was this after you were there, there's a ride called Baron 1898.

1086
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,080
Oh, I think that it just opened, I think, when I was there.

1087
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,120
That's like a gold rush roller coaster. Is that a different one?

1088
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,960
Yeah, it's it's really interesting because I saw a video where it's like,

1089
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,840
oh, this is kind of a lesser ride.

1090
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,720
And by American standards, it's very elaborate. Yeah. Yeah.

1091
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,000
Oh, it is so much. It's a pre-show with animatronics and projections,

1092
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,200
big crazy story and carrot mythology.

1093
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,000
The Baron, you meet the Baron there. Yeah.

1094
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,200
And it's so it's so tower of terror.

1095
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,920
Harrison Hightower, like this guy's got a shady operation

1096
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,040
and he's going to get punished. And so are you.

1097
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,440
The story of this in 1898,

1098
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,840
the wealthy Baron Gustav Mouma, whom a wed,

1099
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,240
whose last name is a variation on the Dutch word for hubris.

1100
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:34,520
Gustav Hubris is led to a cave that is rich in gold deposits.

1101
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:40,080
But and it is haunted by a spirit known as the White Women.

1102
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,280
And the spirit of the White Women gives hubris the admonition

1103
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:50,320
that if he disturbs the gold in any way, he will suffer terrible consequences

1104
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,000
for the rest of his life.

1105
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,640
So he can't disturb.

1106
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,600
I like I want the gold, but I can't disturb the gold.

1107
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,760
What will I do?

1108
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,640
I will force the destitute local population into the gold mine.

1109
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,040
So they're the ones disturbing the gold and they're the ones

1110
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,480
that the white women will go after.

1111
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:14,960
So it's a it's it's white women fiercely protecting their land.

1112
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,040
It's a it's a ride about Karen's. It's Karen's the right.

1113
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:24,560
Well, that that's a lot simpler than the first 80 percent of what you said.

1114
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,920
Yeah, if you have to bullet, if you have to do it in synopsis.

1115
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:33,200
But anyway, so you're going to you're in a crooked mine and you and then the

1116
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,640
with the right itself is a drop coaster.

1117
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,040
This is this one doesn't have a water component. This is a pier.

1118
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,560
So it's one it's a coaster where you you hang, you get a view,

1119
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,320
you go into a tunnel, it's all mist and fog.

1120
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,040
And then and when you get screamed at, like you shall not evade my curse.

1121
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,480
Prepare to forfeit your lives.

1122
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,040
It's it's it rule.

1123
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,160
I mean, that there we're going to be like Hulk tear it.

1124
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,040
Yeah, it's extremely. Yeah.

1125
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,280
Yeah. Your souls are he says your souls are mine, right?

1126
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,440
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1127
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,320
I mean, this it's got dark ride.

1128
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:09,360
It's got like dark ride stuff at the start of the ride in the queue.

1129
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,760
There's a barren animatronic.

1130
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,400
There's multiple ghost projections.

1131
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,640
And then it becomes a standard kind of roller coaster.

1132
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,880
Sure, sure. But they have the theming and everything makes it feel like

1133
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,840
like more than that.

1134
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,880
And this one built by Bollinger and Mabillard,

1135
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,920
who rides they've built Incredible Hulk,

1136
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,120
Batman, the ride Riddler's Revenge, Apollo's Chariot,

1137
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:38,040
the Fabio Goose Coaster and a little ride called Led Zeppelin the Ride.

1138
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,520
The Fabio Goose.

1139
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,000
Wait, is that different from Apollo's Chariot or is that?

1140
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,680
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1141
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,880
That's not one in the same though.

1142
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:50,280
I'm really that roller coaster, Fab Kai's Goose Coaster after the incident.

1143
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,840
They really, really should should still should have.

1144
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,000
I mean, because I as of now, it's like, you know,

1145
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,480
trivia that barely anybody knows that that's not like a black up or something.

1146
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,520
They should have something where someone by the end has like

1147
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:08,840
when exploded goose against their forehead or whatever he did, like

1148
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,680
and like you get to be the Fabio, like you go on the ride

1149
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,320
and guess who's going to be the Fabio.

1150
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:18,240
Every chair has like a blood path like the rebels.

1151
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,040
The rebel spy on Star Wars.

1152
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1153
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,760
But you get to go home with something.

1154
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:26,600
You get a bunch of big blast of blood and feathers in the face.

1155
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,240
It's like double dare.

1156
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1157
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,400
Everything gets you wet.

1158
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,440
But what else gets you bloody?

1159
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,880
Yeah, they have to they have to embrace their history.

1160
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,000
Yeah, at least sell a hat.

1161
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:38,960
At least sell a hat.

1162
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,200
A bloody goose.

1163
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:40,880
Yeah, yeah.

1164
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,520
With like blood.

1165
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,200
And then it's like one of those long hair hats. Yeah.

1166
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,880
So you got. Yeah, yeah.

1167
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,520
With the hair like, uh huh. Uh huh.

1168
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,280
Do I survive Fabio's goose coaster?

1169
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,360
You've got long Fabio hair.

1170
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:55,360
My nose fared better than Fabio's did.

1171
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,360
Is he like a right wing guy or am I confusing him with Kevin Sorbo?

1172
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,840
Or they both right wing guys?

1173
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,760
Right. Like so very much more vocally a right wing guy.

1174
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,200
But I think he might be a right wing guy.

1175
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,520
I mean, he's a businessman.

1176
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,440
He's on Fox. He's smart.

1177
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,040
Smart man. He's a right wing man.

1178
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,320
Wants to protect his money.

1179
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,400
Anybody who keeps their money and protects it.

1180
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,200
Yeah. The reason they're on that side.

1181
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,480
So that one's cool.

1182
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,880
Baron 1898 rules.

1183
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,160
What else struck you?

1184
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,680
What are big ones for you going on?

1185
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,640
You read about that one?

1186
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,240
Spookslot closed last year.

1187
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,880
I just found out on the drive over here.

1188
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,200
I shouldn't have been looking at my phone driving, but I was.

1189
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,400
And I found out Spookslot closed a few months ago.

1190
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,560
Yeah, that was the first big attraction, I think, after the

1191
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,080
when they were branching out from the the fairy tale forest.

1192
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,000
Yes. Oh, this was yeah.

1193
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,320
Like 1970s like we're we're kind of it's it feels like they're big thunder

1194
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,160
or something like we can do relevant higher tech things.

1195
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:55,200
Yeah. And it I was shocked when I saw this and I couldn't.

1196
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,560
I was like, oh, my God, it's like a giant haunted mansion like walkthrough.

1197
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,960
It's not even a walkthrough.

1198
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,600
It is a walkthrough, but it's it's almost like mainlining

1199
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,080
the haunted mansion where instead of going through an environment,

1200
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,640
you see a little like pre show, but then you go into a room

1201
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,320
and then it just like throws the whole thing at you at once.

1202
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,440
So you just stand there and you're looking at a giant courtyard at night

1203
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,120
and everything is like happening in front of you.

1204
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:22,960
We don't move.

1205
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,280
So it's like a weird animatronic, spooky play

1206
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,960
where there's like great, you know, coffins wiggling.

1207
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,640
And then there's a guy hanging in one corner and you look over somewhere else.

1208
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,720
And there's like a witch burning and then there's some monks.

1209
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,040
And but it's like all happening at the same time in front of you.

1210
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,960
It was it was cool.

1211
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,760
And so they already when they were closing it,

1212
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,280
they uploaded multiple videos of like

1213
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,440
ride throughs of this attraction, including like a 360,

1214
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,080
which looks like a CG version of it.

1215
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,720
And then they've also uploaded teasers of like this is what the replacement

1216
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:02,000
dance macabre is, and it appears to be a very similar attraction.

1217
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,920
But you sit in a giant, squirreling, moving theater

1218
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,840
that will point you at different walls, like different scenes and stuff.

1219
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,680
That sounds good.

1220
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,600
Well, that sounds good.

1221
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,040
Dance macabre, I think, is the classical music piece

1222
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,080
that played in the original ride.

1223
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:25,440
You see also a witch burning like this, like there's like suffering in this.

1224
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,120
Oh, my God.

1225
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:29,760
Well, there's a whole story that when I was there, because I don't speak Dutch,

1226
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,120
I didn't understand any of it.

1227
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,600
But I watched a YouTube video today that explains some of it.

1228
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,480
And it's like that they're in a haunted castle that was cursed

1229
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:41,960
because the owner, yeah, like kind of gave up a witch and she got burned.

1230
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,080
So she put a curse on the castle.

1231
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,160
And so you're watching the ramifications of that.

1232
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,440
So you're watching the caretaker hang himself.

1233
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,120
You watch the witch burn.

1234
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,080
You watch someone's funeral.

1235
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,760
But it's like it's really everything is like, from what I remember,

1236
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,040
kind of happening at once.

1237
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:00,360
So it's just like sensory overload on like spooky stuff.

1238
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,680
It sounds I cannot.

1239
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,800
I actually didn't get to watching a ride through this.

1240
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,200
I can't. This sounds so insane.

1241
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,160
And like, you know, you like,

1242
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,600
oh, it's so crazy that there's a hanging body in the haunted mansion.

1243
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,880
Would you see the hanging occur?

1244
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,520
Do you see the moment of of death?

1245
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,320
I don't think you see him drop.

1246
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,760
I don't know the bell. He's ringing the bell.

1247
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,520
He's ringing the bell.

1248
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,160
You see him write the letter and then he hands a letter to the audience.

1249
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,840
And then you see him go up on the chair.

1250
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,720
Well, it's Europe. It's nice to say goodbye to Europe.

1251
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,440
Yeah. Different over there.

1252
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,040
Well, that is also, yeah, that's so crazy that there's still in

1253
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:49,040
in our day and age hanging that you witness at the haunted mansion in Disneyland.

1254
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,920
Yeah. Yeah.

1255
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,680
But it's the it's the aftermath.

1256
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,120
It happened a while back. Right. Right.

1257
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,720
And he's like happy about it, too.

1258
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,960
Like he seems like it's fun.

1259
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,840
And that's him, right?

1260
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,920
That's the ghost host's body.

1261
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,760
Yeah. He died by suicide.

1262
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,520
Yes. He said, why do they say why?

1263
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,080
Do they?

1264
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,160
Because he's trying to.

1265
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,080
He realizes there's no way out of the haunted mansion.

1266
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,920
The room that we're in, the like the elevator, there's no windows and no doors.

1267
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,960
And he can't get so he has to he kills him.

1268
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,200
Like we would all do it if we were stuck in that.

1269
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,200
How did he get to the roof in that room?

1270
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,800
How do you get to the ceiling?

1271
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,680
Hang the news and where do you get the news from?

1272
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,200
What do you he came there with a noose just in case?

1273
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,400
I think he's in the attic.

1274
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,480
Like we're seeing a little brief, like we're seeing into the attic of the haunted

1275
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,480
mansion, right?

1276
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,400
Like he's not in the room directly that we're in.

1277
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,440
I think we're seeing through the.

1278
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,720
Sorry, I need to go back to whatever year you guys covered this scene.

1279
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,720
Twenty seventeen.

1280
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,960
Yeah, I don't think we were we were very detailed and we always are about the haunted

1281
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,760
mansion. We did not discuss where he got the noose from.

1282
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,800
And I guess that's true.

1283
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,880
Do you know the book Boundless Realm?

1284
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,880
You know this book? You got to get this book.

1285
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,280
It's incredible.

1286
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:01,640
It's a it's a former cast member wrote

1287
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:06,680
just the most in-depth book on the haunted mansion at Disney World,

1288
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:12,280
but analyzing every inch of it as though it were basically like an art piece or whatever.

1289
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:17,720
But it's I've been just working my way through it very slowly over the last few months,

1290
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,480
but it's a wonderful book.

1291
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,200
Boundless Realm for any haunted mansion.

1292
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,080
It sounds cool, but it sounds like it doesn't have a definitive answer for your questions.

1293
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,680
I got to go back and look. No, I think he does.

1294
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:27,960
Oh, he does. OK.

1295
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,560
Maybe not how he got the noose.

1296
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:34,600
Everything could possibly be fashioned from parts of his clothes that he stripped off.

1297
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,560
It is a rope.

1298
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,920
I believe you can see that it's a rope.

1299
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,040
OK, like a necktie.

1300
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:43,000
I like to have a rope on them a lot more often.

1301
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,800
That's a good point.

1302
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,960
Like a clue or something.

1303
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:46,280
Yeah.

1304
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,640
Sparrow's he came in with.

1305
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:47,960
Yeah.

1306
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,960
All right, we got it.

1307
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:54,680
This is you, however, derailing the no, no, no.

1308
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:58,920
Well, my concern also is that the the book sounds great,

1309
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,800
but that you've just thrown us something to make us go even slower through the haunted mansion.

1310
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,360
You should be going.

1311
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:04,840
This is terrifying.

1312
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,760
I was going to say you were going through it way too fast.

1313
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,000
Most of the room agrees with you.

1314
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,560
We'll take a vote.

1315
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,360
Do we admit this book into evidence or not?

1316
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,480
Well, we'll discuss it.

1317
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,840
What is other stuff here?

1318
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,440
Oh, the flying Dutchman.

1319
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,840
The fine Dutchman seems incredible.

1320
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:31,400
Yeah.

1321
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,440
Which one is that?

1322
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,880
This is a water coaster.

1323
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,680
OK, yeah.

1324
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,040
This is in 2007.

1325
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,680
It would have been there at least.

1326
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:45,480
OK, this is a evil sailor who recruits his crew from orphanages.

1327
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,840
Despite that there is a heavy storm blowing into port, he sets sail for the Dutch East Indies,

1328
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,520
even though it's Easter.

1329
00:59:55,240 --> 01:00:00,200
And I found another description that like, OK, here we go.

1330
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:05,640
Captain Willem van der Decken sailed the seven seas looking for riches and fortune

1331
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,000
with his crew of orphans.

1332
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,200
He was so greedy he even set sail on Easter Sunday, which was forbidden.

1333
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,720
So this is a scary ride.

1334
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,760
That's a morality play about not working on Easter.

1335
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:23,320
And now the ship is cursed and it's doomed to sail the seas forever.

1336
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,640
And you are on the ship, so you're fucked.

1337
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,640
You're one of the orphans, basically.

1338
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,360
And then here's some of this crazy, there's more crazy mummy dialogue.

1339
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:36,760
When all despair for his lack of fear for God, he proclaims,

1340
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:42,440
I will sail storm or not, Easter or not, this motherfucker prohibited or not.

1341
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,920
I will sail even into eternity.

1342
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,280
And then before the big drop, there's a scary voice that says,

1343
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,080
you shall also sail until the end of time.

1344
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:56,360
So we've got multiple scary mummy type attractions with big four,

1345
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:01,320
with crazy writing, with like a dialogue that cuts into your heart.

1346
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:01,960
It's great.

1347
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,360
Damning you to be a sailor forever.

1348
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,160
An orphan sailor always working on Easter.

1349
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,240
Your Groundhog Day is Easter in 1678.

1350
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:11,960
Jason wouldn't like that.

1351
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:12,760
That's a Sunday.

1352
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,360
That's a day of rest.

1353
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,400
Yeah, it's a day of rest.

1354
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,040
It's one of the many days that Jason rests.

1355
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,040
Yeah, no, I said Sunday, Monday.

1356
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,120
Tuesday through Thursday.

1357
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,520
And then Thursday, you take a break because it's a busy Wednesday.

1358
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:25,900
Yeah.

1359
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,880
That looks fucking great though.

1360
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:33,240
I like a good, I feel like I've never actually been on one,

1361
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:37,240
one of the, like the hybrid where it's a coaster, but then there's a splashdown.

1362
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:42,120
The line was way too crazy at the SeaWorld one that I really wanted to do.

1363
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,480
Is that an Atlantis ride?

1364
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,760
Is it the splashdown?

1365
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,480
Is it like, is Hulk technically a splashdown or no?

1366
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,240
No, this one splashes in the water.

1367
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:50,120
Like it starts out.

1368
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,400
You go in the water.

1369
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,160
And then it becomes a standard coaster.

1370
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,440
And then the coaster splashes in the water.

1371
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,880
So this one is an open during Winter Efteling.

1372
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:00,440
Oh, okay.

1373
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:00,680
Yeah.

1374
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:04,680
Cause they became year round at some point, but not the more water-based rides.

1375
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:09,000
Also, this ride is in a big Viking ship kind of thing.

1376
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,480
And I love the Maelstrom so much.

1377
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,040
Yeah.

1378
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,160
Maelstrom, one of the greats.

1379
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,880
So we still haven't made it to, it's like, this is an entire,

1380
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,840
this is a whole park that's like the Maelstrom.

1381
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:19,160
Yeah.

1382
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,640
That's the level on which I would really love it.

1383
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:27,000
You would want to get yelled at by Norwegians and go inside big ships, big old ships.

1384
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:33,400
It's a wonderful place with hustling, bustling city centers and the tourism.

1385
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,080
Why did you come here?

1386
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,040
Get out of here.

1387
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,080
Do not witness our tourism.

1388
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:42,040
A theme park where you're like damned on each ride.

1389
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:42,600
Yeah.

1390
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,120
Every ride dams you.

1391
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:44,520
Yeah.

1392
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,800
Or you see things that make you feel like you've been damned.

1393
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:48,680
I was going to say, yeah.

1394
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:55,000
One of the few exceptions I would say is a ride that I think is very intriguing.

1395
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,840
The English is Dream Flight.

1396
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,160
Yes.

1397
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:57,560
Oh yeah.

1398
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,520
I watched that.

1399
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,560
It's a dark ride.

1400
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,320
Droomvlucht.

1401
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,120
Droomvlucht.

1402
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,720
And you're suspended, like the track is above you.

1403
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:07,720
And Peter Pan, yeah.

1404
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,200
Yeah.

1405
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:13,480
And so you go through all the, there's a big diorama to start and then there's like a big

1406
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:19,320
fantasy forest and then you are in space, which from the video I'm like, this is one

1407
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,680
of the best portrayals of space in a ride I have ever seen.

1408
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:24,840
It's great.

1409
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,200
And you're looking at these planets that are like half planet, but they look almost like

1410
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,040
they have castles growing out of them.

1411
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:35,000
And then you float to somewhere else, like another forest.

1412
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:39,720
And then there's like this big giant spiral room where you're going around a scene and

1413
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:45,880
you're kind of descending, if I remember correctly, similar to the Calico Mine ride

1414
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:50,440
actually at Knott's where you're looking at just a giant space from a lot of different

1415
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:51,000
angles.

1416
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,400
Yeah, it's amazing.

1417
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,920
Cool idea that not a lot does.

1418
01:03:54,920 --> 01:04:00,280
And the fact like building a space that is truly three-dimensional and lets you see

1419
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:03,720
everything that's not just like, well, that's a flat, you can't go back.

1420
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:07,000
Yeah, you're not just going past scenes.

1421
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:07,240
Yeah.

1422
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:12,680
We've been talking about this lately with the people mover and with Discovery Zone

1423
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,160
that we like seeing things from different angles.

1424
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:15,720
That's good.

1425
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:23,160
I mean, that is not to get all highfalutin, but that is something that the dark ride

1426
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:27,240
as an art form can achieve in a way unlike any other form.

1427
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:33,720
Like when you approach the prisoners trying to get the key from the dog and pirates,

1428
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,880
and you see it in the distance and you creep towards it and then you're seeing it kind

1429
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,480
of over their shoulder at the dog.

1430
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:43,320
And then a few moments later, you're seeing it from the dog's perspective because you're

1431
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,880
floating by and like, yeah, the angles.

1432
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,240
Yeah, the angles are good.

1433
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,840
Yeah, it's like bridging different.

1434
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:54,200
You get major key frames and then everything in between.

1435
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:59,320
It's the great unexplored art form of the 20th century, I think.

1436
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:01,560
God, wow.

1437
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,000
That really does like...

1438
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:03,960
That elevates me.

1439
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,640
You know, it makes me feel good about that.

1440
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,240
We talk about these things.

1441
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,440
We've done this for six years.

1442
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:10,920
Yeah, it's good.

1443
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,200
It was art that we're talking about.

1444
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,560
No, there's so much potential.

1445
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:17,240
God, I thought about this way too much and not in a while, but there is so much potential

1446
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:22,280
with Dark Rides as an experience that beyond what we know of in theme parks, I think there's

1447
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:22,760
a lot there.

1448
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:29,480
But even the way that it tells a story where you're kind of just drifting through and it's

1449
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:35,640
not often so much about tension and storytelling as much as moment to moment experience is so

1450
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:39,880
much more like real life than any movie or anything.

1451
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,720
Especially on that Fata Morgana ride we were talking about where you're just kind of like

1452
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:50,760
going through these scenes in the ancient Middle Eastern times and you're just getting

1453
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,600
a feeling and you're just kind of observing.

1454
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,400
You're floating through.

1455
01:05:54,360 --> 01:06:01,320
And it's like some of the recent rides, the rides where they point you at something or

1456
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:06,600
they're attempting to do something that feels more cinematic, but it's not as usually as

1457
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:12,840
interesting or a good experience as like Pirates where you're just hanging out with a bunch of

1458
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,280
And you're deciding what to look at.

1459
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:14,600
Yeah.

1460
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,400
And yeah, yeah.

1461
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,800
Yeah, you were the camera.

1462
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,680
You were choosing what to look at in this room.

1463
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:23,320
That's what makes it different than like a 3D movie.

1464
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:27,720
So when they do rides that are like really hardcore pointing, except for Transformers,

1465
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:31,880
which is perfect, everything else though, when they're trying to do that, it feels like

1466
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:35,000
you're pointed at the most perfect things that anyone's ever done.

1467
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,600
That one they nailed, but everything else it's like they're trying to like imitate

1468
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:42,440
sort of a thematic experience, but yeah, it's generally better.

1469
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:47,400
In terms of that real life thing, the way like, especially Pirates and I imagine

1470
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:53,960
Fatima or Ghana too, like the conversations weaving in and out that you like leave one

1471
01:06:53,960 --> 01:07:01,480
sound loop and enter another and enter another and like the lack of music can be a nice thing too,

1472
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:08,440
in terms of just creating reality and not like imposing, no, this feels like

1473
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,960
foreboding and dangerous.

1474
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:14,120
Like you kind of get to decide the feeling of certain scenes like this.

1475
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:20,040
The thing I saw a couple of people mention about Fatima or Ghana that you don't see in a lot of,

1476
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:27,160
at least American rides, it's a boat ride, but it's not straight, there's doors,

1477
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:33,160
there's doors, thematic doors that you go through, that open up at the start of every scene.

1478
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:39,080
And like that kind of changes, like Pirates, you're floating the whole time.

1479
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,600
There's no real obstruction.

1480
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,640
There's no separation.

1481
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:42,040
Yeah.

1482
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,960
So you get more of like separate.

1483
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:44,440
Yeah.

1484
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:49,720
So it's like little scenes playing out, but you still have to choose what you pay attention to.

1485
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:57,320
Like it's more, they honed in on the like ethereal, like, well, let's just pack this with detail.

1486
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:03,400
Let's pack this forest with Dreamflight and you can see all these little guys and little creatures.

1487
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:06,360
Wasn't that the cool thing about a lot of these rides then is like,

1488
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:11,160
when you think about what Efteling doesn't have the pressure to do, like that they don't have the

1489
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:15,720
pressure to serve a CEO and put money into his pockets.

1490
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,760
And similarly, they don't need to promote a movie.

1491
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:21,880
It's not one piece of a big promotional puzzle.

1492
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:25,720
So there's no like, okay, we got a race to get every character in there that everybody.

1493
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:28,200
I'm glad they didn't put these characters in movies.

1494
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:28,760
I'll say that.

1495
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:32,440
Yeah, but I would not see any movie with any of these characters.

1496
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:36,600
Do you think Disney will ever again do a ride like that?

1497
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:43,160
That's not just about tying in and promoting a movie or a Marvel property or a Star Wars property.

1498
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:48,520
I've said, I think the only way it happens is if they sneak it in with like a totally new park,

1499
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:53,000
like one ride out of like a new park with like six rides.

1500
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,920
And it's probably not in America.

1501
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,600
And it's probably not in America.

1502
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:56,920
Yeah.

1503
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:03,800
But even then, even like Tokyo Disney Sea, which is not super IP centric, they did just,

1504
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:07,080
there is this big new expansion coming, but it's fully IP.

1505
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:07,880
It's all IP.

1506
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,080
Basically.

1507
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:09,400
Yeah.

1508
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:14,440
So you're not getting a new, which IP Island sounds like a wonderful place to be.

1509
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:17,720
It's really not where all our favorite IP is all together.

1510
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:25,000
I mean, there is like, they could do, you know, there's enough in Guardians of the Galaxy,

1511
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:30,200
there's enough in like Cosmic Marvel or like the magic stuff in Marvel where there could

1512
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:33,240
just be like a million things going around you.

1513
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:35,720
You're saying there could be an IP ride that was at least good.

1514
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:41,960
Oh, well, not per se good, but I'm saying something a little more like a theory in

1515
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:46,280
spacey where like the Guardians of the Galaxy are not yelling at you to complete a task.

1516
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:53,880
It feels like every Marvel attraction so far has been here are many instructions and here is

1517
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,400
lots of backstory.

1518
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:59,960
You are being yelled at with specifics as many as you can possibly take.

1519
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,240
I would love what you're describing.

1520
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,680
Sounds fantastic.

1521
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:06,680
I would love to imagine that and hope they would do that.

1522
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:07,000
Yeah.

1523
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:07,960
But I don't know.

1524
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,320
Something we talked about last month.

1525
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,120
Have you done Avatar the boat ride?

1526
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:14,600
Not yet.

1527
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,160
No, I haven't been to Orlando in like 20 something years.

1528
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,960
Oh, that's going to be a huge one.

1529
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:20,520
Yeah.

1530
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,440
If you do it with family.

1531
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,400
I know I have two kids, they're four and two.

1532
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:30,200
And like I was going to go after I finished working on Palti Goldman.

1533
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:33,000
I was like, I want to go take the family there for a week.

1534
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:40,760
But also I take them to Universal like a few times a year and the older one is just in a

1535
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,760
mode right now of being scared of everything.

1536
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,680
And the younger one doesn't know what's happening.

1537
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,520
The other one is like mostly open to stuff.

1538
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:52,600
We did the studio tour and the younger one, the two year old.

1539
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,120
But to that it's just like either so boring.

1540
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:59,560
It's just like buildings from movies that they never heard of.

1541
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:03,240
Or it's like King Kong fighting dinosaurs is like way too scary.

1542
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:12,520
But like my older one is afraid of the like one minute thunderstorm in the tiki room.

1543
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,800
So it doesn't want to go into that.

1544
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:18,280
So it's just like, oh, and he used to be obsessed with pirates.

1545
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:22,840
And then he hit a certain age where he doesn't like the drops basically.

1546
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,240
And so it's like, yeah, I think I gotta wait till they're old.

1547
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:29,160
So I don't want to go to because I really want to take him to whatever's left of Epcot.

1548
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:32,280
And see the stuff down there.

1549
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:38,440
But it's like, oh, that won't be fun if like he's upset or not wanting to do anything.

1550
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,120
You might need to do the adult trip.

1551
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,320
Maybe I just need to go by myself.

1552
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:50,440
I definitely will be going there solo sooner than I'll be going with my son.

1553
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,760
For all the reasons you're describing.

1554
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,280
He spent a lot of time in theme parks.

1555
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:57,160
He will again soon.

1556
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:03,080
To go across the country, you need a guarantee that's going to be great.

1557
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:07,240
And work and not like a horror show for them at every turn.

1558
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:11,960
Yeah, I mean, they barely got through the secret life of pets because of the

1559
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:15,400
there's some just this vibe of being in a scary city.

1560
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:16,760
Yes.

1561
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,200
Yeah, I did that with my son.

1562
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:24,120
And he like, well, it was the first of him reckoning with a bar lowering onto you.

1563
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,920
And imagine you're two years old and that happens.

1564
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:33,000
And also like they, you know, like it has to click to the that's as far as it can go on a

1565
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:33,960
little two year old.

1566
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:37,400
Yeah, that's as far as it can go beyond just nobody being in there.

1567
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:41,640
So it's like Presta, but like he thinks he's being like what I thought on every ride when

1568
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:44,680
I was still like eight was that he's being fed into a machine.

1569
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:47,160
It's like an incinerator that's going to burn him up.

1570
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:51,480
So lock him in tight, like watching him after reckon with a bar lower.

1571
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,720
Oh my God, it was so awful.

1572
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:54,680
And then know what?

1573
01:12:54,680 --> 01:13:00,440
I'm sure you've had this of like, all right, it's this ride has started bad and now we

1574
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:07,400
have to get through this for depending on that slow ride stops like, oh God, six straight

1575
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,200
minutes of hell.

1576
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:13,960
All right, I'm going to wait till my daughter's like 10 to do my stuff.

1577
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:18,840
Well, it's either although although you agree that like maybe you do you do everything

1578
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,480
between one and two and then maybe it's not true.

1579
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,120
One and two.

1580
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:24,600
Yeah, actually, they don't know what they don't know what's going on.

1581
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,040
They're not scared.

1582
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:30,920
We went all around Tokyo DisneySea when he was six months old and there was no problem.

1583
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:33,160
Six months.

1584
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:33,720
That's crazy.

1585
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:39,000
Okay, and now and since you've been there and not a lot of guests have been there,

1586
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:46,760
comparing the two if you like in terms of like are either of them in greatest theme park

1587
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:49,560
in the world conversation or one more than the other?

1588
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,840
Did you like one more than the other?

1589
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:54,920
Tokyo DisneySea is like such a more unified environment where, you know, it really feels

1590
01:13:54,920 --> 01:14:01,720
like you're on another planet and it just feels so perfectly done except that Italy

1591
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,200
part that just does feel like the Americana or something.

1592
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,240
That's true.

1593
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:08,280
We can all go to fake Italy's and everyone.

1594
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:09,560
We have so many fake Italy's.

1595
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:10,360
That's true.

1596
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,200
Adopted to have any magic to it.

1597
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,360
You grew up in New Jersey too.

1598
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:15,320
Plenty Italy there.

1599
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:23,560
But yeah, that's like a crazier achievement, I think, because it's like this giant intentional

1600
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,120
thing.

1601
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:28,360
This is like, though I hadn't thought of it until I was looking stuff up for it for this,

1602
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:31,240
but it's like it really is because it grew so organically.

1603
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,440
It wasn't like a plan.

1604
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,720
It wasn't even meant to be a theme park.

1605
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:43,720
It was like the sports center basically that started a garden and then we'll do these little

1606
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:44,600
fairy tale exhibits.

1607
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:49,080
Yeah, that it was never like, let's build a theme park, but it became this.

1608
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:53,320
Yeah, but it does have this crazy quality where it almost a lot of it feels like you're

1609
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:59,080
just kind of wandering through a forest and then happening upon these like insane, very

1610
01:14:59,080 --> 01:14:59,640
expensive.

1611
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,560
It's not janky at all.

1612
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:03,880
They really like the animatronics are good.

1613
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,080
The music is good.

1614
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,600
Like it's legit.

1615
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,880
Like they spend tens of millions of dollars on these rides.

1616
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:13,640
A full orchestra doing the score for things.

1617
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,160
And wait, that's a question also.

1618
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,920
Like, do you really wander?

1619
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:19,000
Are there like big stretches of this?

1620
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:26,040
Just this just feels like a garden or nature or I just remember that like especially in

1621
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:29,720
the part near that like fairy tale forest, you can wander around there for a long time

1622
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,240
and just find stuff.

1623
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:34,840
And then the rest of it, I think, is like paved, but also like a pretty themed, pretty,

1624
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:35,560
pretty well done.

1625
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:41,640
But there isn't any kind of like Main Street or hub or anything that's intentionally designed

1626
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,920
to like bring you into the experience.

1627
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,880
You just kind of are there and you're just kind of like finding stuff.

1628
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:49,480
There's also this one ride with I think it's a roller coaster inside with this giant like

1629
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,520
bird outside.

1630
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:52,600
You see a picture of that this giant rock.

1631
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:54,760
Bird Rock.

1632
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,640
Bird Rock Park.

1633
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:05,560
I think it's also about how Arabian Nights are difficult to endure.

1634
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:07,960
You'll find a lot of peril.

1635
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:09,880
More peril.

1636
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:13,400
It's a Sinbad coaster, I believe.

1637
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:14,440
Okay, yeah.

1638
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,120
That seems like a common thing there.

1639
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:17,480
Sinbad or Sinbad?

1640
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:18,440
I'm not sure.

1641
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:19,960
It's a good question.

1642
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,400
I'm going to say Sinbad just in case.

1643
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,840
Sinbad, I think is, yeah.

1644
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:28,280
Then there's one from just that open, I think, right after we were there, year or two after

1645
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:28,920
we were there.

1646
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:32,200
That's a trackless one that has three paths.

1647
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,560
Did you guys read about that?

1648
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:34,280
Symbolica.

1649
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:35,640
Yes, it looks incredible.

1650
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:42,200
So this is like they worked their little mascot guy into this ride and he's a little jester.

1651
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,640
Is he Jokey?

1652
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:44,200
Jokey.

1653
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,480
I think so, yeah, Jokey.

1654
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:47,960
No, no, no, wait, no.

1655
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:49,000
Pardos.

1656
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,120
That was the old one.

1657
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:53,080
Wait, Jokey is different than Pardos?

1658
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:53,560
I think so.

1659
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:56,840
Everything I saw said that the Jester's name is Pardos.

1660
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,600
I didn't see Jokey.

1661
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,040
That's Pardos.

1662
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:02,360
I don't want to be missing a space Jester.

1663
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:03,480
But who is Jokey?

1664
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:04,520
I saw Jokey too.

1665
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,800
Is he a different ride?

1666
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,400
He might be the old mascot.

1667
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:10,680
One of them, okay, one of them is in the Small World knockoff.

1668
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,040
Pardos, I think, is the new one.

1669
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:14,680
That's right, Scott.

1670
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:15,880
Okay, but Jokey.

1671
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:17,560
Jokey's in the carnival.

1672
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:18,520
Oh, I've seen Jokey.

1673
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:23,000
He has neat, simple, like the big circular faces.

1674
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,600
He lives in a hot air balloon and he likes to eat pizza in the shape of a heart.

1675
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:27,960
Is that right?

1676
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,000
That's what it says on the website.

1677
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:37,880
Pardos is a magician and Jester who was born on the planet Symbolica, which sounds adjacent to a mystica.

1678
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,800
I was going to say he sounds like Chris Angel, so.

1679
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:46,440
This ride is really wild in terms of the Trackless Dark Ride.

1680
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:50,680
I mean, there's a bunch of scenes that you all do together and then you like pick your path.

1681
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:55,800
And those paths each have two exclusive scenes on each path.

1682
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:02,440
And you have an interactive console on the front of the ride vehicle so you can like play in Oregon.

1683
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:03,720
Wow.

1684
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,880
Or make like different shapes appear.

1685
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:06,280
Yeah.

1686
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:08,360
Some kind of spell in front of you.

1687
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:13,000
This is, I mean, I'm sure as with all of these things, I would rather see them in person

1688
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,440
than watch videos, but there's some of these, you're like the video,

1689
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:19,800
maybe the video is not conveying the whole thing, but the video is conveying a lot.

1690
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,920
Like this you can tell very clearly from this video.

1691
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,480
This is one of the best rides built anywhere.

1692
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,200
Did you see it?

1693
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:29,640
There's a scene where you're in like an aquarium and there's this giant,

1694
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:31,480
I think it was real.

1695
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:32,600
I don't think it was video.

1696
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,920
Whale that comes down is floating and blinking.

1697
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,680
Yeah, the whale is insane.

1698
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:37,560
It's incredible looking.

1699
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:43,400
And then the glass starts to crack similar to the Jurassic World thing here, I think,

1700
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,200
where it starts to crack, but then real water starts coming in.

1701
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:47,640
Wow.

1702
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:48,200
It's cool.

1703
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,080
Look cool.

1704
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,200
But let me ask you this.

1705
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:53,960
Does it have three giant fans blowing trash at you?

1706
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:58,520
Or is that in a Mystica exclusive?

1707
01:18:58,520 --> 01:18:59,560
What's the correct?

1708
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:02,840
Maybe a Mystica, he said it's closing to tour Europe.

1709
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:07,320
That was their ridiculous excuse lie for why it was closing.

1710
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:08,760
That's not happening.

1711
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:12,680
But that will run in Europe for like Starlight Express.

1712
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:13,800
It'll just never close.

1713
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:18,600
There'll be no way they can get those giant fans over to Europe.

1714
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,160
They're like as big as a room.

1715
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:23,160
Maybe through magic we can.

1716
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,760
Their trash regulations are also much more strict there.

1717
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:31,800
At Efteling, the creatures suck the paper away from you.

1718
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,520
At a Mystica, the paper's blasted at you.

1719
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,920
This is a very specific Yekhov smirnoff.

1720
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:39,640
Yeah, I know that.

1721
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:41,080
I'm like, yeah, I'm sure you're a...

1722
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:47,080
No, this thing, I mean, what I wrote down about Symbolica is this is like a new

1723
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,160
journey into imagination.

1724
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:51,800
This is like a deeply sincere

1725
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:59,960
cinematic like stirring with original characters and not just Pardos, the Jester from space,

1726
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,360
but also King Pardulfus.

1727
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:06,920
It's all about going to visit King Pardulfus, but before you can get to him,

1728
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:11,480
you have to get to his taskmaster guard, OJ Punctual.

1729
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:13,560
Of course.

1730
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:18,920
Is this also a European thing that they're still willing to name characters OJ?

1731
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:22,120
Yeah, what year did this open?

1732
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:23,640
2017.

1733
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:24,360
Yeah, okay.

1734
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:25,240
I mean, why not?

1735
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:26,360
The name's out there.

1736
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,000
It's catch...

1737
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,760
I like OJ Punctual.

1738
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:29,320
OJ Punctual.

1739
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:30,040
I like OJ.

1740
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:31,560
You like OJ?

1741
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:32,200
He's funny.

1742
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:35,080
He's like an influencer now.

1743
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,960
I do his Twitter videos.

1744
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:42,520
I mean, I turn him when I want to know what to think about the slap.

1745
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:45,000
Yeah, he's always shaking his head and stuff.

1746
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:45,320
Yeah.

1747
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:45,960
Foolishness.

1748
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:54,360
No, this thing's...

1749
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:55,320
Oh, wait, and here's...

1750
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:56,520
I forgot another one.

1751
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:59,560
Jason, you're asking about who made these rides.

1752
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,440
ETF Ride Systems built this one.

1753
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:06,440
I think they've made a lot of the more innovative trackless rides,

1754
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:09,160
but also a little ride called Knights and White Sets.

1755
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:10,680
Oh, man.

1756
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:11,000
Yeah.

1757
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,440
I thought that was Sally Corp.

1758
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:13,000
They did.

1759
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,200
I mean, I think they did the effects and the decor, but the...

1760
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,600
The track you're talking about.

1761
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,720
A lot of people are trying to take credit for that ride.

1762
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:22,040
Yes.

1763
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,240
Everyone's racing to.

1764
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:23,880
Everybody is.

1765
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,400
There's liars.

1766
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,480
I wish I could have gone on that ride.

1767
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:33,880
That's an ethereal ride without a straight A to C narrative, like A to B narrative.

1768
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:35,880
It's more of an experience.

1769
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:36,280
Yeah.

1770
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:36,840
You're not saying...

1771
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,680
We haven't been saying the full name either.

1772
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:39,800
Knights and White Sets.

1773
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:40,760
Knights and White Sets.

1774
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:41,320
The trip.

1775
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:41,720
The trip.

1776
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:42,680
I know.

1777
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:43,560
Not the ride.

1778
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:45,080
Yeah.

1779
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:48,920
Because at the height of lockdown, I was just buying things on eBay.

1780
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:54,440
One of the things I bought was the psychedelic coffee bug for Knights and White Sets and the trip.

1781
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,280
It's an inconvenient shape.

1782
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,880
It's got a lot of squirrels on it.

1783
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:00,840
What do you mean inconvenient shape?

1784
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:01,640
It's just odd.

1785
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:02,120
It's trippy.

1786
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:03,560
It's a trippy design.

1787
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:08,600
It's square on the top, then it goes to a circular bottom, and it's heavy.

1788
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,120
Have you posted a photo of this?

1789
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:12,040
I think I did.

1790
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:12,920
See that mug.

1791
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:13,720
Let's look at the mug.

1792
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,200
We've been calling shots a lot.

1793
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,200
That's been the catchphrase of the year.

1794
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:24,040
What I'd really like to do, Jason, I'd love for you to be there.

1795
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:31,080
Well, I've been dreaming for years of Hard Rock Park 3 with John Binkowski and you as well.

1796
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:31,560
I don't know how to...

1797
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,880
He's got to have listened to that episode, right?

1798
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:34,520
I don't know.

1799
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:35,240
That's a question.

1800
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,880
If he's aware of it, I guess if you're...

1801
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:39,560
There's not that much media about...

1802
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:41,560
I feel like we were very respectful to him.

1803
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:44,280
We kind of were doing it assuming he would listen to it.

1804
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,760
Some people are close enough to...

1805
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,040
What's he up to these days?

1806
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:52,680
Does anyone know?

1807
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:53,160
Would you...

1808
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:53,880
He works...

1809
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:57,080
He has a themed entertainment company, Unor Orlando.

1810
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:57,880
What do they do?

1811
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:00,120
They helped on that porn identity.

1812
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:01,400
Oh, really?

1813
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,520
She stole his business.

1814
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,160
Wow.

1815
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:03,960
Yeah.

1816
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:04,920
Which we need to see.

1817
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,760
Everybody is very happy of it.

1818
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:07,720
Where is that?

1819
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,400
That's at Universal Florida.

1820
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:09,960
Oh, damn.

1821
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,720
You replaced T2, T3.

1822
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,080
You really got to go.

1823
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,040
Solo.

1824
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:14,920
No bachelor.

1825
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:15,960
I might have to do it.

1826
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:16,440
I haven't...

1827
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:16,920
Yeah.

1828
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:17,880
That's 20 years.

1829
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:20,120
That's a whole lot of stuff.

1830
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,360
A whole lot of construction walls.

1831
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,080
Closed, yeah.

1832
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:24,120
You got to see everything that's closed.

1833
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:25,160
You missed a lot of stuff.

1834
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:27,240
All the Epcot projects that have been canceled.

1835
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:28,520
I can't go to Florida right now.

1836
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,360
I got Royce Rocco on my tail.

1837
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:31,560
Oh, wow.

1838
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:32,360
I got to lay low.

1839
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:36,920
Oh, he'll send his boys after you.

1840
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,160
Are you sure he wouldn't just take you around?

1841
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:40,600
Orlando?

1842
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,000
That's a ride.

1843
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:43,320
Yeah.

1844
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,400
Going on Royce Rocco's Daytona.

1845
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:45,960
Be careful.

1846
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,160
Might be a bomb aboard.

1847
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:53,960
You talk about people listening to things who are only like a stone's throw away.

1848
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:55,080
We were...

1849
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:57,240
And we'll talk a little more at the end about your show.

1850
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:59,640
But for anybody who's watched Paul to go...

1851
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:03,720
You said at the beginning you think it's very possible that Paul is listening to this.

1852
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:04,360
I just know that.

1853
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:05,320
Yeah.

1854
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:07,400
I think Paul's listening to a lot of interviews I'm doing.

1855
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:08,840
You know, yeah.

1856
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:14,600
I think he's getting a lot of ads him and checking stuff out and seeing the response to the show.

1857
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:16,520
So yeah, he may listen to this.

1858
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:23,960
And also he was saying to me the other day that his first wife who's in the show,

1859
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:31,080
Galina was pitching him ideas on like new things to do.

1860
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:35,800
And one of them that he was excited about was could you do a Paul T. Goldman theme park?

1861
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:40,280
And I said, well, actually I'm going on a theme park podcast that some good friends of mine do.

1862
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:44,600
But then we started talking about something else before I got any of the

1863
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:46,920
details of what that would be.

1864
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,440
Pass them along, please.

1865
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,720
Send screenshots of the text messages.

1866
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:54,760
I can see if he wants to record something and send it to you.

1867
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:55,880
You can get an exclusive...

1868
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:59,000
Oh my God, a Paul T. Goldman appearance with him?

1869
01:24:59,000 --> 01:24:59,400
You know what?

1870
01:24:59,400 --> 01:24:59,880
Let me see.

1871
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:00,280
I'll text him.

1872
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:00,840
Geez.

1873
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:05,640
You should send it first to John Binkowski and see if he's interested in starting and funding it.

1874
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:06,200
Yes.

1875
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:06,360
Yeah.

1876
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:07,400
Let's tie it all together.

1877
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:08,680
Yeah, he could do like the...

1878
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:10,920
He could be the Walliner of that project.

1879
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:11,400
That's right.

1880
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:11,560
Yeah.

1881
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:16,040
Are you saying Walliner doesn't want to be the Walliner of another...

1882
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:18,040
No, he just wants someone from that world.

1883
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,640
I knew how to make a TV show.

1884
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:20,120
You need some...

1885
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:25,640
If you're going to do a theme park where you do whatever rides he wants to do, then you need someone.

1886
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:26,120
Yeah.

1887
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:26,520
And that's...

1888
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:26,840
Yeah.

1889
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:27,160
Yeah.

1890
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:32,760
Well, if Paul is listening also, we are describing one of the only people out there who has built an

1891
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,680
entire theme park from scratch.

1892
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,280
This is who you need to work with.

1893
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:39,560
And now it's just a matter of pitches.

1894
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:41,880
I mean, his whole life is a roller coaster.

1895
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:44,280
So, I mean, is it...

1896
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:49,960
That's what Binkowski should do next is an autobiography in the form of a theme park.

1897
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:51,640
Oh, right.

1898
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,400
Is his life story?

1899
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:53,640
Yeah.

1900
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:55,720
So it involves...

1901
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:59,000
So there's a ride that is Hard Rock Park the Ride.

1902
01:25:59,000 --> 01:25:59,640
Yes, that would be...

1903
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:03,480
The ride would be his experience of the rise and fall of Hard Rock Park,

1904
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:04,920
but that would be the ride.

1905
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:05,240
Jeez.

1906
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,240
And that's only one part of it.

1907
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,400
Like the rise up through...

1908
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:09,640
Yeah.

1909
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:13,160
Like you see all the ideas forming and the brainstorming and the possibilities.

1910
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:20,600
You make a shady deal with a Native American tribe to license the Hard Rock brand.

1911
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:21,480
That's right, yes.

1912
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,960
And then you go off the cliff and you just go...

1913
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:30,120
And then agreement deals with the Eagles flapping by you.

1914
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:30,840
Flapping.

1915
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,040
Yeah, licensing deals.

1916
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:32,200
Yeah.

1917
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:32,840
Uh-huh.

1918
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:36,280
The bare metal family waving to you from heaven.

1919
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,120
And you go underwater, you go...

1920
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:42,440
You can make the ratio correct.

1921
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:45,640
Like the lift hill is as long as the prep period.

1922
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:48,440
And then the drop is as fast as four months.

1923
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:51,480
And then when it's over, you just stay there.

1924
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,840
Like the park is still there.

1925
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,280
You just stay there forever.

1926
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,360
We need to get his thoughts on like...

1927
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:00,040
Because I don't know if you guys have been following this,

1928
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:05,160
but Hard Rock is taking over the Mirage Casino Hotel.

1929
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:05,320
Oh my...

1930
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:06,200
Oh yeah, that's pretty handy.

1931
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:08,360
Are they gonna rebrand that, a Hard Rock?

1932
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:09,400
They're gonna rebrand it.

1933
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,640
It is gonna close for a while.

1934
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:13,480
Did they close the Hard Rock in Vegas?

1935
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:14,200
Is that gone?

1936
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,920
That's the Virgin Hotel in Casino now.

1937
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:18,920
So Mirage is becoming a Hard Rock.

1938
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:20,120
Mirage is becoming a Hard Rock.

1939
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:23,160
Are they gonna get rid of their big freedom royals enchanted garden?

1940
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:25,080
That is slowly being retired.

1941
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:27,640
I think they're rehoming all the animals and stuff.

1942
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:31,160
My brief Googling says volcanoes, fine.

1943
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,200
For now, for like the next year.

1944
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:35,880
And then they're gonna close everything

1945
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:38,920
because they are gonna build a guitar-shaped hotel tower.

1946
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:42,360
It's gonna be like the one they're building in...

1947
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:44,280
Is it Florida or are they building it somewhere else on the East Coast?

1948
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,440
There's a big guitar hotel being built.

1949
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,360
I think they have one.

1950
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,120
This looks so stupid.

1951
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:51,480
Look at a picture of this.

1952
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:52,280
Yeah, yeah, that's what...

1953
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:53,240
This guitar tower.

1954
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:54,600
They built one of those already.

1955
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:55,100
Cool.

1956
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:57,740
That looks so cool.

1957
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:00,780
Somebody's going in for a free room.

1958
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:02,620
It's just so...

1959
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:06,620
The whole idea of Hard Rock is...

1960
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:08,380
Is really relevant.

1961
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:09,740
Is really relevant, yeah.

1962
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:10,460
God, Jesus.

1963
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:14,300
Wait, I was judging off of the headline.

1964
01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:18,380
It says it'll live on into 2023.

1965
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:19,340
But then the quote is,

1966
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:22,860
we will not be continuing to operate the volcano once we commence construction.

1967
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:24,380
Well, what does it have to do with rock?

1968
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:26,940
It's like the Stephen Tyler...

1969
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:27,820
Flames bursting.

1970
01:28:27,820 --> 01:28:29,900
That would be at a Hard Rock concert.

1971
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:31,420
Would it not?

1972
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:33,660
Jimmy Buffett has a song called Volcano,

1973
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:34,380
but it's not his idea.

1974
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:35,740
Jimmy Buffett sent Hard Rock.

1975
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:37,900
And he's already got a place across the street.

1976
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:40,460
So what the fuck are you talking about?

1977
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:42,460
Yeah, you don't want to double up on that.

1978
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:44,780
A volcano is a big part of Dianetics,

1979
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:48,220
and there's a lot of rock star Scientologists out there.

1980
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:50,540
Yeah, Chick Korea.

1981
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:51,420
It all ties together.

1982
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:53,020
That's for the Chick Korea wing.

1983
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:56,380
There's online...

1984
01:28:56,380 --> 01:29:00,380
Hulk Hogan has been seen with a couple of people from Scientology recently.

1985
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:02,140
Yes, that's good.

1986
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:03,100
He needs it.

1987
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:05,900
These worlds have been waiting to meet forever.

1988
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:08,140
What did we miss?

1989
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:09,420
Oh, I know something.

1990
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:11,500
Mike, to quote you a little while ago,

1991
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:16,140
you said you did not want to see any characters from Efteling in a film.

1992
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:21,660
However, there is a TV show called The Magical World of Pardos.

1993
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:26,940
And I thought it was animated because it's a character you mostly see animated.

1994
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:28,780
No, this was like a cheapo.

1995
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:31,740
Although, effects, I don't even want to say cheapo.

1996
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:33,260
It doesn't look like a movie.

1997
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:34,780
It doesn't look like Harry Potter.

1998
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:40,460
But a decent-sized syndicated sci-fi type show,

1999
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:42,140
The Magical World of Pardos.

2000
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:43,900
Better than Bible Man Budget.

2001
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:45,660
Definitely better than Bible Man Budget.

2002
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:49,980
Although, I put on a minute of it last night, and Aaron said,

2003
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:52,140
oh, this looks like Space Cases.

2004
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:52,620
Oh, yeah.

2005
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:53,580
Remember Space Cases?

2006
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:54,220
I do, yeah.

2007
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:55,820
I had Latter-day Snick Show.

2008
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:56,300
Oh, yeah.

2009
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:58,540
So if you want something with Space Cases quality.

2010
01:29:58,540 --> 01:29:59,340
That vibe.

2011
01:29:59,340 --> 01:29:59,820
Yeah, yeah.

2012
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:04,220
I'm impressed by that, that Efteling made a show.

2013
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:05,580
Yeah.

2014
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:09,100
They're making people fall in love with Pardos and OJ Punctual.

2015
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:13,660
There's a TV broadcast that actually kind of tied in with,

2016
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:19,260
it was right around the time of when they were opening Spookslot on a castle attraction,

2017
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:23,500
which was Kate Bush did a performance,

2018
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:27,180
an Efteling TV special, like exclusive performance.

2019
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:31,420
Because her song, Wuthering Heights, was very big in Europe.

2020
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:32,540
Yeah.

2021
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:34,140
I watched this whole special.

2022
01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:35,980
It's so great.

2023
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:39,980
It might have broken the dam for me on liking Kate Bush.

2024
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:41,980
I'm like, I mean, I've liked everything I've heard,

2025
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:43,180
but I've never gone deep.

2026
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:46,220
But I liked every song in this thing so much.

2027
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:46,860
Oh, yeah.

2028
01:30:46,860 --> 01:30:48,780
This song, I think, is called Them Heavy People.

2029
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:51,980
It's all from her first album, which I've now listened to and really like.

2030
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:53,660
I'm like, oh, this might be what I need.

2031
01:30:53,660 --> 01:30:57,900
But her doing Wuthering Heights in Spookslot, and then,

2032
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:07,260
and then, Them Heavy People, she does arm and arm with these three troll creatures,

2033
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:10,780
with animatronics, and she's swaying back and forth with them.

2034
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:12,060
It's so charming.

2035
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:13,820
It's such a great performance piece for-

2036
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:18,060
It's better than Meghan Trainor in front of the Disney World Castle.

2037
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:20,300
Like a holiday special is what you're saying?

2038
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:23,820
To me, but it's in the eye of the whole-

2039
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:29,740
There's a quantity with Meghan Trainor because she's been part of those specials every year.

2040
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:30,380
Every year, it seems like.

2041
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:31,740
For the last 12 years, I think.

2042
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:35,100
Can I bring up something real quick that's completely unrelated, but I have to mention it?

2043
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:40,300
Okay, Jason is wearing, I think, socks that are Spider-Man socks.

2044
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:44,540
These are Spider-Man socks, but they're wool, so it's pretty warm.

2045
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:47,420
To me, it looks like you're wearing a full Spider-Man outfit under your clothes.

2046
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:52,460
I cannot keep- I can't get the thought out of my head, so I had to say it.

2047
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:57,020
It looks like Jason is Spider-Man on the side,

2048
01:31:58,060 --> 01:32:01,820
and I couldn't help but bring it up because it's been driving me nuts for like-

2049
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:05,020
This is actually a classic Dutch pastime.

2050
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:06,380
It's called Spider-Man-ing.

2051
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:11,260
You wear a regular outfit, but you have a full Spider-Man outfit underneath.

2052
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:15,900
I would not be shocked if you were just wearing long Spider-Man underwear under that.

2053
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:18,060
I know it's not what's happening.

2054
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:20,380
Actually, you know what? Prove it to me that those are socks.

2055
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:26,780
These are very snug socks with very snug joggers on.

2056
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:28,540
They go pretty high.

2057
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:30,940
They go- Oh, he's got a full- I can't see it!

2058
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:32,060
I think he's wearing it.

2059
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:33,340
No, that didn't prove it!

2060
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:34,300
That didn't prove it!

2061
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:36,140
That didn't ruin it.

2062
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:38,060
That was so high, and he's not going to show me.

2063
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:43,100
You're pointing at him like the Spider-Man's in the meme.

2064
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:45,260
You're a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, you know?

2065
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:48,220
Mason is wearing a full Spider-Man outfit under these seats right now.

2066
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:55,420
As soon as he leaves, he's going to pull that mask up and either go stop some crime or commit a crime.

2067
01:32:57,740 --> 01:32:59,740
That's how he's getting the CVS candy for free!

2068
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:00,300
That's it!

2069
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:01,500
We solved it!

2070
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,420
He's faking coupons.

2071
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:03,920
Yeah!

2072
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:10,540
I run in, I send someone in to get it, and then when they run out, I don't stop them.

2073
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:12,540
Oh, just like Uncle Ben.

2074
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:13,740
Yeah, just like Uncle Ben.

2075
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:15,740
Wow, that's a scheme.

2076
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:18,300
And then I forget the lesson and eat the candy he got me.

2077
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:23,100
What have we not gotten to?

2078
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:25,980
Oh, did you- you stayed there, did you do the hotel?

2079
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:29,660
We stayed around a lake.

2080
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:33,980
There's a hotel in there and there's a bunch of, quote, holiday villages?

2081
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:35,900
So the holiday village- I was looking at that today.

2082
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:46,860
That's called Village Boss Ridgek, which really looked like a family-friendly Midsommar kind of situation.

2083
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:49,820
It really had those buildings and that vibe.

2084
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:52,380
We stayed, like, stay overnight.

2085
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:57,020
Yeah, I don't know what it was called, but it was like a little-

2086
01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:02,060
there were just little buildings around a lake and it's- yeah, I mean, it's really cool and you can

2087
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:09,980
just walk around and there's an island with a little castle and this- yeah, I got pictures of

2088
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:13,980
that and then you see that and it's on the way.

2089
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:15,660
Oh yeah, that's great.

2090
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:17,580
I'll send us any pictures also.

2091
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:20,860
The main hotel is these crazy themed rooms.

2092
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:22,940
Yeah, we were in a themed room.

2093
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:29,340
Cinderella suite that's got a little- some boiling stew somewhere.

2094
01:34:29,820 --> 01:34:31,100
We weren't in an elaborate one.

2095
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:34,780
We just had like- it was like a little old-timey and it- but it had a painting of this

2096
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:37,500
owl on the wall that was very cool.

2097
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,340
Whoa, that's good.

2098
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:40,540
That's really intense.

2099
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:45,340
The Owl Who Hunts Sinners, another classic children's tale.

2100
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:51,500
Well, you talk themed suites.

2101
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:54,140
You know what the Efteling Hotel has is the Pardo Suite.

2102
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:54,860
Oh yeah, yeah.

2103
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:58,380
Yes, it sparkles with magic.

2104
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:03,180
Read a story together from one of the books in Pardo's bookcase or watch the story of

2105
01:35:03,180 --> 01:35:05,180
Pardo's in Symbolica on TV.

2106
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:08,220
Watch Pardo make love to your wife.

2107
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:13,820
Hear his jingle jingle as he goes down on earth.

2108
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:15,980
Welcome to Europe.

2109
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:27,580
Wait, I have a little bit of- one that I missed, I think of a kind of watershed ride for this place

2110
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:33,980
is the Python and it's kind of a- it's controversial in Efteling history.

2111
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:35,900
It's just- it's a steel looping coaster.

2112
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:44,140
It seems like just a good steel coaster that is not fairy tale and forest and mythology

2113
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:49,900
and it was really the first ride that broke from that and so there were people who didn't

2114
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:54,380
like it and I think it broke all kinds of noise ordinances so the ride was protested

2115
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:57,420
and I read this- I'm not really sure how they got over it.

2116
01:35:57,420 --> 01:35:59,500
I think maybe they just did it.

2117
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:03,100
Just stopped listening to the townsfolk.

2118
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:08,380
But anyway, it's just notable for being a very solid roller coaster.

2119
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:09,500
Really got people in the door.

2120
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:16,940
Took them into the 70s but there's a lot of silly stuff how they promoted this ride and

2121
01:36:16,940 --> 01:36:19,020
some of this by the way comes from Expedition Theme Park.

2122
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:22,140
They made a bunch of great videos about it so to credit them.

2123
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:26,860
But that's where I learned about a couple of weird things.

2124
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:33,580
One is that for a commercial I think they attached a Porsche to the coaster

2125
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:36,700
and there's a video you can watch of them installing it and then this won't be

2126
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:38,460
interesting sound-wise.

2127
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:39,580
This is just for you guys to see.

2128
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:43,820
There's a full Porsche on the front as the front car of a roller coaster.

2129
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:44,220
All right.

2130
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:44,380
Okay.

2131
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:45,420
Why do that?

2132
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:46,380
I don't know.

2133
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:50,540
I don't know what it conveyed or was it for a Porsche commercial?

2134
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:54,940
I'm not sure but the ride vehicle is red and so is the Porsche.

2135
01:36:55,020 --> 01:36:57,020
It's really silly looking.

2136
01:36:57,020 --> 01:37:01,100
I guess it's nice to give a car the chance to ride a roller coaster.

2137
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:03,020
It was going to die.

2138
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:09,740
Our confusion they would call a lack of understanding on America's part.

2139
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:12,380
You know they just go for it.

2140
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:16,940
They commit to the bit at Eftel.

2141
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:19,260
Like they don't ask the question.

2142
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:24,380
They committed to an aesthetic and not using cheap materials.

2143
01:37:26,860 --> 01:37:34,780
Imagine what Epcot would look like if the day one thesis of Epcot and execution of opening

2144
01:37:34,780 --> 01:37:37,420
Epcot just never tapered off.

2145
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:38,140
Never stopped.

2146
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:44,620
Another thing that is said by Expression Theme, there were a bunch of musical acts

2147
01:37:44,620 --> 01:37:49,580
that performed at the opening including local favorites the Dolly Dots.

2148
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:52,860
Let me just play a bit of the Dolly Dots.

2149
01:37:52,860 --> 01:37:54,940
I think I found my new favorite band.

2150
01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:59,820
They're like ABBA but just the girls and then two more sets of girls.

2151
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:05,260
They're not even quite at like Spice Girls level of dancing.

2152
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:10,780
They're not professional but they're on roller skates for this one performance.

2153
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:16,460
This is I'm just gonna play a little of the song Money Lover which is a screed against

2154
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:18,460
money lovers and I really like this song.

2155
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:26,540
All of the Dolly Dots are yelling at a rich man in an open top car.

2156
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:28,540
You're sure this is not an anti-semitic track?

2157
01:38:29,740 --> 01:38:30,460
He's not sure.

2158
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:37,020
Well it's sung in English but with a thick accent which might be masking some very offensive lyrics.

2159
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:39,740
Let's hear what the lyrics of Money Lover are.

2160
01:38:41,020 --> 01:38:44,060
Well I love the lyrics which if you don't understand it when I play it.

2161
01:38:52,780 --> 01:38:55,260
These lyrics are bite the dust hot shot.

2162
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:57,180
There's a roulette.

2163
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:58,460
And then it comes to roulette.

2164
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:06,140
Well you see this awful rich guy in his showy car and then you see him doing some evil gambling

2165
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:11,980
by the end after they all dance and yell at him by the end he's a pennyless.

2166
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:16,300
He walks in like impoverished him and he's drinking in an alley.

2167
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:18,460
So the Dolly Dots ruin this man.

2168
01:39:19,580 --> 01:39:20,700
They destroyed him.

2169
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:22,780
But I really like the go-gos or something.

2170
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:27,420
It's a little bit yeah they start a little more ABBA seemingly and then they kind of turn

2171
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:27,980
that way.

2172
01:39:28,780 --> 01:39:33,340
I really like bite the dust hot shot that feels like a cousin of what's the Mickey phrase?

2173
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:34,540
Soak your head fresh boy.

2174
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:35,500
Soak your head fresh boy.

2175
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:37,340
Yeah yeah yeah feels like a cousin of that.

2176
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:41,340
And then there's one more thing and I think this was kind of the like the Python must

2177
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:46,300
have been the splash mountain of Efteling where they're trying all kinds of crazy stuff

2178
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:47,500
to promote it.

2179
01:39:48,620 --> 01:39:51,340
Actually Efteling has many splash mountains as we've learned.

2180
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:58,380
But in terms of promotional efforts and this I have to play a second of that one promotional

2181
01:39:58,380 --> 01:40:05,660
thing that they did is they did an elaborate escape sequence from the roller coaster like

2182
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:13,180
a car was coming at a magician who was tied to the tracks and the way before Lance Burton

2183
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:21,100
did it outside of Vegas way before that it was first done by a Belgian magician I think

2184
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:24,220
named Joe Alcatraz.

2185
01:40:25,180 --> 01:40:28,220
And I'm just gonna this is just gonna be the sounds of Joe Alcatraz

2186
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:32,060
moaning and writhing as he tries to escape the roller coaster.

2187
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:53,500
And then at the last second when you think all hope is lost Joe Alcatraz is saved by a camera cut.

2188
01:40:54,860 --> 01:40:59,580
It just suddenly like this is the most cop outy thing.

2189
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:04,940
I mean granted if you're if you watch it the coaster does come at him but like why do the cut?

2190
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:07,420
I don't know I'm not sure.

2191
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:08,380
Wait where was the cut?

2192
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:13,580
Like you were looking at one there's one angle for most of his riding.

2193
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:16,220
Oh and then it yeah it's I mean that's yeah.

2194
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:21,260
But I guess it is well look he's on the track and then and he's still screaming

2195
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:25,260
and then the car comes it's better than the Lance Burton one.

2196
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:28,300
I was gonna say is this what Lance Burton got the idea?

2197
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:33,180
Yeah yeah Joe Alcatraz got to it first and I would like to learn everything I can about Joe Alcatraz.

2198
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:36,700
He's got a pretty like nifty van with his name on it.

2199
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:37,200
Wow.

2200
01:41:37,740 --> 01:41:38,860
Really like the name.

2201
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:43,660
So these python promotional efforts love it.

2202
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:49,980
You know that's all like if you can't go to a park what you at least want are a lot of

2203
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:53,420
bizarre YouTube videos stemming from the park and there's no shortage.

2204
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:56,940
There's some I should have actually taken a clip of this there's some great we were just talking

2205
01:41:56,940 --> 01:42:03,580
also on the uh people mover episode about that 70s horn vibe that's missing from Disneyland.

2206
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:05,260
Like that Herb Albert.

2207
01:42:05,260 --> 01:42:07,420
We didn't say porn oh wait oh you said horn.

2208
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:07,820
Horn.

2209
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:12,220
Okay oh sorry I thought I mean you because you could describe that music as being.

2210
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:14,460
Like Herb Albert the famous pornographer.

2211
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:19,020
Well there's that very sexy woman on the cover of one of his albums.

2212
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:20,700
And the whipped cream.

2213
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:21,580
Yes indeed.

2214
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:27,260
Very body dance happened to Mr. Albert's music.

2215
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:30,860
The body brass of Herb Albert I believe is the name of the record.

2216
01:42:30,860 --> 01:42:31,500
Well there you go.

2217
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:37,180
So yeah but there's a lot of commercials that have that vibe too for Efteling.

2218
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:38,860
Oh sure yeah yeah.

2219
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:41,500
Huh like a little swinging retro.

2220
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:44,060
You know that that thing.

2221
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:44,780
Yeah yeah.

2222
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:48,380
Good commercials good materials I don't know what have what have we not

2223
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:51,580
gotten to we've been very productive for being.

2224
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:52,860
I think we covered the main one.

2225
01:42:52,860 --> 01:43:00,060
I mean there's other they have um they have a madhouse style ride where it's like you're

2226
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:04,460
sitting in a room and it seems like the whole place goes upside down.

2227
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:04,940
It's fun.

2228
01:43:04,940 --> 01:43:10,140
These are kind of there there used to be one at Six Flags Great Adventure I remember doing.

2229
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:13,500
Uh that was like Houdini based uh that's just neat.

2230
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:15,180
Oh yeah I did that yeah.

2231
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:20,620
It stuck around for a while and um so they have that at one point in time they had a

2232
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:27,980
bobsled roller coaster that's like imagine a giant bobsled track but with like roller

2233
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:33,500
coaster cars and then yeah you're not on a tread they just release the they just release the car

2234
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:41,260
and then that that was replaced by another upgrade by like dueling power coasters which

2235
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:46,700
I I'd always seen this phrase I I never really processed it but a power coaster is a roller

2236
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:54,060
coaster that is powered the whole time it's not like dropped from a hill to like oh I see

2237
01:43:54,060 --> 01:44:01,900
none of it is gravity you're saying yeah so it can it can do like unique starts like uh uh

2238
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:08,380
so I I again just committing to like oh we're going to do something interesting if we're

2239
01:44:08,380 --> 01:44:13,340
removing something we're replacing it with something worthwhile and there's a museum too

2240
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:19,820
within the park there's a small museum where you can see like old artifacts or like a track from

2241
01:44:20,380 --> 01:44:27,260
you know old rides and wow yeah the museum's great I went there it's great it's worth going

2242
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:32,460
Efteling's great it's a great place it sounds yeah you got you cleaned up their act they did the

2243
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:40,620
right thing they were kicking and screaming into the present day and now we're good uh I did I did

2244
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:45,500
look up like how to get here to see if it's like because I always heard like oh you get on a bus

2245
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:53,340
in the middle of Amsterdam and it doesn't run that often yeah uh yeah it was very uh inconvenient

2246
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:59,500
yeah I I so I I looked it up and it it does mention like there are many public transportation

2247
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:04,220
ways to get here but then there's driving directions from different points and the first

2248
01:45:04,220 --> 01:45:10,460
thing I saw was just the phrase maintaining the direction of door direct slash breetta and I was

2249
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:17,420
like oh man this is this is a little intimidating they're already using the phrase I've I understand

2250
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:22,940
but I've never seen before maintain the direction is this door direct a monster or something

2251
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:30,460
it seems like a thing but it was the website is fun to per use because like there's just little

2252
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:37,740
phrases here and there where it's like not quite a direct translation yeah yeah yeah yeah it's not

2253
01:45:37,740 --> 01:45:43,660
terrible english but it's a little like uh it just reads a little crazy yeah in there like the go

2254
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:48,540
like the um Jason what was this specific one of the in the fairy tale forest there's like 30

2255
01:45:48,540 --> 01:45:53,660
different scenes and stories represented and the one is you peek into the cottage with like

2256
01:45:53,660 --> 01:45:58,540
oh it's incredible there's a wolf dressed goats sitting around the table yeah it's these dressed

2257
01:45:58,540 --> 01:46:05,660
goats there's a wolf at the door um he has a full suit suit and tie yeah he is a suit and tie and

2258
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:09,980
then there's these um he's you know moving they're all moving and then yeah they're sitting on the

2259
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:15,180
table and it just looks like just this crazy like movie I mean it looks like um Lars von Trier's

2260
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:21,500
christ where the animals come in at the end um where it's just like they're just having this

2261
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:27,500
weird meal or another playing a game and but it's haunting it's like really disturbing yeah yeah

2262
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:33,260
this is wonderful yeah yeah it's really yeah it's awful yeah as long as they're like goats uh

2263
01:46:33,980 --> 01:46:39,500
willingly as long as they're well I guess you're what I'm saying is I don't like I am so disturbed

2264
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:46,780
by the donkeys having become donkeys oh and Pinocchio the hands of magic so as long as

2265
01:46:46,780 --> 01:46:51,820
they're okay with being goats that helps me here's another thing I love and I can give you this clip

2266
01:46:51,820 --> 01:46:58,300
is these these boats um there's a boat ride on a lake but they just go on a track and they just

2267
01:46:58,300 --> 01:47:03,020
run them when they're empty so it's just like so scary there's just like this line of empty boats

2268
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:08,380
with no one driving them they just like float through all day and night this ride had no

2269
01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:15,900
survivors they were like they're coming back from hell well they were all taken they were all okay

2270
01:47:17,260 --> 01:47:22,940
the uh resurrection happened oh yeah that's better yeah left behind happened um uh yeah there's some

2271
01:47:22,940 --> 01:47:28,140
mid-sommar stuff uh I don't know that that's the right country to be referencing but you know what

2272
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:33,900
I'm saying just like weird euro like yeah just euro euro weirdness yeah yeah it seems like the

2273
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:39,180
thing about it and that it's like it's still allowed to be weird there isn't some cedar fair

2274
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:43,500
type company it's like yeah I mean you might get more people if you take away the weirdness

2275
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:48,940
sure it's um yeah it's weird and rough around the edges and I'd really like to go just Seth Meyers

2276
01:47:48,940 --> 01:47:52,700
was interviewing Jordan Peele they were talking about going when they were in Boom Chicago this

2277
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:58,060
is like a week ago oh I saw that yeah they went yeah during Boom Chicago's uh uh Amsterdam oh

2278
01:47:58,060 --> 01:48:03,180
yeah it's where a lot of theater a lot of people do go there for like a year and do improv we never

2279
01:48:03,180 --> 01:48:07,100
you didn't audition for that I didn't audition for that because the way everyone described it in the

2280
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:13,260
way it's been talked about it's like we go um to Amsterdam and you do improv for a year and the

2281
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:19,900
audiences do not like you but it's cool that just hang out in Amsterdam for a year you don't get

2282
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:25,820
paid very much and the audiences are not wild about a lot of the shows but it's a great tourist

2283
01:48:25,820 --> 01:48:30,780
so I went there when I was 18 I think I went to a Boom Chicago show in Amsterdam yeah you hated it

2284
01:48:31,660 --> 01:48:39,020
I like I was 18 I liked it I think Will Forte was a um did a dissent there actually well their

2285
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:45,100
alumni role is it's insane yeah of people who did that yeah well the problem is the locals were all

2286
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:48,700
in the audience like who are these performers none of them are goat faces

2287
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:58,060
um uh Jason anything else about uh you want to throw in for me that covers all my Efteling

2288
01:48:58,060 --> 01:49:05,100
memories yeah no it's just a good it's a good place go geez yeah great uh I'm very excited to

2289
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:10,780
we will uh I'm so glad you could you could take us through it mentally Jason Wallander you survived

2290
01:49:10,780 --> 01:49:16,380
podcast the ride uh so so happy you could do this and let's thank you I will get this something

2291
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:22,140
you do not typically choose to do which is exit through the gift shop you don't have to hear

2292
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:29,180
either however uh Paul T Goldman is so amazing we've all watched it yeah we all love it very much

2293
01:49:29,180 --> 01:49:33,900
and uh and the listeners should uh should check it out thanks afterling of shows

2294
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:41,180
uh no I have a new I have a new show newish came out a few weeks ago uh it's on the streaming

2295
01:49:41,180 --> 01:49:49,580
service peacock it's called Paul T Goldman um look for the thumbnail check it out keep your eyes

2296
01:49:49,580 --> 01:49:56,460
opening click it watch it it's six parts um and it's it's the one with the guy it's the one with

2297
01:49:56,460 --> 01:50:01,420
the guy who doesn't look like the typical stars of shows it doesn't but that was from a photo

2298
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:05,980
shoe where like it wasn't a great we didn't get a great photo that really captures him he kind of

2299
01:50:05,980 --> 01:50:11,500
looks unspectacular uninteresting in that photo he's a pretty interesting guy um and the show is

2300
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:18,140
about his story that he tells about marrying uh a woman who turned out had a secret double life

2301
01:50:18,140 --> 01:50:25,420
and his attempts to take down uh her international crime ring which may or may not exist and uh and

2302
01:50:25,420 --> 01:50:32,060
that's kind of the simplest way of uh talking about the show and it's much more complicated than

2303
01:50:32,060 --> 01:50:40,060
that as you guys know oh yeah some great actors some great actors show up in it great actors uh

2304
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:47,580
yeah like paul t gold paul t goldman melinda mcgraw earl brown just great actors you've seen

2305
01:50:47,580 --> 01:50:52,780
in all sorts of things but but acting with this real guy who uh wrote this script and lived his

2306
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:56,540
life and then there's a bunch of other kind of documentary elements to it it's a very hard show

2307
01:50:56,540 --> 01:51:03,340
to describe but it's an easy show to watch that is absolutely i know like like it sounds like it's

2308
01:51:03,340 --> 01:51:08,060
it might sound like math when you hear it but it's all these formats blending but it is so exciting

2309
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:14,620
and it goes down so smooth and it keeps like the there's such variety to it because it's

2310
01:51:14,620 --> 01:51:20,460
cycling through the formats but it's all weaving one story so wonderfully together i hope thank you

2311
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:27,020
thank you uh we had really great editors and uh yeah i worked on it for about 10 years and it's

2312
01:51:27,020 --> 01:51:35,340
out and uh that's my plug it's a it's a really good one and i i don't want to say i don't want

2313
01:51:35,340 --> 01:51:42,380
to that implies that other people's plugs have not but but look uh it's top notch it's so i i

2314
01:51:42,380 --> 01:51:47,820
demand that the audience uh check out paul t goldman on on pico i would say this this crowd the

2315
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:54,540
listener base of podcast the ride definitely a type of person who's after experiences i would

2316
01:51:54,540 --> 01:52:01,660
say this is more of an experience than other tv shows by the time you get to the end uh you've

2317
01:52:01,660 --> 01:52:09,180
gone through something like every possible permutation of of like what it's like in this

2318
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:15,740
guy's mind inside and out of it and and things are turned on him in a way you don't expect and

2319
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:23,180
yeah there isn't an easy uh path through this but i i hope it's uh enjoyable in some way if you sign
