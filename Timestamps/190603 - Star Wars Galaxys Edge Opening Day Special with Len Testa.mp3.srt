1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,520
It's the Star Wars Galaxy's Edge Opening Day special, starring Mike as the master code

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:14,040
breaker, Scott as Rex's daddy, and Jason as the hot dog Padawan.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,760
Featuring appearances by Andy Katok, Aaron Gernert, Jenny Nicholson, and a very special

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,320
galactic sit down with Len Testa.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,000
Right, son.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,720
It's podcast, The Ride.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:52,360
Welcome to Podcast, The Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three men who will soon make

10
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:57,600
the Kessel Run in over 50 parsecs when Jason drops a black tap cake shake on the control

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,600
panel.

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,240
My name is Mike Carlson, I almost ran out of air saying that.

13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,240
You got it out.

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,240
Jason Sheridan.

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,240
You did get it out.

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,240
I will probably do that.

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,240
Yeah.

18
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
Scott Garner also here.

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,080
Yep, I can see it all.

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,680
We don't know a lot of what awaits us in Galaxy's Edge, but that one's guaranteed.

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,080
But that's what the rest of this is all about, is forming the plan, I guess, and trying to

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,360
figure out what we're going to do, because we should explain what's going on here.

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay, the timeline's very confusing.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,600
What's the most confusing timeline in a Star Wars movie?

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,080
Do they mess with time?

26
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,120
There's no time travel in the movies.

27
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,560
Well, you know what this is?

28
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,520
This is like a prequel, second trilogy, third trilogy situation, and the audience is listening

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,040
to a prequel right now.

30
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
Yes, that's true.

31
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,040
That's a good point.

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,940
As we talk, because you are hearing this a couple days after the opening of Star Wars

33
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,560
Galaxy's Edge, but we are recording this a few days before the opening of Star Wars Galaxy's

34
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,920
Edge, but by the time you've heard it, we will have been to Star Wars Galaxy's Edge.

35
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,000
So as this episode proceeds, we will be there, you will hear us there, you will hear us after

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,240
there, saying what we think, but right now we're anticipating, because the moment is

37
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,680
here, it's almost here.

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,440
We got a couple days to go as we record this, but we've been talking about this for years.

39
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,880
I think we probably brought on the first episode, we were like, why are we doing a theme park

40
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,880
podcast?

41
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,680
Star Wars is coming, among other things, and we're finally here.

42
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,120
Yeah, it's felt like maybe a big pitch, if people were like, why are you doing this?

43
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,200
We're like, this stuff is going to get more popular, there's going to be big things coming

44
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,600
that the world will be talking about, and that's what's going to happen.

45
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,520
People will be talking about more than like, you know, Horizons and the Mexico boat ride.

46
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
Yes.

47
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,680
These are like major, and the theme park attractions are major stories in the world right now.

48
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
Right, and this is going to be-

49
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,400
Though the Mexico boat ride always should be, obviously, but-

50
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,160
Yeah, I think if it was a different social media day, that Mexico boat ride would be

51
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,560
celebrated and Instagrammed so hard, but now-

52
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,000
And we will make it so soon enough, but for now, I guess Galaxy's Edge is the big trend.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah, so-

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And we're going to check it out.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,160
Yeah, we're checking it out.

56
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,840
Before we started recording this, we kept accidentally wandering into conversation about

57
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,520
what our expectations are, and then we go, no, no, no, save it.

58
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
No, no, save it, save it.

59
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
Save the good stuff.

60
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,080
It's more like the Extended Universe novels and comic books and video games that are all

61
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,620
now fucking garbage that Disney has deemed not canon.

62
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,620
Not going to see those there.

63
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,880
But are still canon in our hearts.

64
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:36,640
Yeah, yeah, it's not canon like Tony Solaroni and the holiday special when the bots are

65
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
on Sesame Street.

66
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,160
That obviously is all canon.

67
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,760
But yeah, we've, I mean, like, because we had to do a lot of off air discussion of how

68
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,960
this is going to work.

69
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,680
We have like boring personal logistics to work out, like who's going to drive and everything.

70
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,640
But I mean, the main reason being that, you know, also for months, we've been wondering

71
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,500
how are we going to get into this place?

72
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,120
Are we going to get into this place?

73
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,680
And we are getting into this place.

74
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,720
And I'll pre-say, thanks to you, Mike, thanks to you jumping on the best possible plan,

75
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,000
we will be there morning number one, 8 a.m.

76
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,600
Yes, May 31st.

77
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,280
We are in the first group, besides cast members and employees and press, besides.

78
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,280
Fuck all that.

79
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,280
Regular, right.

80
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,280
Good, honest, hardworking Joe's.

81
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,280
Folks.

82
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,280
We folks.

83
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,280
We are the first folks.

84
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,160
The real experience, you know, we don't need Bob Iger, you know, stumbling through a not

85
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:41,160
quite fully baked joke about like the force was with us when we started this project and

86
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,160
it is with us now.

87
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,840
I don't need to hear Steven Spielberg's boring war stories, impradling on.

88
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
Oh, yeah.

89
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,240
With real people, with the people, with the folks.

90
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,920
If someone said you could get in early, I would have said no way.

91
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
No.

92
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
Fuck off, I would have said.

93
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,920
I want to do it with the regular theme park.

94
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,720
I want to do it with the regular people who will enjoy it, not like the 30 member story

95
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,560
committee was spit on the ground when they hear George Lucas's name.

96
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,720
Were we invited to a preview?

97
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
No.

98
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
But that doesn't matter.

99
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
I would have said no.

100
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
Yeah.

101
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,680
We wanted to do it the real way.

102
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
Right.

103
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680
Absolutely.

104
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,320
And we're getting our wish to be to do it in the time when it is the most unorganized

105
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,800
and stressful humanly possible.

106
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,560
If Josh Gad himself came to my door with Scott Trowbridge, I would say, get out of here,

107
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
you two.

108
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,560
I don't want to go to the Galaxy's Edge this way.

109
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
You guys go.

110
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,760
Why don't you guys go make a 180 line crossing unwatchable sketch and leave us to do.

111
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,760
That's the most obscure reference.

112
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,200
I was going to say the audience probably know what you're talking about.

113
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,520
I should be so lucky.

114
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,360
Yeah, no, we're doing it with the I can't believe this is the case.

115
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,640
Mourning number one.

116
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,280
Yeah, because I didn't know if we weren't.

117
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,160
I didn't know if I was going to get in for a full summer.

118
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,960
Money.

119
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,760
Yeah, yes.

120
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,480
Who knew that the solution was to pay extra?

121
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah, because here's what we're going down and we're all get we're all sharing a couple

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,760
hotel rooms because once we realize that was the plan, that's the way to get in.

123
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,920
Yes, the crafty Disney method of pay us more.

124
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,840
Pay us more.

125
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,040
Which are original.

126
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,440
We can say now our original idea was to go in on a tour guide.

127
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,440
Very quickly learned that like, no, not going to work.

128
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,040
Not happen.

129
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,360
It might work, though.

130
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,920
Might work.

131
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,480
It was just unclear of that being a clear cut plan.

132
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,320
Well, you know, when we were talking about that, we didn't know about this reservation

133
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,400
system for the first month.

134
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,640
This was pre-reservation.

135
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,760
This is pre-hotel.

136
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,440
This was pre-wristband.

137
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,720
Now everything's changed.

138
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:42,240
We've been like staring at Twitter's getting every morsel of information and now we sort

139
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,880
of know what we're doing, although I'm still I have no idea how that first morning is going

140
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,760
to go.

141
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,040
Yeah, we've gotten a little more information in the last 24 hours, I feel like.

142
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,560
A really complicated email went out to everybody.

143
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,520
Very complicated.

144
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,280
You listening might have this email.

145
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,000
Wait, really?

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,720
Huh?

147
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,200
Yeah.

148
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,320
If you have a reservation in your name.

149
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,880
Because you didn't know.

150
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,200
Well, other people got it, too.

151
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:11,040
Oh, maybe it's just because we also, spoiler alert, Scott and I are going in different

152
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,240
times as well.

153
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:19,520
Yeah, we all did a lot of math of like when other groups, we all were on the website on

154
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
that first morning.

155
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,440
Probably a lot of listeners were, too, which we made it on and I was very happy, but I

156
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,240
was seeing other people who did not and I felt bad for them.

157
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
Yeah.

158
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,840
Look, I couldn't give up my spot if I wanted to.

159
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,840
I couldn't.

160
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,840
I'd have to make a fake ID.

161
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:41,200
I'm going on the last day I can go to the Disneyland Resort until like late August.

162
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Disneyland Park.

163
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,960
I can go to California Adventure for another like month and a half.

164
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,960
Oh, that's interesting.

165
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
Why is that?

166
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
What's your past situation?

167
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,600
I have the Southern California Pass still.

168
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,400
Oh, and they do California Adventure different days?

169
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,120
They're starting to, yeah.

170
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,120
Interesting.

171
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:04,680
But I'm also, I have to, if I get a chance when I'm down there or maybe ask one of our

172
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,240
potential check-ins with one of the people on the show, because they also just announced

173
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,160
the Disney Flex Pass recently.

174
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,480
That just went into effect.

175
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,260
That cost exactly the same amount as my SoCal Pass.

176
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,760
So now I'm kind of weighing and I also wonder if I can convert it.

177
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Flex sounds good.

178
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
I think you go Flex.

179
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,760
I think maybe, yeah.

180
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
It's complicated.

181
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,960
But if I go Flex, I can never go back.

182
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,360
Yeah, but what's, unless Flex goes away.

183
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
Yeah, that's true.

184
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
Yeah, so.

185
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,360
But that's not, we shouldn't talk about Flex.

186
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
That's a whole nother three hour podcast.

187
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
It surely is.

188
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,360
The most interesting podcast you've ever heard.

189
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,880
I, yeah, we, well, we're all going to get on a spaceship and stuff.

190
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,880
That's probably the main thing.

191
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,680
And we're all, yeah, so we're all going, so Mike, you got, all right, I'm going a second

192
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,960
time with my wife Erin.

193
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,160
You're going how many more times?

194
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
I don't know.

195
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
A couple, a couple times.

196
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
Uh huh.

197
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,560
A couple.

198
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,000
So you'll keep hearing from us about, you know, our, our galaxy's edge thoughts, obviously

199
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,720
pre rise of the resistance, but hopefully we'll, between these visits, we'll have been

200
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,080
able to, been able to fit everything in.

201
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,840
But the main thing is 8 a.m. and we have decisions to make.

202
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
Yeah, big decisions.

203
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,800
What are we, yeah, what's everybody doing?

204
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,320
Do we stick together?

205
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Do we split up?

206
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,720
Because we've got a bigger group too and we'll explain, we'll check in with other people

207
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
as we go.

208
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,600
But Erin and Lindsay are coming, and Andrew Christom's coming.

209
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,280
But like, do we divide and conquer?

210
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,480
Well that's what I'm, so basically the situation is, is that 6 a.m. is when the park opens

211
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,920
and we go into the park, go to Star Wars launch bay in Tomorrowland on the other side.

212
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,920
Very convenient.

213
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
Very convenient.

214
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,360
And you get your wristbands, you have to all be together.

215
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,200
You can't, one person can't be missing, which stresses me out.

216
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Oh fuck.

217
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Yes, yeah.

218
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Man.

219
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,400
You gotta coordinate and be there at the right time, an ungodly early time.

220
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,120
This is like when you buy a row of movie tickets and there's always one or two people who get

221
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,080
into hijinks and it's a real, but worse, but worse.

222
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,120
But an incredibly high pressure because we will all be waiting on this thing we've been

223
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,800
thinking about and talking about for months.

224
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Right.

225
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,160
So wait, so once we, if the park opens at 6 a.m., are attractions running at 6 a.m.?

226
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,160
No, no.

227
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,160
Nothing is running.

228
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
Oh I love you didn't know any of this.

229
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
That is funny.

230
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
It is an empty theme park.

231
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
Which by the way, kind of cool.

232
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,120
Yeah, I'm not into it.

233
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,920
Well, my question then is when do the coffee shops at the hotels open?

234
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
I'm sure those are open.

235
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
I believe 5 a.m. or 4 a.m.

236
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
I'm sure those are open very early.

237
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,080
I'm sure I've read that they will have like limited amount of food open at 6 a.m. in the

238
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,080
park.

239
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
Sure.

240
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,080
They're not gonna abandon us.

241
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,680
And the parking garage is supposedly open at midnight.

242
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
So what's going on?

243
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,680
Are people getting there?

244
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,160
Like will there be some lineup?

245
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,400
Well, this is the thing.

246
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,600
This is the thing that always happens is they say no one can line up before 6 a.m.

247
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Just come in at 6 a.m.

248
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
That's how it'll work.

249
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,320
But where do the people that are waiting to get in at 6 a.m. go?

250
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,320
Yeah.

251
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,800
So there will be a line.

252
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,920
Yeah, there's no way this doesn't end up in a line.

253
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,120
There's always a line.

254
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,760
It just maybe it's on maybe it's in front of Captain Kids or something.

255
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,680
You know, like it'll be somewhere.

256
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,880
It's on the freeway probably.

257
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,000
So I'm glad we're there overnight because fighting our way in.

258
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yes.

259
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,520
This month fighting your way in is going to be crazy.

260
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,520
Yes.

261
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,520
I think that.

262
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,160
By the way, also, if you guys know this is pre Galaxy's Edge.

263
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,160
We follow this Twitter, the annual past Twitter that says, oh, Mickey and Friends is closed

264
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,520
to go to Toy Story.

265
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,120
So many days I've been seeing there is no parking available at Disneyland Resort.

266
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,880
So many of these days.

267
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,920
I think people want to see it.

268
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:42,080
Want to see it before it becomes whatever it becomes, you know, with Star Wars, because

269
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,120
also they have refreshed a lot of the park like we get to see this.

270
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
Later, Castle.

271
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
I haven't seen any of this.

272
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
Yeah, that's good.

273
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
Uh huh.

274
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,720
You'll see it at six a.m. like jacked up on a quad latte.

275
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
It's beautiful.

276
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Beautiful.

277
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Yeah.

278
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
Three hours of sleep.

279
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
Yeah.

280
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
All of us together.

281
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,560
We got to figure it out.

282
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
So I was talking.

283
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,360
There's another there's some other people going with this and I was talking to this

284
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,960
one person and she was saying that I was saying like, well, should we get the launch

285
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,160
bay at seven?

286
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,160
And she was like, oh yeah, that's so that would be pretty good because I was I do think

287
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,280
even though there will be a line to get in, I think getting into the land won't be that

288
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,760
bad because there's a limited amount of people.

289
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,760
Yeah, maybe it's a thousand people, but everyone should be wristbanded by that point.

290
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,920
And really all that is is just a march in.

291
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,120
So marching in a line of a thousand.

292
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,880
Once you have your wristband isn't going to be the worst thing.

293
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,800
It seems like it's been working pretty well for the cast member previews and presumably

294
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,960
it's about the same number allocated.

295
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,200
And since yes, since the number going in, I think is the capacity of the land, we're

296
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
not going to be held.

297
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,760
I don't think it'll just sort of be a steady stream.

298
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,280
And that's the very opening of the park anyway.

299
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,680
And that's the only people in the park will be there for now.

300
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,200
It's going to be tough because when 11 a.m.

301
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,240
rolls around and we won't leave or at mid noon, we won't leave.

302
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,760
We refuse to leave because we're crying, touching the walls.

303
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,080
A stormtrooper to hit me with the butt of their gun to make me.

304
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,240
I want them to hit me in the mouth to make me leave.

305
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,080
Kill me. Kill me.

306
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,000
You'll do the ride with a concussion, but you'll do the right.

307
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,080
That's going to be the general Hawks walk around character to slap me with a glove.

308
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
That's going to be the problem.

309
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,960
A big spanking.

310
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,200
Give me a big spanking on my bottom like that woman in Vegas was going to do to you.

311
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,120
Yes, like that. Oh, no.

312
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,280
But with a light paddle,

313
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,120
Captain Phasma is going to bring a big space paddle.

314
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,840
Who runs the Cantina?

315
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,640
Uga. Uga is.

316
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,120
Oh, no. Is it Uga?

317
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,040
It's probably spelled Uga.

318
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,360
But it's probably Uga.

319
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,200
I keep confusing Uga and Doc Ondar.

320
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
Don't confuse them.

321
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,320
I know they both seem like real prickly pairs.

322
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,320
Well, maybe we should talk about priorities, because here's what worries me is that

323
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,240
what if there is more of a ride situation and I don't get my dream

324
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:16,760
of being the first layperson to have a glass of Padme wine in Star Wars Galaxy's Edge?

325
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,440
Well, this seems to the play here.

326
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,320
I do think that the incentive to lining up at 4am, which I'm not saying we do,

327
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,200
I don't think we should do that.

328
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,320
But that is the fact that then you will be at the very front of the line.

329
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,880
So it seems like the lines that form that are the worst are the Cantina and the Falcon.

330
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,600
But the Falcon, I think, loads fast.

331
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,360
Yes. And it's also built to accommodate lines.

332
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,680
Yes. As opposed to a 30 person occupancy.

333
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,000
How many people fit in there? It's like 130.

334
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,880
Very. Yeah.

335
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,400
It's going to be great in three years when it's less crowded.

336
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,760
Yeah. Yeah. But right now, yeah.

337
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,520
Sure. That's what they said about Trader Sam's.

338
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,680
Always fun and easy to get into.

339
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,640
Always a pleasant experience.

340
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,000
Oh, no. But don't you appreciate that it's small?

341
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,000
I appreciate it. No.

342
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,800
You're out of your fucking mind. I like it.

343
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,080
It should be huge.

344
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,360
Isn't the one in Florida bigger?

345
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,880
A little bigger. Do you appreciate the size of that one?

346
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,760
Well, no, it's very it's negligible.

347
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,840
Oh, OK. How much bigger it is in Florida.

348
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,280
I will say there should be more of an outdoor.

349
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,520
There should be more of an outdoor, which they've kind of made the terrace

350
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,560
a little bit more fun and you can sit at the bar.

351
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,040
I do think it'll be fun if there were like little rooms

352
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,440
that maintain the intimacy, but didn't.

353
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,880
Well, I like being in a small bar, but wait, which I was going to say,

354
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,840
like almost like some sort of club, like an adventure themed club

355
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,800
with different small bars and rooms.

356
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,000
That seems like what an idea.

357
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,160
It'll never work. I think that.

358
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,520
I think the play probably is

359
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,120
get in line at the Cantina first.

360
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,440
I think we have a drink.

361
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,520
What Jason's giggling with Glee.

362
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,200
I have I have a number one.

363
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,040
I don't think anyone else has a number one.

364
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,320
Well, everybody's priorities.

365
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,280
Yeah, because I think I'm Cantina.

366
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,600
But I also like, can we contend people all get in?

367
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,440
But this is well, this is maybe this is my thing.

368
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,560
And this is what I have to ask our source, our source who has been inside already.

369
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,920
Do they think that maybe three

370
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,520
or five can leave and explore while certain people hold places in line?

371
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,920
Sure. That's the question I have, because that sounds fine.

372
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,400
But then we got a cycle.

373
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,840
And what a chore for somebody to stand in the line for.

374
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,040
That's unfair to.

375
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,440
Well, but it will.

376
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,960
We'll set a timer on our phones.

377
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,360
So like 15 minute intervals.

378
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,680
I think it can't be you leave and do the Falcon.

379
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,320
No, I agree. Yeah, for sure.

380
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,360
But like 15 minutes, you explore.

381
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,200
Sure.

382
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,480
And then come back and exchange with the people.

383
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,400
I like this. Yeah, we can do that.

384
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,200
I think that makes the most sense to me.

385
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,000
Mm hmm. Go see the Rondo Roaster.

386
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,120
Go see the run to see the pod race engine. Yeah.

387
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,680
Yeah. OK. So what is Jason?

388
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,920
What is your priority?

389
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,880
My number one is the milk bar.

390
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,880
Ever since I was a child, I've wanted to drink the blue milk.

391
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,680
Is that true? Yeah.

392
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,640
I ever since I was a kid, I was when Luke sits down in a new hope

393
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,040
and starts drinking the blue milk, I was like, what the fuck is that?

394
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,600
I want to drink that.

395
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,800
Now the milk bar is by the Cantina.

396
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,320
And according to a few posts, the milk bar,

397
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,240
docking Bay Seven, the other restaurant and Rondo Roasters,

398
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,000
I think all three will have mobile ordering.

399
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,560
OK, so in theory, you might be fine.

400
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,680
I can mobile order a blue milk and green milk, but I'm afraid I'd get sick

401
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,800
because my number two milk to milk to you.

402
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,680
8 a.m. You've had to color milks before.

403
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,600
Now non dairy coconut with a hot dog to sop it up.

404
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,000
That's number two. The space hot dog.

405
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,080
Yeah, it is. It actually is.

406
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,200
That's number two.

407
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,560
But they're like, here's the breakfast version.

408
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,920
It's like, I don't want the breakfast.

409
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,120
I want the lunch version with with pulled pork and coleslaw and ranch on top.

410
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,480
When does the lunch version come? Wow.

411
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,640
That's a big question.

412
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,240
Where there were all we're all doing morning hours.

413
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,120
You will be like you'll be craving pulled pork at 8 a.m.

414
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,520
I will be wanting white wine.

415
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,400
I mean, the morning is possible.

416
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,440
I will be the I want a sugary drink, colorful drink.

417
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,000
I will be hammered at 9 a.m.

418
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,200
My stretch goal is then to get into the Cantina

419
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,800
and have the second kind of blue milk as well.

420
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,920
But I realize that's unrealistic.

421
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,600
You really need to do both milks in one day.

422
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,040
I don't need to do both milks in one.

423
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,120
That's the indulgent.

424
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,360
There is nothing.

425
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,840
I'm shocked that you've saying this about the blue milk.

426
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,520
I've never actually seen anyone say, wow, wouldn't it be great

427
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,920
to have the milk from Star Wars when they when they did the Star Wars

428
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,280
hyperspace mountain and they and the Star Wars launch bay in 2015.

429
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,400
And my family was visit.

430
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,680
We were there like the first day they did all that stuff.

431
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,680
And they're like, look, there's going to be Star Wars food.

432
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,160
I'm like, all right, blue milk. Here we go.

433
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,240
Yeah, I get that it makes sense because that's one of the only food items

434
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,720
that they sort of talk about or call out in the movies.

435
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,560
I just I'm just saying, like unlike butter beer, which is so,

436
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,240
I think, appetizing if you read the books, how they make it sound.

437
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,160
And then they talked about it.

438
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,360
And like it's so thought of fondly.

439
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,000
Blue milk is just like, well, just make the milk blue, I guess, for Luke.

440
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,760
And it'll be like a space milk or whatever.

441
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,360
Like it's such an afterthought.

442
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,200
And it was never very appetizing to me, at least.

443
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,520
And I've never heard this.

444
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,720
It's the kind of thing that usually I would be saying

445
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,960
and someone on Twitter or Facebook is like, fuck it, Scott Brenner.

446
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,080
And I'm actually surprised to hear a counter Star Wars point from you.

447
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,440
I could be wrong.

448
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,560
I've just never heard anyone speak of it in a way of like, man,

449
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,520
I always wanted to try that blue milk.

450
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,160
I always wanted. I don't know.

451
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,520
I just flew was always my favorite color. And

452
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,200
sure, I think I think the way they've talked about like that, it's non-dairy.

453
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,600
So a lot of people can enjoy it.

454
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,240
That is kind of like it's meant to be cold for hot.

455
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,120
Well, and it has like citrus flavor.

456
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,920
Like I'm very they've intrigued me.

457
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,840
What do you think that taste is like if you had to compare it to if you had to guess

458
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,200
before and will update everyone else and everyone in 10 minutes

459
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,080
about what it actually tastes like?

460
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,080
Well, I know the I know the green ones supposed to have like hints of melon flavor,

461
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,760
which I think in melon liqueur, like the Star Trek experience.

462
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:26,040
I don't know. I think from what I understand, like of like candy and sweets in Asia,

463
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,520
melon is more of a go to, but would be more unique for American audiences.

464
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,720
And that seems to be what they're doing with the food program in Star Wars.

465
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,440
Like stuff, stuff is unique, but a little familiar.

466
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,960
Sure. So, yeah, so I'm honestly not sure.

467
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,800
The blue milk may just taste like strawberry milk, honestly.

468
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,200
Yeah, you know, this isn't a super big priority, but yeah, if I could

469
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,520
eat something while I'm there, like I it's definitely not.

470
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,320
If I leave and just go do regular uva bar kind of stuff

471
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,280
and we just have regular days the day, whatever.

472
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,400
But like I am excited about the food and I haven't yet been to Avatar.

473
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,960
So I haven't done this new breed of like elevated Disney food

474
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,920
and themed Disney food and so much of what's been on blogs and everything.

475
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,280
Looks like that a lot of it is like plant that it's like,

476
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,040
oh, falafel balls with like a tomato cucumber salad and pita like,

477
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,360
oh, that sounds very neat and refreshing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

478
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,920
Yeah. But also like crazy meat, crazy meats. Yeah.

479
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,440
Crazy jerky. The one stands going to sell different kinds of jerky.

480
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,360
Chewbacca, Jerky, Jerky.

481
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,520
I forget what kind of meat they said, but also, yes, I want to see you.

482
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,440
You get you could get like, you know, like I'm going to guess like 600 slices

483
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,480
out of out of one Wookie.

484
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,560
I or if it's just the kind of Wookie's like,

485
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,480
I hope I'm not behind Chewbacca in line.

486
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,120
He's going to buy out the whole shop.

487
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,080
But I do want to go to the Ronto.

488
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,880
I think it's very funny cooking over a pod race.

489
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,720
Yeah, it's great.

490
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,840
And I like that they are acknowledging the prequel that they are

491
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,800
because the worlds of Star Wars are interesting and fun.

492
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,040
And so, yeah, yeah.

493
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,200
Yeah, I know. It's nice that it's not like exclusively.

494
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,120
It seems like it's more like Episode seven, eight, nine dominant, but it's not.

495
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,080
Generally. Yeah. Yeah.

496
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,840
There's not a lot of history.

497
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,000
But I yeah, I don't I don't know.

498
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,160
And then I guess number three for me would be the Falcon Ride.

499
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,840
But if like only some of us can get into the Cantina,

500
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,880
I recognize it's important for you, Scott.

501
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,160
I'd rather you go.

502
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,480
Well, that's the sweetest thing I've ever pilgrimage to Rex.

503
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,440
And I won't hold you back from eating your space dogs.

504
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,280
This is perfect.

505
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,120
I wasn't we leave you.

506
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,240
I don't know in what way would I

507
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,480
just shoving kids out of the way to get a hot dog at 8am.

508
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,920
I really first time.

509
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,480
I mean, I'd love to be the first.

510
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,200
I'd love to be the first, because really what you're talking about

511
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,800
is the first like layperson Disneyland drinker.

512
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,840
If I could hold that title or if I could see that to my wife,

513
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,880
if she could have that title.

514
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,160
But it also seems like you got to be a 4am line.

515
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,440
I think there's no way yet.

516
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,840
You get to be first unless we're sitting outside Captain Kids in a tent.

517
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,440
I think that might be the only way I think.

518
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,640
And then the city of Anaheim will like gun us down.

519
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,000
Yes, very possible.

520
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,080
We'll be sprayed by a fire.

521
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,080
Yes. The Disney police, the Disney secret police

522
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,360
rid of the unwanted

523
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,000
unsightly people will go to Tustin, motherfuckers.

524
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,720
Yeah. Mike, what is your number?

525
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,040
What are you leaning towards?

526
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,440
Number one is hard.

527
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,760
I think getting in the canteen is my number one.

528
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,560
I do. I think seeing Rex, I think having a weird cocktail

529
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,360
seems so fun to hear.

530
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,400
I want to hear the music that Rex is playing.

531
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,440
Because eventually we're going to need to hear the whole Rex.

532
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,400
Right. So let's start shipping it off now.

533
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,840
And number one being that being number one just feels like that's going to be

534
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,960
so popular.

535
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,240
And it's such a hard thing is like they let you stay in there for 45 minutes.

536
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,200
How do they do? We know how they enforce that.

537
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,800
No idea. Who knows?

538
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,960
Oh, boy. So like that that feels like this, the thing of like,

539
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,640
oh, I got to do it.

540
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,680
Like, that's why I'm having the most anxiety about.

541
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,520
Well, we were agreed then we all it's all straight there.

542
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,880
I mean, we can all we'll all have like an hour upwards to game plan

543
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,560
with nothing to do in an empty Disneyland.

544
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,320
So I think we'll figure it all out.

545
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,360
And I bet we can also get on.

546
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,760
But we were saying we're hearing conflicting reports.

547
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,680
I was specifically told by somebody who knows Imagineer or whatever

548
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,480
that lines have been pretty short during cast member previews for Falcon

549
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,280
and that the Cantina is really the problem.

550
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,800
Yeah, I heard that multiple people were saying you can't do both Cantina

551
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,560
and Falcon, that the lines are too long,

552
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,720
that there was a three hour line in one cast member preview.

553
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,640
But who knows? Who knows?

554
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,600
We're getting there first thing.

555
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,800
But there's still there's going to be probably more.

556
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,080
Say we get there at what do you think we should do as far as getting at the

557
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,840
launch bay? Because I was the first thing like seven.

558
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,000
And I was like, oh, that's an hour. That'll be.

559
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,680
But like, does that mean 500 people are in front of us?

560
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,760
Well, my other question is and what I heard was that you can't build

561
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,360
a lightsaber and do the Falcon. It takes too long.

562
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:13,480
But then now they're saying there's a separate scheduling to do the lightsaber.

563
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,680
I don't know that any of us are in the market for a two hundred dollar

564
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,080
well, we are at the moment.

565
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,600
Yeah, I don't think I'm going to do that.

566
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,840
I feel like you both want to buy Rex's.

567
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,880
I will certainly have Rex.

568
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,040
I will buy Rex.

569
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,720
I think that is that there.

570
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,280
Rex, I think, is you buy him off the shelf.

571
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,560
I don't think you don't make a rat.

572
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,520
You don't have to sit in it.

573
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,000
Whatever the Droid Depot show, because I've heard that's maybe a crazy line.

574
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,200
That might be a time.

575
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,760
I am. I have enough crap, but I would like a tiny waddo, a tiny toy, toy

576
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,560
hands, fake hands on waddo from the toy stall.

577
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,560
I got the Java looks very cute.

578
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,560
The Java looks good.

579
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,840
There's there's like a wampa that looks real looks cute.

580
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,240
And I like the they have like tin toys or wooden toys like those.

581
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,600
Like the latest crumb toy looks pretty good.

582
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,760
Salacious crumb. Yeah.

583
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,840
I have to see what grabs me in the moment.

584
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,000
I want to see how big all this stuff is because I have a stunt

585
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,040
trooper who will grab you and grab you throw you out of the land.

586
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,240
Yeah. Drown you in the rivers of America.

587
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,400
Get out of the bar, idiot.

588
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,120
I mean, I want to get a coke.

589
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,720
I want one of the bottles.

590
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,200
That's a prayer. That's a day one priority.

591
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,320
It's a little down on the list.

592
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,920
Are you going to drink it or just leave it?

593
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,040
I'm not sure. Yeah, I haven't decided.

594
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,360
We are lucky that we do have the other reservations.

595
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,840
So I think I think what you got to prioritize in that first day

596
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,280
is what do you want to do on that first day?

597
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,920
Because we'll get to do everything.

598
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,320
Well, I'll be there a bunch.

599
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,160
And I'm my second one is at night.

600
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,280
And I'm excited to see how it's different tonight.

601
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,880
But I mean, bar first day seems like you got to do it.

602
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,600
You got to do it.

603
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,480
And now so now what you're going to hear is whatever happened.

604
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,720
You may hear us in a line in the park if Jason allows it.

605
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,400
It seems like you've come around.

606
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,440
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

607
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,200
No, I came around.

608
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,280
Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

609
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,320
Not an issue.

610
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,040
But, you know, who are will we be too frazzled to will we be to like

611
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,520
coffee bleary, will we be too drunk?

612
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,920
Where are we? Where are we all going to be at?

613
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,480
I know morning of May 30th.

614
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,840
30 is probably if you're saying seven, it should probably be six.

615
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,160
I was thinking six 30.

616
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,880
You can get to launch pad six 30. Yeah, I guess so.

617
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,240
My other concern is are people whose reservations are at like

618
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,600
four or eight p.m.

619
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,320
Are they going to be there at six a.m.

620
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,680
thinking they're going to get their wristband and then come back?

621
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,840
So really? Like, I don't I don't think so.

622
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,240
But I don't know. I could be wrong.

623
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,600
You never know. Huh?

624
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,760
I don't I don't know.

625
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,640
The question then is at six a.m.

626
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,000
is everyone allowed in the park that has reservations or just people

627
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,440
that have eight to 12?

628
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,760
As long as it's just eight to 12, that won't be a problem.

629
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,480
At the very is there a separate check at supposedly Disneyland?

630
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,800
Supposedly there is like a magic mornings.

631
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,440
They have a system in place for like when they do an extra magic hour

632
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,760
for only certain guests.

633
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,720
But I don't know if you just flash your hotel key.

634
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,520
They've also erected some temporary customer service stations

635
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,840
throughout the whole park, knowing that there's going to be

636
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,960
a million questions about Star Wars in a moment like this.

637
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,760
I am very glad that we have Mike as our guide through crowd complications

638
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,760
and I don't know a deeply confusing

639
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,240
credit flow scenarios.

640
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,080
The fact that you got because you were also juggling all this weird

641
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,880
like you had another hotel room, there was all this bizarre.

642
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,080
I've had five total hotel rooms booked at a certain point.

643
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,960
And then I got no weird fees to to get rid of them.

644
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,320
Have to make sure you cancel before a certain time.

645
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,960
And that's potentially still a tip for people.

646
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,520
Maybe there are still hotel rooms available towards the end of the month.

647
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,480
Yeah, there are no there's still you can get one for Thursday.

648
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,760
Huh? Really? Yeah.

649
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,760
Because people cancel all the time. Sure.

650
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,200
Yeah. So it's just that's the checkers.

651
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,000
That's the checkers knowledge.

652
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,360
Thank God there's like in that Falcon cockpit.

653
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,080
Like we need a good pilot and we need a good engineer,

654
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,560
but we mainly need a good checker.

655
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,480
We need a good check.

656
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,120
I'll check in the back of the Falcon.

657
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,080
I don't have to control the those.

658
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:28,680
Thinking back to 2012 and like Cars Land open and the DCA revitalization was done.

659
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,880
Like we I think you went down opening day

660
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,880
and then we both went down on Sunday of that opening weekend.

661
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,400
But we just wandered.

662
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,000
We did it on a whim. Parked at Mickey and friends.

663
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,240
When it is crowded. Sure.

664
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,720
I think I even did Raider Springs Racer is like that opening weekend.

665
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,160
But it's so crazy how it's evolved.

666
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,680
Well, I have some trust in that Disney knows what they're doing.

667
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,400
And I'm going to I'm going to lock in some feelings here a couple of days before

668
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,000
so that I'll see if my expectations are not met or matched a couple of days later.

669
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,880
But I'm going to say here now before the opening, it's all seemed smoother

670
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,280
so far than I expected it to be.

671
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,560
The reservation seems smart.

672
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,160
There being a cap on it seems smart.

673
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,360
And now will we be able to do all the thing?

674
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,040
I think if I just the fact that I might be able to do one major thing on

675
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,280
the morning of May 31st.

676
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:25,680
But you could hear us, you know, if you say fast forward five minutes

677
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,920
and we could all be screaming angry. I don't know.

678
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,920
I don't know. We'll see.

679
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,400
The future isn't written yet.

680
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,840
You know, that's the thing about the future.

681
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,800
No, but if the past is any indication, like in Star Wars,

682
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,160
the cycles just keep repeating themselves.

683
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,400
The story is rhyme, as George Lucas says.

684
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,080
The story is rhyme. You ever see George said that?

685
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,320
Yeah. Oh, so that makes it OK that just all the same things happen in episode seven.

686
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,760
That's what he says.

687
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,440
Well, if he justified it long ago, we'll all be visited by force

688
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,200
ghosts of ourselves today by May 29th us saying,

689
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,400
but you said you would have a wonderful morning.

690
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,400
You said you were looking forward to it.

691
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,600
Shut the fuck up.

692
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,320
Force ghosts of Christmas future.

693
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,200
Yeah, I don't know where usually like the other.

694
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:22,680
And yes. So so stay tuned for the thrilling conclusion in a couple of seconds.

695
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,720
Yeah. The next time you hear us, we will either be doing it or mad

696
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,000
or something will be happening.

697
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,240
The thrilling conclusion, also known as the meat of this episode.

698
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,680
Yes. Yeah. The actual.

699
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,400
Here we go. Here it is.

700
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,640
This is Anaheim dispatch from the front

701
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,520
Galaxy's Edge. The time is 717.

702
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,760
May 31st.

703
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,720
And we have made it into an empty Tomorrowland.

704
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,480
Tomorrowland is now a holding pen for Star Wars, Galaxy's Edge.

705
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,440
But hey, a pretty efficient start, right?

706
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,480
For anybody wondering, is this going to be chaos?

707
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,760
Wasn't chaos yet.

708
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,560
We were worried there was there's a long line,

709
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,680
but it was just for merch.

710
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,760
It was at the top floor of the launch.

711
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,240
Terrifyingly big line.

712
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,280
Yeah, but no, that was OK. It was a quick line.

713
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,400
We got to see a video of Scott Trowbridge talking about the new land.

714
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,760
We all shouted Scott Trowbridge together.

715
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,760
And you know, it's a good crowd when that's happening.

716
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:24,480
We did say it's a very good crowd because we are joined by show

717
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,000
favorite guests here.

718
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,960
I'm going to pull her over.

719
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,440
Joining us here in line, Jenny Nicholson is here.

720
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,280
Hi, I'm Jenny and I'm sick.

721
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,720
We swear it's her.

722
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,000
I know she sounds different.

723
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,120
This is my real voice.

724
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,720
Oh, jeez.

725
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,200
This is what I just talk like when I'm not doing a video.

726
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,600
You put on a lot of cheeriness.

727
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,200
You dredge a lot up for these things.

728
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,080
It straightens my voice so much that it sounds like this the rest of the time.

729
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,680
Wow, jeez.

730
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,600
Well, hey, we'll try to put some filters on it or something.

731
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,640
Yeah, just raise the pitch a lot.

732
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,920
It'll make it sound natural.

733
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,400
I think we can work some magic.

734
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,040
So we're here at morning number one, but you beat us.

735
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,120
You've done it already.

736
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,440
I did the cast preview on the 26th.

737
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,520
Boy, oh boy.

738
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,720
What can you tell us?

739
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,640
It was great.

740
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,200
Sure.

741
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,160
The blue milk is refreshing.

742
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,760
OK.

743
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:13,360
But it's also a slush, which, you know, I don't like slush that much.

744
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,400
I see. OK.

745
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,800
So consistency.

746
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,280
And that's all you have to say.

747
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,880
Yeah, there's nothing else to go.

748
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,120
You have items with you.

749
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,760
You've already done some merch and you don't have to wait in the horrible merch line.

750
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,920
It's called a quack horn.

751
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,040
It's a droopy McCool's instruments.

752
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,360
And I brought my port.

753
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,040
Can you play a little bit of droopy McCool's instrument?

754
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,520
Of the quack horn?

755
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,200
Yeah, here.

756
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:32,840
You need some help?

757
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,680
Oh, this won't be annoying here.

758
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,160
So this is like a Cantina band flute.

759
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,960
Looks like a cosmic shillelagh.

760
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,800
OK.

761
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,200
And then it doesn't have the last note.

762
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,120
Beautiful, beautiful, too.

763
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,160
Hey, it seems like you're an expert on this thing already.

764
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,400
The notes are so beautiful.

765
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,000
It's wonderful.

766
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,760
Can you just really quickly play the podcast, The Ride Beam?

767
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,320
Here you go.

768
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,240
Yeah, sure.

769
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
Perfect.

770
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
That's it.

771
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,200
I just improvised that.

772
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Nailed it.

773
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
Nailed it.

774
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,200
Exactly what it would be on the podcast.

775
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,200
You have to pay for realties, but you can use that every episode if you want.

776
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Geez, thank you so much.

777
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,200
Well, then we didn't realize you'd be doing musical accompaniment as well.

778
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
I know.

779
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,200
It's crazy.

780
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,200
What is your plan of attack going back?

781
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,200
Where do you want to go first?

782
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
I want to go straight to the lightsabers.

783
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,200
Let's not say this too loudly.

784
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:27,200
I want to go straight to the lightsabers because it was like the worst line at the preview and

785
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
I haven't done it yet.

786
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,200
OK.

787
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,200
And I didn't want to do it then because I wanted to be able to record it.

788
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,200
Same with the droids.

789
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,200
And there were no photos or videos allowed there.

790
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,200
Yes.

791
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,200
So that's my first plan.

792
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,200
And then I'd like to do the Cantina today, but that might not happen.

793
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,200
So we'll see.

794
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:49,200
Yeah, I hear that's the check-in we can do at about 730 is I do feel like the dream of

795
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
first wine at the Cantina is dead.

796
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,200
Looking at the line ahead of me.

797
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
Oh, I want to drink that Tonneray Alderain.

798
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
Is that the first wine?

799
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,200
Oh, yes.

800
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,200
Is that Padme?

801
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
Is that Padme's wine?

802
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,200
That's what Scott wants to do too.

803
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,200
Yeah, it's from Alderain.

804
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,200
And then Alderain was destroyed.

805
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
So it's now in a finite supply.

806
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
Oh, there's no more of those grapes.

807
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,200
They only have a few cats.

808
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,200
It's a genocide wine.

809
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,200
Folks, everyone's lining up for the genocide.

810
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
It's almost too late.

811
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Yeah.

812
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,200
It is certainly my hope that we can toast some, what is the name of the wine again?

813
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,200
Tonneray.

814
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Tonneray.

815
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,200
If we can all toast some Tonneray wine together and Erin, can you jump in really fast?

816
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,200
Yeah.

817
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
We're talking about wine.

818
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,200
We're talking wine, so Erin Gerdner has to be summoned.

819
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,200
Welcome back to the show.

820
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,200
Do you have a palate?

821
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Yes.

822
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
So you're not going to like the teal wine?

823
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,200
Oh, well, whatever.

824
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,200
I'm not discriminating.

825
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,200
If it's wine, you guzzle it down.

826
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,200
I have a palate for everything.

827
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Okay, good.

828
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,200
Well, what about you guys?

829
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:51,200
If we do a canteen, I've heard, I was hearing people talk around the Tango of Terris last

830
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
night about the fuzzy Tonton.

831
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,200
Tonton.

832
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,200
Tonton.

833
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
It has some kind of foam on it.

834
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,200
Uh-huh.

835
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,200
Yeah.

836
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,200
But I also learned just now that there's not, there's like tiki-ish glasses, drink stuff.

837
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,200
Yes, but also they have like a big porg sipper.

838
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,200
What?

839
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,200
Yeah, they didn't have it at the preview.

840
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,200
They showed me a picture and they were like, they're going to have this opening day and

841
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,200
I want it more than anything.

842
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,200
You can drink out of like a hollowed out porg?

843
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,200
I think literally like the straw comes out the top of its head or something.

844
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,200
It was just a little picture on the menu, but I want it.

845
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,200
Is it ceramic?

846
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,200
It's probably plastic.

847
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Yeah.

848
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,200
I like that popcorn bucket that's the mouse droid as well.

849
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
Wait, what?

850
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,200
That's what I heard.

851
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
There's a pop, maybe I, that's a rumor.

852
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,200
I don't know.

853
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
I love that.

854
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,200
Oh, it would be actual size too.

855
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,200
Yeah, supposedly there's like fun flavor popcorn.

856
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,200
I've tried that.

857
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,200
And then it's the mouse droid, supposedly.

858
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,200
It's like a kettle corny effect.

859
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:47,200
It's like the red popcorn is like kind of vaguely spicy and salty and the purple stuff

860
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
is like gross and fruity and sweet.

861
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
But together, it's like kettle corn.

862
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,200
So it's pretty good.

863
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:57,200
As long as we can eat out of a hollowed out skeleton or drink.

864
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Yeah.

865
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,200
Yeah.

866
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,200
If we can fill up a poured skeleton with wine, I think that's the, at 8 a.m.

867
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
That would be the best outcome.

868
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:09,200
I just want to get liquored up at 8.30 a.m. or 9.30 a.m.

869
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,200
I just want to get so hammered so early at Disneyland.

870
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,200
That's a regular Friday for me.

871
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,200
So.

872
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,200
Nothing different.

873
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,200
Star Wars doesn't change that.

874
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,200
Lindsay K. Tye's here too.

875
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,200
What do you think?

876
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,200
Three feelings.

877
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,200
What do you want to do?

878
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,200
What are you excited about?

879
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:31,200
I'm excited about whatever you have told me is in this place.

880
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,200
There's.

881
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,200
The Millennium Falcon ride.

882
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Millennium Falcon ride.

883
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,200
And milk.

884
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,200
It's blue milk too.

885
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,200
It's not regular milk.

886
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,200
And green milk.

887
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,200
Yes.

888
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,200
From the teat of that monster in Last Jedi.

889
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,200
Yes.

890
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,200
Yes.

891
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,200
Also I've managed to cut myself.

892
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,200
I don't know how that happened.

893
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Oh I missed that.

894
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
Oh no.

895
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,200
When did I winter where you were?

896
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,200
In the bathroom.

897
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,200
Oh.

898
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,200
Who knows you guys.

899
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,200
Yikes.

900
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,200
You stubbed your toe before we left.

901
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,200
I stubbed my toe.

902
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,200
And you've constantly been stubbing it for a day.

903
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,200
This is like when you go to a new place you injure yourself.

904
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,200
Yeah.

905
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
This is.

906
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,200
These edges new and so I have injured myself.

907
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,200
Obviously.

908
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,200
Wow.

909
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,200
A whole new world of injuries for you.

910
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,200
Yeah.

911
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
So I'm really looking forward to it.

912
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
I think these are good omens.

913
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,200
The beleaguered accommodating attitude of many significant others coming here today.

914
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Do you think UGA or Hondo will have a first aid kit for you?

915
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,200
Yes.

916
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,200
Only you know the answer to that.

917
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,200
You've read all the previews.

918
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,200
Yes they do.

919
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,200
They have it by the counter and it will be fine.

920
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
It's a space first aid kit.

921
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,200
Like the Cokes.

922
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,200
It's customized.

923
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,200
It's like Disneyland has made new again.

924
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,200
Yes it is.

925
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,200
Well I mean what else do we have any final thoughts before we hopefully start moving

926
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,200
in a couple minutes?

927
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,200
Only that this was surprisingly easy.

928
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Like very smooth.

929
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,200
I'm really impressed with the crowd control.

930
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,200
They're tiring us out by making us crisscross the park.

931
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:09,200
We've gone Main Street to Launch Bay holding in Tomorrowland heading for the Critter Country entrance.

932
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,200
And we're slightly on the move so maybe this is a good time to.

933
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,200
Slightly on the move.

934
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,200
Oh Jenny we should mention is carrying a camera.

935
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,200
Explain the camera.

936
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,200
It's a vintage novelty camera that superimposes Phantom Menace characters into the side of

937
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,200
your photo.

938
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
Wow.

939
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,200
Yeah right now it's set to Qui-Gon Jinn.

940
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
What are the different choices?

941
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:35,200
It has like Darth Maul, Qui-Gon Jinn, Queen Amidala, Jar Jar, Jake Lloyd and that's probably

942
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,200
it.

943
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,200
Yeah Jake Lloyd.

944
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,200
From Jingle All the Way.

945
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
Did I say Darth Maul?

946
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,200
Darth Maul's in there.

947
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,200
But no Watto.

948
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,200
Geez.

949
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:48,200
It's good it's so archaic that it just tells you like A B C D E F and it gives you a legend

950
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,200
in the instruction booklet you're supposed to memorize.

951
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,200
Sure.

952
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
So you know that's going to be an interesting thing.

953
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,200
So you'll show these pictures on Twitter eventually.

954
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,200
Oh sure I just have to send them away in the mail to have them developed.

955
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,200
Like a caveman.

956
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,200
Somebody's got to blow dust off of an old machine.

957
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,200
Oh here we'll take a picture.

958
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
Can we request Jake Lloyd?

959
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
Can we request Jake Lloyd?

960
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
Okay yeah yeah.

961
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Check the legend.

962
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,200
No I don't remember.

963
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
I'd be fine with General Tarples.

964
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,200
The Gungan.

965
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,200
So check Twitter for a picture of us and see.

966
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
Alright.

967
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,200
And everybody see.

968
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
See.

969
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,200
Alright.

970
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
Great.

971
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,200
Thank you.

972
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,200
We got photos and we're on the way in.

973
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:40,200
Jenny, Erin, Lindsay thanks for joining us and we'll see you in Batuu.

974
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,200
Jason I have a quick question for you while we're waiting out here

975
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,200
and recording live audio in line.

976
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,200
Are you comfortable as we're doing this?

977
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,200
Yes.

978
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,200
Yes I am comfortable.

979
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,200
I am comfortable.

980
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,200
But am now annoyed.

981
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,200
No counter points to present?

982
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,200
No.

983
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,200
Not at this time.

984
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,200
Counter point though maybe counter point Mike was right?

985
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,200
Is that maybe something you'd like to say now on the record?

986
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,200
We go that far.

987
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,200
No never.

988
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,200
I got your mobile order.

989
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,200
I picked up your mobile order.

990
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Jason now believes that because he picked up an iced tea for me

991
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,200
he does not owe me a counter point I am right.

992
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,200
That's fine I think by the end of exploring Batuu and Black Spire Outpost

993
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,200
you will say counter point Mike you are right.

994
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,200
We'll all be hugging each other and weeping and saying counter point you are right.

995
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,200
You're all right.

996
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,200
I love you guys.

997
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,200
Just waiting with bated breath for the restaurants are in the mobile ordering system

998
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,200
but are not available yet.

999
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:47,200
So I want that breakfast hot dog and breakfast milk.

1000
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,200
I saw you praying a couple minutes ago to make sure that everything would go smoothly.

1001
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,200
Yes praying to the sacred Jedi texts.

1002
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,200
To the decks of course.

1003
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,200
All right well next time you'll hear us we'll be in Batuu.

1004
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,200
Now we'll be in Batuu.

1005
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,200
Okay.

1006
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,200
Hi everyone just Jason now.

1007
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,200
Fair warning there is no bathroom in the Cantina.

1008
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:20,200
So it is not advisable to pound a blue milk outside the Cantina.

1009
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:25,200
Go in drink a different blue milk and then hope to use the restroom.

1010
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,200
No ins no outs.

1011
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:33,200
All right we have jumped in time it is 920 and we are wasted.

1012
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:43,200
We amazingly thanks to the wonderful summer were able to get into the Cantina in the first half hour.

1013
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,200
We were bad boys and joined someone who had already waited a longer time in line.

1014
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,200
But once in a while you get excited and you have to be a little bad.

1015
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:58,200
There was no choice in this scenario do we not get in today or do we just jump in and do it.

1016
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,200
And I think I speak for all of us when I say maybe I don't.

1017
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,200
I will speak for myself and say I'm very happy but I'm not the one who's had two milks already.

1018
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:13,200
Well Black Spire Outpost is full of rogues and scoundrels so I think we're all just you know playing by the rules.

1019
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,200
Why are you talking like you're in a Melville novel or something?

1020
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,200
We are aren't we?

1021
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,200
I guess we are in a way.

1022
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,200
Talking Star Wars isn't it as far as I know.

1023
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,200
It's either that or this.

1024
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,200
Here at the Spire everyone talks like this.

1025
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,200
Like Quint from Jaws.

1026
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,200
Yes like Quint yeah.

1027
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,200
I have had two drinks.

1028
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:37,200
I have had very little to eat or water so I'm doing very good right now.

1029
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,200
It's still very early. What were your drinks Michael?

1030
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:45,200
I had the Bespin Fizz and I had the what was it the Bloody Rancor is what I had.

1031
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:52,200
Now the Bespin Fizz was a fajitas scenario where you attracted the attention of everyone else in the vicinity.

1032
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,200
Yes I got a lot of attention from strangers which I like.

1033
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,200
Right now things are happening.

1034
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,200
Oh there's some droid.

1035
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,200
There's a droid cleaning station by the way.

1036
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,200
Yeah there's a droid cleaning station right now which is great.

1037
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,200
Somebody's taking a jacuzzi and oil I don't know exactly what's going on.

1038
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:12,200
If I could actually take a washcloth and scrub one of these droids down I think it would make my experience very nice.

1039
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,200
You would do your part to clean some oil off of some metal.

1040
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,200
If this is too irritatingly loud to listen to my apologies.

1041
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,200
But the Bespin Fizz people were asking questions and taking photos and you were the star of the table.

1042
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:32,200
Yeah I was finally the star. It was something I've wanted for my whole life and it happened in Uga's Cantina.

1043
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:42,200
Okay a couple things. I ordered my long dreamed of white wine but when it showed up it was blue.

1044
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:50,200
A fun surprise. I wasn't sure at first and I see color and I think it's going to taste weird and sugary and fakie.

1045
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,200
I really liked it though. I'm feeling fantastic.

1046
00:44:53,200 --> 00:45:02,200
And of course if you're listening to this you may have already seen on Twitter my arrival into DJ Rex's zone.

1047
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:07,200
I truly don't think I've felt that kind of joy since childhood.

1048
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,200
I feel incredible and I've sustained it via white wine. The greatest joy of my post childhood.

1049
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,200
Feelings are good at 921.

1050
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:20,200
Hey great. Jason what do you think before we head over maybe to become pilots?

1051
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,200
What are you feeling right now?

1052
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,200
Jason did it.

1053
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,200
Oh that's a good point.

1054
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:28,200
So Jason's tomb melts in and Jason had to use the bathroom as soon as he sat down at Uga's.

1055
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:38,200
Waited it out until he could finish his drink and then quickly ran out to find the refreshers.

1056
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:43,200
Found it and then proceeded to solo ride or walk on to the Millennium Falcon.

1057
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,200
So you've done it.

1058
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,200
Alright so don't tell us anything. We're doing it now.

1059
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:51,200
Scoundrel Anaka is not pleased that you scoundrels for getting hammered.

1060
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,200
You know Hondo can eat shit. I don't give a shit what Hondo wants.

1061
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:59,200
Let's go give him a piece of our mind right now. We're going to go see Hondo right now.

1062
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,200
Oh my god.

1063
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,200
Out of the way.

1064
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,200
I'm keeping an eye on the pilots.

1065
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,200
You go left and I go right.

1066
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,200
I see. I see. I see. I see.

1067
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,200
Now let's go get that kuaqiao.

1068
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,200
Where is it?

1069
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,200
Leave the jump to the sea.

1070
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,200
Where is it?

1071
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,200
Go. Go.

1072
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,200
Watch out.

1073
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,200
This is the pilot action.

1074
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,200
This is the trick we have been using.

1075
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:58,200
You have heard the first order and made Chewie proud.

1076
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:07,200
Now after my modest profit, your cut, minus what you owe me for damaging the Falcon, is full.

1077
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,200
That was rough.

1078
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,200
Yeah, so okay. That was us on the Millennium Falcon.

1079
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,200
It's already two days ago that that happened.

1080
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,200
Yes. Now it's Monday. More time jumps.

1081
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:22,200
But now we have experienced it. We're back on earth and we can reflect on our experience.

1082
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,200
Which was pretty wild.

1083
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:28,200
You could hear, hey, that audio speaks for itself.

1084
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,200
We're all really vocalizing the fun that we're having.

1085
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,200
We're giddy. We're a few drinks in as well.

1086
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,200
Jason had no alcohol I believe at this point.

1087
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,200
I was on a sugar high. Yeah, that's one of my things when I go back.

1088
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,200
I have not had the first drink on Disneyland soil yet.

1089
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,200
I was just drinking candy milk all morning.

1090
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,200
Right. You had a candy milk. I think you referenced it a little bit.

1091
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:58,200
You had a candy milk outside of the Cantina and then inside the Cantina.

1092
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,200
There was no alcohol in what you had, wasn't there?

1093
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,200
No, that was a non-alcoholic drink.

1094
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,200
Wow. Wow.

1095
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,200
You had two drinks. I only fit the one in.

1096
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,200
I had the Bloody Rancor and the Bespin Fizz.

1097
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,200
If you follow us on social media, the Bespin Fizz was the one I was very excited about.

1098
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,200
It was moving in my hand because of the dry ice.

1099
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,200
Somebody really insulted me because I think in the video I said,

1100
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:26,200
this feels like it's dangerous to drink because it was so much cold steam coming out of it.

1101
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:31,200
Someone's like, dry ice. Don't eat the dry ice, but it's fine or something.

1102
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,200
There was a little protective thing like the Flaming Moe.

1103
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:40,200
The dry ice is not going to go into my mouth because it's protected under there.

1104
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,200
I see.

1105
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,200
I felt a little stupid, but that was very exciting because I like a colorful nonsense drink.

1106
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:52,200
Here's the main thing that the morning drinking did for me.

1107
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:58,200
I just had my one blue wine, but it was enough that I made it through the Falcon Line,

1108
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,200
which is a fantastic line, instantly one of the great lines.

1109
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,200
The smells are fantastic. This burning rubber smell.

1110
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:11,200
There's a lot of chaos. Problems being reported in the hangar, whatever it is.

1111
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,200
Then I don't think I knew we were at the door.

1112
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,200
It all happened so fast and that line's really efficient.

1113
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,200
When the doors slid open, revealing Hondo.

1114
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,200
Oh, right.

1115
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:29,200
Then he does his spiel. You're watching one of the greatest animatronics ever created.

1116
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:36,200
The Falcon lands behind him and then Chewie calls in. I cried. I cried actual tears.

1117
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:42,200
I think it's become clear I do not have quite the affection for Star Wars that you guys have.

1118
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,200
I wasn't really raised on it. I don't have so much emotion about it,

1119
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,200
but something I think maybe was the Parks emotion.

1120
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,200
You've been tracking the progress of this for so long,

1121
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,200
and now we're about to get on the Falcon and Chewie calls in.

1122
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:02,200
The reveal of that room was a holy shit moment. Amazing.

1123
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,200
The genuine greatness of the room was revealed,

1124
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,200
because I think I had a pretty decent idea of what the ride itself was.

1125
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:14,200
I've seen pictures of the cockpit. Obviously, it's from the movie, so you know what it is already.

1126
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,200
Even I saw pictures of the animatronic,

1127
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,200
and I didn't get a sense of what the room looked like, what the scope of it was.

1128
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,200
I swear I saw somebody say that it was only half a robot or something.

1129
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,200
You didn't see a full animatronic.

1130
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:34,200
I think that's just in that video that was that little promo video that somebody might have been confused.

1131
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:41,200
But he's walking, and he moves, and it opens up to a very fantastic room.

1132
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,200
It's like you're like, ooh.

1133
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:50,200
All the doors in the whole land, they have the Star Wars door sliding open effect down.

1134
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:55,200
Even just going to the bathroom or walking into the bar, it works.

1135
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,200
We've got to make sure to talk about the bathroom.

1136
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:02,200
I was pretty shocked. I remember looking at everyone's faces a couple times,

1137
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,200
and everyone had sort of the same glee.

1138
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,200
Open mouth awe. Incredible.

1139
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:12,200
The Hondo robot, I think I didn't know the placement of him.

1140
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:16,200
I was even jumbled up. I forgot he was on this ride and not the other ride.

1141
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,200
It's all a little mixed up in my head.

1142
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,200
But the reveal of him and seeing where he is, he's up on this elevated platform,

1143
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:33,200
and it makes him, it feels like a cross between Rocket Raccoon and Ben Franklin climbing the stairs

1144
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,200
in the American Adventure long ago.

1145
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:45,200
It's the realistic moving around, like human movement.

1146
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,200
I guess he's not a human, but he's human.

1147
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,200
He's humanoid.

1148
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,200
Yes, yeah, yeah.

1149
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:55,200
Seeing a human-sized animatronic moving around with such dexterity.

1150
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,200
And also I'd seen video of that robot just in a warehouse, and I thought, well, it's cool.

1151
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,200
I don't know that I'm having any real feelings about it.

1152
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:06,200
I was wondering with lighting and with the full art direction, is it going to freak me out?

1153
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,200
It totally did. It's such a jaw dropper. Incredible.

1154
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,200
Yeah, yeah. That part was the biggest surprise.

1155
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,200
The emotion, I think, is just something great.

1156
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,200
Like when you see something great.

1157
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:21,200
Yeah, when you're a little drunk and you see something great is sort of the feeling.

1158
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:27,200
And you have barely slept and you're drinking at a time that you've never drank, I think ever.

1159
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:32,200
Yeah, I don't think. What did we, we got in there, we got in the Cantina at eight?

1160
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,200
We were in by, I was looking at timestamps.

1161
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,200
So we were in there. Oh yeah, that early. Yeah. So we had our drinks probably by.

1162
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:43,200
I think maybe one time in Las Vegas, I had a 9 a.m. beer.

1163
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:50,200
Maybe what you think like you're maybe having a Bloody Mary if you're having an early brat or like a mimosa.

1164
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,200
I don't like Bloody Mary's. I don't either.

1165
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,200
I ordered a Bloody Rancor and didn't even think about what I was ordering.

1166
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,200
Yeah.

1167
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,200
And then they put it in front of me and I went, oh yeah. I hate this.

1168
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,200
Did you like that? It's fine.

1169
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,200
Sure. It's just not your genre.

1170
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,200
That's not my thing. I'm not against like tomato juice.

1171
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:12,200
There wasn't really a presentation for like the coffee one. The coffee.

1172
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,200
Yeah.

1173
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:20,200
So I had to be. I forget if I don't know what we recorded prior, but I had to order off menu.

1174
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:24,200
We got a we got a two sided sheet of like morning drinks.

1175
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,200
And I was like, fuck this. Give me that wine. Yeah.

1176
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:32,200
Like the guys taking the orders. I think he's probably like whoever's ordering before me isn't even done.

1177
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,200
And I'm like, can I still get that wine? Wine still level?

1178
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,200
Which one? The Tang Ray or what's it called?

1179
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,200
Tana Ray.

1180
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,200
What is it?

1181
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,200
Tana Ray.

1182
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,200
Tana Ray.

1183
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,200
Tana Ray.

1184
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,200
T-O-N-I-R-A-Y.

1185
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,200
Okay. Okay. He's like, which one are you thinking? The Tana Ray? Yeah. Yeah. I'd be the Tana Ray.

1186
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,200
Yes. Two of those please. Yes. Yes.

1187
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,200
The other is an Imperial Red. I believe it's a cab.

1188
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,200
Maybe that's my next drop. Maybe when I return.

1189
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,200
If I get into the Cantina, that's something to talk about.

1190
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,200
We said it prior on the day.

1191
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:07,200
We only got in because we were kind of bad boys.

1192
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,200
Oh yeah. We have to admit this.

1193
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,200
We jumped in line a little bit because our friend Andrew was with him. His friend Summer.

1194
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:18,200
And thank God for Summer. Were it not for Summer getting there so early.

1195
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,200
We owe Summer big time.

1196
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,200
Yeah, we do. We really struggled with it.

1197
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:28,200
We tried. He jumped in line and they were like, come on in. It's no problem.

1198
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,200
We were waved over.

1199
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,200
We were waved over and then we were like, ah, you know, with so many people.

1200
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,200
And we tried to get in the Falcon line and we were in a panic at this point.

1201
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,200
I think we were all frantic. Yeah, we had gotten to the back of the Falcon line.

1202
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,200
I am consuming candy milk. I'm consuming frozen candy milk.

1203
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,200
Oh yeah, Jason Reddy has his candy milk at 8-10.

1204
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,200
I ordered as the gates opened, the mole ordering activated.

1205
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:55,200
And my window, I got to the stand at like 8-02, 8-03 and it was for like eight,

1206
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,200
the pick up at between 8-10 and 8-20.

1207
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:03,200
Yeah. And I had to go like, hi, Jason. I don't know if mine went, it went through.

1208
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,200
And they're like, oh yeah, there you are. And they, they got it for, they handed it to me.

1209
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:14,200
Damn. Yeah. And then I had lost you guys at that point because it was kind of a scramble.

1210
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,200
And then we all split up. We never saw Jenny again.

1211
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,200
We never saw Jenny.

1212
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,200
That's true. They were friends.

1213
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,200
So if you were hoping for her to come back on this episode, sorry.

1214
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,200
Nope, not going to happen.

1215
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,200
Nope.

1216
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:29,200
Yeah. It was, it was sort of chaos. And we really felt like we had to pick exactly what we were going to do.

1217
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,200
And there's, we didn't know how everything was going to go down.

1218
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:39,200
Because I think also like later on in the land, five minutes for Millennium Falcon ride.

1219
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,200
Yeah.

1220
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,200
Like, so we didn't know that was the case.

1221
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,200
We're like, we got to pick our thing right now or we're not going to get anything done.

1222
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,200
There was a lot of like scared straight stuff online.

1223
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:52,200
And a friend of mine was like, oh, I read that you're not going to be able to do the Cantina and the Falcon.

1224
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,200
And I was like, okay. And I was like, are you sure?

1225
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,200
And he goes, yeah, I've read a lot of people say that.

1226
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,200
And I was like, shit. Okay.

1227
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,200
So there's a lot of fear.

1228
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,200
But, and I said, we still didn't do everything.

1229
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:06,200
We, I didn't even go in Doc Ondar's den of iniquities.

1230
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,200
What is it called?

1231
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,200
Doc Ondar's den of antiquities.

1232
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,200
Antiquities, not iniquities.

1233
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,200
Okay. Got it.

1234
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,200
Not inequalities.

1235
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,200
Not inequalities.

1236
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,200
A lightsaber show we can't speak to.

1237
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,200
You haven't done that yet either.

1238
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,200
That had the most line.

1239
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:28,200
I mean, Cantina obviously had a line, but in terms of lines that were definitely not moving, at least the Cantina people left once they had their drinks.

1240
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:33,200
There was a crazy queue for that build a lightsaber experience.

1241
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,200
Yeah.

1242
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:38,200
It's unclear if we can do it without buying or we can just say no afterward.

1243
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,200
Like we can not get it.

1244
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:46,200
We can shed some light on our experiences, but that we, we are not a hundred percent on, but I'll say this.

1245
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,200
I did that.

1246
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,200
I have done all the positions in the Falcon.

1247
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,200
I did the Falcon three times.

1248
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,200
I know you're bragging about it.

1249
00:56:52,200 --> 00:57:03,200
But the first time I did single rider after I fled the Cantina looking to find a bathroom, because I had to use the bathroom pretty much from when I stepped foot in the land.

1250
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:08,200
And then the scramble happened and I downed two beverages.

1251
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:12,200
And then really had to use the bathroom.

1252
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,200
And I'm like trying to sweet talk all the cast members in the Cantina.

1253
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,200
It's like, hey, is there a bathroom in here?

1254
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:21,200
In my head, knowing there's no way they built a fucking bathroom in here, which they of course have not.

1255
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,200
And I'm like, can I go back out and come back in?

1256
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,200
They're like, you cannot.

1257
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,200
So I'm all jumbled up at this point.

1258
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,200
We I'm worried we've told this story like seven times in the episode.

1259
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,200
I don't remember.

1260
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,200
It's possible.

1261
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,200
I remember when we did what?

1262
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,200
I think I give Lin a little.

1263
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:45,200
But single basically once I had used the bathrooms, then I did single rider on the Falcon and got right on.

1264
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,200
But you skip all of the pre show.

1265
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,200
OK, you skip the Hondo sequence.

1266
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,200
You do hang out in the Falcon like quarters.

1267
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,200
I think we thought I think you talked about this in the live.

1268
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,200
We're previewing everything.

1269
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:01,200
I think you also said this over and repeated the thing you talked about outside.

1270
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,200
Sorry, you guys have to deal with it twice.

1271
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,200
I'm not cutting this out.

1272
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,200
You got to hear anecdotes twice.

1273
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,200
I'm so I don't know what the hell.

1274
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,200
Did I mention that I hung out with Rex and I drank blue wine?

1275
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,200
Did I ever say that?

1276
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,200
Yeah, I didn't.

1277
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,200
I think I'm going to.

1278
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,200
Yeah, perhaps.

1279
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,200
What have we not talked about, though?

1280
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,200
Well, we didn't talk about we came in just going into the land.

1281
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,200
It was a very fun.

1282
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,200
Maybe maybe.

1283
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,200
Oh, we did not.

1284
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:31,200
Yeah, like like we walked in and we've said a little bit and we've said it a couple of times.

1285
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,200
This thing was so efficient and we got right to the land date.

1286
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,200
And I'm sure we say that in the upcoming land test interview.

1287
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:49,200
But we got to go through and this big fun ceremony basically felt like an unofficial ceremony of like Imagineers and Disney parks people all like kind of like lined along Star Wars, Galaxy's Edge.

1288
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,200
Business casual, minute management, middle management clapping.

1289
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,200
Yeah, like thank God we got this open and you'll give us more money.

1290
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,200
They were so happy about that.

1291
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,200
It felt like really it was oddly emotional to be there.

1292
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,200
Really glad.

1293
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,200
I feel like we'll always have that.

1294
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:08,200
We did that day one and we got that line of applause and they're applauding us for coming in.

1295
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,200
But I think thank you.

1296
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,200
You did it.

1297
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,200
Holy shit.

1298
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,200
Scott Trowbridge, who was there somewhere because I saw on his Twitter, he was there in that line, but I didn't see him.

1299
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,200
I was looking for him, but I didn't notice him.

1300
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:26,200
I was really trying to find him so I could yell his name because I was getting really used to yelling things in the morning because I yelled.

1301
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,200
I saw Fresh Baked Disney, the YouTuber.

1302
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,200
I don't know if they call him that, but I yell Fresh Baked Adam.

1303
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,200
So I was like really enjoying yelling things.

1304
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,200
So I was like going to yell Scott.

1305
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,200
Thank you, Scott.

1306
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,200
But I didn't see him.

1307
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,200
So now we did a lot of yelling of Bright Suns.

1308
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,200
Yes, Bright Suns.

1309
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,200
That is how you say hello or good morning.

1310
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,200
I didn't.

1311
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,200
OK.

1312
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,200
You guys knew all this.

1313
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,200
I didn't know about no Bright Suns.

1314
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:55,200
They released a key of the Batu customs and stuff.

1315
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,200
I see.

1316
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,200
I didn't know about Bright Suns.

1317
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,200
OK.

1318
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,200
So yes, you.

1319
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,200
Here's a tip.

1320
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,200
When you get there, hello is Bright Suns, although it's different at night.

1321
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,200
I forget what it is at night.

1322
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,200
Oh, it's a shit.

1323
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,200
I just saw that.

1324
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,200
Yeah.

1325
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,200
Oh, whatever.

1326
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,200
It's something about stars.

1327
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,200
Right.

1328
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:16,200
To the spires is kind of like a goodbye or or is it till the spires till the spires.

1329
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,200
I've seen it written as both.

1330
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,200
I'm not sure.

1331
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,200
And then like made the spires keep you is a good bias.

1332
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,200
Yes.

1333
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,700
Now, this seems like the kind of if you would describe this to me before, I probably would

1334
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:29,200
have verbally rolled my eyes.

1335
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:35,880
However, having been there, it felt so much like a foreign travel experience, like I'm

1336
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,280
comparing it to having just been to Japan where you learn your couple phrases and it

1337
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,160
kind of helps you through all your interactions and makes you feel like a local just in the

1338
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,840
tiniest little way.

1339
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:50,520
And it it like it's this real analog of it's this little language thing makes you feel

1340
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,920
so much more like you traveled to a foreign place.

1341
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,920
Yeah.

1342
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,680
Rather than you went to land in a theme park in Anaheim.

1343
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:57,680
Yeah, it's a lot.

1344
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,680
It's details.

1345
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:04,200
All of it is details and the phrases and things also just great details.

1346
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:08,080
I was reading you're supposed to say let the wookie win to the resistance and they may

1347
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,080
like give you something.

1348
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,080
I don't know.

1349
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,080
That's what I saw.

1350
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,080
I'm going to try it.

1351
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,080
We'll see.

1352
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,080
Yeah.

1353
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,040
There's like other little things I think you can say.

1354
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,920
There's a lot of like secrets, which is so much fun.

1355
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:19,960
A lot of secrets.

1356
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:26,320
There's people wandering around, which Len talks about in the interview.

1357
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,320
So I won't go into that.

1358
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,320
What was I going to say?

1359
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,320
Yeah, those characters.

1360
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:33,320
There's a we missed there's this Kylo show evidently.

1361
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,320
Yeah, Jason.

1362
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,880
I saw a little I saw that a little from a distance.

1363
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:43,400
But then there's a show with Maradi, the woman we saw in the but there's an original character

1364
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,240
that there's a book coming out starring this character.

1365
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,960
There's a walk around person playing this character, too.

1366
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,920
And there's like a little mini stunt pop up thing.

1367
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:57,040
Well, above that one entrance, there was like a catwalk and that and she's like pursued

1368
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,040
by storm troopers.

1369
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,680
And I think she shows up.

1370
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:04,080
So really, there's almost little pop up happenings going on.

1371
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,560
This storm troopers.

1372
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:09,600
When you realize that there's storm troopers up on that second level, we're doing things.

1373
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,600
Incredible.

1374
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:15,560
have to give so much credit to the Harry Potter team.

1375
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:20,400
Yeah, pioneering like there's very specific that you can't say ripped off.

1376
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,280
It's not ripped up because I think if you think of something in theme park world, it

1377
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,560
becomes part of theme park vernacular.

1378
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,800
It's part of language now anybody can do it.

1379
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:33,840
But the idea there's very specific things, little weird pop up shows that involve puppets

1380
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:39,640
and such sometimes and like cages with weirdo animals that are rustling around and waking

1381
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:45,920
up. The idea that the I mean, obviously the beverages, the idea that your your merch getting

1382
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,960
experience is also a show.

1383
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:53,040
Yes, I picked open all of this and Disney took the ball and ran with it.

1384
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,040
Yes.

1385
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,840
I mean, it's up to the listener, really.

1386
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,840
Is it better?

1387
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,840
I think it could be better.

1388
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,800
A rising tide lifts all ships, I think.

1389
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:02,800
Yeah.

1390
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:03,800
Yeah.

1391
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:09,240
One one innovates and the other responds and then it just keeps going back and forth.

1392
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,360
Yeah.

1393
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:11,360
Yeah.

1394
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:14,320
So what will the Nintendo experience of making your own merch be?

1395
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:18,000
What will that what will what will surpass even these two?

1396
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,080
They have to, you know, suspenders design your own.

1397
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,320
Design your own plumber suspenders.

1398
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,600
Your dream finally realized.

1399
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,120
Are you saying I can put my own initial on a hat?

1400
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,120
Yeah.

1401
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,120
Instead of M or L.

1402
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,120
It's a you.

1403
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,120
Pick your own color.

1404
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,120
Scott, pick your color.

1405
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,120
It's a me.

1406
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,120
Scotty-o.

1407
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:39,760
Well, everyone has to have an O at the end of their name.

1408
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:40,760
That's the only thing.

1409
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:41,760
You can't justify that.

1410
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:42,760
Yes.

1411
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,760
Men and women both.

1412
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,040
By the way, that actually is a really good idea.

1413
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:47,040
Yeah.

1414
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,040
With your initial one.

1415
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,040
It's a different color.

1416
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:54,200
And if we see it in the land, we'll know that they they stole it.

1417
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,800
Here's a here's a little detail.

1418
01:03:55,800 --> 01:04:02,120
Do you remember or were you guys around when a ship whizzed by and then maybe this was

1419
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,120
only me.

1420
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:06,360
A ship whizzed by and I turned my head.

1421
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,360
What was that?

1422
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:08,360
Where did that go?

1423
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,920
Realized that was pure audio.

1424
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:10,920
Oh, yeah.

1425
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:16,760
May have been a light as part of it to some subtle light, but it was just like ultra stereo

1426
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:17,760
effects.

1427
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,080
A ship whizzing by.

1428
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,280
Audio landscape soundscapes are incredible.

1429
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,280
Yeah.

1430
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,280
There's stuff everywhere.

1431
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:31,280
There's even more down by the resistance camp, which I got to a few minutes before you guys

1432
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,520
and then you guys came and we pretty much had to leave at that point.

1433
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:39,240
I will say a couple of things if you haven't been following one.

1434
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:45,000
They didn't really they didn't pistol whip us to get out of the land.

1435
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,320
They was pretty no stormtrooper clearance.

1436
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,320
No.

1437
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:52,600
And I don't know if we maybe we alluded to it a little in the clip so far.

1438
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,080
Everything was so smooth.

1439
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,000
Everything was so smooth.

1440
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,200
We talk about it in the next clip, though, for sure.

1441
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,200
Yeah.

1442
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:05,680
But it is like it's so crazy that everybody thought this was going to be hell on earth

1443
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,760
and my myself potentially included.

1444
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:13,560
Although I did say before we went that I have a good feeling about this as opposed to Tilted

1445
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:14,800
Brak Sunstar Tourist.

1446
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:18,160
Like Alden said, you have a very good feeling about this.

1447
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,160
Does that said in really?

1448
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,160
Yeah, he says that in solo.

1449
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,160
I'm missing out.

1450
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,200
Boy, everything gets flipped on its head.

1451
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,200
Yeah.

1452
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:32,040
So, yeah, I it just felt like all the like they knew they had the stakes were so high,

1453
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:35,960
which is why I had I also had a very good feeling about this.

1454
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:39,360
And yeah, everything there was an article that just I don't forget where it was from.

1455
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:43,920
I just read it was like this could like change the game for new lands essentially in any

1456
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,160
theme park because Harry Potter, they had to limit the amount of people in the land.

1457
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:51,200
But you would have to wait eight hours when Orlando opened.

1458
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,200
Yeah.

1459
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:56,080
Whatever, depending on the day to get in the land.

1460
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:59,760
But this combined with the fact that they're going to do virtual queuing next month, which

1461
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,000
I think that'll actually start to be worse in the park again.

1462
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:09,240
But the land still will be at like a good capacity where you won't be crushed by people,

1463
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,400
which is what was people leader.

1464
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,400
It's huge.

1465
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,400
It's huge.

1466
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,240
And it feels like they could triple the amount of people that were in there and still be

1467
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:18,640
comfortable and still be reasonably comfortable.

1468
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:25,760
The last 45 minutes of our time there, that was started to feel the crunch because there

1469
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,000
was an hour overlap with the next group.

1470
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,960
And that's when things started to go like, yeah, it was a little more.

1471
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:37,000
But it's still like it wasn't like walking by New Orleans Square during Fantasmic, which

1472
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,600
is the craziest amount of people you can possibly cram in one space.

1473
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,600
Yeah.

1474
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,800
But like it was never like that.

1475
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:47,680
So it wasn't like the part of my Tokyo trip where like the small world.

1476
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:53,880
It was a Saturday and the small world fast pass like corridor was so much worse than

1477
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:58,480
anything we experienced in the new galaxy's edge on opening day.

1478
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,480
Right.

1479
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:00,480
It's really insane.

1480
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:01,480
And I was comparing it all.

1481
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:06,680
I think like a lot of my fear came from remembering what it was like the entire first summer of

1482
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,040
the Indiana Jones adventure.

1483
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,560
And there wasn't any of this technology yet.

1484
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,080
It was like, all right, there's a big line.

1485
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,080
So get in it.

1486
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,080
Yeah.

1487
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:20,280
It took over all of that little like sort of the Fiesta area of Frontierland, just wrap

1488
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,040
around, wrap around, wrap around.

1489
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,280
And the entire indoor queue was used.

1490
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,080
It took so fucking long.

1491
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:29,320
And like, but you've got to remember, it's not 1995 anymore.

1492
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:33,480
There's technologies beyond to here stand in a big line.

1493
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:39,140
It's like when you're it's like when you have a big two liter of soda and it's shaken up

1494
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:40,140
and you can do two things.

1495
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,300
You can just open it up and it sprays everywhere.

1496
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,220
You let a little gas out every like second.

1497
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:46,220
You know what I mean?

1498
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:49,260
It's like you're kind of like this is the way they're now doing it where it's like we

1499
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:51,780
make sure we limit it and we get take a little.

1500
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:52,780
Okay.

1501
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:53,780
Some of the people now are good.

1502
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:54,940
They've they're satiated.

1503
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:55,940
They've seen it.

1504
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:59,500
And hopefully you do that over the course of a few months as opposed to like everybody

1505
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:02,340
get down here, line up along Harbor.

1506
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:03,340
It's hell.

1507
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:08,100
Well, and I think they knew that everyone has a megaphone nowadays, right?

1508
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,520
Everyone has a smartphone.

1509
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:13,680
So if it was a disaster, there would have been hundreds or thousands of people posting

1510
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,480
that like, yeah, this sucks.

1511
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,480
This is bad.

1512
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,480
Yeah.

1513
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:18,800
But I don't think we had a bad experience.

1514
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,800
Like I said, the last little bit, there was a choke.

1515
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:24,000
Like I dock on ours was too full.

1516
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,040
Mobile ordering for a couple.

1517
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,040
I tried like I got a little bit of time left.

1518
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,820
Should I get another food thing or another drink?

1519
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:33,240
And it was only letting me mobile order a couple hours ahead of time so I couldn't have

1520
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,240
come back.

1521
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:38,280
Other than that, pretty that's pretty minor like friction issues.

1522
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:42,360
None of these are things you could put in a headline and go, wait, what happened?

1523
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:48,000
I will say one of honestly, one of my biggest disappointments is that the giant pod racer

1524
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,080
that they're cooking meat on doesn't look like the pod racer in the art in the promo

1525
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,080
art.

1526
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:59,000
But that is such a huge thing for such a little practice.

1527
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
It's such an amazing.

1528
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Oh yeah.

1529
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
It's huge.

1530
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
It's just for placement.

1531
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,960
It's not any practical application and it's still cool.

1532
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:10,080
It's just like a little like kind of rubbery thing over an engine, which is also like one

1533
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,160
of the pod racing engines.

1534
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:15,560
But in the promo art, there's like a really cool, sleek looking pod racer engine.

1535
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:19,440
But that's who cares?

1536
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:22,800
Maybe my biggest disappointment is the pod racing engine.

1537
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:23,840
Well here, let's OK.

1538
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:26,080
So what is going wrong now?

1539
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:31,120
It's a couple of days after we have heard reports that there have been spork issues.

1540
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:35,160
Well, I guess we'll get into this actually with the way that we'd land a little bit in

1541
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,160
the future.

1542
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:40,440
Miraculously, we talk about there is a spork tangent in the.

1543
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:41,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1544
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:42,440
OK.

1545
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:47,320
So what what what Lynn predicted did come true a little bit.

1546
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:50,520
But again, like that's one of the biggest problems they're having.

1547
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:57,920
I guess now you would have to say this Cantina thing is a mess, although apparently already

1548
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,920
there is a text based system in place now.

1549
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:01,920
Yes.

1550
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,760
You give a name and you get a text message when it is your time.

1551
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,480
Which I have wanted for years.

1552
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,000
Like chilies can do that.

1553
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,880
Macaroni Grill can say like go to the Barnes and Noble, come back, we'll text you when

1554
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,440
you come back.

1555
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:18,520
And Disney has all these bars where it's just like just stand in the line and it's like

1556
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,920
just text us to come back.

1557
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,920
When everything else in the park is mobile.

1558
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:23,920
Everything else is text.

1559
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,600
Some of the hotel restaurants have it.

1560
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,680
Some of the hotel restaurants will text you to come back.

1561
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:29,960
But like this is great.

1562
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:34,000
And hopefully it's working well and hopefully they roll it out at like the Pixar Pier at

1563
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,320
Lamplighter and like other places of that type.

1564
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,360
There's something in the restaurant, I thought, where they do text.

1565
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:43,520
Maybe not the actual lounge, but maybe for the actual restaurant itself.

1566
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,320
Yeah, I think we do have to say it is a legitimate problem.

1567
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,000
It does make it more of an exclusive.

1568
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,840
Like how great do we feel?

1569
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:55,080
How much different was our day because we got into the Cantina first thing.

1570
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,880
But if we hadn't, I don't know.

1571
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:01,920
And some of the people who take all this effort to get down there and book hotels and then

1572
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,000
don't get close to the Cantina.

1573
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
It's sort of a mess.

1574
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,200
I don't know why they didn't build like two or three more.

1575
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,320
I don't know why it's not double the size.

1576
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:13,560
I do think you would have to call this a fuck up that they didn't anticipate the insane

1577
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,080
popularity of that place.

1578
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,080
It's weird.

1579
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,360
Yeah, it feels like it's like less capacity or it's at least the same as the Carthay

1580
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:23,000
Lounge, which is just sort of a little afterthought because there's a full restaurant.

1581
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,640
So it's weird.

1582
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:29,400
It is weird that there's not like two or three rooms like make three rooms of this with like

1583
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:36,720
a different fun droid DJ or entertainment or something like it seems odd that they would

1584
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:42,280
not foresee that being the only place you can drink in Disneyland being popular.

1585
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:43,280
Yes.

1586
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:48,400
Plus, yeah, let's not even include that it is Star Wars mythology and that, you know,

1587
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,120
some people have very strong feelings about Rex like myself.

1588
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:56,000
But even if you don't, it is a if you've never heard of Rex before, there's a droid DJ playing

1589
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,960
original music for three hours.

1590
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,720
This is the coolest thing ever.

1591
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:02,320
Of course, there's going to be a line for two and a half hours.

1592
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,440
But yeah, and I will I'll even take it back.

1593
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:09,080
I'll say like this could just be an empty janitor's closet with one man in a bottle

1594
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,320
of fireball whiskey.

1595
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,160
It's the only place to drink in Disneyland.

1596
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:13,160
It's going to be popular.

1597
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:18,440
Yeah, people will go to the closet full closet with the man with the fireball, especially

1598
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,880
if it's a guy from A New Hope who's like he doesn't like you.

1599
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,920
I don't like you either.

1600
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:30,480
I did notice a couple of things of our canteen experience that I thought were well, this

1601
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:35,120
was like we ordered the first round of drinks as he brought the drinks.

1602
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,200
He also brought the check.

1603
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,680
So like they closed it out immediately.

1604
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:41,520
They did let you guys orders.

1605
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,480
Mike ordered the second drink.

1606
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:44,680
Also, coasters.

1607
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:46,160
He put down coasters when he came back.

1608
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,640
He got a through more coaster.

1609
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:51,080
He's like these motherfuckers are going to what coast like and they're pretty cool about

1610
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:55,240
that at the place in Disney Springs.

1611
01:12:55,240 --> 01:13:01,320
The Lindsey Lindsey, you can start Dexter, Dexter, who joined us.

1612
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,240
I'm glad he I'm glad he's sort of Lindsey's.

1613
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,000
Chuck Lindsey's has cool coasters, too.

1614
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,680
And they were very much like, yeah, take a pile.

1615
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:11,200
Is this like what I'm realizing?

1616
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:15,160
I think I think here's what we have to say is that the you're talking about our cool

1617
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:20,280
coasters are we've talked about how cool these future sports are, how the sounds and

1618
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,760
smells.

1619
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:26,760
And if you ask me what's I'm preparing to tell people just like, oh, man, what was that?

1620
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:27,600
Well, how was it?

1621
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,880
What was your favorite thing?

1622
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,520
It was it was all that stuff.

1623
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:32,480
It's details. It's being there.

1624
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:35,760
And like, was the Millennium Falcon ride cool?

1625
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,560
Sure. We have a little bit of complaints which we can get into.

1626
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,160
But we do like.

1627
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:43,960
Yes. Yeah. But the yeah.

1628
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:48,520
And the Cantina, the Cantina might be like the place highlights, although Droid Depot

1629
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:53,240
is up there, too. But truly, what is great about Galaxy's Edge, it's being there.

1630
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:59,080
It's those little. And I don't think we found even like 20 percent of those things.

1631
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:04,560
Like if the coasters are that good, I bet we're like we're we're missing a napkin or a,

1632
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,520
you know, or a sink somewhere that would be one of our favorite things in the land.

1633
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:09,880
They figured out. Yeah.

1634
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:13,680
In the in the bathrooms, which on Batu are called the refreshers.

1635
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,600
There's a radio station playing.

1636
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,080
There's more original music in the restroom.

1637
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,240
Really? Yeah.

1638
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,880
Did you not catch that? I don't think I did.

1639
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,760
There is music playing and every now and then a DJ will chime in to the red chili

1640
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,200
peppers play on the radio station.

1641
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:33,720
Only. Yeah, I think that they've really taken and we get into we get into it with a little

1642
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,120
bit of some of our interactions.

1643
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:38,600
But I think and I've mentioned this a couple of times in the show before, one of the best

1644
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:44,120
star tours line memories I have is when the stormtroopers came for like grabbed my arm

1645
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:46,240
really hard and like scared me.

1646
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,800
I turned around, there were stormtroopers and I went, ah, and then they did like a fun

1647
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:54,280
bit with some kids or one kid and they kind of kicked the kid out of line who was trying

1648
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,040
to like cut in line or whatever.

1649
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,840
And I was we were all delighted by it.

1650
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:03,960
And it does feel like the Imagineers really know that that's the stuff that sticks with

1651
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:09,800
people. So, yeah, it's full of that stuff and it's full of stuff that don't that doesn't

1652
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:13,400
feel I'm sure it's on a schedule of some kind, but stuff that doesn't feel like it's on a

1653
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:18,440
schedule. So it feels very personal to you as you're doing it like, oh, Jason caught

1654
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,000
a little bit of Kylo Ren show.

1655
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:25,400
We didn't catch that. There's nothing on the pamphlet that says, oh, it's 315 Kylo Ren

1656
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:29,320
does a show. So it feels like you're just getting to see something that's happening.

1657
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:31,480
And it's just for you and the people that are around you.

1658
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:36,760
So like they've all that's this that that's the triumph, I feel like of this land is just

1659
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:41,720
populating it with things that make everyone feel like special, make them feel like you're

1660
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:42,920
having a special little thing.

1661
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:48,200
I mean, the day and a half we were down there, I was like enjoying walking around the parks

1662
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:54,280
just in general, just especially the emptiness on Friday, just walking around and being

1663
01:15:54,280 --> 01:16:00,120
there. And Galaxy's Edge just took that feeling just like multiplied by a thousand.

1664
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:02,640
How great did you all feel right after?

1665
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:05,400
We probably should have recorded right at noon on the way out the door.

1666
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:09,520
We were like, yeah, we were like a little high and weird.

1667
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:10,720
We were kind of like speechless.

1668
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:14,960
Maybe it wouldn't have been good because we were it really just felt like we'd I don't

1669
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:16,360
know, something washed over us.

1670
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:19,280
It was really insane. And I think you put a great mic.

1671
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,240
You said, I don't feel like I have a sense of it.

1672
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,640
Yeah, it was such a weird flurry.

1673
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:27,600
Also, to compare it to Japan, I bet you guys felt like this all the time in Japan, not

1674
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,400
just Disney, but the city, but Tokyo itself.

1675
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:31,680
Just like, what was that?

1676
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:36,160
I don't think I know. Even I have no like I'm so overwhelmed by it.

1677
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,400
And that's that's how Batu feels.

1678
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:43,360
Yeah. Well, with so many so many of the things we talk about on the show, we've especially

1679
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:47,880
Disneyland and Universal stuff, we've seen it and been on it like a hundred times.

1680
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:54,360
So, yeah, to get to try to cram all of that in even four hours is very overwhelming.

1681
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,840
And especially to be have two drinks at 8 a.m.

1682
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:01,680
Like the feeling was like a little disoriented.

1683
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:06,880
And then we walked out to the coolest new addition to the Hungry Bear restaurant.

1684
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:08,880
The new Hungry Bear sign.

1685
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:11,360
There's a new sign, everybody.

1686
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:15,880
And it's a little like grizzly bear trying to get a little honey or a honey beehive,

1687
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:19,320
excuse me, which I kept insisting he was he was fixing the sign.

1688
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,800
No, there he is. He's fixing the sign.

1689
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:23,760
No, he's clearly searching for it.

1690
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,440
No, he's lending and lending a bar.

1691
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,960
Yeah. Then shortly thereafter, I got on the marked way and I had a whole deck to myself.

1692
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,560
Like I had the whole middle deck.

1693
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,920
It was just me and a cast member.

1694
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:34,560
We all see.

1695
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,840
And he was wonderful.

1696
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,480
Oh, yeah, we all sort of went our different way.

1697
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:41,400
But we'd like, yeah, Aaron and Lindsay hung out in Carthay

1698
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:45,360
and the Carthay lunch for like an hour and 45 minutes while we talk to our guest.

1699
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,400
You'll hear. Yeah.

1700
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,440
And that was pretty.

1701
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,920
There was no lines anywhere.

1702
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:52,360
And that was after Lindsay and I went on Guardians of the Galaxy four times in a row.

1703
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:55,880
She's beating the record that you, Jason, Geo, Anthony Geo

1704
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:58,920
and I had of three times in a row right early in the morning.

1705
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:01,480
And I may be going like very, very soon.

1706
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:02,840
And maybe I'll beat it.

1707
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,880
Maybe I'll beat four.

1708
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,080
See if I can do five.

1709
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,200
We got four different songs, too. Very impressive.

1710
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,480
Wow. Wow.

1711
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:11,000
You got you covered the gamut of the soundtrack.

1712
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,840
Well, there's two more. There's six.

1713
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:14,680
So, yeah, pretty good.

1714
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:19,200
Yeah. So it was a real popcorn into Rockets mouth and no one stopped you.

1715
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,200
Nope, they didn't care.

1716
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,960
So, yeah, the whole day was very fun because

1717
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,880
Disney scared everyone away. Yeah.

1718
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,560
Yeah. And you know what else is weird is like every cast member elsewhere

1719
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,640
was seeing our wristbands and going, oh, my God, how was it?

1720
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:35,040
And how's it going over there?

1721
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,080
Like you felt like this weird.

1722
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:40,200
It felt like everybody who was working was not working.

1723
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,640
Like everybody's brain was elsewhere.

1724
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:48,760
And we just like all of the typical sort of customer interaction was broken.

1725
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,960
Just like, wait, can we stop and talk about this for a second?

1726
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,760
Because they're all so curious themselves.

1727
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:53,880
It's what everyone's talking about.

1728
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:57,440
The DJ in downtown Disney is calling out like,

1729
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:00,120
I see some people here have been to Batu.

1730
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,680
All right. You've seen the Black Spires and, you know,

1731
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:05,440
I hope you had a magical day out there and back here on Earth.

1732
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:06,520
The weather's pretty nice.

1733
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:09,760
And it was just there was odd.

1734
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,520
It's what everyone was thinking about.

1735
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:15,440
I want to go back and I was like, there's like six things I didn't even do.

1736
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,440
I mean, you guys ate in docking day seven.

1737
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,960
I didn't because I just eat and I had the Ronto Roasters.

1738
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,160
I had the space hot dogs.

1739
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:24,240
Well, that's that hot dog content up.

1740
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:27,080
If not already, I didn't.

1741
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,240
Yeah, it was too full to go and dock on to ours.

1742
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:33,400
I didn't even stop at the first wood or shop or the resistance

1743
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,600
shop, which I think is just like, you know, carts because it's meant to look

1744
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,520
temperate like they have to pack up at a moment's notice.

1745
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,240
Oh, interesting. Huh?

1746
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,280
Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, there's a bunch of things I did.

1747
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,560
Green milk. I didn't have I only had the blue milk.

1748
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:49,320
Sorry, I didn't get to the green milk this time, but something exciting

1749
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:52,200
to look forward to when I go back.

1750
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:55,200
Oh, we should. Well, let's talk Droid Depot a little bit.

1751
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:56,520
Oh, yeah, sure.

1752
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:01,280
The I didn't I didn't do enough previewing to know that the way you assemble

1753
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:04,280
your droid is a conveyor belt of loose parts.

1754
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,440
Yeah, yeah, incredible. Really great.

1755
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:09,240
That was and even if you don't do it yourself,

1756
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:13,240
just watching that thing go by is so fun.

1757
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:17,200
Bunch of weird dude ads, you know, how the hell they begin to go together.

1758
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:20,800
And apparently and I watched videos of people doing it where they'll pick up,

1759
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,040
oh, this looks like a good top.

1760
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:25,520
And but they know you're building an R2 that goes with the BB.

1761
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,280
That doesn't work.

1762
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:30,280
So you have to like learn processes while you're doing that.

1763
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,080
That's the funnest toy experience.

1764
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,400
Yeah, it really is.

1765
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:36,560
And like Scott and I both got Rex's. Oh, yeah.

1766
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:41,120
And but the thing is, like, yeah, that droid putting the droid together seems fun,

1767
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,280
but maybe I don't need more toys.

1768
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,400
I already have too many.

1769
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:47,200
And maybe there's a couple on the way still in my mail.

1770
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:50,960
And I don't need another droid, but I want to do it.

1771
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:53,920
I really want to build a droid and I want to make them purple.

1772
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:57,400
Well, that's going to be one of those things that like in how do you keep

1773
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:01,800
Galaxy's Edge interesting for you if you don't do that for three years?

1774
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,480
Yeah. Oh, you know what I never did was was droid.

1775
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:08,960
I also the lightsaber thing to which we didn't do, which seems very cool.

1776
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:10,920
And they have much like Harry Potter.

1777
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:14,680
They have make your own lightsaber and you get your Kyber crystals

1778
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:17,800
and you do the whole thing and your hand and your hilt your hilt.

1779
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:21,000
But they also have legacy lightsabers, much like Harry Potter,

1780
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,120
where you can also just buy like Snape's wand or Harry's wand.

1781
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:27,480
Yeah. You can buy Luke's lightsaber or Mace Windu's lightsaber.

1782
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:31,160
And I'm looking on Twitter and I'm like, oh, these look pretty good.

1783
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:34,680
Yeah. But I don't know. No, no.

1784
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:36,760
Bad Michael.

1785
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:38,160
Oh, it's hard.

1786
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,880
Isn't it funny that the whole thing is an outpost in a marketplace,

1787
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:45,280
a bustling, you know, place where you can buy a ton of shit.

1788
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:50,400
And I did a charming marketplace, but with wide walkways.

1789
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,920
True. And lots of cash registers.

1790
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1791
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,520
I have one complaint.

1792
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:59,600
I did. So I did buy Rex, which I have zero complaints about.

1793
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:00,960
What a toy. It's great.

1794
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,080
But in ringing him up, the cashier said,

1795
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,960
what was the phrase? It was like, do you have credentials?

1796
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:12,000
Something like that. Oh, is that ID?

1797
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,280
I think that was that was the term for annual pass.

1798
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:17,160
There's a term for annual pass.

1799
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:19,120
And I miss I didn't know what she was asking.

1800
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,320
And I said, no. Oh, no, I didn't know this, Scott,

1801
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:25,600
because I haven't told a story that happened to me while we were there.

1802
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,920
Oh, the day before. Uh huh.

1803
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:33,880
When I paid, I went we went to Black Tap Burgers and Shakes.

1804
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,480
And a little while after we were there,

1805
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,440
I realized I did not give the annual pass.

1806
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,200
I did not get the annual pass discount.

1807
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,920
Holy fucking shit.

1808
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:49,040
For. Oh, do you need to like stop recording and just like vent a little bit?

1809
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:52,120
No, because I went back and they're like, oh, this happens all the time.

1810
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:55,200
We'll fix it. And they. You went back. Yeah.

1811
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:00,400
Because it was again, it was empty later.

1812
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,680
So I was like, hey, is this a can you do that?

1813
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:05,120
And they're like, yeah. And they like did it in 30 seconds.

1814
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,960
When I was toward money to your car.

1815
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:11,520
Yeah, they restored like seven dollars to my card. So that much really? Yeah.

1816
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,120
Yeah, I know. I got fucked on because they do.

1817
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:17,120
I love I'll give that tip. Joy Depot. They do.

1818
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,440
I thought I thought they did.

1819
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,000
I thought none of it was going to take any.

1820
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,280
Did you get it? I did. I did. OK, you did.

1821
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,320
But they yeah.

1822
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:27,440
And food, we mobile ordered.

1823
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:28,600
And that was a discount.

1824
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,960
Oh, you got something very rare.

1825
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,560
Do you know about this?

1826
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:35,040
It's already sold out. The gift card.

1827
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,720
Oh, is it sold out already? Yeah.

1828
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:41,840
Yeah. So I believe Dave Meske, who I went to elementary school with,

1829
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:46,120
who is a Patreon subscriber, tweeted at us during like I think we were over

1830
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:48,560
by the Marantos Roasters.

1831
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:53,760
And there was a person who tweeted that you can get these cool little gift cards

1832
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,920
that are like pieces of metal with a cool symbol on it.

1833
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,640
And those are the gift cards in Batu.

1834
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:03,440
And someone was like, you can just get one of these and use it to buy something else.

1835
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:06,480
And it happened like minutes before I went into Joy Depot.

1836
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:08,680
And I saw them sitting there at the counter.

1837
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:09,880
And I said, is it possible?

1838
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:12,840
Can I just buy one of these and then use it to buy racks?

1839
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:14,680
And she's like, oh, sure, I guess.

1840
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,880
So I did that and I have it.

1841
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,360
It's upstairs. It's a cool little coin.

1842
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,840
It looks neat. Yeah.

1843
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:22,640
So I didn't realize those were sold out already.

1844
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:30,160
So get get through this Batuvian language jargon nonsense

1845
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:34,560
and make sure you get your annual pass discount because I ate it a little bit

1846
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:39,520
financially, but no regrets because now Rex is rolling around my house.

1847
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:43,720
If you follow me on Instagram, you may have already seen

1848
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:47,000
I was having my DJ Rex take requests.

1849
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:50,720
And thank you, everyone who did that for sending in your requests.

1850
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:53,480
I've had so much fun with him already.

1851
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:57,840
And follow me at SkizGerdner on Instagram, and maybe I'll do it again

1852
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,080
in the Insta stories that we do.

1853
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,880
Oh, we did. We did a lot of Rex played crack and cocaine.

1854
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:05,160
I hate music. A lot of our favorites.

1855
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,400
It was a videopolis. It was a blast.

1856
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,760
The toy is great. You've been fucking around with it, too.

1857
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:12,720
You sent us a video of him playing Kokomo.

1858
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:13,720
Much appreciated.

1859
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:17,120
But I dog hates him.

1860
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,800
Yeah, cats are cats are a little freaked out.

1861
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:23,040
Oh, and my cats are real freaked out by the Porg.

1862
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,360
Oh, Aaron, Aaron bought a Porg puppet.

1863
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,400
The Porg puppet is great.

1864
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,800
It's got two little levers when you reach up into it.

1865
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,400
One is arm flaps, wings.

1866
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,240
One is sound.

1867
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:35,840
And my cats sound exactly like a Porg.

1868
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:37,320
So they should get along great.

1869
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:39,280
It's that little flutter.

1870
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,360
And so they should be best of friends.

1871
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:46,120
But it truly freaks them out, especially because,

1872
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,360
OK, you operate it for a little bit, right?

1873
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,640
And then you set it down.

1874
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:52,000
That was fun. No more.

1875
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,240
No more more Porg.

1876
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:58,120
About 45 seconds to a minute later, it just makes a sound on its own.

1877
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:01,560
Oh, wow. It just adds to this feeling of it's alive.

1878
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:06,840
And this land that is so interactive, you bring to your home this same feeling.

1879
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,200
I didn't just buy a puppet.

1880
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,720
That's an alive Porg.

1881
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:12,080
It's freaking out my cats, even if I'm not touching it.

1882
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,360
Yeah, that's great.

1883
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:14,800
I didn't realize it even did that.

1884
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,080
Yeah. So cool.

1885
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,240
Does your Jason got a waddle?

1886
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:21,840
I got went to the Toy Darien toy shop and I got the waddle plush.

1887
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,160
And I think the secret plush.

1888
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:27,680
No, because they're meant to look like hand stitched.

1889
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:30,120
Right, right. They're not a real someone.

1890
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:33,360
But it's so funny to think like 20 years ago,

1891
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:37,320
if you had told me as the movie as the Phantom Menace was coming out,

1892
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:41,240
like when you are 33 years old, you're going to be so psyched

1893
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:44,680
to buy a stuffed waddle at Disneyland, not Disney World.

1894
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,360
But you're going to be very happy to see that stuffed waddle.

1895
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:51,920
That that was my that as I've aged, like that's why I like that.

1896
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,520
You can't believe they made a waddle.

1897
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,440
Yes, that's why I live in California now.

1898
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,400
I live in California.

1899
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:58,640
I'm irony.

1900
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:02,360
You are. You do have irony poisoning, but it's fine.

1901
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:05,080
And you can have hot dogs.

1902
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:07,240
Yes, you still like hot dogs and sugar milk.

1903
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,840
Milk hasn't changed a lot.

1904
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:11,160
A lot hasn't changed.

1905
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:14,760
You will be one of the first people to have a very special new milk.

1906
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:18,080
One of the most anticipated milks in theme park history.

1907
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:22,600
And this will be a day after you had a milkshake with a slice

1908
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:25,440
of funfetti cake mounted on top of it.

1909
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:29,120
Hey, you know, while we're talking about Jason's dreams coming true,

1910
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:32,800
I have a little gift from Aaron that I can present to you here in this bag.

1911
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,160
Here we go. Yes, she told me about this.

1912
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:36,000
OK, great.

1913
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,960
Extra toiletries from the Disneyland Hotel.

1914
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:44,080
We all stayed in the hotel together, not in one room, but we we booked two.

1915
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:45,480
Yeah, it's a fun way to play.

1916
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:46,400
It would have been nice.

1917
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:50,560
Mike and Lindsay, Aaron and Scott, and then our adult sons,

1918
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:53,000
our respective adult sons on the couch.

1919
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,800
It was a wonderful affair.

1920
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,200
So so toiletries.

1921
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,840
Wait, I went to the hot tub the night before.

1922
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:02,440
Me too. I went twice. Two hot tubs.

1923
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:06,680
That probably helped, like, you know, the relaxation

1924
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,200
and the ease the next morning.

1925
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,200
Body's resistance is the relaxation body last.

1926
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:15,400
The start, the reopen Starbucks opened at four thirty in the morning

1927
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:20,160
opening day. Thank God we all were able to fuel up.

1928
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:24,800
We all had besides all just what a great weekend and trip it was.

1929
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,000
And you know what?

1930
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,080
Another great thing, and maybe this is the time to throw to it.

1931
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:34,360
We got to talk to somebody who we have been listening to for many,

1932
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:37,040
many years when we first poked around.

1933
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:41,200
Are there any before we even thought we wanted to do a theme park podcast?

1934
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,880
I remember going, well, podcasts are kind of blowing up.

1935
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:46,640
Are there any podcasts about theme parks?

1936
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,400
And there's there's a ton, certainly.

1937
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:51,880
But if you're looking for if you're looking for quality,

1938
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:53,840
if you're looking for scoops, if you're looking for info,

1939
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,360
you can't get anywhere else.

1940
01:28:55,400 --> 01:29:01,440
The major one is the Disney Dish podcast with Jim Hill and Lentesta.

1941
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:06,280
And lo and behold, we were heading to Black Spire Outpost

1942
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:07,800
at the very same time.

1943
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:11,920
Yes. A theme park podcasting luminary Lentesta.

1944
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:16,680
Now we have a very special interview, a very special guest.

1945
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:20,240
We're talking about the co-author of The Unofficial Guide

1946
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:25,240
and the host, co-host, excuse me, of the Disney Dish podcast Lentesta.

1947
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:28,320
Here we are in his hotel room in the Disneyland Hotel.

1948
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:31,240
We are very excited. Lent, welcome to podcast the ride.

1949
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,200
Thank you guys. And thank you. And welcome to my hotel room.

1950
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:34,480
Thank you.

1951
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:38,520
Thank you. You know, the Galaxy's Edge is an exclusive Vanaheim experience,

1952
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:39,240
but this one's even more.

1953
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:41,200
But also, yes, room 267.

1954
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,760
Yeah, apparently also fairly exclusive.

1955
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,280
These days, we'll skip the.

1956
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:46,800
No, yeah, exactly.

1957
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,800
Park podcast game.

1958
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,080
Will you be out by Monday?

1959
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:53,560
So if when this comes out, people won't bomb our room by Monday.

1960
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:54,400
Great.

1961
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:55,480
I think so.

1962
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:57,880
They'll just know that if you guys could leave your wristbands

1963
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:00,120
with the attendant as you leave, that would be sure.

1964
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:01,640
We're recycling.

1965
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:03,120
We've got a time cap. Yes, of course.

1966
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:05,960
OK, OK. So, yeah, for those of you who don't know,

1967
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,960
Len co-hosts a podcast that we have all listened to,

1968
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:12,760
that we have all talked about ad nauseam,

1969
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:16,120
rumors, fun stuff, history.

1970
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,800
It's all there. Numbers, statistics.

1971
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:20,840
You're like Mr. Statistics, I feel.

1972
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:23,080
I have a team of great statistics.

1973
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:25,840
Be that way because you have a guide that is full of numbers

1974
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,600
and full of information.

1975
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,040
So we've talked about you guys forever.

1976
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:32,080
Yeah, thanks. So we're fans.

1977
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:36,240
I'm listening to Jim and yeah, I mean, what I was thinking on the way

1978
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:39,440
what I was realizing on the way over is, you know, we talk a lot about

1979
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:43,200
Mike's, Mike's probably biggest obsession that we talk about

1980
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:46,840
a lot on the podcast is his obsession with what he calls checking.

1981
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:50,600
And checking, I guess, would be defined as,

1982
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,240
well, how do you define checking?

1983
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:56,160
Well, checking is anything that I think it's a repetitive motion

1984
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:58,200
that I think that's really what it comes down to.

1985
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,440
Like doctors call it a compulsive behavior.

1986
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:01,760
It is a compulsive behavior.

1987
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,360
It's like trying to get tickets at Ticketmaster, which is like

1988
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:07,960
I'll spend 40 minutes refreshing, refreshing, trying to get better tickets.

1989
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,400
When it's fast passes, I'm canceling and trying to get better ones

1990
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:15,440
and better ones. And then the high I get when I get like a fast pass,

1991
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:17,520
that's 30 minutes away versus two hours.

1992
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,600
So you're optimizing. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

1993
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,640
I'm optimizing.

1994
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:25,000
And it's maybe the greatest thrill that I experienced during a possible day.

1995
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,920
Maybe let's say maybe. Sure.

1996
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
It depends on the day.

1997
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,840
But I was thinking it's like for you to meet the person who runs a

1998
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:36,320
like theme park planning website is like it's like meeting Mickey Mantle.

1999
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:39,520
That is a good point. Yes.

2000
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:40,600
It is a good point.

2001
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:43,080
Yeah. So you like you have it all in your head more.

2002
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,440
But I do. I enjoy planning.

2003
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:48,680
I enjoy figuring out the exact you actually I should thank you

2004
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:52,720
now that I think about it because we stayed at Port Orleans in Orlando

2005
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:56,440
two years ago and you were the one who told me on the podcast, not me personally.

2006
01:31:57,080 --> 01:32:01,120
But you told me about the hot lighter deals and how you would be able to check

2007
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:04,960
and see if you could tell which Orlando resort it was.

2008
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:08,680
So I had a much more expensive resort and I checked and I checked.

2009
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:09,680
I was like, oh, my God.

2010
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:14,320
And I canceled the one I had and we stayed at Port Orleans for like 150 to

2011
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:15,680
I don't remember something crazy.

2012
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:17,880
So because some of those are dead giveaway.

2013
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:21,920
Like, you know, New Orleans tell you sometimes to tell you sometimes that.

2014
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,520
Yeah, it still depends.

2015
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:24,560
So thank you.

2016
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:27,000
We're just keeping praise on you for minutes.

2017
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:29,760
There's a one of our one of our users.

2018
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:33,960
His name is John is a guy that keeps track of the the price line

2019
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:35,000
and the hot wire deals.

2020
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,640
And he has a system that is I'm not going to say it's foolproof, but it's 100 percent.

2021
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:41,600
Wow. And we can't say how it works on the air.

2022
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,280
Wow. Send me send me an email.

2023
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:45,320
I can explain to you.

2024
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:47,880
Sure. That is very exciting to me.

2025
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:48,760
We'll talk about it off the air.

2026
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:51,800
Does it work for everywhere or just Orlando?

2027
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:54,880
It works. We know when it works for the Disney area hotels.

2028
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,680
OK, because I just was in Vegas and I was doing all of this obsessive

2029
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:01,120
hot wire and price line to try to figure out.

2030
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:02,280
Yeah. What would OK.

2031
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:03,720
So we'll talk later. Yeah, we'll talk later.

2032
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:04,800
Yeah. OK, got it. Got it.

2033
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:09,680
Yeah. But I guess I guess the question to ask specifically is

2034
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:15,240
in regards to Star Wars, Galaxy's Edge, which all four of us now

2035
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:18,040
have experienced, I mean, how's that changed

2036
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,360
your world's with touring plans?

2037
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:22,520
What have you been like looking for?

2038
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:24,560
What have you been the most

2039
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:29,400
nervously anticipating, worried about in terms of things being a disaster

2040
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:31,440
over there, which I think we could safely say they were not.

2041
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:35,000
Our big concern was how they were going to handle opening day crowds.

2042
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,600
And to their credit, that doesn't pull it off flawlessly.

2043
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:40,800
I don't think today could have gone any better than it did.

2044
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:43,200
Yeah. All the crowds were manageable.

2045
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:44,920
All the lines were clearly marked.

2046
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,800
Disney did a great job operationally.

2047
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:51,640
It has off to all the check in check out was very, very fast.

2048
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:52,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2049
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:53,720
They did really, really well in all of it.

2050
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:56,480
We got in like at eight o'clock exactly.

2051
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:59,040
Maybe like they really had pinpointed it down

2052
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,160
because they walked us from Tomorrowland over.

2053
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:04,200
And it was just it was crazy because we were like, wow,

2054
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:05,680
we're going to get him right at eight o'clock.

2055
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:07,160
Like it was insane. Right at the clock.

2056
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:09,280
Yeah. What do you do first?

2057
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:11,840
I got a Blue Milk by 807.

2058
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:15,080
I had mobile ordered from the entryway.

2059
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:16,880
It was sooner. It was 801.

2060
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,920
I want to say I'm going to give you that credit.

2061
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:20,760
This was my three. It was 810.

2062
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:24,000
And I was like, oh, my God, am I going to have to burn 10 minutes standing here?

2063
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:28,000
But then there was just a cast member standing at the mobile order pickup.

2064
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:31,120
And I was like, hey, I'm a little ordered, Jason.

2065
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:32,280
And she's like, oh, yeah, there you are.

2066
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:34,000
And she just got it.

2067
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,520
So like we kind of got separated at some point.

2068
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:39,040
And then I just showed back up with Blue Milk. Yeah.

2069
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:42,080
Jason is one of his things he said before today.

2070
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:43,640
Yeah. He wanted to do that.

2071
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:45,960
He said two milks, different types.

2072
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:47,480
I had it in the cantina, too.

2073
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:51,120
He did. It was very honestly, it was better frozen.

2074
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:53,600
The other way about the butter beer, I like the cold butter.

2075
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,000
Yeah, I like the frozen milk. I thought it was was fun.

2076
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:57,320
I think it's better frozen as well. Yeah.

2077
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:59,320
Yeah. Official verdict here.

2078
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:02,720
But we did that and we were able to get into the cantina.

2079
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:05,080
But as we were saying right before we started recording, mainly because we were

2080
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:07,040
with somebody who was in the front of the pack.

2081
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:11,920
And I might advise anybody listening to this to if cantina is your concern,

2082
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:15,440
maybe try to be too early and get it like.

2083
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:18,040
Yeah, because it's not a line per se.

2084
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,120
Like everybody gets into the land and you can easily do

2085
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:24,240
the most of the things you want to do.

2086
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:27,960
But cantina, I mean, you were said like that was up to two, two and a half hours.

2087
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:31,400
They told us to the the last hour of your wristband eligibility.

2088
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:32,720
You can't get in line.

2089
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:35,880
So they cut you off an hour before interesting to try and get you all the way through.

2090
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:38,520
They're trying to get into you 45 minutes in the cantina.

2091
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:39,920
Right. Nice. That's great.

2092
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:42,320
Which is nice. But it took us 45 minutes to get our drinks.

2093
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:46,040
Yeah. So when they you know, when the waitstaff comes out and tells you

2094
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:49,760
you've got to be gone in 45 minutes, like I've got two and a half minutes

2095
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,920
to drink two drinks. This is great. Yeah.

2096
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:53,920
Yeah. You can have some fun.

2097
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:58,400
Did you did you because I learned the hard way that I figured that, well,

2098
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:00,720
maybe there's not a restroom inside, which there is not.

2099
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:02,880
There's no restroom inside. There is no ins and outs.

2100
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:05,040
They said if you go out, you're out. You're out.

2101
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:06,080
Yeah, that's it. One time.

2102
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:08,960
No, you you you go to the you use the facilities before you go in.

2103
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,400
I yeah, it was it was kind of a whirlwind.

2104
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:12,320
The you bailed early.

2105
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:14,640
I failed. Yeah. I stayed for a little while.

2106
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:17,040
You had so much milk inside of you.

2107
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:20,600
Crazy. Yeah.

2108
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:22,840
It's coffee and coffee walking in.

2109
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:26,480
I mean, I've been up since like I got up at like 4 45 this morning.

2110
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,480
Yeah, I got a free. Yeah. Yeah, sure.

2111
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,160
I see steps. I'm sorry. Oh, my God.

2112
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:32,120
Oh, you're on East Coast. Whatever. Yeah.

2113
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:34,240
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

2114
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:35,680
I there's a question.

2115
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:38,480
Do you the smoothness of this?

2116
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:42,360
Do you would you credit any

2117
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:46,160
like recent programs Disney has instituted

2118
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:49,680
or any other, you know, theme park

2119
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:52,200
or organizations have been experimenting with like like

2120
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:54,000
is there anything that you can point to that's been happening

2121
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,360
the last few years where it's like, oh, that must have been planning

2122
01:36:56,360 --> 01:37:00,600
the seeds for the smoothness of the groups and the reservation.

2123
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:03,120
I think the project start us thing that they're doing with

2124
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:04,800
where they're opening up the walkways.

2125
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,760
You can definitely tell that that's made a huge difference.

2126
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:10,080
The stroller stuff was all much better.

2127
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:12,560
All of the things that they've been doing over the last six months to a year,

2128
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,280
which is the walkways, all of it.

2129
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:17,280
We've probably heard a lot about this on your podcast, but yeah.

2130
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:18,760
What are the big projects start as things?

2131
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:20,400
It's like clearing out adventure land.

2132
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:23,800
But the curve is making the curve lowering the curve,

2133
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:26,360
making the walkways more consistent and wider,

2134
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:30,320
even if it's moving things like a foot, they move things a foot. Right.

2135
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,840
And you can tell, I mean, it's

2136
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:35,040
the walkways are much more accessible.

2137
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:36,720
And the water.

2138
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:38,840
But also the whole park looks really good right now.

2139
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:41,480
And yes, we're talking before we recorded that I spent

2140
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:45,360
parts of Tuesday and Wednesday just walking around and taking a look at

2141
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:48,800
both Disneyland and DCA right before

2142
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:53,000
Black Spire opened to see what it was, you know, one more time

2143
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,360
before everything changed.

2144
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:55,920
And it looked really, really good.

2145
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:57,760
Everything looked, everything was working.

2146
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,440
All of the effects in Toontown, for example, were working when I was there.

2147
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:02,880
Wow. Everything was really good. Yeah.

2148
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:06,120
Do you when you're looking like, do you have like a checklist

2149
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:08,480
even of effects or are you just kind of going off of memory?

2150
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:13,000
I walk with Guy who has a walking encyclopedia of things.

2151
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:16,400
Guy knows where all the individual different decades of fencing are.

2152
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:21,480
And apparently there's this place in Tomorrowland where you can see

2153
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,160
three decades of fencing coming together.

2154
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:27,600
And Guy showed me this this particular spot.

2155
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,040
And I'm like, man, that is some knowledge right there.

2156
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:31,680
It's the spot. You got to tell us the spot.

2157
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:36,120
It's over by where the sort of the Matterhorn meets the

2158
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:38,560
the submarine voyage.

2159
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:42,280
There's three different sections of of of fencing there.

2160
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:46,760
That's it's like early Tomorrowland and then two versions of like

2161
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:48,400
Fantasyland coming together.

2162
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:49,400
All at one point.

2163
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:51,280
Yeah, because a lot has been redistricted.

2164
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:53,680
Yeah, because like there was there used to be two

2165
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:58,480
utopias and things have changed and there were two queues for for Matterhorn.

2166
01:38:58,480 --> 01:38:59,680
Apparently, no. Sure, sure, sure.

2167
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,880
Three decades of fencing, all of it from the past.

2168
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,120
Tomorrow. Yeah, none of it from tomorrow.

2169
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:08,040
Now, some of it was was definitely fantastical, though.

2170
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:09,840
So that sort of fits in. Yeah, that's good.

2171
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,560
We got to get a picture with this triple fence.

2172
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:14,640
We are literally going to go in and get the triple fence after this.

2173
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:16,080
There's no three. It's three of them.

2174
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,800
College fence here. He's going to drag his wife.

2175
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:19,960
I'm dragging my girlfriend from Carthay Circle and going,

2176
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:22,320
we have to see this special match. Yeah, exactly.

2177
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:24,760
We must see the fencing.

2178
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:29,640
I the other thing to mention is like with the smoothness of the day,

2179
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:31,880
OK, so we got out of there.

2180
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:33,360
We got out of Star Wars around noon.

2181
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,680
We've just been touring around the park for the last couple hours.

2182
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:39,440
And now the rest of the park is virtually empty.

2183
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,680
Like some of the shortest lines I've ever seen.

2184
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:43,720
Nobody in it. Carly, there's nobody.

2185
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:45,600
I just had a car in Manhattan. It's insane.

2186
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:49,160
I don't remember the last time there was only like three occupied tables.

2187
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:50,240
Maybe never. Yeah.

2188
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:52,760
She's really why I was going to be much more crowded than this.

2189
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:55,920
Not not DCA necessarily, but I thought Disneyland would be

2190
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,800
much more crowded with people who thought maybe that they didn't need

2191
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,600
a reservation to come in or right.

2192
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:02,200
But no, I mean, Disney's got the word out.

2193
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:04,680
It looks like I was worried about people not understanding

2194
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:06,760
and that everybody in the line would be.

2195
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:08,760
We also like, oh, they'll let us in. It's Disneyland.

2196
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:09,920
It'll be fine. Yeah.

2197
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,760
Hey, we'll smooth talk our way.

2198
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,640
We'll be friendly and sparkle.

2199
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:15,280
And there was a message board.

2200
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:18,800
I won't say which one that said there was somebody that like was very adamant

2201
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:20,280
that like there will be a stand.

2202
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:22,560
They're not saying standby line, but there will be.

2203
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,160
But that's not happened, right?

2204
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:26,160
I haven't seen a standby line.

2205
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:27,080
So that was wrong.

2206
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:28,320
And whatever this website is,

2207
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:31,440
I guess, listener, if you really want to email me, I'll tell you what it was.

2208
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:35,400
But I don't want to say now, you know, the average listener.

2209
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:38,920
If you have my email, I guess we have a show email.

2210
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,280
They were loading in.

2211
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:44,800
They were they they were loading in by Critter Country in the afternoon.

2212
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:47,600
We went in through Big Thunder Trail.

2213
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:48,560
Yes. Yeah.

2214
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:52,920
So the only hiccup was that we were told we would be loading in a Critter Country

2215
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:54,520
and then we loaded in at Big Thunder.

2216
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:56,840
I thought the colored tape was the it was the dead giveaway

2217
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:59,920
for how you were supposed to load because green was the second wave

2218
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,040
and they were over at Critter Country.

2219
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:02,680
But we were blue in the morning.

2220
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:05,040
OK, the gentleman, I guess, was just wrong.

2221
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,760
I think he was probably just speaking to.

2222
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:08,280
But we just kind of followed the mass.

2223
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:10,080
Yeah, exactly. There was nowhere.

2224
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:12,800
And there was yeah, there was so much manager.

2225
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,840
There was so many people in business attire.

2226
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:17,720
In addition to cast members in like Star Wars attire there,

2227
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:19,480
it's a lot of managerial people.

2228
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:21,400
Well, also, that means it's a work day Friday, too, for a lot of people.

2229
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:22,960
So they should. If it was a Sunday.

2230
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:25,240
Oh, yeah, that's true.

2231
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:25,720
But it's Friday.

2232
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:28,240
He should be. So we just think of the red.

2233
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:32,240
We we I think my review is I dug it, but I don't think it's the highlight.

2234
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:36,000
I don't think it's the best thing about being there, which is I don't know.

2235
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:37,200
Maybe that's the Cantina.

2236
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:39,840
Maybe that's the just atmosphere in general.

2237
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:42,560
I think it's just like walking around is the best thing about being there.

2238
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:45,120
But yeah, I don't know.

2239
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:48,840
But I liked it and I like the Q experience and I like being being

2240
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:53,920
like in that waiting room in the Falcon and then the ride itself is like, hmm.

2241
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:56,360
It's fine. Yeah, it's fine for what it was.

2242
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:58,600
What would put what role did you have?

2243
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:00,360
Oh, I did all three.

2244
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:03,960
I wrote in three times this morning while we were in there.

2245
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:05,320
Awesome. May that say something.

2246
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:06,960
The single writers.

2247
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:08,160
Yeah, you're right.

2248
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:09,160
Walk right on.

2249
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:11,640
But I mean, you miss all of the pre-show stuff.

2250
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:13,560
But like, you know, I just seen it once.

2251
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:15,920
Yeah. You'll then you'll also probably be the engineer.

2252
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:20,800
Except we single rider in our party got to be the pilot, which is unfair.

2253
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:21,920
I feel that's true.

2254
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:23,280
Should be the pilot.

2255
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:25,400
But I felt I felt too bad.

2256
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:27,440
Yeah, I mean, I was they're not they're not letting you pick

2257
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:29,680
because I asked one time to be pilot and they're like, no,

2258
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:31,960
but we ended up being pilot anyway.

2259
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:33,920
Oh, they're like, how many times did you do it?

2260
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:36,320
Three. OK, I've done one in each role.

2261
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:38,600
Oh, what do you think?

2262
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:41,240
So the the one the engineers in the back, right?

2263
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:42,600
Yes. That's the worst.

2264
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:44,960
The worst role. Yeah, it's what I would have guessed.

2265
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:45,720
It's a lot to do.

2266
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:49,280
But did you notice the ergonomics of the Millennium Falcon are also not that great?

2267
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:50,800
Kind of. Yeah, you kind of got to sit.

2268
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,480
I don't want to complain because it's a spaceship

2269
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:54,600
and you shouldn't really complain about like the ergonomics.

2270
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:55,680
It's a spaceship, right?

2271
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:56,720
Ultimately. Yeah.

2272
01:42:56,720 --> 01:43:00,400
But no, but like you're when you sit down, the seat is facing forward

2273
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:01,800
so you can see the action.

2274
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:04,560
Everything you're supposed to do is 90 degrees to your right.

2275
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:07,000
Yes, this is yes.

2276
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,160
So whoever was actually setting up that workstation,

2277
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:14,160
I think did not have like OSHA compatibility in mind when they were doing it.

2278
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:18,520
Well, do you blame that it's this would you have to blame the design

2279
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:20,760
of the real Millennium Falcon for this problem?

2280
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:24,920
Well, I think there was a practical compromise because famously the land

2281
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:30,520
Falcon, there is a very long gunner sequence in a new hope

2282
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:32,600
where they're separate.

2283
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:34,560
Yeah, there is a separate separate.

2284
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:36,240
That's what I thought. I thought we would be separate.

2285
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:39,080
Yeah. Or at least in little antechambers to the side.

2286
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:39,680
Sorry.

2287
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:44,160
Any chambers to the side of the of the main pod, like where we actually had guns.

2288
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:47,200
I mean, that would be I mean, we're basically pushing buttons here,

2289
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:50,320
like ordering a frappuccino or a gas station or something.

2290
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,640
Or this is not the one you're talking about.

2291
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:55,400
My my feeling was I did pilot.

2292
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:57,160
I was in the back seat.

2293
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:59,920
I almost felt like it was a better ride in the back seat,

2294
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:01,840
even though I couldn't see as well.

2295
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:04,040
But I sort of was not as stressed out.

2296
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:08,400
But it would take me out a little bit when I'd have to turn and press three buttons.

2297
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:10,960
Because you don't you can't see what's going on on the screen.

2298
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:13,160
And also, I thought the screen would be more wrapped around you.

2299
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:15,560
Like I thought you'd be farther in the cockpit a little bit.

2300
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:19,320
Yes. When you're the engineer, if you look up, all you see is right.

2301
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:20,720
Be a ceiling. Right.

2302
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:21,720
Yeah. Like it is.

2303
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:25,240
I get it. That is like maybe accurate technically.

2304
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:29,000
Maybe they could have like it would be a way to be an eight person

2305
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,840
DeLorean in the back to the future. Right.

2306
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:35,000
It's not the DeLorean where you would have not even room for a third person.

2307
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:39,280
Yes. So maybe they have maybe they needed to like we've expanded the cockpit

2308
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:40,760
to allow for and this.

2309
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:43,400
I don't want to like just hate on it because I did really enjoy it.

2310
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:46,880
Like I truly like being in the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon is amazing.

2311
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:48,880
Yeah. And piloting is really amazing.

2312
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:54,080
I do think they were trying to be too nice to everyone who's sitting down.

2313
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:56,600
My feeling is one control should have been.

2314
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:58,080
Oh, let me back up.

2315
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:02,400
There's two pilots, one controls up, one controls side to side.

2316
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:05,000
And man, is that frustrating. Yeah.

2317
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
That is so frustrating. Yeah.

2318
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,840
Because like it's like you have half of a half of a steering wheel.

2319
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:12,800
Yeah. Right. It's like kind of insane, honestly.

2320
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,080
Like I get where they're going with it.

2321
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:18,960
But and I know that it's on rails like you really can't go that far out of where they want you.

2322
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:20,400
No, I tried when I was piloting.

2323
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:24,040
Yeah, sure. Sure. Down and nose dive.

2324
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:27,040
You can flip this like flight to it.

2325
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:30,440
Yeah. The visuals are very, very constrained.

2326
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:34,120
Like you can't you can't leave the field that you sit right.

2327
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,920
So you can't like turn left and just go around the world to the left.

2328
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:38,640
Yeah, I mean, I get it.

2329
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:40,200
I get like I get it.

2330
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:42,320
It has to sort of be that way.

2331
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:43,320
Does it?

2332
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:47,520
Doesn't it? But isn't it like I mean, I like that question too.

2333
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:52,160
I I mean, here I'm thinking now Star Fox 64.

2334
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:56,840
There were there were worlds that were on like kind of rails

2335
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:59,000
and then there were worlds that were sort of more open.

2336
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,560
Yeah. Air and you could go around and zip in.

2337
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:03,280
And but there were still objectives to do.

2338
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:08,040
Yeah. So perhaps there was a way to maybe do it where it was a little more exploratory.

2339
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:09,920
I would have liked a little bit more exploring.

2340
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:12,120
Yeah. And with the consequences of, you know,

2341
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:14,280
if you explore, you don't finish your mission.

2342
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:15,960
Right. And there are consequences.

2343
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:18,720
The other thing, too, is I didn't get the like we

2344
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:22,280
I didn't get how the consequences happen once you leave the spaceship.

2345
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:26,520
Like, yeah, did you guys get did you guys end up with positive points or negative points?

2346
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:29,640
We had like mildly positive, but the first one seemed negative

2347
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:31,400
and there were like flashing green lights.

2348
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:34,280
And that's what let us know that as you walked into the hallway,

2349
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:36,240
which was actually a complete tower down on one ride,

2350
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:39,200
like everything black and then back up again.

2351
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:40,680
Oh, no, this was like theatrical.

2352
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:42,000
Oh, no, no, no. I got an actual.

2353
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,080
Yeah. It actually like broke down.

2354
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:46,520
Yeah. Like there were not there was no there were no visuals for like

2355
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:47,760
oh my four minutes. Yeah.

2356
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:49,200
It's like that long. Really?

2357
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:51,560
Reboot the laptop. Yep. Oh, that's interesting.

2358
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:53,480
Yeah. Huh. Huh. It was fun.

2359
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:54,360
Sure. Sure. Yeah.

2360
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:57,400
And they actually have a spiel that they that they play.

2361
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:59,680
It was very funny. I like that.

2362
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:03,760
They have a lot of different little tidbits to cover when they're

2363
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:05,680
they do this a little bit in Avatar land.

2364
01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:06,640
Exactly. Yeah.

2365
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:07,880
But they're doing it better here.

2366
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:09,640
I think this one was actually much more. Yeah. Yeah.

2367
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:13,320
Yes. The one in Avatar is like a 10 second looper.

2368
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:15,480
I feel like it's like something that's very repetitive.

2369
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:18,000
And it's like just a guy like typing on a computer.

2370
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:18,920
Like, oh, I'm working on it.

2371
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:21,040
And then it's like 10 seconds later, I'm working on it.

2372
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:24,120
And you're like, OK, this is like Hondo.

2373
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:25,920
It's a whole different thing.

2374
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:28,840
I have to say they endeared Hondo to me pretty quickly.

2375
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:30,520
Yeah. Like a character I was not really from.

2376
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:33,800
I know shows up in the cartoons and stuff, but like a character

2377
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:37,720
that's going to be brand new for pretty much 90 percent of the people going to this.

2378
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:39,240
Yeah, it was great. And it's like, oh, I like this.

2379
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:41,400
Yeah, this is fun. I like the skeevy guy.

2380
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,160
Yeah, the queue is fantastic.

2381
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:43,920
All of it's fantastic.

2382
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,160
I really truly that all of that is fantastic.

2383
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:48,760
That they're working on the engines and you can hear the engines starting up.

2384
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:52,640
Yeah. I mean, it smelled like a it smelled like a garage. Right.

2385
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:55,360
Yeah. We walked in and saw Hondo and I guess spoiler.

2386
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:57,160
We'll say that's before, but spoiler alert.

2387
01:47:57,160 --> 01:47:59,080
Like we see him up there. We all like gasped.

2388
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:01,080
Yeah. And I looked at all this great animatronicism.

2389
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:02,080
It's fantastic.

2390
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:05,080
So like all of that stuff, I think, walking into the Falcon,

2391
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:07,840
a very mildly emotional for me.

2392
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:11,520
All that stuff sitting down like it was really crazy.

2393
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:13,600
And then, yeah, like it's good.

2394
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:16,200
The ride is good. Yeah, good.

2395
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:19,840
It's like you've never been on a video game this cool or elaborate.

2396
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:22,160
But I don't think they're going to.

2397
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:25,120
I think they will hear some extent of this.

2398
01:48:25,120 --> 01:48:29,280
I bet we will see like modified retools.

2399
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:33,080
I don't think that ride stays exactly how it is day one.

2400
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:33,840
No, I don't think so.

2401
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:36,760
And I think you'd have to think that the interactive elements

2402
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:40,080
let them change it up and I think we'll see more interactivity.

2403
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:43,880
I still don't understand how the how the outcome tracks you through Black Spire.

2404
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:46,360
Oh, yes, that's been said for so long.

2405
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:50,520
And I don't really I don't think it's I don't think it's if it's if it's true,

2406
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:52,160
it's not working on day one.

2407
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:55,120
Seems like it would make sense with the magic band sort of system.

2408
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:56,680
I wouldn't really have that out here.

2409
01:48:56,680 --> 01:49:00,200
But you've got so now when you use that, my play Disney parks app,

2410
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:02,760
if you turn Bluetooth on, I believe that's how it's tracking you.

2411
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:04,440
Is that what it is? Yeah.

2412
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:07,080
Oh, yeah, because it asks you to have Bluetooth on the whole time.

2413
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:08,440
And I think that's what they're doing. Yeah.

2414
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:11,160
So when when Guy and I rode the second time, we both had Bluetooth on.

2415
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:15,960
And right before you walk into the Falcon, there's a there's a small TV.

2416
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:20,800
Yeah. And Hondo came back on and said, Oh, you guys are back.

2417
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:23,920
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

2418
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:25,960
He said, you're back. That's interesting. Yeah.

2419
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:28,200
That's cool. I got to give it up.

2420
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:31,120
So that's that's how I think they're tracking and it's it must be coming from the app.

2421
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:34,200
And did it not seem to you guys like we were in that room

2422
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:36,200
a little longer the second time? Yeah.

2423
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:38,200
Hondo Spiel keeps going.

2424
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:42,560
And then in an unbroken animated sequence,

2425
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:46,720
it like extends it auto extends.

2426
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:48,520
Yeah. Because there is a delay.

2427
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:51,280
Yeah. Which is which is pretty wild to me. Yeah.

2428
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:53,400
That's the thing to go back to back to the future, right?

2429
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:56,400
There is no like extra fill from Duck Brown.

2430
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:59,480
They go to the test pattern, but you wouldn't get like, yeah,

2431
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:03,080
they didn't like update five hours of improv.

2432
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:03,680
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2433
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,200
Make sure to cover please.

2434
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:07,560
Please do every possible option.

2435
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:10,800
One for if there's a legionnaires disease outbreak.

2436
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:13,960
Eclipse. There's something on Eclipse.

2437
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:15,240
I need three minutes.

2438
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:16,200
That's great.

2439
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:18,000
It's just covering our base.

2440
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,800
Moons, man. They're crazy, right? Yeah.

2441
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,400
Did you guys as you guys are back going back to the bar,

2442
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:25,800
do you guys try the drink that numbs your mouth?

2443
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:26,600
Oh, no. What?

2444
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:28,240
I mean, perhaps not.

2445
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:29,640
That doesn't sound familiar.

2446
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:31,680
So it's the one with the foam.

2447
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:32,800
Hmm. No, no.

2448
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:36,280
I I did the best been Fizz and then the bloody rain core.

2449
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:37,800
Those are both.

2450
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:39,480
We were one of every drink.

2451
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:40,440
Oh, really? Yeah.

2452
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:42,640
And so we were like, I mean, those people are with us, too.

2453
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:44,560
Yes. We're the fuzzy tauntaun.

2454
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,200
Yes. The fuzzy tauntaun.

2455
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:52,080
It the foam is actually numbs your your mouth on purpose.

2456
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,120
On purpose. Yeah. Apparently, it's a thing.

2457
01:50:54,120 --> 01:50:56,720
And I know there are Chinese spices that numb your mouth.

2458
01:50:57,200 --> 01:50:59,720
Oh, so they must be using some sort of extract of that.

2459
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:00,680
But it's flavors.

2460
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:03,400
It's a it's either mildly numbing or mildly itchy,

2461
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:05,720
depending on how you take it.

2462
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:08,080
Yeah. But it's a it was it's tasty drink, too.

2463
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:08,640
Yeah, they're not.

2464
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:11,040
You get the like the party mix.

2465
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,080
Yes, it's the party mix. Yeah.

2466
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:13,760
Was it wasabi? It's not bad.

2467
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:15,080
Yeah, that looked interesting.

2468
01:51:15,080 --> 01:51:15,760
It was tasty.

2469
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:16,880
Picture afterwards.

2470
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:17,640
They have to wait left.

2471
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:19,920
And then the the jello thing that looks like it looks like

2472
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:23,520
Boba Boba in gel.

2473
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:24,960
Yeah. And that's exactly what it is.

2474
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:26,080
OK. But it's not bad.

2475
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:28,880
I'm not a big fan of jello or Boba, but it wasn't bad.

2476
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:30,720
Any other food?

2477
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:33,320
You do one of the one of the we tried all of the Ronto roasters

2478
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:34,960
things, which were all pretty good.

2479
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:36,960
I had the hot dog sausage.

2480
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,280
Did you try the breakfast one?

2481
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:40,040
The breakfast was the best lunch one. Is it?

2482
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:42,280
Yeah. Breakfast one of the egg is was really super tasty.

2483
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:45,000
Also, did you see the cutlery, the the sporks?

2484
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:45,960
Oh, right. Oh, yeah.

2485
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:46,600
You brought that up.

2486
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:47,520
Then we were keeping.

2487
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:48,280
Yes. You just find them.

2488
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:50,040
Yeah. We we still have some out.

2489
01:51:50,040 --> 01:51:51,240
And people have stolen them already.

2490
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:52,320
No, I don't think so.

2491
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:53,240
I think they had.

2492
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:54,400
They're not going to be there tomorrow.

2493
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:56,000
I use them. You think I should.

2494
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,320
I have stolen them.

2495
01:51:57,320 --> 01:51:58,600
Should I have stolen? I didn't.

2496
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:00,800
I'm just saying it's this year's must have souvenir.

2497
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:02,320
I'm just saying I looked.

2498
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:04,120
I don't think there's any on eBay yet.

2499
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:07,920
I I will be shocked if tomorrow morning we wake up and there's not.

2500
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:08,760
They're not on eBay.

2501
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:09,880
There's like metal.

2502
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:11,000
Sport metal sports.

2503
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,880
But I would like to put that in your kids lunch box and be like,

2504
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:15,080
guess what I got for you?

2505
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:15,960
No. Yeah. Yeah.

2506
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:17,240
Bring a little of the magic home with you.

2507
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:19,800
I actually thought it was like a I think it's a good utensil.

2508
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:21,920
It's sort of like a little spork a little.

2509
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:22,720
Yeah. Yeah.

2510
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:24,960
It's like weightier, bigger.

2511
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:27,160
I mean, you didn't see using this food and wine, right?

2512
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:29,080
I mean, just how would you get this out?

2513
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:30,160
Black black spire.

2514
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:30,880
Yeah. Yeah.

2515
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:31,480
Uh huh.

2516
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:34,880
It's like instead of a pocket knife, you carry this spork from Black Spire Outpost.

2517
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,120
It's like a multi use thing.

2518
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:39,000
It's fantastic. Yeah.

2519
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,360
I thought all the food was was really good.

2520
01:52:40,360 --> 01:52:42,560
The only thing we haven't done yet and we'll do it tomorrow is the

2521
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:44,160
the lightsaber experience.

2522
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:48,040
OK, so that's potentially not compatible with all the other.

2523
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:50,400
I was thinking you can't do all three of those things.

2524
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:53,600
You can't do the you can't do the Falcon, the Cantina and the lightsaber.

2525
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:55,680
Almost trying to make you come back.

2526
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:56,640
I know that time.

2527
01:52:56,640 --> 01:52:59,120
The party has to buy the lightsaber at the end.

2528
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:02,000
Whereas can you just sort of see the show element?

2529
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,480
I I imagine you can always say no, right?

2530
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:07,080
You can always say no.

2531
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:10,160
But I think everyone that's going in there is going in there to buy a lightsaber.

2532
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:11,040
I think so. Yeah.

2533
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:12,960
And there was plenty of people.

2534
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,000
Two and a half hour long. Yeah.

2535
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,840
But I mean, it's only it's 14 groups of two every 20 minutes.

2536
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:19,680
So what is that?

2537
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:22,000
That's 42 people.

2538
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:24,520
84 people an hour.

2539
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:26,360
Hmm. That's not a lot.

2540
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:28,360
That's a real, yeah, that's your experience.

2541
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:30,880
Hey, what do you think about listing that as an attraction?

2542
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:32,120
I think absolutely.

2543
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:34,280
I mean, they're going to have to do reservations, I think, at some point

2544
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:38,400
where it'll be like Cinderella's royal table where you'll pay up front.

2545
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:40,880
OK, for your reservation, you'll get the lightsaber at the end.

2546
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:42,320
And that's how they're going to do it.

2547
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:42,800
Hmm.

2548
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:46,840
Because I can't imagine that everybody in that line was in that line to buy a lightsaber.

2549
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:47,720
And if they were, God bless them.

2550
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:49,920
But sure. But they'll cut that in the line, too.

2551
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:51,200
I got you. Yeah.

2552
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:54,800
Do we know what that's like the highest selling merch thing yet?

2553
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:56,520
I think it's

2554
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:58,120
now seeing a lot of people, the animals,

2555
01:53:58,120 --> 01:54:02,280
but I think the lightsabers at 200 bucks a pop are still, I think, a decent deal.

2556
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:06,400
Is are you do you have any merchandise from theme parks?

2557
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:08,120
Are you not a merch collector?

2558
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:09,200
I don't really collect anything anymore.

2559
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:12,040
Interesting. I mean, I think of the soda bottles here for Derek Bergen.

2560
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:14,560
He asked me to bring some home to a.

2561
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:16,320
Sure. I don't really, I don't really collect stuff anymore.

2562
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:16,960
Yeah.

2563
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:19,360
So stuff that I the stuff that I have is the stuff you can't buy.

2564
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:21,640
And I'm sort of into that.

2565
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:22,200
Do you have like.

2566
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:22,680
What does that mean?

2567
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:24,440
Yeah, I was going to say, like, what is that, like a car?

2568
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:25,520
I'm going to talk about it in the air.

2569
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:26,600
Oh, OK.

2570
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:28,480
Wow. Fascinating.

2571
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,520
I didn't even like experiences and love.

2572
01:54:30,520 --> 01:54:32,240
No, I have.

2573
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:35,520
I have things that are meaningful that you can't you can't acquire through normal channels.

2574
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:36,400
Interesting.

2575
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:37,760
Very interesting.

2576
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:38,880
I mean, very small things.

2577
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:39,200
Sure.

2578
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:41,200
Guy in Florida, a lot of trouble for that right now.

2579
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:45,200
So all of it, all of it's semi-legally obtained.

2580
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:46,200
Yeah.

2581
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:48,160
If you have any of Buzzy's clothes, I swear.

2582
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:49,480
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2583
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:51,680
That was you have a shirt.

2584
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:52,840
Is the shirt still missing?

2585
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:55,080
I don't know. I kind of followed it in the nose.

2586
01:54:55,080 --> 01:54:55,920
Like, yeah.

2587
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:57,360
Yeah.

2588
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:57,720
All right.

2589
01:54:57,720 --> 01:55:02,040
And the warrant is so funny, but also sad.

2590
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:04,760
Yeah, that's not the way that's that's not the way I'm going down.

2591
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:06,360
It's not for that.

2592
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:06,960
Yeah.

2593
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:10,080
Did you notice because you were in there for a little while.

2594
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:14,800
Did you notice them like like nudging people out because we know not at all?

2595
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:15,600
No, didn't notice.

2596
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:17,680
No, and we still like a photo pass.

2597
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:20,200
Photographer still took a picture in front of an X-Wing.

2598
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:21,600
Yeah, no, really noticed.

2599
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:25,680
You know, I think after four hours, you know, you've done everything

2600
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:28,680
that you want to do, and I think for most people, four hours was was good.

2601
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:29,760
I think it's plenty of time.

2602
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:30,440
Yeah. Yeah.

2603
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:31,320
Do you think I would say so?

2604
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:35,200
Do you think they were putting like for each group, what do you obviously like?

2605
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:39,440
Since there was overlap, capacity, the land can't be the amount they're letting in every.

2606
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:42,560
Oh, yes. We're trying to figure out how many people were and we did a little bit of counter.

2607
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:44,680
We figured there was about three thousand people in every group.

2608
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:46,160
Mm hmm. Hmm.

2609
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:49,960
Which is less than two hours of Millennium Falcon capacity.

2610
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:53,640
So spread that out over four hours and you have like an average 30 minute wait.

2611
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:56,920
Right. Which seems like it's about the average weight.

2612
01:55:57,600 --> 01:55:59,800
So I waited. I waited about 45 minutes.

2613
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:02,240
I waited about 15 minutes and I waited about five minutes.

2614
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:03,560
Right. Maybe less than that.

2615
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:06,800
Maybe it's a three thousand in some other like.

2616
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:12,400
Is there another like ride or area in a theme park just to like to help me visualize?

2617
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:15,200
What else? What's another place that would hold three thousand?

2618
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:18,840
Three thousand is about the peak hourly capacity of like pirates.

2619
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:19,920
OK. Yeah.

2620
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:21,680
That's what you that's what you think they're letting into the whole land.

2621
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:24,200
Yeah, not many. I mean, I think that's why we're in so smoothly.

2622
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:26,200
And there was so much there was open space.

2623
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:27,200
Yeah, there's a lot of open space.

2624
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:29,680
Just if you go back where where rise is supposed to be.

2625
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:31,880
Right. Yeah. There was not a lot of people over there at all.

2626
01:56:31,880 --> 01:56:33,960
In fact, that's one of the best places to go get the coke.

2627
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:35,320
The coke bottles.

2628
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:37,240
There's no one back there. Yeah.

2629
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:38,880
Yeah. Yeah. That that scene.

2630
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:42,280
That was kind of like where we ended because it's like where we ended.

2631
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:43,840
We're like, OK, turn around and go back.

2632
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:48,240
We sort of hit a choke point where it's like, oh, there's 30 minutes, 40 minutes left.

2633
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:51,200
The the overlap group has arrived.

2634
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:54,920
So like Doc on the they weren't letting anyone into Doc's.

2635
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:56,760
Oh, really? So I hadn't seen that.

2636
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:59,040
OK. They said like Doc's too busy right now.

2637
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:01,320
If you could come back. Yeah.

2638
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:02,800
It's a small, small place.

2639
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:06,400
The milk stand wouldn't let me mobile order unless I wanted it

2640
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:10,560
like three hours ahead of time because I tried going back to try the green milk.

2641
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:13,160
I don't think they understand how mobile ordering works.

2642
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:15,480
Yeah, I don't think they understand how mobile ordering works.

2643
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:18,680
I think that, yeah, I think they tapped it out, but I didn't want to spend

2644
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:23,320
the last half hour in the line in case the rumors of them going like,

2645
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:25,600
no, you can't buy that. I see what did.

2646
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:27,080
Yeah. Oh, three. Yeah.

2647
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:29,880
So by the way, did you guys do the the character?

2648
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:32,120
Any character encounters? Did you meet Ray?

2649
01:57:32,120 --> 01:57:34,000
No, you saw Ray, right?

2650
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,560
That is the best character greeting I've seen in a long time.

2651
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:39,640
Oh, oh, tell us. Yeah, I missed this entirely.

2652
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:42,600
So normally, you know, Disney character meet and greets, you go up,

2653
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:46,160
you meet the character, you take a picture, you're on your way like love and shelf.

2654
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:47,320
Right. OK, sure. So sorry.

2655
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:49,800
It's OK. Don't worry.

2656
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:52,160
But like Ray will actually pull you from the group.

2657
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:55,440
And Guy was meeting Ray.

2658
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:56,600
So Guy got the photo.

2659
01:57:56,600 --> 01:57:59,640
But she walked with Guy and talked about the force.

2660
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:01,960
And I was like, I think these two are having a moment.

2661
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:04,440
They're a cute couple. They're really nice. Wow.

2662
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:07,640
But yeah. And then she turned around and they posed and took pictures.

2663
01:58:07,640 --> 01:58:11,080
But it was like an actual meaningful, short little conversation.

2664
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:13,400
They took a stroll. They took a stroll.

2665
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:15,120
Yeah, she was walking around.

2666
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:17,480
She didn't really have a friend of Ray with her.

2667
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:20,520
But hey, she looks like Ray. She acts like Ray.

2668
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:22,680
She had all the mannerisms down.

2669
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:24,400
That was that part was fantastic.

2670
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:28,560
I went another 10 feet and hit a crowd and Chewbacca was there with like

2671
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:31,080
another rebel spy guy and they're both in character

2672
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:33,200
and they're both kind of like eyeing everyone up.

2673
01:58:33,200 --> 01:58:36,640
And the crowd parts and Chewbacca comes up to me, like gets down to my level,

2674
01:58:36,640 --> 01:58:39,400
looks me in the eye for a beat and then gives me a big hug.

2675
01:58:39,400 --> 01:58:43,600
And it was like what he has done in Launch Bay before.

2676
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:46,480
So you remember you. Yeah, I guess so.

2677
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:49,240
You guys are bad, but it was moving.

2678
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:52,360
It was like so moving like today.

2679
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:54,200
But then he just keeps walking there.

2680
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:55,520
They weren't. Yeah.

2681
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:56,880
Well, he she acknowledged you.

2682
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:59,080
And yeah, you want to hang out longer.

2683
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:01,360
No, I wanted to like try and get a picture.

2684
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:03,960
But like, I mean, Ray, I guess, he's got things to do.

2685
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:06,000
Yeah, he's got things to do.

2686
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:06,720
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2687
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:07,560
Responsibilities.

2688
01:59:07,560 --> 01:59:09,360
They were all starship to fly to.

2689
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:11,320
I mean, you know, sure.

2690
01:59:11,320 --> 01:59:14,320
They're still they were on break from building Rise of the Resistance.

2691
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:16,160
They were on their union break.

2692
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:18,800
So that's what I heard, like that all the characters are actually inhabitants.

2693
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:21,120
Right. And so they're just going about their day.

2694
01:59:21,120 --> 01:59:22,720
Right. That's the idea. Yeah.

2695
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:25,000
So Ray was actually walking. Right. Sure.

2696
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,400
And then we're just stopping quickly.

2697
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:27,760
Yeah. Stopping. Exactly.

2698
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:29,440
I was on her way to somewhere else.

2699
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:32,080
Yeah. He saw someone in the cantina who is.

2700
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:33,640
Oh, yeah. Like on.

2701
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:36,000
I just happen to remember they were on the cover.

2702
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:38,920
The characters on the cover of a book that hasn't come out yet.

2703
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:40,520
And I was like, I think that's this.

2704
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:42,160
But like I found it on the Amazon.

2705
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:44,200
And I'm like, that's this person.

2706
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:46,960
And she's like walking around looking over her shoulder.

2707
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:51,040
So like, oh, I think if you like, talk to her and ask about the resistance.

2708
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:53,040
But like she was darting like in and out.

2709
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:54,160
Yeah, I didn't even see her stop.

2710
01:59:54,160 --> 01:59:56,360
But she was like, that's clever.

2711
01:59:56,360 --> 01:59:59,920
Yeah. It was like she was a little too well dressed to be maybe a civilian.

2712
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:01,880
She looked exactly like the.

2713
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:04,720
Jason pulls the book cover up on his phone and we're like, oh, yep, that was her.

2714
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:07,440
Yeah. There was a painting of a person on the cover.

2715
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:09,280
But yeah, but she looked just like her.

2716
02:00:09,280 --> 02:00:10,880
Yeah, it looked great.

2717
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:11,840
So they're doing.

2718
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:13,320
Geez. That's good. I hope they keep doing that.

2719
02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:15,360
That's that's the kind of atmosphere stuff that we'll like to.

2720
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:16,360
Yeah. I've seen this.

2721
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:18,600
You know, that'll give it legs beyond like, yeah, exactly.

2722
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:19,760
All these things a ton of time.

2723
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:22,680
And if they can figure out how to actually track like your progress,

2724
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:24,360
like flying the Falcon and. Yeah.

2725
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:25,400
Stuff like that. Yeah.

2726
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:28,960
There was an art when I was getting Rex, we Scott and I both bought Rex's

2727
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:34,440
from the Droid Depot and R2 was right by the Rex.

2728
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:37,880
And also R2 came to life while I was buying or really Rex.

2729
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:40,440
And then sort of beeping at me and I was responding to me.

2730
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:41,920
Like I would say, oh, hi, R2.

2731
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:44,240
And you're like, like in turn with head.

2732
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:47,360
And then people were coming up to it and kids were coming up and hugging him.

2733
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:51,440
And it was like everyone was just like enthralled by this.

2734
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:54,960
By R2. Yeah, because supposedly they were going to do it in the full land.

2735
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:57,040
But then it was like, yeah, busy. We don't want to do it yet.

2736
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:57,880
That's what I heard.

2737
02:00:57,880 --> 02:01:02,320
That they they got a lot of the the autonomous robot stuff working.

2738
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:05,120
But then they're like, can somebody's going to come over and try and push it over?

2739
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:08,640
Right. I think also when I say I heard it probably was from you.

2740
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:12,320
I'm guessing. Yeah, mostly when I'm saying I heard it's from you or Jim, I think.

2741
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:15,560
This is how we probably have spent a lot of time on our podcast, like

2742
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:21,320
in eloquently badly reporting something that we heard from your podcast.

2743
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:23,760
And we try to say that we're not trying to fake pretend we have.

2744
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:26,400
We're not claiming the scoops.

2745
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:29,680
Just realizing like, you know, yeah, you guys say something succinctly.

2746
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:33,120
And then we say it like, I think I remember like.

2747
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:38,440
So thanks for letting us siphon material.

2748
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:39,200
All this together, man.

2749
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:42,240
We're all. We've entered a fraternity.

2750
02:01:42,760 --> 02:01:45,760
Actually, and now I'm now on that note, I there's a there's something

2751
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:48,600
that I'd be remiss if I didn't fed him bring up.

2752
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:51,240
OK, the three of us, we have we have one podcast.

2753
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:55,520
You then have one podcast.

2754
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:59,040
Jim Hill, your partner in Disney dish has 27.

2755
02:01:59,040 --> 02:01:59,840
I believe so.

2756
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:01,720
As my captain, 27 podcasts.

2757
02:02:01,720 --> 02:02:05,160
Yeah. Do you do you feel lazy in comparison?

2758
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:06,520
It makes us feel lazy.

2759
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:11,320
There's a it's such a like, what is the time to do all this?

2760
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:12,240
I don't know.

2761
02:02:12,240 --> 02:02:17,000
It was also what I would say is like it didn't go from one to two to three.

2762
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:19,600
All of a sudden, there's like 12. Yeah, it was wild.

2763
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:23,760
On the same feed, just like you're being pummeled by new podcast every day.

2764
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:27,240
Yeah, it's it's where the words come from, Jim.

2765
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:28,440
Where the words come from.

2766
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:31,200
I mean, the scoops.

2767
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:34,760
I know I'm an introvert like I don't talk this much. Yeah.

2768
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,520
You build it up.

2769
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:40,440
And then you have to site myself up starting Monday for our third

2770
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:42,320
Thursday recording sessions.

2771
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:43,520
Yeah, sure. All right.

2772
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:44,600
Let's do this. Let's do this.

2773
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:46,400
Yeah. Yeah. Running pronunciation.

2774
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:48,240
What's my joke today? What's my joke today?

2775
02:02:48,240 --> 02:02:49,920
I you know, you know what I like?

2776
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:53,200
It's it's nice that they, you know, like everybody else

2777
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:55,480
on these shows, they're they're trying their best.

2778
02:02:55,480 --> 02:02:57,920
But I feel like, you know, I don't think these other co

2779
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:59,440
I don't think they got that Lin magic.

2780
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:01,840
I think you guys are the dynamic doers. Very good.

2781
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:03,960
And I don't know.

2782
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:05,920
You got you. You got to stick together.

2783
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:08,640
I want to say I want to see the pair.

2784
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:09,800
Like Martin and Lewis.

2785
02:03:09,800 --> 02:03:10,800
We got to we got to make this work.

2786
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:13,200
Absolutely. They do. They made it work, right?

2787
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:14,920
Don't tell me.

2788
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:16,960
Yeah, we're fine.

2789
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:18,960
I mean, it's fine.

2790
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:20,080
The great solo.

2791
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:22,800
It's creative partnerships, especially comedian

2792
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:26,400
duos always ends well, always, always, always.

2793
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:28,680
A hundred plus years.

2794
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:30,240
I can't best friends.

2795
02:03:30,240 --> 02:03:32,920
Yes. I can't think of a party.

2796
02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:34,480
Yeah. I like Estella.

2797
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:37,360
Yeah. Yeah. No sad biopics about any of this.

2798
02:03:37,960 --> 02:03:40,120
So let's I guess let's yeah, let's say some like

2799
02:03:40,120 --> 02:03:42,040
let's give our final sort of thoughts.

2800
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:43,800
I mean, there's going to be so many thoughts, but

2801
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:47,000
and then I have a few I guess a couple of questions, just general

2802
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:48,480
theme park questions.

2803
02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:50,280
So like just feeling like

2804
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:53,640
overall your experience with Galaxy's Edge, like

2805
02:03:53,640 --> 02:03:57,240
what meeting expectations like are you thinking more analytically?

2806
02:03:57,240 --> 02:03:59,760
Are you thinking as a fan or are you doing all of it at once?

2807
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:03,080
So I'm trying to think of what the typical theme park guest is going to

2808
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:04,200
going to encounter.

2809
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:07,920
So if they keep the lines like they are, it's run pretty well.

2810
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:11,480
You know, somebody's paying $160 or whatever to get in.

2811
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:14,480
I think if they see both rides

2812
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:17,440
and they get an experience like we had today, I think they'll be absolutely fine

2813
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:18,200
with it.

2814
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:23,080
I expected a little bit more in terms of technology

2815
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:27,040
and a little bit more in terms of

2816
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:28,920
ride quality from this ride.

2817
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:30,720
And again, I had huge hopes for it.

2818
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:32,600
Sure. So so that's fine.

2819
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:36,440
I'll be interested to see what most people think of Falcon.

2820
02:04:37,640 --> 02:04:40,000
You think we get another like mission at some point?

2821
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,280
Do you think there are three apparently?

2822
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:42,520
So we're only getting one right now.

2823
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:43,480
Interesting. Oh, is that right?

2824
02:04:43,480 --> 02:04:44,680
We have. Well, we have one and a half.

2825
02:04:44,680 --> 02:04:47,000
There's apparently an extra 30 seconds of footage that you can

2826
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:49,400
you can enable on this if you if you play it right.

2827
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:50,320
Well, wow.

2828
02:04:50,320 --> 02:04:52,320
More TIE fighters. Oh, interesting.

2829
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:53,600
When do the other ones cycle in?

2830
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:55,480
Do you have any idea the plan?

2831
02:04:55,480 --> 02:04:58,440
Yeah. So it's about from what I understand, it's about halfway through.

2832
02:04:58,600 --> 02:05:02,120
So at one point, I when I was Gunner, I'd shot 11 TIE fighters.

2833
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:04,400
Oh, which I think it wasn't it wasn't bad.

2834
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:06,760
Yeah. My second time out on a ship and I was doing for.

2835
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:07,600
Yeah, that's right.

2836
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:09,320
It was about that. Yeah, it's progress.

2837
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:13,680
But I think that's that if you if you do reasonably well, you get

2838
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:15,320
you get more TIE fighters to shoot at the middle.

2839
02:05:15,320 --> 02:05:16,720
I see. OK. Oh, no kidding.

2840
02:05:16,720 --> 02:05:17,880
All right. So that's good incentive.

2841
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:18,840
That's a good tip for.

2842
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:19,800
I could be totally wrong on that.

2843
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:21,760
That's what I heard. Yeah.

2844
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:23,840
So like looking for

2845
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:27,480
maybe they get maybe they got to crack this right a little bit better.

2846
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:30,160
And but once like if if there's little tweaks to this thing,

2847
02:05:30,160 --> 02:05:32,800
if the resistance is up and running, I think it rises.

2848
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:33,760
Supposed to be the big ride, right?

2849
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:35,640
Yeah, it's supposed to be the major thing. Right.

2850
02:05:36,160 --> 02:05:38,360
So this is this is like the Navi River journey of

2851
02:05:39,400 --> 02:05:41,480
of of Galaxy's Edge. Right.

2852
02:05:41,480 --> 02:05:42,760
And that's fine for what it is. Right.

2853
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:44,240
It's a it's a good ride.

2854
02:05:44,240 --> 02:05:45,720
I thought the merch was all good.

2855
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:47,520
I thought the food was better than I anticipated.

2856
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:50,120
Mm hmm. The Cantina was good.

2857
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:51,920
We'll see about the lightsaber thing tomorrow.

2858
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:54,400
But overall, I mean, I made expectations.

2859
02:05:54,760 --> 02:05:56,520
Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Fantastic. Yeah.

2860
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:57,640
I think I agree with that.

2861
02:05:57,640 --> 02:05:59,200
What else? What else do you want to know from Len?

2862
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:02,880
Oh, well, I guess if you would ever we probably should do in the future,

2863
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:05,800
if you're ever available full on like kind of general interview.

2864
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:09,440
But I just my question actually was because we hear just like about history

2865
02:06:09,440 --> 02:06:12,920
and rumors and stuff, I just was wondering like, what are your favorite rides

2866
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:15,000
at these parks? Like, what do you like the best?

2867
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,560
What is your all time favorite ride or few?

2868
02:06:17,560 --> 02:06:19,640
A couple you don't have to pick one like three or something.

2869
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:20,880
So I'll give you one in each park.

2870
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:23,520
So I'll give you two in Magic Kingdom.

2871
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:25,800
So Pirates is the first ride I ever loved. OK.

2872
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:29,680
And oddly enough, it's Pirates in Florida,

2873
02:06:29,680 --> 02:06:32,280
even though this one is far better here.

2874
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:35,640
So I went on that one on Tuesday.

2875
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:38,600
And I like Splash Mountain quite a bit. OK.

2876
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:40,720
So I like Splash Mountain because it's got sort of everything

2877
02:06:40,720 --> 02:06:43,400
that you want in a theme park. It's got a catchy song.

2878
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:45,840
It's a good ride. It's family friendly.

2879
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:48,120
The ride is long, so you can wait 45 minutes for it.

2880
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:49,640
And I feel like, you know, it's over in a minute.

2881
02:06:49,640 --> 02:06:51,240
Oh, it's not just done. Yeah.

2882
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:53,240
Yeah. The it's funny.

2883
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:55,480
And it's also very it's a big sort of big scope.

2884
02:06:56,360 --> 02:07:01,520
Yeah. You get a big bear, but it wasn't like that in Epcot.

2885
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:05,320
I think Spaceship Earth, I think, is the is still a great ride.

2886
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:07,960
It needs to be updated to something else.

2887
02:07:07,960 --> 02:07:09,200
But I don't know what.

2888
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:11,960
Mm hmm. Do you think what do you think about those rumors

2889
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:14,360
of a two year closure for Spaceship Earth? Whoa.

2890
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:15,720
You think that's happening?

2891
02:07:15,720 --> 02:07:18,040
You know, Jim seems to think that there's going to be an overhaul

2892
02:07:18,160 --> 02:07:19,880
of some kind there.

2893
02:07:19,880 --> 02:07:21,200
You know, it becoming a roller coaster?

2894
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:22,120
No, I don't think it will.

2895
02:07:22,120 --> 02:07:25,360
But but we can do more with communication.

2896
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:28,160
I think actually the thing that needs the most refurbishment in Epcot

2897
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:29,280
is the American adventure.

2898
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,600
And I said this in the book this year.

2899
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:36,000
And it's it's they haven't updated any of the scenes in 40 years.

2900
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:37,840
But think about it.

2901
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:41,480
But think about how our understanding of America has changed in 40 years.

2902
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:43,280
Yeah, how it's changing to two.

2903
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:45,800
In two. It wasn't going to go there in a bit.

2904
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:47,960
In two years. Yeah.

2905
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:51,080
Yeah. The the the last two years have been the longest decade of my life.

2906
02:07:53,240 --> 02:07:55,400
But yeah, but but things have changed, right?

2907
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:57,440
And we don't think about things the same way.

2908
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:59,760
Entertainment doesn't end with Will Rogers. Yeah.

2909
02:08:01,240 --> 02:08:04,440
But you think about like the thing that's great about the ride is its scope, right?

2910
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:06,320
It's massive show sets.

2911
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:09,400
But it's also its weakness because you can't update those things, right?

2912
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:11,960
You're not going to bring down American Adventure for a year

2913
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:15,000
while you update two scenes. Right.

2914
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:18,000
So I think there's that in the studios.

2915
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:21,200
I don't think there's anything great like Toy Story Mania.

2916
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:22,760
I think it's fine.

2917
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:25,000
But a lot of studio stuff needs to be redone.

2918
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:26,440
Even Tower of Terror.

2919
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:29,400
Tower of Terror is probably one of the best rides.

2920
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:33,600
But it's it's a very fancy drop shaft.

2921
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:35,280
Right. Right.

2922
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:37,240
They do parts of it really, really well.

2923
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:38,080
I don't know.

2924
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:41,160
We'll see what happens when when Rise of the Resistance opens there.

2925
02:08:41,160 --> 02:08:42,080
That might be my favorite.

2926
02:08:42,080 --> 02:08:45,640
That's in play. Mickey Mini Railway seems like I'm so looking forward to that.

2927
02:08:45,640 --> 02:08:47,480
Have you guys seen the cartoons? Yeah, they're great.

2928
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:48,520
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2929
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:52,040
So that's a 3600 people an hour to I think that's going to move some people through.

2930
02:08:52,120 --> 02:08:56,360
Hey, should be the highest capacity Disney ride ever built ever.

2931
02:08:56,360 --> 02:08:58,440
Really? Really? No kidding. Great.

2932
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:00,400
And you just framed 3000 for us.

2933
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:04,040
So everyone from 3600, I think, is is what I'm saying.

2934
02:09:04,120 --> 02:09:06,640
Everyone they let in to go into Galaxy's Edge would all fit.

2935
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:08,520
Or in an hour instead of an hour.

2936
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:09,440
Crazy. Wow. Yeah.

2937
02:09:09,440 --> 02:09:12,480
But I think I think Mickey Mini is runaway railway is going to be a sleeper

2938
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:13,760
hit for the studios.

2939
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:14,600
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2940
02:09:14,600 --> 02:09:17,320
Where it's not going to be like build in a blockbuster way like Galaxy's Edge.

2941
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:18,520
But I heard the technology is good.

2942
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:21,920
Yeah. The video, the projection looks good.

2943
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:24,160
Cool. So that's cool.

2944
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:27,440
And then Animal Kingdom, I like the Killmonger surprise is good.

2945
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:31,360
And I'm not a huge fan of Flooded Passage, but it's done well.

2946
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:33,360
Yeah. Sure. Sure.

2947
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:34,280
Yeah. Those things.

2948
02:09:34,280 --> 02:09:36,040
You never got a Hard Rock Park, did you?

2949
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:38,000
Hard Rock Park.

2950
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:41,160
Yeah. You know, there was when there's a Hard Rock Cafe theme park in Myrtle Beach.

2951
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:43,760
No, I miss there.

2952
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:46,200
And you're more if you're an Eagles life in the fast lane guy.

2953
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:48,680
I was up on the ride guy.

2954
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:50,080
Just thought I'd check.

2955
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:51,480
Did you miss that park existing?

2956
02:09:51,480 --> 02:09:52,920
And I missed the entire thing.

2957
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:54,080
I would think you might be interested.

2958
02:09:54,080 --> 02:09:56,000
Take a look. It's unbelievable.

2959
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:57,160
Oh, unbelievable.

2960
02:09:57,160 --> 02:09:59,160
Like like I can't believe I've seen this.

2961
02:09:59,160 --> 02:10:03,080
Like the university's retrospective is 10 parts long

2962
02:10:03,920 --> 02:10:06,200
and multi page 10 part posts.

2963
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:09,840
Every statue is there's a story like you have to like stop

2964
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:12,640
and talk about every sign that was up, you know, where they had a sign

2965
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:16,720
that said free air guitars and then it was a rack that was just blank.

2966
02:10:17,160 --> 02:10:18,640
You know, great stuff like that.

2967
02:10:18,640 --> 02:10:21,600
But it was like six months.

2968
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:22,920
Six months or something.

2969
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:26,400
Like 2008, right before financial recession.

2970
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:27,400
That was it.

2971
02:10:27,400 --> 02:10:28,720
It's open up a theme park.

2972
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:30,200
Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

2973
02:10:30,200 --> 02:10:32,040
No, I'll have to look at this one.

2974
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:34,440
I feel like there was like in retrospect, like that you had done

2975
02:10:34,440 --> 02:10:36,960
an unofficial guide to Hard Rock Park.

2976
02:10:37,320 --> 02:10:40,040
It just said it was 300 pages and they were all blank except for the first one

2977
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:41,480
that said don't go.

2978
02:10:41,480 --> 02:10:42,320
I've actually done that.

2979
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:43,760
I've done that ride review before.

2980
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:45,840
It was a yeah, there was a ride in

2981
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:50,080
Thorpe Park, I think, in England.

2982
02:10:50,160 --> 02:10:53,520
Oh, and it was a ride called, I think, No Exit.

2983
02:10:53,560 --> 02:10:56,520
And it was this idea that you were trapped in a computer virus

2984
02:10:57,040 --> 02:11:02,280
and sort of like imagine a really bad indoor, small, slow version

2985
02:11:02,280 --> 02:11:03,920
of Space Mountain.

2986
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:05,560
OK, slow Space.

2987
02:11:05,560 --> 02:11:08,120
Slow, I can slow back, slow to backwards.

2988
02:11:08,760 --> 02:11:12,520
So my my ride review was like, you know, like, you know, what is it?

2989
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:14,000
It's an indoor roller coaster ride.

2990
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:18,200
When to go. And I said when to go is if there's a lightning storm outside,

2991
02:11:18,200 --> 02:11:21,800
you've recently renounced God and there's no other shelter to to find.

2992
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,320
So it's probably similar to a lot of the rides at Hard Rock Park.

2993
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:27,400
Yeah. Yeah.

2994
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:28,640
I would assume.

2995
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:30,480
If you guys want to do

2996
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:34,400
a whole gym, you and Jim want to do a whole Hard Rock Park series.

2997
02:11:34,600 --> 02:11:36,880
We'll feel free. We can help you out with that.

2998
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:38,520
We're ourselves experts at this point.

2999
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:39,680
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

3000
02:11:39,680 --> 02:11:43,120
You know, experience nostalgia for a place we've never been.

3001
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:47,240
The chronological Hard Rock Park series.

3002
02:11:47,240 --> 02:11:48,800
Yes. Please.

3003
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:50,400
This would be over.

3004
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:52,640
It's like six years to finish that seven years.

3005
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:55,680
We were confused why it just like went away.

3006
02:11:55,760 --> 02:11:59,240
Why like like you just didn't do one for like a couple of years.

3007
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:00,800
Yeah, we sort of got on.

3008
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:02,960
We got on the the unbuilt Disney track.

3009
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:06,760
Right. So have you seen the the Buzz Price archives over in Orlando?

3010
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:09,040
I've heard you bring this.

3011
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:13,080
Oh, I forget the the but it's OK.

3012
02:12:13,080 --> 02:12:16,280
There's like there are plans for and concept art for things that were never.

3013
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:21,200
It's like 200 moving boxes of Disney history going back to now pre-Disneyland.

3014
02:12:21,240 --> 02:12:23,640
Right. Right. That's just fantastic research stuff.

3015
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:28,440
I mean, several moving boxes full of like the actual plans for Epcot with the roof.

3016
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:30,680
And man, it was supposed to be a city. Right.

3017
02:12:30,680 --> 02:12:34,320
You know, but they feel like you're the plans that we're giving to,

3018
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:37,640
you know, housing and urban development or whatever, you know, government agency.

3019
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:39,240
We need to talk to about this.

3020
02:12:39,240 --> 02:12:41,360
And yeah, I mean, they had everything planned out.

3021
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:45,880
So if you want to go, if you want to find theme park related, the memos.

3022
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:48,160
Oh, yeah. Then these archives are the place.

3023
02:12:48,400 --> 02:12:49,520
I mean, stuff you've never seen before.

3024
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:50,960
Concept art you've never seen before.

3025
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:54,960
That was, you know, that Buzz had because he got it from the Imagineers that drew it.

3026
02:12:55,200 --> 02:12:57,280
Like, I'll put this in my living room. Great.

3027
02:12:57,280 --> 02:13:00,400
And the reason why it's in the the archives is apparently had to take photos of it

3028
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:02,040
for insurance purposes.

3029
02:13:02,040 --> 02:13:04,400
So the photos, the photos became part of the archives.

3030
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:08,120
Well, we'll be doing more of those on built.

3031
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:11,320
I think so. We have to find a little bit more, a little bit more material.

3032
02:13:11,320 --> 02:13:13,240
But we think we have a little more we can do. Yeah.

3033
02:13:13,240 --> 02:13:16,520
OK. Yeah, those are I mean, those are some of my favorite.

3034
02:13:17,120 --> 02:13:18,400
Sure. Very exciting.

3035
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:22,840
You wouldn't give that no exit review to anything in the in the Disney realm,

3036
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:28,040
would you? I actually said that the Disney Pixar short film festival

3037
02:13:28,360 --> 02:13:32,640
wasn't something that you sure you needed to go see.

3038
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:35,960
And I mean, fast pass for that is just pulling up YouTube on your.

3039
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:37,400
That's exactly what I said.

3040
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:40,520
I said in the book, I'm like, let me give you the links in the book.

3041
02:13:40,520 --> 02:13:41,760
So all of the YouTube videos.

3042
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:44,560
So you don't have to go do this when you're paying, you know,

3043
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:46,280
$10 an hour per person to be in the park.

3044
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:48,280
We sure God don't.

3045
02:13:48,280 --> 02:13:52,560
But we get feedback from people like, oh, it was my favorite part of the day in Epcot.

3046
02:13:53,080 --> 02:13:54,680
Let me tell you what that says about Epcot, lady,

3047
02:13:54,680 --> 02:13:58,560
because it doesn't say anything about the about the quality of the films.

3048
02:13:58,560 --> 02:14:02,520
Right. You might love all of those short films, but they don't belong in that park.

3049
02:14:02,520 --> 02:14:06,320
Is there is there a most shocking thing you've like a consensus

3050
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:10,040
that you hear from people that shocks you like everyone loves something like that

3051
02:14:10,040 --> 02:14:12,400
versus like what you feel or?

3052
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:15,040
I mean, generally the.

3053
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:19,600
The the readers have a pretty good sense of what's good value for money.

3054
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:22,600
The one thing I think that, like, I personally disagree on

3055
02:14:22,840 --> 02:14:25,880
and I realize this is just me, so it's not the readers are right

3056
02:14:25,880 --> 02:14:27,280
and I am wrong when I say this.

3057
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:29,560
I don't think California Grill is all that good.

3058
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:30,800
Oh, interesting.

3059
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:33,240
The contemporary contemporary in Walt Disney World.

3060
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:34,920
I don't think it's worth the money.

3061
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:37,680
I've never had a truly fantastic meal there.

3062
02:14:38,040 --> 02:14:41,640
Whereas like if you tell me like Gico, I've had many great meals at Gico.

3063
02:14:41,680 --> 02:14:44,920
OK, Victoria and Albert's, of course, everyone you can you can always eat good there.

3064
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:47,720
But like and unlike when it used to be the top of the world,

3065
02:14:47,720 --> 02:14:50,720
now you can't see like a concert from Helen Ready up there.

3066
02:14:51,560 --> 02:14:54,120
Those they were groovy, weren't they?

3067
02:14:54,120 --> 02:14:57,560
With the outfits, bright orange shag in the wall.

3068
02:14:57,560 --> 02:14:59,480
Yeah. And somebody was playing guitar.

3069
02:14:59,480 --> 02:15:02,920
And I'm like, this is why are we not doing residencies?

3070
02:15:02,920 --> 02:15:04,240
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

3071
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:06,200
From raw. Why are we?

3072
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:07,560
Yeah. Why are we not doing this anymore?

3073
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:08,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

3074
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,000
All right. Make it a review.

3075
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:11,760
And that's the way we yeah.

3076
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:13,800
Get us in there. We'll do live podcasts.

3077
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:15,280
So California. Yeah, I don't think it's that.

3078
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:17,000
Is that great? Gotcha. OK.

3079
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:17,960
Well, all right.

3080
02:15:17,960 --> 02:15:20,120
Well, controversies abound.

3081
02:15:20,120 --> 02:15:21,920
And I say, I know it's me.

3082
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:25,440
Right. But generally, but generally speaking, you dug Galaxy's Edge

3083
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:27,960
and we dug talking to you about Galaxy's Edge.

3084
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:30,920
And when test, you survived podcast, the ride.

3085
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:32,880
Thank you so much for doing it.

3086
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:35,240
And I mean, what's there so much for you to promote?

3087
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:39,480
But what is the main thing our listeners should leave listening to this and check out?

3088
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:42,160
You can read my books. It's the unofficial guide series.

3089
02:15:42,160 --> 02:15:43,160
You can get them on Amazon.

3090
02:15:43,160 --> 02:15:44,640
Unofficial guide.

3091
02:15:45,680 --> 02:15:47,320
I also run touring plans dot com.

3092
02:15:47,320 --> 02:15:50,920
So we need help planning your trip to Disney World or Disneyland.

3093
02:15:50,920 --> 02:15:52,640
Touring plans dot com can help.

3094
02:15:52,640 --> 02:15:54,960
And then listen to our podcast with Jim Hill.

3095
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:56,960
It's the Disney dish dot band camp dot com.

3096
02:15:56,960 --> 02:15:59,080
One of Jim Hill's podcast.

3097
02:15:59,080 --> 02:16:00,960
One of Jim Hill's many, many podcasts.

3098
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:03,120
The first one of the first number one.

3099
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:04,680
Yes, the flagship, the flagship.

3100
02:16:04,680 --> 02:16:05,600
Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3101
02:16:05,600 --> 02:16:07,040
The great Florida.

3102
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:09,280
Absolutely. I could agree on that.

3103
02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:11,360
Awesome. Thanks so much, Lynn. Thanks.

3104
02:16:11,360 --> 02:16:12,640
Wow. There you go.

3105
02:16:12,640 --> 02:16:14,480
There you have it.

3106
02:16:14,480 --> 02:16:19,800
Extra info about logistics and numbers, attendance figures,

3107
02:16:19,800 --> 02:16:23,160
the fencing in Disneyland, which I actually forgot to look at.

3108
02:16:23,160 --> 02:16:24,560
Oh, we didn't go to the fence.

3109
02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:28,600
We didn't drag our walk arounds that the characters are just going about their day.

3110
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:31,760
I thought that was very interesting.

3111
02:16:31,760 --> 02:16:36,120
We got down to the bottom of the Jim Hill Media Podcast Network Consortium.

3112
02:16:36,520 --> 02:16:38,760
We found out a little more what's going on over there.

3113
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:40,080
So a very productive visit.

3114
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:44,200
Very productive. Thank you, Lynn Testa for having us to his hotel room.

3115
02:16:44,640 --> 02:16:47,000
His spotless organized hotel room.

3116
02:16:48,120 --> 02:16:51,520
We also had an office like he was there for days.

3117
02:16:51,520 --> 02:16:52,200
He was working.

3118
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:54,880
He was the hardest working man in like theme park,

3119
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:56,960
very nice or whatever you would call it.

3120
02:16:56,960 --> 02:16:59,760
Theme park publishing, theme park analytics.

3121
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:01,400
I think all of those things apply to him.

3122
02:17:01,400 --> 02:17:04,440
We had so many icons over these last few days.

3123
02:17:04,480 --> 02:17:07,600
Jason met Shubhaka and we all met.

3124
02:17:08,120 --> 02:17:10,520
We all met Lynn Testa.

3125
02:17:10,520 --> 02:17:14,360
So I think like to wrap up, like we're going to be going, obviously again,

3126
02:17:14,360 --> 02:17:16,600
what are we looking forward to now?

3127
02:17:16,600 --> 02:17:17,560
What are we going to do?

3128
02:17:17,560 --> 02:17:19,840
Which is a way? What is the way to tackle it next?

3129
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:21,360
Like, I will start.

3130
02:17:21,360 --> 02:17:25,640
I want to figure out what the best view of the land is.

3131
02:17:25,640 --> 02:17:27,840
What is the most beautiful view of the land?

3132
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:33,280
Like we talk about Cars Land, that entrance over by the of the wharf

3133
02:17:33,680 --> 02:17:37,080
is the most beautiful view of Ornament Valley.

3134
02:17:37,400 --> 02:17:41,200
I'm interested now in kind of looking and seeing through the different

3135
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:44,360
archways and the different spots you can look at.

3136
02:17:44,560 --> 02:17:47,200
What's like the cool view they made up?

3137
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:50,880
Obviously, we know like the Millennium Falcon where that's parked is very, very cool.

3138
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:52,560
But like, what is like the epic?

3139
02:17:52,560 --> 02:17:54,400
What's the most epic of all the views?

3140
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:55,440
I'm interested in that.

3141
02:17:55,440 --> 02:17:58,600
I'm interested in seeing how they design that and paying more attention

3142
02:17:58,600 --> 02:18:00,200
to like that stuff.

3143
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:01,360
When I go there next.

3144
02:18:01,400 --> 02:18:03,320
Impact that my next visit is at night.

3145
02:18:03,320 --> 02:18:05,960
I'm really excited to see at night.

3146
02:18:05,960 --> 02:18:08,720
I was very happy with the smoked Kadoo ribs,

3147
02:18:08,960 --> 02:18:12,000
but I'm also maybe going to switch next if I eat there again,

3148
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,760
I might switch over to the the fried yip yip.

3149
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:19,720
I'm going to switch over to the red, the imperial imperial red.

3150
02:18:20,840 --> 02:18:23,280
So give that a shot.

3151
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:25,480
You know, I think I think we've

3152
02:18:25,480 --> 02:18:28,000
of course, in a mega episode, we've maybe given the Falcon shirt

3153
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,680
end of the stick. We had some complaints.

3154
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:32,120
I have a lot of very good things to say about the Falcon 2,

3155
02:18:32,120 --> 02:18:34,400
and I'm interested to crack it better.

3156
02:18:34,400 --> 02:18:37,120
I didn't get to pilot it, although I think I'd be terrible at it.

3157
02:18:37,320 --> 02:18:40,600
I do think that there I think I can't write this thing off.

3158
02:18:40,600 --> 02:18:46,200
I can't say that it's like a just OK attraction because the lead up is so fantastic.

3159
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:50,640
And I think there's a way to make that to get more accustomed to it,

3160
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:55,000
for it to be a little less stressful and to maximize your Falcon experience.

3161
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:58,760
And if what Lynn says is true and there are future expeditions coming,

3162
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:01,960
I just I want to end up loving the Falcon.

3163
02:19:01,960 --> 02:19:03,480
And I think I think I will.

3164
02:19:03,480 --> 02:19:04,680
Yeah, I think that's right.

3165
02:19:04,680 --> 02:19:08,160
I want to give a shout out to the cast member who the one time we did the Falcon

3166
02:19:08,960 --> 02:19:12,320
and kind of banged it up a bit and the lights were like

3167
02:19:12,320 --> 02:19:15,760
glitching on purpose as we were leaving, we said, wow, we really

3168
02:19:16,320 --> 02:19:20,120
did a number of the Falcon and the cast members coming from backstage area

3169
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:24,000
without missing a beat went, you did what to the Falcon?

3170
02:19:24,960 --> 02:19:27,160
Like, Honda is not going to be happy.

3171
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:30,280
Like played, played the reality. Wow.

3172
02:19:30,480 --> 02:19:32,960
Oh, yeah. And there was that also just I forget to mention

3173
02:19:32,960 --> 02:19:35,040
there was a cast member who was we were walking.

3174
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:38,120
He goes, all right, be Lilo, the First Order here.

3175
02:19:38,160 --> 02:19:41,320
So don't do it like he was really very good.

3176
02:19:42,640 --> 02:19:44,400
Sort of fun little bit there.

3177
02:19:44,400 --> 02:19:48,080
So that's great. I have to say, yeah, I feel like I barely

3178
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:50,880
scratch the surface on treats and eats.

3179
02:19:50,880 --> 02:19:52,040
I want to walk around more.

3180
02:19:52,040 --> 02:19:55,040
And I think a thing to do while I walk around, I didn't really fiddle

3181
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:58,920
with the play Disney Parks data pad experience.

3182
02:19:58,960 --> 02:20:00,640
There's a lot of stuff to scan.

3183
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:03,480
Yeah. Yeah.

3184
02:20:03,480 --> 02:20:06,200
One of the summer who we were with was doing it a lot more.

3185
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:08,520
And she had like by the end,

3186
02:20:08,840 --> 02:20:13,080
gotten a reputation, gotten weapons and clothing.

3187
02:20:13,360 --> 02:20:14,800
So like, I think there's a lot.

3188
02:20:14,800 --> 02:20:16,840
There's a lot of frequencies you can tune into.

3189
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:18,320
She was like texting with Honda.

3190
02:20:18,320 --> 02:20:20,400
She was texting with Honda.

3191
02:20:20,400 --> 02:20:24,120
And it seems like the quote, unquote,

3192
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:28,560
when your reputation follows you is they're kind of tracking it through Bluetooth.

3193
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:30,720
It asks you to have Bluetooth on the whole time.

3194
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:33,120
So that way you can go into things

3195
02:20:34,120 --> 02:20:37,760
because we were speculating because the one time the last time we went back,

3196
02:20:38,280 --> 02:20:41,520
one of the times we went back to the Falcon, we got like a different video

3197
02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:43,760
where they're like, you're back. Yeah.

3198
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:45,880
Which they may have figured that out through Bluetooth.

3199
02:20:45,880 --> 02:20:48,560
So I'm curious about that. Right. Right.

3200
02:20:49,800 --> 02:20:52,480
I you know, it's maybe a good next goal for me.

3201
02:20:52,840 --> 02:20:56,520
I did my morning wine in the in the cantina.

3202
02:20:56,720 --> 02:20:59,320
I want to see what happens if you get kicked out of the cantina.

3203
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:02,200
Because my next slot is the end slot.

3204
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:04,720
It's a 12 p.m.

3205
02:21:04,720 --> 02:21:08,400
I want to see if I if I won't leave, if I say, keep them coming.

3206
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,840
More frog eggs, please. More frog egg juice.

3207
02:21:11,840 --> 02:21:13,080
I'm not getting out of here.

3208
02:21:13,080 --> 02:21:14,720
You want to be like, make a scene.

3209
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:17,880
Will somebody like pick me up and throw me out?

3210
02:21:18,040 --> 02:21:19,520
Hmm. I wonder.

3211
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:21,480
I wonder what would happen if you did that at Carthay.

3212
02:21:23,240 --> 02:21:24,280
Whatever would be much different.

3213
02:21:24,280 --> 02:21:26,880
It might be less comical.

3214
02:21:26,880 --> 02:21:29,960
They'll send out that that big, tall 40s goofy

3215
02:21:31,080 --> 02:21:33,440
that singer with the blackjack.

3216
02:21:33,440 --> 02:21:35,400
Yes, with a big comical blackjack.

3217
02:21:35,400 --> 02:21:37,280
That is practical. Yeah.

3218
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:41,760
What I want to look at, and I don't know that I will purchase it,

3219
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:46,360
but I just need to take a look at that gold bust of Plo Koon,

3220
02:21:47,080 --> 02:21:51,000
the Sith character Plo Koon that supposedly is sold in Dock

3221
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,560
on Dar. Yeah.

3222
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:53,840
I got to take a look at it.

3223
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:55,640
I shouldn't buy it.

3224
02:21:55,640 --> 02:21:58,760
But my irony poisoning makes me want it.

3225
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:03,560
Who is the other prequel item that there is a Mace Windu one too, I think.

3226
02:22:03,720 --> 02:22:05,000
Yeah. Fuck Mace Windu.

3227
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:09,280
I want Plo Koon, the famous prequel's character Plo Koon.

3228
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:11,360
And I want to take a look at it and I want to assess it.

3229
02:22:11,360 --> 02:22:13,840
I don't know how much it is. Do we know how much it is?

3230
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:15,560
No, I think we can find out, though.

3231
02:22:15,560 --> 02:22:16,960
I bet we can find out.

3232
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:20,480
I think people have been cataloging every item for sale.

3233
02:22:20,560 --> 02:22:21,640
You know what? I actually don't want it.

3234
02:22:21,640 --> 02:22:23,920
I'm going very soon. I don't want to know.

3235
02:22:23,920 --> 02:22:25,600
I want to figure it out.

3236
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:27,200
Let the Force guide you.

3237
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:27,960
I'll see if the Force...

3238
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:28,960
To Plo Koon.

3239
02:22:28,960 --> 02:22:31,840
If the Force tells me to purchase Plo Koon, I may.

3240
02:22:32,240 --> 02:22:34,400
We'll see. We'll see what will happen.

3241
02:22:34,400 --> 02:22:35,760
Something tells me it might.

3242
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:38,200
It might. Your midichlorian count's strong enough.

3243
02:22:38,200 --> 02:22:39,920
I'm curious to see what happens, though,

3244
02:22:39,920 --> 02:22:43,120
because the next few weeks with the reservations,

3245
02:22:43,120 --> 02:22:46,680
there are time slots where there's a two hour crossover

3246
02:22:46,680 --> 02:22:49,680
with the different two different parties as opposed to one hour.

3247
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:51,760
I'm curious to see how that affects everything.

3248
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:53,680
We'll see. I guess we'll hear about it.

3249
02:22:53,680 --> 02:22:56,000
I would think if anything was going to go bad,

3250
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:56,960
it would have been this weekend.

3251
02:22:56,960 --> 02:22:58,920
And it seems like this weekend went great.

3252
02:22:58,920 --> 02:22:59,680
Yeah. Wow.

3253
02:22:59,680 --> 02:23:02,480
It certainly did for us personally.

3254
02:23:02,480 --> 02:23:05,920
And I hope it was great for you to listen to us

3255
02:23:05,920 --> 02:23:10,160
have a good time in a place that you maybe couldn't get to.

3256
02:23:10,720 --> 02:23:13,520
I hope listening to it was just as fun as being there.

3257
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:15,320
Yeah. I can tell you that it wasn't.

3258
02:23:15,320 --> 02:23:17,160
That's the number one thing I can see.

3259
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:20,560
Like, I'm still I've been watching videos ever since we left.

3260
02:23:20,880 --> 02:23:24,320
Videos don't tell you it's it's all that stuff.

3261
02:23:24,320 --> 02:23:26,560
It's atmosphere, it sounds, it smells.

3262
02:23:27,520 --> 02:23:30,040
Watching that ride doesn't tell you because, OK, right.

3263
02:23:30,160 --> 02:23:33,760
Like are the graphics like is it a little video gamey on the ride once in a while?

3264
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:37,120
Sure. But you don't you have like the feeling of hitting a button and then you

3265
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:41,480
like it, you hit a button and then the whole thing shakes in a crazy way.

3266
02:23:41,480 --> 02:23:43,920
Or that it's you you're making it all happen.

3267
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:45,240
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

3268
02:23:45,240 --> 02:23:46,720
You got to be at a whole another level.

3269
02:23:46,720 --> 02:23:48,960
Yeah. From just seeing because I saw like

3270
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:53,360
I won't say who was already trying to make the Millennium Falcon

3271
02:23:53,360 --> 02:23:55,680
ride a disaster of our friends.

3272
02:23:55,720 --> 02:24:00,640
You won't say which podcasting, which which peer one

3273
02:24:00,640 --> 02:24:05,360
luminary, one partner, one which IP hating

3274
02:24:06,600 --> 02:24:10,320
podcaster has it all for D-boy.

3275
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:13,600
I don't want to be specific here, but which one?

3276
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:16,360
Imagine what that stands for stuck in development.

3277
02:24:16,520 --> 02:24:19,200
He sees a person development system.

3278
02:24:19,360 --> 02:24:20,160
That's what we'll say.

3279
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:23,840
But he was already trying to sort of paint that as a big disaster.

3280
02:24:24,120 --> 02:24:28,520
And I did say, like, if you watch the video, there's a lot more glare on the Falcons,

3281
02:24:28,520 --> 02:24:30,800
like screen in the cockpit.

3282
02:24:30,800 --> 02:24:33,920
And I was like, I can see where you like it looks maybe a little cheapy,

3283
02:24:33,920 --> 02:24:36,440
but it really it being in there is a much different experience.

3284
02:24:36,440 --> 02:24:39,920
Let's remember, too, that is technically the D ticket ride.

3285
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:41,440
The ticket isn't even open yet.

3286
02:24:41,440 --> 02:24:46,160
Yes. Also, the ride we need to remember that a whole and a whole copy

3287
02:24:46,160 --> 02:24:49,040
of this land coming to Florida.

3288
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:50,720
Yeah. Yeah.

3289
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:53,560
And Florida people were here watching how everything was going.

3290
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:56,160
So they can that's their little cheat sheet.

3291
02:24:56,160 --> 02:24:58,720
So presumably, Florida will also go smooth.

3292
02:24:58,840 --> 02:25:03,600
Yeah. Once that ride, I keep forgetting that there's oh, the best part of it is an open

3293
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,200
yeah, I like times 100.

3294
02:25:06,200 --> 02:25:08,720
Supposedly the best part is not open yet.

3295
02:25:08,720 --> 02:25:13,000
And I can't like I I kind of like that they didn't open it yet.

3296
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:14,520
I kind of like that we got more.

3297
02:25:14,520 --> 02:25:16,440
And it's kind of fun to get me to renew my pet.

3298
02:25:16,440 --> 02:25:17,440
My pass is going to be up.

3299
02:25:17,440 --> 02:25:19,440
I'm going to have to go on that ride.

3300
02:25:19,440 --> 02:25:21,480
There's no way you can't. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

3301
02:25:21,480 --> 02:25:23,800
They got me. I'm so screwed.

3302
02:25:23,800 --> 02:25:25,960
We're all going to spend so much goddamn money.

3303
02:25:25,960 --> 02:25:29,160
We already have like, yeah, it's.

3304
02:25:29,160 --> 02:25:32,920
Well, we'll get to see how all this architecture holds up to hurricane

3305
02:25:33,400 --> 02:25:37,400
conditions when the Florida version opens kind of in the middle

3306
02:25:37,400 --> 02:25:41,040
start of hurricane season. Oh, no, it's all going to blow away.

3307
02:25:41,160 --> 02:25:45,360
It's all going to blow away and then rearrange itself.

3308
02:25:45,360 --> 02:25:47,480
And spires are millennia old.

3309
02:25:47,480 --> 02:25:49,800
So hopefully they would stand.

3310
02:25:49,800 --> 02:25:52,280
Hopefully they stand strong.

3311
02:25:52,280 --> 02:25:55,800
Well, hey, folks, you survived podcast, the ride supersized

3312
02:25:56,080 --> 02:26:00,200
the galaxy's edge edition, almost as long as a window

3313
02:26:00,440 --> 02:26:02,800
of time in which you could be in the land.

3314
02:26:03,560 --> 02:26:06,880
Now, if you have we called for questions on Twitter

3315
02:26:06,880 --> 02:26:10,400
and we couldn't fit them into this episode, but head over to Patreon.com

3316
02:26:10,400 --> 02:26:12,800
slash podcast, the ride, and we will put up.

3317
02:26:12,800 --> 02:26:17,200
We will do a podcast, the right post office devoted to your questions

3318
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:21,920
and anything that we missed about galaxy's edge and keep throwing questions at us

3319
02:26:21,920 --> 02:26:24,480
because we'll probably we're hey, we're going to milk galaxy's edge.

3320
02:26:24,480 --> 02:26:28,640
We're going to blue milk it for all of the content that we possibly can.

3321
02:26:29,640 --> 02:26:31,520
And that regular stuff, too.

3322
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:33,680

3324
02:26:37,360 --> 02:26:42,520

3325
02:26:42,520 --> 02:26:46,080
at our hundredth episode. Oh, my God. Yeah.

3326
02:26:46,440 --> 02:26:47,800
There's a few tickets left.

3327
02:26:47,800 --> 02:26:51,480
So if you're hearing this and you want to go and maybe on the fence,

3328
02:26:51,800 --> 02:26:53,320
I would buy now. Yeah.

3329
02:26:53,320 --> 02:26:55,040
A couple left. Give it a shot.

3330
02:26:55,040 --> 02:26:58,240
No promises. But yeah, yeah.

3331
02:26:58,240 --> 02:26:59,360
I think I mean, I should check.

3332
02:26:59,360 --> 02:27:05,520
But maybe you can smuggle some tickets out of the dynasty typewriter dot com.

3333
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,120
And yeah, but otherwise, we'll see you there.

It's been great. Yes, it has.

3337
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,800
It's been as fun as riding a caddo.

3338
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:20,120
Yeah. May May not bright suns.

3339
02:27:20,120 --> 02:27:23,600
We have to say this. May the spires keep you or.

3340
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:25,600
Yeah. OK.

3341
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:27,480
I think you're right.

3342
02:27:27,480 --> 02:27:29,480
May the force be with you. All right. Sure. It's still that.
