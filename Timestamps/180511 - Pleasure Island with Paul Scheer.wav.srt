00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
Tonight, a once-in-a-lifetime podcast party that spills out into the streets.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,960
Every minute of this episode is a New Year's Eve celebration featuring heel kickin' country,

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,360
cool jazz, madcap explorers, and the funmeister of podcasting himself, Mr. Paul Scheer.

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:45,960
It's Pleasure Island on Podcast the Ride in three, two, fun!

5
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,800
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three men who despite not

6
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,680
having children still possess strong opinions on the best diaper changing station in Disneyland.

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,960
Joining me is all, I'm Mike Carlson first of all, joining me as always Scott Gardner.

8
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,200
Hello, too crowded in Adventureland, you gotta go deeper into the park.

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,400
It's Tomorrowland I think, because it's that bathroom in the very back by the Autopia.

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,360
Well Adventureland bothers me, you're saying Tomorrowland is the good one or the bad one?

11
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,720
I'm saying that's the good one, yeah yeah.

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
Oh okay sure.

13
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,720
So, also Jason Sheridan is here.

14
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,280
Yeah I'd have to agree with the Tomorrowland one, that bathroom's nice, kinda out of the

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,040
way, it's the opposite of the New Orleans square one, which is like a dead end and there's

16
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,320
a lot of traffic back up and constantly construction there for some reason.

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,880
I'm glad we're in concert with this.

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,800
Let's bring our guest in for his opinion on the best diaper changing station at Disneyland

19
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,480
from the upcoming podcast Unspooled.

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,600
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Paul Scheer!

21
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,120
As someone who has children, I will say that I have an issue with the changing tables in

22
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,760
all of Disneyland and I think they are too small.

23
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,800
I have two children and they do not fit on those changing tables.

24
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:57,760
I have to cram them in there, it's like a very small trunk that I'm trying to pack for

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,520
a very long vacation, putting my child in there, legs are going up, I have no room for

26
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,160
my gear, my wipes, everything.

27
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
It's a real mess.

28
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,400
It looks great, not functional.

29
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,080
Wow, and it's a length issue.

30
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,320
My kids are not abnormally long, I don't have very tall children.

31
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,280
I have average sized children.

32
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,920
And also, it's made of concrete.

33
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,640
It's made of a very hard substance.

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,080
It's not like when you go to like, or at least the ones I've been to, because I feel like

35
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,320
I'm looking at your face and you don't look, when I go to normal bathrooms, it's like a

36
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,880
pull down thing, it's a little bit of plastic, it's not hard concrete.

37
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,880
I feel like I'm changing.

38
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,480
Is it like marble surfaces?

39
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes, it looks very nice.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,220
I don't want to change my child on marble.

41
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,800
It's not good for someone who is not cool with me changing their diaper and their heads are

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,520
whipping around on marble.

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:58,060
It is, anytime I have to change my kids, not only one of them, it gives me way too much

44
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,060
anxiety in there.

45
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,640
Yeah, if there's like a jerk of the head and they slam backwards.

46
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,640
Yeah, it's too much.

47
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,280
That's the way I broke my arm.

48
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,840
The only serious injury I've had was slipping on a marble floor and falling backwards and

49
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,840
broke my, in New York City, and then I had to like do all the New York tours with a broken

50
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
arm.

51
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,080
The first I was ever in Studio 8H or the former Conan Studio, I was like, yeah, I was a little

52
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,080
dork and a sling.

53
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,840
So you had your arm treated in New York?

54
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,720
Yeah, or actually, wait, no, nothing had happened in New York and then we went to Boston, the

55
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,480
best children's hospital in the country, apparently, so I lucked out.

56
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,760
But yeah, but marble and child dialing, it does everything, moves every which way.

57
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,400
I'm demonstrating now.

58
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,520
But yeah, keep kids away from marble and when wetness.

59
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,560
Like Walt Disney probably, like he changed his children on marble.

60
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,280
Like there's a generation that changed children on a marble surface and they lament the loss

61
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,960
of this as a character building moment in most kids' life, I think.

62
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,880
But now, like playgrounds and parks, everything's like shredded rubber, right?

63
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,560
Everything's like really cushioned.

64
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah, I mean, you think I am a ball of anxiety with my kids at these parks.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,240
Everything is there to hurt them in some way or at a certain point.

66
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,920
Then they get to an age where then they're not hurt.

67
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,040
But at this age, I'm at I'm a four and one and a half year old.

68
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,040
Like there's too many.

69
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,880
Yeah, even though it's hard rubber, they can still fall.

70
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,880
They can still get it.

71
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,560
I'm here to say as a man with a child who's been to Disney World now, there's issues.

72
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
There are issues.

73
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,080
But you bring them over to that Pluto's house and it's great.

74
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,080
Great time.

75
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,080
Well, that's good.

76
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,080
What ages are the two?

77
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
What age?

78
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,080
Four and one and a half.

79
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,760
So I spent, I spent spending a lot more time recently.

80
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,080
I don't bring the one and a half year old.

81
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
Yeah, yeah.

82
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
What's a waste?

83
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
That stuff.

84
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
Yeah.

85
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,840
I but I spent a lot of time in Toontown.

86
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
Yeah.

87
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,840
Yeah.

88
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
Toontown, USA.

89
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,840
Yeah.

90
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,600
As a theme park fan, do you ever feel obviously you're happy to be spending time with your

91
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,320
kids, but do you feel like frustrated that you're stuck in the kiddie area?

92
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,360
Well, not exploring the I have a very cool kid who happens to be 40 inches tall, which

93
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,000
means as a four year old, he's much taller than normal four year olds.

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,560
Maybe he's larger than normal.

95
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,080
But he can ride roller coasters.

96
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,920
So he loves big Thunder Mountain railroad.

97
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,080
He goes on the go go.

98
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,400
He calls it go go gadget coaster.

99
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,280
I think this is called the gadget coaster.

100
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,640
But and he goes on a bunch of things.

101
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,360
He's allowed to go on Space Mountain, but I feel like that will freak him out.

102
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,640
And I tell him he is not allowed to go on that.

103
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,120
That the Matterhorn are off limits.

104
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,160
And every day he wakes up and asks me, am I tall enough now for the Matterhorn?

105
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,800
So we have like a thing in our house where he stands up against it and we see the 42

106
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,000
inches and we are tracking until he can ride the matter.

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Almost there.

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's current.

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's 42 inch watch right now.

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
We are.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We are.

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I mean, we've been on 42 inch watch now for a while.

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,440
So I feel like when it happens, it will happen.

114
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,920
But it's it's been a slow go.

115
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,100
Soon your child will have the coming age of coming of age experience of getting injured

116
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,520
on the matter of just getting thrown around.

117
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,320
Spine is young, really getting upset by that.

118
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,920
Yeah, he's he's already having issues with the big Thunder Mountain Railroad.

119
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,360
There's you know, which is a great ride.

120
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
But you know, scary.

121
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
Yeah, scary.

122
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Scary.

123
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,720
I was as a little I was very short now is very short as a child.

124
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,120
And I would get like tossed around on those rides like my dad was like, thankfully, just

125
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,120
there.

126
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,640
And for whatever reason, it was both my parents were always like, all right, make sure he

127
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,800
sits on the inside of the thing.

128
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Right.

129
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,760
So that way you can just slam into your parents.

130
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
Yeah.

131
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,400
We kind of sandwich him in the middle of big Thunder Mountain Railroad.

132
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
It's good.

133
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Yeah.

134
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
It's a bit you're in that.

135
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
But that's uncomfortable as an adult.

136
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Oh, yeah.

137
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Like three across in there.

138
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
It's not a not a fun ride.

139
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Yeah.

140
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:53,280
But I will say going with my kid has been an amazing experience because I've got a I'm

141
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,760
a Disney World Disneyland all theme parks person.

142
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:04,080
But it's kind of great to watch a kid experience all of this and and see them just do it and

143
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,360
get excited by it.

144
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,920
And you know, I don't bring them to the parade.

145
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
I don't even know that exists.

146
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
I'm like, I don't need to get into that.

147
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
I like smart.

148
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
Yeah.

149
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
I'm like, no parades.

150
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,920
And almost to the day that way.

151
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,560
And it's a small world has become a great like refuge because it's kind of tiring to

152
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,160
bring a kid and it's all air conditioned.

153
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
It's a nice ride.

154
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,840
It's about it feels like 20 minutes.

155
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Yeah.

156
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,480
And you get like a friend as a parent, you get a nice recharge on there.

157
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,800
So I'm I'm appreciating different parts of the park.

158
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,520
I've probably done Roger Rabbit more than I ever have done or probably want to do.

159
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,320
But yeah, but yeah, I've definitely I've explored a different side.

160
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:44,600
But that being said, in the last three weeks, I think I've been there three times.

161
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
No.

162
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Wow.

163
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,120
Yeah, I went there once to go to Club 33.

164
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
Right.

165
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,120
So you posted about this.

166
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Yes.

167
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
This is no private.

168
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,320
I got a for a birthday gift.

169
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,920
Someone got me an invitation to go to Club 33, which was amazingly fun.

170
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
Yeah.

171
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
You all been there?

172
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,920
I've never we've Jason.

173
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
I have never been.

174
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,880
Scott, I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,160
It was it was a great experience.

176
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,760
I thought it was a pretty lovely thing.

177
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,480
Did you stand out on the deck?

178
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
I did.

179
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
I got to see the end of Fantasmic.

180
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:17,040
And I forget if I've told this story on the podcast before, but I at the time was like

181
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:24,840
I went to propose to my now wife and I had I had the wedding ring in my pocket and I

182
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,240
was like, huh, like in case a moment struck us and we were out there.

183
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
Well, that would have been great.

184
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,840
Finishing would have been great.

185
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,280
And our my rationale in my head was like then our friends who were nice enough to let us

186
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,920
in there like that then takes over the dinner conversation.

187
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,960
It's entirely about we just got engaged and not about how cool you let us into Club 33.

188
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
I understand that.

189
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
Yeah.

190
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
I was just connecting.

191
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
But yeah, I could have.

192
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,720
I will say as someone who is also married that it is nice to do that moment privately.

193
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,040
Like you don't want to like immediately.

194
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
And we just did it.

195
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,400
Like you want to kind of just be able to connect, which by the way, you know, yeah, I think

196
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,240
that that's yeah, I think that's a good good move.

197
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
I think so.

198
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Yeah.

199
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,920
Even when I ended up doing it, we were on like the bluffs in San Diego, like along the

200
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,280
beach and the I was still I was extremely stressed out by how many people were there.

201
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Yes.

202
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,920
I mean, the sunset, a reasonable thing for people in the world to do.

203
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,120
And I was so stressed out.

204
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,520
And she's like, why do you care that there's people around like you kind of clicked with

205
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
her right before?

206
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,280
Like, are you suddenly having this people phobia?

207
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,800
So yeah, I felt the privacy pressure big time.

208
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,640
No chance, though, you were going to run into a Captain Jack Sparrow face character.

209
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,040
And then he'd steal the ring.

210
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
Yeah.

211
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,560
He loves those jewels.

212
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,440
You know, and sometimes it's Johnny Depp just stealing people's jewelry.

213
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Yeah.

214
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,720
The I proposed to my wife on a beach as well.

215
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,060
And we did it at night.

216
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,720
And there's like all these cool fire pits.

217
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,240
And we did it.

218
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,760
And there's a whole story to this.

219
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,120
But the only thing the end part was like we finally kissed and and this kid yells, get

220
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
a room.

221
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,120
The literal nightmare, the movie scene.

222
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,120
1980s.

223
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Wow.

224
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
Get a room.

225
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,120
We are.

226
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,120
We will.

227
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,720
This is very special for us.

228
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,480
What do you guys think about a Disney wedding?

229
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,960
I mean, there's been a lot of talk about a lot of things in this podcast.

230
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,240
But where do we fall on that?

231
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,800
It's well, there's first of all, I'm a big pro wrestling fan.

232
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,800
OK.

233
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,120
And some pro wrestlers got married at Disney a couple like a year ago.

234
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
And they did.

235
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,340
I think they didn't do the big crazy version of it, because I think there's tears to it.

236
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,280
They don't have it on the website.

237
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,320
But like they did like there's like a little chapel out to the Disneyland Hotel, hurling

238
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,160
that chapel, but like a little spot where they do.

239
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,400
And Floridian has like a whole big thing on.

240
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,080
Oh, there's a wedding villa there, which is really funny to walk around.

241
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,180
I think there are tasteful ways to do it.

242
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:59,920
And then like there's obnoxious, like Saudi prince style version where like you're like

243
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,840
you're walked down the aisle by Gaston or something or a less evil character, I guess.

244
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,120
There's a beautiful courtyard like in the Grand Californian out here.

245
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,520
And it's sort of like self contained.

246
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,720
Like you can't see downtown Disney from it.

247
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,320
You can't see a Starbucks or like sprinkles, cupcakes and all.

248
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,960
But like there are rooms above it.

249
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,880
Like I was my family was visiting a couple of years ago and they were staying in a room

250
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,600
and I walked out on the balcony and I looked down like three stories down.

251
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,600
There was a full wedding reception going on.

252
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,560
But it is like very private and intimate and like beautiful foliage.

253
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,280
Well, if I'm getting married there, I want to get married.

254
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,360
I want to have my whole reception to be my guest.

255
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,400
It would be a very expensive.

256
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,640
Who went to that?

257
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,640
Be my guest.

258
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
Be your guest.

259
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
I've been twice.

260
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah, because you mentioned you're the one who.

261
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yeah, OK.

262
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,160
I'm only knowing your voices and now I'm always trying to.

263
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,840
So you did.

264
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,080
You went there to get the 830 reservation, right?

265
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
Yes, it was a whole.

266
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
Yeah.

267
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
Was it worth it?

268
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,080
You didn't really talk about the experience.

269
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,360
I had so much to do.

270
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,280
Well, yeah, I convinced my friends to bail on the rent a car that we had paid for already.

271
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,640
I was like, they'll reimburse you.

272
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
I figured out.

273
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,160
Yeah, it's it's great.

274
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,000
It's it's got the three different like you have the ballroom where they dance and you

275
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,400
have the beast swing, which has the flower, the rose that like is wilting.

276
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,680
It's just sitting there, though.

277
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,000
It's just sitting there.

278
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,640
But it does fall like they have an effect that makes it look like it's falling or whatever

279
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
throughout your day.

280
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,360
It was a worth it to ditch the rental.

281
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
Yeah, of course.

282
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,680
Well, I mean, but was it worth it in general?

283
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,960
I feel like it's a coveted place to have dinner.

284
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
It's hard to get a reservation.

285
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,800
Yeah, very like stock it, which I did for like weeks.

286
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
Yeah.

287
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,900
If you unless you book like a year out.

288
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,200
And but I mean, so but you felt like it was a it was it was worth the hype.

289
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,560
It just feels like it's like you're eating in a place that looks like the Beast's Castle.

290
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,400
If you're a weirdo like we are.

291
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Yeah, it's worth the hype.

292
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,040
But if you're a normal human being, you're like, OK, yeah, it looks like the movie.

293
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,400
Got it like, well, I mean, it is good.

294
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
Yes.

295
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
And the atmosphere is good.

296
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,360
But I guess my question and I'm not trying to be difficult about it, but does it fall

297
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,240
like above Bayou?

298
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,440
Does it go below it?

299
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,640
Where does it where does it fall in the in the atmospheric Disney experience?

300
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,280
I think the food is a little better than Bayou.

301
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
We're talking blue Bayou.

302
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,280
Yeah, we just call Bayou.

303
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,280
Yeah, yeah.

304
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:28,240
The blue, yeah, the atmosphere, I think, is on par with it.

305
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,200
The blue like it's it's it's cool.

306
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
It's really cool.

307
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,800
If you like doing the beast a lot like they do, like the snow is falling behind you.

308
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
I'm down with that.

309
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,240
And like again, the beast swing is like the coolest play.

310
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
They walking around.

311
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
Yes.

312
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,860
They well, he's you can take pictures with him, which doesn't quite make sense because

313
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,860
like he should be upset.

314
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,860
You're in his house.

315
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,860
Yeah.

316
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,860
Maybe he wants company.

317
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,860
But yeah, he's he's lonely.

318
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,860
He's a lonely man.

319
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,860
Yeah.

320
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,520
So you see that they walk around when he walks through, there's a big like, I'm now introducing

321
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,160
the beast and he goes through.

322
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
So that's fun.

323
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,880
Like introducing the couple that just got married.

324
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880
Yeah.

325
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,880
First time.

326
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
So it's great.

327
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
I mean, it's great.

328
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,600
It's if you like this type of nonsense, it's on the high end of this type of nonsense.

329
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,800
If you're listening to this podcast, you're probably yeah, you're on.

330
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
You're on.

331
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
You're in.

332
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
What's the best?

333
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,520
What's the best restaurant in a park?

334
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,480
If we leave out hotels or a sort of subsequent.

335
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,480
Yes.

336
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,480
No Napa Roses here.

337
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,840
I guess you'd have to count that out.

338
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,000
Oh, I have one.

339
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,320
I think it's Lacelle A in Canada and Epcot.

340
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,360
Oh, I think it's a steakhouse.

341
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
Oh, yes.

342
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
It's a steakhouse.

343
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,920
It's like looks like it's supposed to be in a cellar.

344
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,600
I guess back in the day, it used to be a buffeteer.

345
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,900
Like a full cafeteria, like buffet sort of thing.

346
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,180
And then at some point, they made it into a steakhouse.

347
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,180
And it's great.

348
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,000
That is a very hard reservation to get because it is so small.

349
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,760
And I think Epcot across the board has like really solid food choices like the Italian

350
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,680
Pavillion has a good food.

351
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,880
That's a great like go to dinner place.

352
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,200
Did not love the French restaurant there though that my mom.

353
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,000
I had an okay right time there.

354
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It was fine.

355
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,440
There's a couple there and I feel like they've turned over a lot.

356
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,940
Like they've redone them a few times now, but it's but they're never like at the top

357
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,940
of anyone's list.

358
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,940
Yeah, Italian.

359
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,880
There hasn't been one consistent Italian restaurant as there is.

360
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,120
Alfredo's was there for years.

361
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,800
Alfredo of Fettuccine, Alfredo had been there for years.

362
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,280
The man who invented it, which was amazing.

363
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:30,560
But then I think I always heard that they didn't want to accept the Disney dining plan

364
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,520
or they didn't want to lower their prices or stuff.

365
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,560
So eventually, like when the licensing agreement ended, they were not except what do you mean

366
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,040
they're bartering within the overall Disney?

367
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,040
They was very fancy.

368
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,800
I mean, it was a really intense place.

369
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,040
Like they're very serious about their pasta.

370
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
Yeah.

371
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,040
Snudy restaurant.

372
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
I haven't.

373
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,200
Tiffin's is supposed to be really good.

374
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,080
I've never had that at the Animal Kingdom.

375
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,080
That's their high end.

376
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
I've eaten there.

377
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
Is that good?

378
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
It is very good.

379
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,080
Yeah.

380
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
Do you have an answer to this?

381
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,080
I'm thinking of my answer.

382
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,280
Like I'm my go to it, but continue.

383
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,280
I'm sorry.

384
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,360
I think the best I'll say this, I'll be very bold to the best fast service restaurant is

385
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,680
the Sala Cantina in my.

386
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:21,440
Oh, oh, I was I know the Cantina in in Frontierland that's all Cantina.

387
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,800
I thought that's the same of it.

388
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,080
Maybe it's let me look the name up.

389
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,320
No, is that Bill Pekos Bills?

390
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,480
No, it's a Mexican place.

391
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,160
Disney World or Disneyland.

392
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,160
Okay.

393
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Disneyland.

394
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,160
Yeah, the Zocalo Zocalo.

395
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
Sorry.

396
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:41,320
That's not a Navi word, all is a Navi word.

397
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,320
Which language you were speaking.

398
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
I'm sorry.

399
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,320
I mispronounced it.

400
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
Such huli canteen.

401
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
Okay.

402
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
Okay.

403
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
Sorry.

404
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
Fans were screaming.

405
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
They're very upset.

406
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
All of us right now.

407
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
In their cars.

408
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,800
My Pandora experience was really a bust.

409
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,480
Oh, no.

410
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
So I went to go.

411
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,240
My mom has a timeshare at Disneyland.

412
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,560
My mom got into the timeshare game at Disneyland.

413
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
It doesn't world.

414
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
Oh, sorry.

415
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,520
That's a guy in the Disney world early on.

416
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,120
Early on, but just late enough that originally when you bought a timeshare there, they would

417
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,960
give you a lifetime free pass.

418
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,600
That was the first wave of it.

419
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Oh, wow.

420
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
So my mom got into the second wave.

421
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,480
How long you've been doing that?

422
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,480
Over 25 years, I think she's had it.

423
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,200
So she's on the second wave of it.

424
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,900
So she has, whenever I tell people, I don't know her points.

425
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,640
She talks about her points all the time.

426
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,880
But whenever I mention the amount of points, she has to be like, whoa.

427
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,480
That's a comically large amount of points.

428
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,820
And she has them for life.

429
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,760
But now the new points, you only have them for 99 years.

430
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,080
So you can't pass them on to your family.

431
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,600
That's basically like you can, but it will eventually.

432
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,720
But they got to use it.

433
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,720
Yeah.

434
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
My family was in it for a little while.

435
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Yeah.

436
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,880
Like five or six years were in it.

437
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,720
So as a kid, I was like, so how are the points looking this year?

438
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
Are we doing what?

439
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,440
Because one year we went for two weeks.

440
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,840
We spent two weeks in Disney World, which was wild.

441
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
That's amazing.

442
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,800
I think that Trump should repeal that.

443
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,680
I think that it's like a death tax.

444
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,640
I think that he should allow the kids to get the full amount of points.

445
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,640
That would only be good for.

446
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,640
Kids need to get those points.

447
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,640
Yeah.

448
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:23,280
I was going to say that my favorite dining experience is, and I apologize to your listeners.

449
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,160
I am a ardent Disney fan.

450
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:31,040
I forget names a lot of the times is the either.

451
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,480
I think it's a carnation cafe in Disneyland.

452
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,320
It's like the old timey cafe Main Street, Main Street, where it's like where they do

453
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,680
the character breakfast in the morning.

454
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:43,480
I feel like that is a quintessential Disneyland experience in both parks.

455
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,320
I think they like because it looks like old timey diner, like red and white kind of thing.

456
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,520
And like poos there and they have good French toast.

457
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,880
There's something about that one that's a higher quality.

458
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,000
Good cheeseburger there.

459
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,200
Like a good like whatever a good version of a Johnny Rockets cheeseburger you can get

460
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,460
at the Carnation Cafe.

461
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,360
If you're facing the castle, is that the one on the left or the right?

462
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,000
Disneyland if you're faced on the left.

463
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
OK.

464
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yeah, that's the one.

465
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I've never been there.

466
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But it's in the middle of the street.

467
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Carnation's in the middle of the street.

468
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,600
Oh, is that the one that does the breakfast buffet is one.

469
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
I see.

470
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Yeah, I see.

471
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
I'm always wrong.

472
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
What is that?

473
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,800
It's called the Plaza in Disneyland and in Disney World, it's called the Crystal Palace.

474
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,760
The one I'm thinking of that was great.

475
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,760
OK.

476
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,200
And Carnation Cafe had a good breakfast here last week.

477
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
I had a good pancake.

478
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,560
I had a pancake with although they served it was the pancake and granola.

479
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,560
And I was like, oh, that'd be good.

480
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,000
Like a granola pancake.

481
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,200
It was just granola sprinkled on a pancake, which was an odd.

482
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
That's your choice.

483
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,200
That's odd.

484
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Yeah.

485
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
And I felt uncomfortable eating it.

486
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,000
Mike and I went down recent because they have all the Pixar Fest stuff.

487
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,800
And we went to the Pizza Planet restaurant and we're like, there's there.

488
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:56,160
Oh, look, it's let's try the cheeseburger pizza, which I've like had before.

489
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,400
I've had this con.

490
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,840
I've had the idea of cheeseburger pizza before.

491
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,240
And this usually is just ground a layer of ground beef under the cheese or on top of

492
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
the cheese.

493
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,840
This was like they like quartered hamburger patties and had chunks of it like it was fine.

494
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,840
It was nothing.

495
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,840
It was fine.

496
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,320
But we posted it on the Twitter account.

497
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,280
It's Scott replied immediately spit back.

498
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,280
That's fucking disgusting.

499
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,280
Yeah.

500
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,800
It was a joke way to say it.

501
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
It just looked horrible.

502
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,520
And I showed my wife and she said the same thing.

503
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,160
We're just jabbing you on your trip from afar.

504
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,320
It was covered in rain like a Thousand Island dressing.

505
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,320
So like miserable.

506
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,960
No, but I mean, if you have you ever dipped like a real cheap pizza in dressing before?

507
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,120
That's the Papa John's like key to success.

508
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,640
I mean, essentially, it was not that good, but if you just dip it, you'll you'll forget

509
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,640
about that.

510
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,120
So yeah, put enough sauce on anything.

511
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,120
It's delicious.

512
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,600
You know, Jake's pizza and some creamy ranch.

513
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
It's delicious.

514
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Sure.

515
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,400
Well, we should talk about, you know, there's there's plenty of fine dining options and

516
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,280
of course, entertainment options at today's topic.

517
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,280
Oh, yes.

518
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
Island.

519
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,280
Yeah.

520
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,920
Hey, if you're if you're looking to, you know, we can talk about rides all day.

521
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:14,240
But if you want to talk about the finest entertainment, the best top 40 Jams and and there's some

522
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,600
restaurants and shop.

523
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
It's all there.

524
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
So we're talking about pleasure.

525
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
It's amazing.

526
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:24,400
I want to tell you like a little bit of my background of Disney and why I feel so connected

527
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
to pleasure.

528
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:34,440
I grew up in New York and from the time I was three years old to 21, we went to Florida

529
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,840
every single year, not just the Florida.

530
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,080
We went to Walt Disney World.

531
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,160
So we were there all the time in a minimum of five to six days, a minimum of that.

532
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,360
And then maximum dream.

533
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,360
Yeah.

534
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,760
And I didn't understand that you could take vacations anywhere else.

535
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,040
And I didn't understand why you would want to go anywhere without a theme park.

536
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,880
Like I wasn't like a purist in the sense that I was like, I'd like to go to Universal.

537
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,880
We went to Universal.

538
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,880
It was great.

539
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
Sure.

540
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,640
I wasn't, you know, but yeah, I that was my my entire life from three to 21 was that.

541
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,320
And when I had my girlfriend in college, she's like, well, we should go to Hawaii.

542
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,600
I was like, why?

543
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,120
And then we and then we went to France and I made her go to Disneyland Paris.

544
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,240
And we were only there for a very short period of time in France, like a day and a half.

545
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,240
I was like, we're got to go there.

546
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,520
You made the majority of it be Disneyland Paris.

547
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,200
The good thing was it was completely empty so we could like really knock that park out

548
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
real quick.

549
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,280
As it mostly has been in its history.

550
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,440
Yeah, it's a little bit of an out of the way place.

551
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,920
But it was it was fantastic.

552
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,920
I actually found it.

553
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:42,280
I found the Haunted Mansion there to be quite spookier than the any other one that I've

554
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,280
experienced.

555
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,280
It's scarier.

556
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,280
I love that.

557
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,280
Right.

558
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,280
That was the best part of the day.

559
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,280
Yeah, they did a great job of land.

560
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,520
It's like still the it's the scenes and characters you recognize, but with this layer of the

561
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,200
old west and it is.

562
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Yeah.

563
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Yeah.

564
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
That that phantom is scarier.

565
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,760
It's a it's a real it's a real good one.

566
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,880
So I so I spent a lot of time, a lot of time at Walt Disney World.

567
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:10,760
And then and so as I got older and even when I was younger, like pleasure island was like,

568
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,080
um, this is cool.

569
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,880
Like I am going to like my idea of what like a like where, you know, people go to like

570
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,520
whatever, like senior frogs or whatever.

571
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,720
I was like, this is my where my people are, you know, and like and as I got when I when

572
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,480
I got a little bit older, like high school age, my parents would like let me go to pleasure

573
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,480
island by myself.

574
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
OK.

575
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,480
Oh, yeah.

576
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,360
But and then but yes, but I originally went there with my dad and we would spend, you

577
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,360
know, I needed to get there to watch at least the midnight celebration, which I think happened

578
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,920
at 10 o'clock.

579
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,920
This OK.

580
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,720
So I was telling my dad we were doing this and he went and tried to hunt this because

581
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,360
he was convinced of the same thing.

582
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,680
And yes, it seemed like on weekdays they would do it at like 10 or 1030.

583
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,760
Yes, because every night was New Year's.

584
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,160
Yeah, every night was New Year's.

585
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,840
If you were to ask me like what like I did my research, everything that my research is

586
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,480
not my memory of pleasure island.

587
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,240
Like it was like, yeah, it was like the theming behind it was like that was not out in front

588
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,680
of this place at all.

589
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,440
Like, OK, OK, because it was like it was like this guy, James Pleasure invented of like

590
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,040
it was like to me it was like this moon that had sunglasses on that looked like a rejected

591
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,680
like McDonald's character that was the fun.

592
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,680
Meister.

593
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,680
Yeah, the fun.

594
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,520
After my tonight, Mac tonight already exists and they still go in on like the moon.

595
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,520
The cool moon character.

596
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,320
The fun Meister is different from Mac tonight.

597
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,840
Everyone be very clear about that.

598
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,020
But it felt so cool to be like it's midnight.

599
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:42,640
It's New Year's Eve every night like they would have fireworks and music and they count

600
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,880
down like that's a crazy great thing.

601
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,600
And I want to acknowledge because I like I there's people I know who are like pretty

602
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,240
advanced in their theme park knowledge who still when I talk about this.

603
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,000
Oh, yes, this nightclub district where every night there was a New Year's celebration and

604
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,240
so many people have been like the Simpsons joke.

605
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,240
That's real.

606
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,600
That's an actual thing because in the itchy and scratchy episode when Homer and Mark from

607
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,320
the kids, yeah, when they go to Parents Island, it's there, it's New Year's Eve constantly.

608
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,040
Just like every five minutes.

609
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,960
But like it just seemed like kind of like an odd joke of like how a place like that

610
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,000
could be irritating.

611
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,160
And I've like recently told people there was a real place.

612
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,280
And like you're fucking kidding.

613
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
That's so crazy.

614
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,320
It was like this cool.

615
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
It was an interesting thing.

616
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,600
It was kind of like I think in my opinion, like at the height of like good, bad Disney

617
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
decisions.

618
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,120
It was like it was like we're gonna we're gonna appeal to Orlando.

619
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,760
Like this is going to be a place where Orlando people can come.

620
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,840
You get a wristband and you would be able to come in and just go to any of the like

621
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,600
but it was almost like a separate park like pleasure island park.

622
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Yeah.

623
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,960
And that was another thing my dad came across.

624
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,680
There was a season pass just for Pleasure Island.

625
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:55,960
You could buy a pass for an annual pass just to go to the clubs and then you could.

626
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,960
Yeah.

627
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,320
And I remember like my dad and I would like figure out like, well, we're going to go here

628
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,320
every night.

629
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,240
It was worth buying like the more expensive.

630
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
Yeah.

631
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,240
Band.

632
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,240
Have you all gone to Pleasure Island?

633
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,080
I have not spent a lot of time.

634
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,160
I really only went in the middle of the day on a band trip and I cannot figure out which

635
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,720
place I went to.

636
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,800
And my mom was chaperoning this trip kind of and like I was dancing with girls and I

637
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,120
had never been more insecure in my life.

638
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,120
Oh, wow.

639
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,280
Because also like it's like a year or two prior the girls introduced like what would

640
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,200
be called grinding, I guess you would call it.

641
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,440
And then like they're like kind of and it's also in the middle of the day.

642
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,360
So everyone's like not really, you know, feeling it.

643
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,280
I didn't even know the pleasure island was open during the day because I always thought

644
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,280
it like started opening up at like six.

645
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,440
But this is pleasure island was like gasping for air at multiple points.

646
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
I feel like yes.

647
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,520
The last few years of Pleasure Island, because that's what I came across looking up the researching

648
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
for this episode.

649
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,000
A lot of videos on YouTube and the type of video you're going to run into is I transferred

650
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,320
a VHS tape from a camcorder in 1991 of walking around Pleasure Island or I'm here in 2008

651
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
and it's shutting down.

652
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,320
Yeah.

653
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,800
There's a lot of planters and a lot of stuff is already closed.

654
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,440
By the way, I need to get my videotapes out.

655
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,640
I have like literally like boxes of videotapes of like all we did was this tape everything.

656
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,360
It's almost the most uninteresting home video because it's like who's who is this for?

657
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,120
Like yes, here's four rides on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

658
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,000
Like none of them are better than the other.

659
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
But yet we taped it.

660
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,080
It was almost like we can tape this so we should.

661
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,240
And now we have this property.

662
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,360
It was like I felt like the same way that you feel like if you've got like a ghostbusters

663
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,960
on tape now, like I got Mr. Toad's ride.

664
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,480
I can live it anytime I want.

665
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,280
In a pre YouTube era, that was important.

666
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:49,160
Yeah, I remember having like I took my own video of Alice in Wonderland and I don't even

667
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,760
need to go to the park anymore.

668
00:27:52,760 --> 00:28:00,400
I to me, Pledge Island was two things that were like my favorite things besides the New

669
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Year's every night.

670
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
And it was not the dance clubs.

671
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,360
It was this place called Adventurers Club.

672
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,360
Sure.

673
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,360
All right.

674
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,680
That was the best thing ever.

675
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,480
It was like kind of a spin off or at least my memory of it was like of like the Jungle

676
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,720
Cruise and you go in.

677
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:22,400
It was like a basically like a fully themed like kid friendly cocktail bar where they

678
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:29,120
would have like people singing songs or the gorilla that ran around certain points.

679
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,720
And and then, you know, you would play games.

680
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,320
It would bring some of the people into like one room and then the other people go into

681
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,320
another room.

682
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,480
And it was kind of like everything that people are doing now.

683
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:43,240
It was like the it was as a kid, I would make my dad say there for hours.

684
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,720
I did the same thing.

685
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,240
I talked about this on the show before, but the Adventurers Club was like loom so large

686
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,320
in my childhood.

687
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,240
The Adventurers Club and the Comedy Warehouse that's the first two places that I ever saw

688
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,240
live comedy.

689
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,200
Oh, the comedy warehouse.

690
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,200
Equally amazing.

691
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,160
It was like we're just running back and forth there.

692
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,200
They're right across the way from each other.

693
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,480
But the Adventurers Club, the most notable thing there there was, do you remember the

694
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,280
giant idol in the main?

695
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,280
Oh, yes.

696
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:18,640
There's a giant animatronic stone head and it talks to you and it always asks for volunteers

697
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,080
to do like an embarrassing dance and stuff.

698
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,400
And I've gone there so much.

699
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,160
I knew those volunteers got like pins you couldn't buy this door.

700
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
Yes.

701
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,360
I pimped my dad into I was like, get up there.

702
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,340
You do get up there and do it.

703
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,540
And then I don't remember if this was the same night.

704
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,560
In my mind, I've mushing together, but we stayed so late.

705
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:43,300
It was like last it was closing down and we walk outside into pouring rain and like an

706
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:49,200
electrical storm with like chain lighting in the distance and the bus stop is on the

707
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,600
other side of like the movie theater and the Cirque du Soleil had been built by that point.

708
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,760
So we had to run through torrential rain because I was like, well, we got to see all the shows

709
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,760
tonight.

710
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:06,040
Some of the best memories of my dad and because my parents are divorced, but was like being

711
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:11,160
like me and my dad just in in those yellow Disneyland ponchos, just like braving like

712
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,160
awful, awful storm.

713
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
Oh yeah.

714
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,160
Yeah.

715
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
Terrifying.

716
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,160
Yeah.

717
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
Yeah.

718
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,160
It was fun though.

719
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,160
It was like, cause then my dad was always cool.

720
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
He'd be like, let's go on the line now.

721
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
That would be very long and it would be empty.

722
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,160
And then, you know, you know, he'd tough it out.

723
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,160
Yeah.

724
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,160
Once you get that poncho on, you're fine.

725
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,160
Yeah.

726
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
Yeah.

727
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,160
Use it.

728
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,160
But yeah.

729
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,160
Adventurers club.

730
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,160
I'm upset that I didn't go to this.

731
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,160
I'm so, I didn't know it existed.

732
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,160
I didn't know it existed.

733
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,240
It wouldn't have been cool when you went with the band.

734
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,320
I don't think, I don't think people would have been like, I want to go in for an interactive

735
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,320
theater experience.

736
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,200
Well, it was open though, when I went with my family, I just think that I wasn't in the

737
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
know.

738
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
I was, I wasn't really designed.

739
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,960
The, what do you zines you call them?

740
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,720
The old Sting Scott was reading these.

741
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Yeah.

742
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,400
Cause I did read all these, all these dorky magazines and stuff.

743
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,280
And for some reason, the adventure club was not on my radar.

744
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,280
It's everything I want.

745
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,960
Or maybe I thought I couldn't go because I was a kid, but this wasn't all ages.

746
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,880
Well, to me, that was the coolest part about it.

747
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:11,000
Cause like, I had no desire to go dancing at mannequins, you know, or Videodrome or

748
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
whatever it was.

749
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,040
I, I wanted to, I wanted to like watch, you know, these people like say they had, they

750
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:22,280
had like a special thing to say when you walked in, it was a, here, I wrote it down.

751
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:28,160
It was a Jason might have a kongaloosh wiggle your head.

752
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,320
You take a drink, you wave.

753
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,560
It felt so adult.

754
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,400
I think that was the thing that was so cool about it as a kid.

755
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,800
I think I would go back there now.

756
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,320
And it's probably, I'm sorry.

757
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,040
It's probably what you assumed adult entertainment would be.

758
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,520
Like you put it, like it's, it seems like in a similar, it's, it's like Disney tried

759
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,320
to start a magic castle.

760
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,320
Yes.

761
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,800
Like all of a sudden from the, from scratch.

762
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:55,720
And I like, now you realize magic castle is this odd particular anomaly, weird LA thing,

763
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,960
but you probably like probably as a kid, you think like, oh yes, these bizarre secret room

764
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:06,440
cheeky theater shows are, it's just the kind of clever, cool adult entertainment that people

765
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,440
are always getting up to.

766
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,800
I almost think if the pleasure Island had like, like, I feel like they kind of like,

767
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,440
again, they appeal to like Orlando and they don't appeal to like the people are going

768
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
to the parks.

769
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,360
I feel like adventure, like the adventure club would be better served as they did more

770
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:28,160
of those type of feet, like more Disney type themed things instead of being like, and you

771
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:33,680
can totally do like, I remember they were like shots girls in like, in pleasure Island.

772
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,760
And that was like, it's so incongruous to what you know of Disney.

773
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,760
Like they had like syringe shots.

774
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,640
I remember at one point I was there and it was like, they had like syringe shots or something.

775
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,240
Did you ever get, did you drink there?

776
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,680
Were you old enough to, okay.

777
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,680
Huh.

778
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,680
Huh.

779
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,920
I feel like I was a two, I was a good boy.

780
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:54,320
I wasn't ever going to push it, but that was the thing too, the wristbands.

781
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
I think the wristbands would dictate if you could drink.

782
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,200
So yeah, you, there was no way to even fake it.

783
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,200
Sneak it.

784
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
Yeah.

785
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Okay.

786
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,200
Okay.

787
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,760
It's a, it's, you said, I believe Jason, before we started, you said that they were

788
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,920
like, pleasure Island was like trying to be everything to everyone.

789
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,120
They were trying to give it every single demographic would enjoy.

790
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,920
And that's like the bat, the good, bad Disney.

791
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:17,660
It was like, this is a good idea, but it's too, it's too scattershot.

792
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,640
There was so much going on.

793
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,960
I mean, Mike, even your description of like going there and like dancing with girl, like

794
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,000
that, uh, I think I would have been a little younger the main times I would have gone there.

795
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,460
My most memories of being a pleasure Island was like between like 11 and 14 and I was so

796
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,800
focused on the comedy warehouse and the adventures club.

797
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,800
I was like, the concept of meeting people is alien to me.

798
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,400
I would go there by myself and just sit quietly in the comedy warehouse.

799
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,440
I mean, a lot of my time at Disney is spent by me by myself, like, cause my parents would

800
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,440
be like, we're just staying at the hotel.

801
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,440
I'm like, well, I'm going to go to there.

802
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,280
You know, I bring a book, you know, like, and like read books online.

803
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,880
And uh, like, but yeah, like I was just me by myself at those places, not talking to

804
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
anyone.

805
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,880
Just like watching.

806
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,880
I would do that.

807
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,440
Like I remember taking like the bus once, like I want to go walk around the Virgin mega

808
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,440
store.

809
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,120
It was like a giant three story.

810
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,520
I spent a lot of time there too.

811
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,320
I could be by myself.

812
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,320
Right.

813
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,560
I got, I bought blood sugar sex magic at that mega store.

814
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,560
Perfect.

815
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,480
Years, years after it came out, this is like 97 or something.

816
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,480
This is a lot.

817
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:33,360
I bought a Beck biography that I read front to back and learn and learned a lot from as

818
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,800
a very formative item.

819
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Thanks Virgin mega store.

820
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,480
Ask the listeners which item they purchased at the Orlando Virgin mega store.

821
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,040
How do you, how do you Virgin?

822
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,800
I think I bought an optic nerve collection.

823
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,800
Really?

824
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:52,680
The Virgin mega store used to have a really intensive graphic novel selection.

825
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,680
Yeah right.

826
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,680
They had a cool, they had cool stuff.

827
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,680
I had like cool comics.

828
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,740
I remember like finding cool stuff there like once in Orlando and then like on a high school

829
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,880
trip to time square.

830
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,280
Yeah that like that time square one was amazing.

831
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,760
That's when I had the, my most familiar, familiar with the other thing I loved about, I have

832
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,200
a whole story about the comedy club.

833
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,200
Oh yeah.

834
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:18,520
I have a, oh man I'm like, it's even hard to like break down what it is because it is

835
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,520
an assemblage of insanity.

836
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:25,480
It's like there's a Jessica Rabbit like only clothing store and then there's like four

837
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,080
dance clubs and then there's the ventures club and there's a comedy thing and then there's

838
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:34,160
the nightly New Year's Eve celebration and then there's Disney Quest, which I like Disney

839
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,160
Quest.

840
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,160
Yeah.

841
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
I love Disney Quest.

842
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,160
Right, right.

843
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,240
Which is like a pay one price paid video arcade.

844
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,840
Like you like, or at least when I was there it was like you paid like 25 bucks and could

845
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,760
play any game you want.

846
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,360
And that to me blew my mind.

847
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,960
With Cyberspace Mountain and Aladdin Magic Carpet.

848
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,800
I got Ilan.

849
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,800
What's that?

850
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,800
I felt, I almost threw up on that.

851
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,800
Oh really?

852
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
Yeah.

853
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
I was so excited about it and then I almost threw up.

854
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,800
It was probably weird old like VR.

855
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Oh yeah it was bad.

856
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
It wasn't.

857
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
It was awful.

858
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,800
Yeah, yeah.

859
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,800
But it was so exciting.

860
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,720
I mean to me the best part of that place was like when you get in there by yourself and

861
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,080
you could ride the elevator up and it was like a special like Robin Williams did like

862
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:16,080
a special like Aladdin or a genie from Aladdin like thing.

863
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,480
So he was in the elevator with you and he would you know make the Disney Quest appear.

864
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,080
There's a thing that's only in this elevator in this particular themed experience that's

865
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,080
so bizarre.

866
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,880
I was, you know, there's a, that thing is similar to our friend Andrew Grissom just

867
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,200
turned us on to a, did you ever go to Mars 2112 in Times Square?

868
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,200
Yeah.

869
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
I'd never heard of it until recently.

870
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,760
Which had like a, there was like a simulator you had to go on to get into the restaurant.

871
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,800
It was a very, it was the poor man's version of like a planet in Hollywood because the

872
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,920
simulators where they spent all their money.

873
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:54,600
It was like they, it was, and simulator is a generous way to describe it.

874
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:00,320
It was like you were in a little box, you sat down and it was so janky and it just like,

875
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,760
it just shook.

876
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,760
It didn't really move.

877
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,400
It just was like, almost like you could picture like five kids just like pushing it really

878
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,200
hard and then the door would open on the other side.

879
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,960
It wasn't, you know, so you get out and you'd walk into Mars.

880
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,200
Oh, it didn't take you anyway.

881
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,200
It didn't elevate.

882
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,200
Oh no, no, no.

883
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,200
Yeah.

884
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,560
It was like, well, yeah, it was the same thing as Star Tours, but take away all the cool things

885
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,360
of Star Tours.

886
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,160
And then you would walk into this place, but then they had no money.

887
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,720
So it was like just the surface of the, of Mars as a restaurant.

888
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,280
So there was no real theming besides like, now you're here now.

889
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,280
That's it.

890
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,160
Like they, they, they, it was like a big open space and it just became notorious for everybody

891
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:41,600
who worked at MTV and VH1, which is right upstairs to get super drunk at their bar.

892
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,760
Cause like when I started working at VH1, people just go, yeah, we're going around Mars

893
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,560
2112 and everyone was psyched to get into that simulator.

894
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,380
And then they would get really drunk and then get on the simulator.

895
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:55,480
So like, like it was, cause that play at that time was becoming like, this is not going

896
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,840
well for the Mars 2112.

897
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,680
Like sometimes the simulator wasn't even working and you just had to walk through the simulator

898
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,640
like just to get through into the restaurant.

899
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,200
It was, it was bad news.

900
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,820
We'll show you a video if you're curious.

901
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,820
Just keep walking.

902
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,880
They had one in Schomburg, Illinois where I grew up.

903
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,880
Oh, really?

904
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,880
Oh wow.

905
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,880
There was another multiple.

906
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,880
This mall had, we got to do all episode about the Schomburg mall.

907
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,880
Oh, Woodfield mall.

908
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

909
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
There's, yeah, there was a lot of weird.

910
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,880
The fans demanded.

911
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,880
The only rainforest cafe still there.

912
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,880
Geez, really?

913
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,880
One of the only rainforests that still exists.

914
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,880
Wow.

915
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,600
And the, and of course the Disney, the Mickey's kitchen.

916
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,600
Oh yes, that was one of the Mickey's.

917
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,600
Whoa, I didn't know that.

918
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
The Disney store.

919
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,920
There were only two locations of a Disney store restaurant.

920
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,560
So it's kind of like the one here in Los Angeles that's attached to the movie theater, the

921
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,840
ice cream shop kind of.

922
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,840
Yeah.

923
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,840
It's an ice cream shop Disney store.

924
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,840
Yeah.

925
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,840
That's an audio elevator.

926
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,840
Yeah.

927
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,840
With El Capitan.

928
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,840
Yeah.

929
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:52,160
But you were, well so that's like going to that bar for stupid reasons in Times Square.

930
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,640
You must have had all this like, this, this, this Pleasure Island and Disney affection

931
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,880
growing up and like, you must have like badly wanted to take this into your adulthood and

932
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,480
get people to dumb restaurants.

933
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,480
Oh, yeah.

934
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,240
I mean, it's a constant battle of people not wanting to go and do my stuff.

935
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:12,760
My wife, like, like, uh, for my birthday this year, like it was just, it was weird timing

936
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,360
we were away, we were back and she's like, what do you want to do?

937
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,960
And I was, she, oh, my wife was working.

938
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,960
That was what was happening.

939
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,760
And, and she's like, uh, and I was like, I'm just going to go to Disneyland.

940
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,760
I was like, it'll be fun.

941
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,560
Like I don't, like I didn't have anything planned for the day.

942
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,560
I was like, I'll come back.

943
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,800
And then she's like, why, why would you go there?

944
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,800
Like during the day by yourself?

945
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,800
I was like, no, no, it'd be fun.

946
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,800
Like I had a great time.

947
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:35,560
I went on that new Star Wars, like VR thing, which is amazing.

948
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,560
We just, we just did it.

949
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,560
Yeah.

950
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,120
But we're, yeah, we loved it.

951
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,120
Yeah.

952
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,120
I mean, it's great.

953
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
They're now they have one in Glendale now too.

954
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,120
Uh huh.

955
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,120
We did the Glendale one.

956
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,120
Yeah.

957
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,120
Yeah.

958
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,120
Yeah.

959
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,120
Right next to the JC pennies.

960
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,120
You got a VR spectacular.

961
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:54,320
You're making us fit that you were, your willingness to be open about going to Disneyland by yourself

962
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,280
makes us feel less alone.

963
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,520
Oh, I feel, I, I don't often admit it.

964
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,080
Like if people, I, I, I try to hide where I was, like I just got busted by my wife.

965
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,360
I didn't want to even tell her, but there's been days when I'm just like, I, I've had

966
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,960
that season pass or to do, I'd be like, I'll go down there and ride when they switch over

967
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,520
the haunted mansion into the nightmare before Christmas thing.

968
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,520
Like, and come back.

969
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,520
I don't care.

970
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,520
Sure.

971
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,520
Yeah.

972
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,520
Just that.

973
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,520
Yeah.

974
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,520
Yeah.

975
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,520
It's a luxury.

976
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,520
Yeah.

977
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,520
I, you know, I, that's making me realize I have been to Disneyland by myself and been

978
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,520
too ashamed to tell my wife.

979
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,520
That was what I did.

980
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,520
She'll find this out from listening that you ever done that.

981
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,520
She had maybe Lindsay knows where you're coming from.

982
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,240
You feel alone when I go by, I feel like I'm not.

983
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,480
So you guys have all gone by yourself.

984
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,480
I've gone by myself.

985
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,400
It's usually like I have something to do at wonder con or there's something around.

986
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,480
I don't think I've gone down alone and not told anybody, but I've certainly been in the

987
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,480
park.

988
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,200
I've drank alone at trader Sam's.

989
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,640
I've drank alone at the bar at the car.

990
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,640
They circle.

991
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,840
I've maybe drank alone at that circle one in the middle of downtown.

992
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,720
By the way, I'm going to say car thief circle might be my favorite.

993
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,720
Yes.

994
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,720
Very good.

995
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,720
We love the lounge too.

996
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,520
Have you ever done in the middle of the day?

997
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,000
I'm sure there's a 10th time I've said this, you go and you have a, a, a Walt scotch mister

998
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,720
Manhattan and it totally reinvigorates you for the, like it's a good mid day.

999
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,040
I had a martini there.

1000
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,040
I should have done that.

1001
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,920
I did a mid day drink there cause I was like, why not?

1002
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,920
I'm here.

1003
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,920
This is great.

1004
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,920
Not a bad line too.

1005
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,320
I went down in December, like just on a weekday just to see, cause I was like going home like

1006
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,760
two days later for like a week or two to see my family for the holidays.

1007
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,500
And I was like, oh, I'm not, I didn't, I can't schedule.

1008
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,040
No one else could go down and it's like, well, I want to see Christmas.

1009
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,280
I want to see Disneyland at Christmas.

1010
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,360
So I just went and then I was like middle of the day, I was very tired.

1011
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,040
I was like, I'm going to go eat at the hotel and I went to whitewater snacks.

1012
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,160
The quick service restaurant.

1013
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,320
It's all the way in the back.

1014
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,320
It's very quiet.

1015
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,280
They pump in nature sounds and soothing music.

1016
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,480
I had the whole restaurant to myself.

1017
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,240
I remember now I went down, I have said this before.

1018
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,320
I went down to see Dick Fendi in the parade.

1019
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,320
Oh yes.

1020
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,320
I remember.

1021
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,320
For like an hour.

1022
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,320
It was an hour.

1023
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,320
I don't think I went on a ride.

1024
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,320
I think I literally got out.

1025
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,320
I bought a cupcake.

1026
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,920
I watched an old man in a car go down main street and I was out of there.

1027
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,480
Cause I had like, I think I had to do an, I think we had an improv practice that I had

1028
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,480
to get back to.

1029
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,480
I think that's right.

1030
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,320
You know, it's like my, like when I, I think I got used to it because when I would go with

1031
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,180
my family, I'm an only child.

1032
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:24,880
So they would like my parents, they, even though they have a Disney timeshare, they

1033
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,200
don't seemingly, uh, like the parks.

1034
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,520
They really like the hotels and the restaurants.

1035
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,440
I think they almost just like that.

1036
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,920
They don't have to think about anything.

1037
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,680
It's like, why would I go to France when I could just have a nice French meal at this

1038
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,680
place?

1039
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,640
And you have to do research and look up where are the nice hotels and where are the nice

1040
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,640
roads?

1041
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,040
You know, you go to Disney world, they'll all find them somewhere.

1042
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,040
She's so excited.

1043
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,240
She's like, I checked my bags at the airport and then they're in my hotel room.

1044
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,320
Cause she does like the Disney, the bus and everything.

1045
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,440
So I mean, by the way, I'm speaking about, oh, this is the thing.

1046
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,440
That's what happened.

1047
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,200
I went to club 33, but I went there with friends.

1048
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,840
Then I spent a week in Alani, the Disney resort in Hawaii.

1049
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:12,240
And then my son's birthday was on Monday and I brought him there and that, that was the

1050
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,920
most Disney I've done in a very long time.

1051
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:21,640
You know, I know somebody who was in at Alani when the, uh, the death notice went out when

1052
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,320
like, oh, like the alert.

1053
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,320
Yeah.

1054
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,320
Yeah.

1055
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,320
What did they say it was like?

1056
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,920
Uh, like it just, it was almost too surreal to believe and just everybody's looking at

1057
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:36,320
like, he's got to maintain calm for the kids have to just, but like you go outside and

1058
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,000
everybody was, it was kind of like people lying each other.

1059
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,960
Like, is this real or we all is a, is a, is a bomb coming our way right now.

1060
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,560
And he said like the bonding after it had happened was phenomenal.

1061
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,360
They're like every single person you ran into is like, Hey, we made it.

1062
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,360
Wow.

1063
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:56,320
Like just every, there was this like the great bonding of humanity happened from that.

1064
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,640
We all had the experience of getting a fucking alert on our phones saying we're going to

1065
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,640
die.

1066
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,600
Well, it may be most of us had to deal with children and like, how do we, yeah, I could

1067
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,600
like, I could not imagine.

1068
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:10,000
I talked to, like, I did this little boat trip at off the Alani and I asked the guys

1069
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
like, what was it like?

1070
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,840
And he was like, yeah, they were really nice to Disney people invited us into the hotel

1071
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,840
and they were like, Hey, you want to hang out here?

1072
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:21,000
Like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, because I spend your last hour

1073
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
home or whatever.

1074
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,680
So we just like hung out in the hotel with them and they were like, nice to us.

1075
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:31,120
And it was like, which is seemingly was surprising to me from about Disney, like being like,

1076
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,840
I can see Disney at that point being like, you know, you guys kind of work on the water.

1077
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,960
So I maybe stay down there and you could be great.

1078
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,960
Cost us money.

1079
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,960
Also, yeah, this place gets destroyed.

1080
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,480
Well, the hurricane last year that hit Florida, like Disney got a lot of good press because

1081
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,560
like they went out of their way to feed people and like they gave like next to nothing rooms

1082
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,960
to Florida residents and there were characters around.

1083
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,400
There was activities for kids and buffets and like Kristen Bell was singing like show

1084
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,320
to the show tunes.

1085
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:10,200
She got Josh Gads family rooms, which and I believe that was a one 80 because I think

1086
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:15,200
they've kind of miffed it on hurricane prep in the past, but they seemed like they did

1087
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,560
a good job in 2017.

1088
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:22,920
Well, you know who really miffed it on hurricane prep was the pleasure family who let the island

1089
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,680
fall into disarray.

1090
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,600
I don't know if you read the backstory of Pleasure Island.

1091
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,080
This backstory is so confusing.

1092
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:31,560
Can you like try to break it down because they turn to you, Jason.

1093
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:36,720
I have a couple of I have a couple of questions about it because I did enough research that

1094
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,360
made me confused about it.

1095
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,880
I don't think any amount of research there is so much.

1096
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,320
There's so much.

1097
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,320
Merryweather Adam pleasure.

1098
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,000
Merryweather Adam pleasure.

1099
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Before we start this.

1100
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,280
So what and maybe you guys found this.

1101
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,360
This is called Pleasure Island, which is from Pinocchio.

1102
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,840
The name Pleasure Island is from Pinocchio.

1103
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,200
It's the evil place.

1104
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,720
It's the debaucherous place that the kids go that they should not.

1105
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:07,120
They learn a lesson not to drink and smoke and turn into donkeys.

1106
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,800
And now here's my question.

1107
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,800
So that's the theme.

1108
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,800
Right.

1109
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,800
You should just stick to that.

1110
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,320
Call it pleasure island because it's based on Pinocchio and yeah, and make it.

1111
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,720
But I guess it has a very evil negative connotation.

1112
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,720
That must be.

1113
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,720
They had to invent another definition.

1114
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,720
Yes.

1115
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,720
But they're not named pleasure yet.

1116
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,720
Right.

1117
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,720
That don't call it Pleasure Island.

1118
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,840
That's that's what I find so bizarre about it is because when people hear it, 99% of

1119
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,680
all the dads who went here were like, let me look into the backstory of this place.

1120
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,520
And then he's like, oh, it's not the Pinocchio thing.

1121
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,080
It's a man named Merryweather.

1122
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,080
OK.

1123
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,600
And then the big mascot is not Merryweather pleasure.

1124
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,600
It's Jessica Rabbit.

1125
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,600
Right.

1126
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,600
But also the fun.

1127
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,600
Funmeister.

1128
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,200
But then there's no visual depiction of Merryweather pleasure anywhere.

1129
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,200
Right.

1130
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,200
Only in the Adventurers Club.

1131
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,920
He's in a picture in the Adventurers Club.

1132
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,480
But but then every place had a plaque.

1133
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,480
Yeah.

1134
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,420
There were 26 plaques scattered about the island.

1135
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:06,120
The plaques were black with like gold ish.

1136
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,280
So hard to see at night.

1137
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,840
And they made an incredibly convoluted.

1138
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:17,240
I mean, here at the entrance plaque, this is like a video drum one.

1139
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,520
The video drum one is one of my favorite ones.

1140
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:26,640
Well, this is just a snippet of the unverifiable anecdotal purely subjective theoretical alleged

1141
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,240
purported history.

1142
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,640
Also your stats.

1143
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,800
So like there it's a gag.

1144
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,100
It's like this is fake.

1145
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,880
They're telling you it's fake.

1146
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,480
Founded in 1911.

1147
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,320
Founded in 1911.

1148
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:45,000
Merryweather Pleasure's profitable canvas manufacturing and sale fabricating empire founded on this

1149
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,640
island provided him with capital to indulge his lifelong interest in the exotic, the experimental

1150
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,040
and the unexplainable.

1151
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:55,640
And very quick side track to that, because I found a longer history that explained that

1152
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,080
he was he made sales.

1153
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,360
That's what Merryweather Pleasure did.

1154
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:04,120
That's what all these warehouses were were sale manufacturing rooms, warehouses.

1155
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,280
And there was like a failing business until World War One.

1156
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,680
So he was he's a war profiteer is who Merryweather Pleasure is.

1157
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,440
He is a war profiteer.

1158
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,320
He is also known as the Grand Funmeister.

1159
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:23,440
So the funmeister is a nod to its own made up history.

1160
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,600
How much fun would it have been to have a man dressed like, you know, like almost like

1161
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,920
a life sized version of the Monopoly man.

1162
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:35,080
And I remember the brother, well, yeah, and walking around and just being a gregarious

1163
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:39,160
sort, you know, you put a big mustache on him, give him a monocle and let him just run

1164
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,160
around there.

1165
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,720
Like he's the ghost of Merryweather.

1166
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,720
Merryweather Pleasure.

1167
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,360
They didn't they don't want to go all in on him, though, because like that's probably

1168
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,640
like teens are like, who the fuck's this old man?

1169
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,640
Like they wouldn't like that.

1170
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,040
They want a sexy cartoon woman or they want a moon man.

1171
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,160
By the way, speaking of ghosts, I just remember that one of the things the Avengers Club,

1172
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,360
they wanted to do is drink with a ghost.

1173
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,360
Yes.

1174
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,920
They wanted to do the Haunted Mansion technology to project a ghost next to you.

1175
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,360
So you'd be in this ghost bar.

1176
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,240
I thought that was so someone would be playing a ghost and talking, but it would look like

1177
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,240
they were.

1178
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,400
Yeah, it's amazing in another room.

1179
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,400
Yes, they are.

1180
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,400
It is live.

1181
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,400
Yes.

1182
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,400
Whoa, that's cool.

1183
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,320
I know there was a bunch of like expansion plans for it if it was like the most popular

1184
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,120
thing ever, which it wasn't.

1185
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,000
But I will say I bet it would be now.

1186
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,440
Yeah, it would be now.

1187
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:27,120
And there were plans to put an adventurous club in downtown Disney in Anaheim, according

1188
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,160
to Jim Hill, I believe he mentioned that on a recent podcast.

1189
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,000
They were going to put it out here.

1190
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,560
And then as they started to dial back with California Adventure in downtown Disney, we're

1191
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,300
going to be that was gone.

1192
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,440
That stinks because, you know, they put in like that that store that take pictures of

1193
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,680
babies and like Bean Pods or whatever it is.

1194
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,520
You know, that may be gone now because of that.

1195
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,520
Yeah, yeah.

1196
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,520
Yeah.

1197
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,040
That was there for a long time.

1198
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:55,800
But maybe now in this like elevated with the level of escape room and all that stuff.

1199
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,400
I think the teaming and everything.

1200
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,440
Yeah, I feel like that's what Star Wars is going to be.

1201
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,440
Yes.

1202
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,320
It's kind of like interactive, fully like, you know what I think?

1203
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:08,360
And this is it goes back to like this dumb thing of like, I feel like 40s is lost on

1204
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:12,640
people on how this get maybe just watch Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.

1205
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,200
And at a certain point, someone's like, yes, this is what people want.

1206
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,200
They want to watch.

1207
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,440
They want to watch a movie that was like the old serials because that's what Indiana Jones

1208
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,440
is like.

1209
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,960
Indiana Jones is like, no, no, Indiana Jones is still like a contemporary movie.

1210
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:30,240
Yes, it takes place in the 40s, but it's not like literally like it's not like it's not

1211
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,200
nodding its head to the 40s so much.

1212
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,760
You're like, hey there, what's going on over there?

1213
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,360
You know, it's like, it's not like that.

1214
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,360
People don't want.

1215
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,360
I want it.

1216
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,360
But you know who does?

1217
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,360
Yeah, me too.

1218
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,360
Yeah, I'm all in.

1219
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,360
The Avengers Club imprinted on my subconscious so much.

1220
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:47,640
Anytime I see something of like, you know, mid century explore, I'm like, all right,

1221
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,760
got to make sure to see that at least on DVD.

1222
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,760
Oh, 100 percent.

1223
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,760
Like, yeah, I would.

1224
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,800
I would be going if it was like if it was that.

1225
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,120
I mean, that's why I like Trader Sam's to a certain degree.

1226
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,080
Yes, because Trader Sam's has that same kind of energy.

1227
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,080
It's like it's an explorer.

1228
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,080
It's a pirate theme.

1229
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,480
It's a this, you know, with all the artifacts he brought back from.

1230
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,960
Yeah, that's that's why.

1231
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,680
No one has like art of artifacts.

1232
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,680
Yeah.

1233
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,440
Well, if you go on to the oh, I haven't gone to the Trader Sam's.

1234
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,480
It's like a year old to a year and a half.

1235
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,480
Something like that.

1236
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,480
It's in the Polynesian.

1237
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,240
Oh, I just went to the Indiana Jones bar.

1238
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,240
Yes, John does.

1239
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,240
He's bringing you guys.

1240
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,240
Yeah, that was fun.

1241
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,960
Yeah, that's a great bar because that's like, you know, that's a perfect theme.

1242
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:30,440
It's Indiana Jones and like they got the plane is like a big decked out restaurant out there.

1243
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,840
It's perfect in the former Pleasure Island.

1244
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,840
Exactly.

1245
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,240
And that's in the landing is what it all became.

1246
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,240
Yes.

1247
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,240
Specific area.

1248
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,240
Right.

1249
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,240
So you had the Jason.

1250
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,240
You were getting there.

1251
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,240
Twenty six.

1252
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,240
Well, one of my favorite ones.

1253
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,240
Huh?

1254
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,240
I can't read one of my favorite.

1255
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:51,120
OK, this is I think the one on the video drum one, which is basically a club that had just

1256
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,040
a lot of music videos playing in it.

1257
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,040
Video video.

1258
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,040
Sorry.

1259
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,040
I was East.

1260
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,040
Yeah.

1261
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,040
Oh, it was all ages.

1262
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,040
This was the only all ages built for Island founder.

1263
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:07,240
Meriwether Pleasure's son, Henry, the mad genius of Lake Buena Vista and Henry's life

1264
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:11,120
work, the pleasure cellular automation.

1265
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:16,640
OK, so that's so that's that Henry died thinking his experiments in artificial intelligence

1266
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:23,040
had failed, but when the building was reopened in 1987, the Ottoman the automaton was alive

1267
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,040
and thriving.

1268
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:30,400
In fact, it is directed the refurbishing of its home and design the sophisticated computer

1269
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,080
hardware that shows itself to its best advantage.

1270
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,800
That does not make sense.

1271
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,720
It's a poorly worded thing.

1272
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,960
I'm not I was reading it.

1273
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,960
I'm hitting the periods.

1274
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,960
It is.

1275
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,960
It doesn't really.

1276
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,920
Yeah, no, it's yeah, it's all wordy.

1277
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,920
It's tough.

1278
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,160
They needed an editor.

1279
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,640
He had to in the history.

1280
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:53,920
He had two sons, Henry and Stewart, and they're like Trump fail.

1281
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,160
They're like Donald Jr. and Eric.

1282
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:01,240
They just like if you follow the line through these plaques, they're constantly fucking

1283
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,240
up.

1284
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,240
Literate.

1285
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,240
Their mismanagement led to the bankruptcy of the island.

1286
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:11,680
Yeah, and they had gotten vacated and then Hurricane Connie hit and that wiped it out

1287
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,680
all together.

1288
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:18,480
So yeah, it was a wealthy industrialist who had two idiot sons who fucked up his empire.

1289
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,760
This is my favorite plaque.

1290
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,080
It was at the lookout point at Pleasure Island.

1291
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:28,200
And this this is my favorite because it's so off game of everything else.

1292
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:33,560
Son of Island founder, Meriwether Pleasure, paranoid Henry Pleasure camped up here every

1293
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:40,760
single night from 1981 from December 8th, 1941 to VJ Day.

1294
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:45,440
He was convinced that the Axis powers were plotting an assault on America by coming ashore

1295
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:51,040
at Pleasure Island, which was then and remains 80 miles from the Atlantic Ocean.

1296
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,880
In his nearly four years of vigilance, Henry fired his musket only once.

1297
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,960
Musket is a weird detail.

1298
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:02,720
He mistook a family of herons for the leading edge of an invasion force.

1299
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,080
The herons escaped unharmed.

1300
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:11,840
This is like a this is backstory that seems like the stuff that you write and you're like,

1301
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,840
oh, I'll never use that.

1302
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,000
And I guess it's like it's almost like they go, well, I don't mean like it's like that's

1303
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,120
for me to know to write the story, but no one should ever know because it's inconsequential.

1304
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:26,000
Like you're like actor backstory and something just in case anybody needs to know.

1305
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,440
Yeah, it's it's so sad.

1306
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:33,120
We could make a better pleasure island right now in the give us just give us the same exact

1307
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,840
material we could make.

1308
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:38,480
It would be more functional and complete than this.

1309
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,760
This seems like this seems like Michael Eisner is like dumb ideas.

1310
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,760
Yeah, it's pleasure.

1311
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,760
Go, go, go.

1312
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,720
I feel like maybe it was the imagineers were like, here's the deal.

1313
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,720
We're going to make 26 plaques.

1314
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,920
You guys write whatever you want on them.

1315
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,520
We're going to sneak them in in the middle of the night.

1316
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,800
I'll never see it.

1317
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,800
No one will care.

1318
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,280
Like we won't get this approved.

1319
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,120
There's no like this is our we're a bunch of fucking nerds for the 40s and for like

1320
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,520
people like firing muskets.

1321
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:05,600
We're going to put these plaques up like because again, no dad ever read these.

1322
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,080
No no one cared.

1323
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,280
Ninety nine percent of the people didn't know you were walking around by yourself.

1324
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,280
Yeah, right.

1325
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,280
You didn't really read them.

1326
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,920
I didn't know that these even existed until I did this research.

1327
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,320
I mean, let's in front of the comedy club.

1328
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,320
This is this one.

1329
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:23,400
This building became a storage facility when Pleasure Island was electrified in 1928.

1330
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,280
So does that mean hit by lightning or got electricity?

1331
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,680
Either way, it's not clear.

1332
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,440
And then it goes six years later, the power station became home to the Pleasure Island

1333
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:38,160
thespian players founded and featuring Isabella Pleasure, wife of island founder and drama

1334
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,800
enthusiast Meriwether Pleasure.

1335
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,280
The players specialized in elaborate central Florida historical pageants, including the

1336
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,200
Seminole song of the Seminole.

1337
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:52,880
Now, but why do we need to know that it's a storage facility that was electrified and

1338
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,440
then it became this other thing?

1339
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,720
It's like it's it's not it's not it's nonsense.

1340
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,720
It's nonsense.

1341
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,920
Also, I read all of these plaques.

1342
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:06,280
And if you ask me right now how many of them were power plant themed, I'd go like, uh,

1343
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,920
half half of them were power plant themed.

1344
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:13,360
They're all where that's the that's the flaw in the design of all warehouses.

1345
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:18,160
I mean, it's like it's like it's like too much like there's too many points on the scale

1346
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,440
because they're supposedly like this thing was discovered by the Imagineers who got it

1347
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,440
back on its feet.

1348
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,440
Yeah.

1349
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:29,000
It's a much simpler line to draw, like, well, this man owns the things and it's a fun place

1350
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,480
for children to like or for teens to go.

1351
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,480
That's so much cleaner.

1352
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:37,160
It's like it's not an unheard of thing in this world that you take like a dilapidated

1353
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,600
warehouse area and turn it into a bar area like that.

1354
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,760
You don't have to buy the way many, many pages of novel.

1355
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:48,480
They were already stealing Church Street Station, which is like the downtown Orlando.

1356
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,380
Thank God you said church station because I spent two hours last night going down this

1357
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,380
rabbit hole.

1358
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:54,380
I'm ready.

1359
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:59,480
Church Street Station, I think just like Adventurers Club opened me up to this thing.

1360
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,000
They had the they had like a haunted mansion there.

1361
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Yes.

1362
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,080
I'll walk through haunted mansion like a reach out and like the whole you had to walk through

1363
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,680
by putting your hand on someone's shoulder in front of you and you walk through as a

1364
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:12,480
line and it was the first time I ever gone in anything where people like jumped out at

1365
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,760
you or chased you with chainsaws like one.

1366
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,760
It was a very like a lot of money.

1367
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,760
You went.

1368
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,760
I went.

1369
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,760
Which is crazy because I never went.

1370
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,760
I didn't even know really this existed.

1371
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,120
Scott said this like Church Street Station me a while ago.

1372
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,080
Is there anything weird to do in Orlando?

1373
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:31,560
And I was like, Church Street Station, but it's it's totally desolate, much like a merry

1374
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,720
weather Pleasures Island.

1375
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,400
It was like 70s and 80s was the heyday of it.

1376
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,640
And it's the reason why Disney made Pleasure Island to put it out of business to try to

1377
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,640
get some of this money.

1378
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,040
Yeah, yeah, this is what they do.

1379
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,480
This is what MGM Studios was.

1380
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,520
They tried to put Universal out of business or to or like Barbush Gardens.

1381
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,520
We don't want people going to a zoo.

1382
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,520
Let's have a zoo.

1383
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:51,520
Exactly.

1384
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,760
So a man named Bob Snow came up with Church Street Station and he was the one and it was

1385
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,120
a crazy like you would pay like ten bucks or five bucks and all these different places

1386
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,160
were available to you very quickly.

1387
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,960
I'll name some of the places.

1388
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,800
Apple Annie's, Rosie O'Grady's.

1389
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:07,800
I wrote your grades.

1390
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,800
I brought a date there.

1391
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:09,800
Yeah.

1392
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,800
Wow.

1393
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:11,800
Great.

1394
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:16,680
It was actually the first time that my parents met my girlfriend's parents at Rosie O'Grady's.

1395
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,680
Wow.

1396
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,680
I have a souvenir mug.

1397
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:19,680
Wow.

1398
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,840
But the say the full title Rosie O'Grady's Good Time Emporium.

1399
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,840
Yeah, sorry, sorry.

1400
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,840
Again, a very Simpson's.

1401
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,160
It's so much like Uncle Mo's.

1402
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,160
I know.

1403
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,160
Family feedback.

1404
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,160
Yeah.

1405
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:35,960
The Chenyan Opera House, which they like recorded a TV show from there.

1406
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,040
And if you look at look on YouTube, they have all the episodes of this Chenyan Opera House

1407
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,760
show and they have Merle Haggard on it.

1408
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,600
Lee Greenwood, Tammy Wynette, Boxcar Willie.

1409
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:50,720
Every country star you can imagine did this show that was at Church Street Station.

1410
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:51,720
It's insane.

1411
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,680
What was the word you were saying before Opera House?

1412
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,680
I couldn't hear it.

1413
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,680
Was I mispronouncing it?

1414
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,680
Chenyan?

1415
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:57,680
Cheyenne?

1416
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:58,680
Cheyenne.

1417
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,680
Oh, I'm sorry.

1418
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,680
Oh, okay.

1419
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,680
I only know that because I have a relative name Cheyenne.

1420
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,680
I otherwise might not know.

1421
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,680
Oh, yeah.

1422
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,680
Okay.

1423
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,680
I probably wrote that.

1424
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,400
It was also the Orchid Garden Ballroom.

1425
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,920
And then my favorite title is Phineas Fogg's Balloon Works.

1426
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,560
That's so Disney.

1427
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,560
Which is the most.

1428
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,560
That's so Dream Finder-y.

1429
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,560
Yeah.

1430
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:21,000
It's before Dream Finder and before like fantastical like Man in a Balloon.

1431
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,200
Is Phineas Fogg the character from Around the World?

1432
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,200
I believe so, yeah.

1433
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,200
I think that's right.

1434
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,200
That makes sense.

1435
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:31,720
It sounds like that Troy McClure.

1436
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:32,720
Another one.

1437
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,720
Horatio Ocknagels.

1438
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:39,040
Those are the era of Simpsons writers must have been down with Disney stuff.

1439
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:43,840
And obviously as South Park is and I think the Adventurers Club is referenced in a little

1440
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:48,240
bit in the last episode with Chef, the Super Adventure Club.

1441
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,240
Yes.

1442
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:52,320
That's got to be a little Disney reference.

1443
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:58,720
I was going through like people's like memories of this place and I was getting so nostalgic

1444
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,400
for a place I had never been.

1445
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,640
Like Hard Rock Park.

1446
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,960
I was like Hard Rock Park, but like Hard Rock Park was a little funnier.

1447
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,560
I was getting legit like, wow, what a place.

1448
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:10,400
If I was only like I was imagining working at Phineas Fogg.

1449
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,840
It was like 2 a.m. and I'm so tired.

1450
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:16,480
And I'm like really getting nostalgic for all of this bullshit.

1451
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,000
And then there's also people like talking about, you know, just how much fun it was.

1452
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,320
Then there's people that are talking about how they would pregame for a Jimmy Buffett

1453
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,440
concert at Church Street Station.

1454
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:30,560
Well, to me Church Street Station felt like very like adult.

1455
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,400
And I think Pleasure Island tried to split the difference.

1456
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,880
It was like, can we do adults and kids?

1457
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,920
It felt like this is where people in Orlando went to get hammered.

1458
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:42,060
It was like, you know, and it was like fun and safe.

1459
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:44,800
And I think Orlando didn't have much outside of the parks.

1460
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,240
And this felt like the community of Orlando to a certain extent.

1461
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:52,000
It's like we're going to go to like we're going to go down to our like New Orleans,

1462
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
like whatever that Main Street in New Orleans is where everyone.

1463
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Oh, sure.

1464
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,040
And the bars are all it's separate establishments, but it's all one big neighborhood.

1465
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,920
You're walking down one block and it's like and everything's there and everyone's seeing

1466
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,720
each other and it's like no cars are there.

1467
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,040
And it's like, well, at least my memory of it was like that.

1468
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,120
It was like you could walk from place to place.

1469
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:16,440
Watching people's home movies on YouTube of Pleasure Island, it was very clearly like

1470
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:25,400
a mix of locals in club where see like couples, couples in like vacation leisure where like

1471
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:30,800
a lot of flowery polos tucked into jeans and then four person family, like families with

1472
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,060
kids and they all look tired.

1473
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:36,400
So that is a very odd melting pot to encounter.

1474
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,280
Yeah, it's it's it was again, it's a bad it's a bad thing.

1475
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,640
I think the reason why like even Disney Springs is having issues now, it's like they want

1476
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,960
to like attract people from Orlando to come there and do their like mall shopping.

1477
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:47,960
Right.

1478
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,200
It just seems like it's out of the way.

1479
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,200
Yeah.

1480
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,120
And I feel like if you live in Orlando, you're probably like, I don't want to go there to

1481
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:53,120
do my my mall.

1482
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,120
Right.

1483
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,120
Just basic shopping.

1484
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,120
Yeah.

1485
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,120
Do you have more?

1486
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,120
Is there more church?

1487
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,120
Well, they have to think about that.

1488
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,920
I don't want to go to anyone.

1489
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,000
I didn't see I didn't have a memory about that.

1490
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
I did find the Church Street Station promo video, which is a big.

1491
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Did you see have you seen this?

1492
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,320
Didn't we text about this?

1493
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:13,240
Did the disease with with I think we did in the streets?

1494
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,240
Yes.

1495
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,240
OK, yes.

1496
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,240
I found it.

1497
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,240
There we go.

1498
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,240
So we'll post this, obviously.

1499
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,240
This time.

1500
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,280
Yeah, I love the vibe of this.

1501
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,280
It's like a more slower themed like Cheers.

1502
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:28,040
I mean, it's like if Cheers didn't have all those lovable characters.

1503
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:31,320
This look some of this looks like Farrell's the ice cream.

1504
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,320
Oh, yeah.

1505
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,320
Oh, yeah.

1506
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,320
Old timey.

1507
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,320
Yeah.

1508
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,320
Yeah.

1509
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,100
And then there's this other ad that's that's like eight minutes long.

1510
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,140
That's like this.

1511
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:45,320
A man just carving a Marlin out of some ice.

1512
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:51,460
A good place for good people.

1513
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:55,680
That's a little sexy.

1514
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,400
Lady putting a garter on.

1515
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:02,480
But this is like this whole idea, like these places came alive at night.

1516
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,380
Yes, that was like that.

1517
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,040
Wait, wait.

1518
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:09,040
I'm ready for a brand new season

1519
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:13,040
So I'm here every time I try

1520
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,040
To advance into the future

1521
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,040
I'm looking for a car

1522
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,040
And even now I'm alone

1523
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:40,040
It's really sincere fun and Eisner is like, I must crush this. Yes. It...

1524
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,040
False Louis.

1525
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:51,040
This was the fourth most visited tourist destination after Busch Garden Seaworld Disney.

1526
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,040
Wow. Wow.

1527
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:59,040
Well because I think it felt like adult... I mean that's what my parents like going to Church Street Station.

1528
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:05,040
Because it's a real place for grown-ups. Yeah. It was established by not a Bizarre Kids Corporation.

1529
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,040
Yeah, so this goes on like this.

1530
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:13,040
But you end up with the dinner where things get a little more stately.

1531
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:20,040
See we didn't leave the Disney bubble that much. We mostly left to go to Universal.

1532
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:24,040
My dad and I would leave the bubble. My mom would stay in the bubble.

1533
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:29,040
Oh and then if we had a kitchen we would go to the grocery store.

1534
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:34,040
So you get the classic song Dancing in the Street in all these different styles.

1535
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:37,040
Yeah, there's a dinner is my favorite. Where was this ever airing?

1536
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,040
That's a very good question. It's just called a marketing video.

1537
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,040
Oh, okay. Yeah. It's pretty warm.

1538
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:46,040
If you don't feel like hearing this part up, it's all the different clubs sing Dancing in the Street.

1539
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:52,040
And then it changes to a more stately dinner where you hear, it's a place for folks to eat.

1540
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:58,040
That's a change I really like. But so Mike, I don't want to jump ahead of the order of things.

1541
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:59,040
No, no, it's okay.

1542
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:04,040
But do you know why what happened to Church Street besides Disney crippling the business?

1543
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,040
I probably came across it, but I don't remember.

1544
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:12,040
So it's in the window where Pleasure Island was doing well.

1545
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:15,040
Church Street station decays. Businesses start moving out.

1546
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:20,040
And Orlando has to do something big to try to get this area back on its feet.

1547
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:27,040
And they turn to the greatest industrialist in Orlando at that time, Lou Pearlman.

1548
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,040
Oh, wow.

1549
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:33,040
Will you, sir, turn this area around?

1550
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:37,040
Okay, I guess. I'll get some of the guys in here.

1551
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:44,040
And so in 2003, they give this guy $1.5 million in loans to the city of Orlando.

1552
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:49,040
And in 2003, the bands have already sued this guy.

1553
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,040
Backstreet and NSYNC have already sued.

1554
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:56,040
And there's certainly by 2003 the implication that this man is like a pedophile.

1555
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:59,040
And still Orlando is like, he's the solution.

1556
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:04,040
He's a guy saying that he's going to turn Church Street station into the hub of boy band culture.

1557
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:10,040
And he makes a promise that this is a place for him to like score dates.

1558
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:13,040
So well, this is all the boys here.

1559
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:18,040
All the kids will be dancing in the streets here.

1560
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:22,040
There'll be many alleys that are difficult to escape from.

1561
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,040
All dead ends.

1562
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:28,040
Every alley is a trap doors spikes that close in on you.

1563
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:32,040
That's like four years after City Walk opens in the other side of Orlando.

1564
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,040
You've already got that going too.

1565
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:40,040
How is Pearlman going to and he makes a promise to he's like, we'll start small.

1566
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:43,040
2004 we will have we'll do some concerts.

1567
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:48,040
We'll have 150 outdoor street events, 150 days out of the year.

1568
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:51,040
And then the next year we'll get it up to 200.

1569
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:58,040
And I found an article from the Orlando Weekly from 2005 like for liberal writers like anybody been to any of those concerts?

1570
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,040
Any of those happen?

1571
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:02,040
No, not a single like he just didn't do it.

1572
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:07,040
And he pocketed the money and then he was arrested by the FBI in Malaysia or whatever.

1573
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,040
And he died in jail.

1574
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,040
Oh, my God.

1575
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:13,040
What a sad thing for the people of Orlando.

1576
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:20,040
All they had was a place where they could hang out where they weren't going to be totally inundated by like tourists all the time.

1577
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,040
Maybe there's a little bit more of a local culture there.

1578
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:31,040
And even though it was the biggest tourist attraction, I feel like they probably had their own thing and then not every like, you know, like Bannister everywhere you look at it.

1579
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:35,040
Not everything is shaped like Mickey or Jafar or whatever.

1580
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:38,040
Like there's some unbranded things in this area.

1581
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:38,040
Yeah.

1582
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:43,040
Characters like Phineas Fogg, you know, and the fake Gary Armstrong.

1583
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,040
Yeah.

1584
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,040
The you know, and Laurel and Hardy.

1585
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:49,040
Oh, they were like Laurel and Hardy running around in all the places.

1586
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:53,040
That sort of like old timey stuff like that still hasn't gone away.

1587
01:07:53,040 --> 01:08:01,040
I mean, Mike and I have both been to Disney Springs once it's like been fully operational and like the Edison is power plant theme.

1588
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,040
Right.

1589
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,040
Turn of the century power plant theme.

1590
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:06,040
Maria Enzo is an Italian restaurant in it.

1591
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:13,040
Looks like a 1940s like Golden Age of airline travel, 1940s, 50s airplane hangar.

1592
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:17,040
And then Jock Lindsay's that there's still all this old timey theming.

1593
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,040
It's a weird thing.

1594
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:26,040
I think it's like I don't know why we are doubling down on that because in my opinion, you know, look, it may be controversial.

1595
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:29,040
I think that City Walk is the only one who's nailed it.

1596
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,040
Like City Walk is like this is what you want.

1597
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,040
It's kind of like you got a big movie theater.

1598
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:40,040
There's some restaurants that you know, it's we're not theming these out to be like 1940s.

1599
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,040
There's no Keystone cops here.

1600
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,040
It's like it's Olive Garden.

1601
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,040
It's Bubba Gump.

1602
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:49,040
And like and we got a fountain that does that thing so your kids can run there and get soaked.

1603
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:53,040
And you know, and then there's like a couple of fun stores, a magnet store, the sock store.

1604
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,040
Sure.

1605
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:56,040
John Lovett's Comedy Club that's out here was out here.

1606
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:02,040
But like, you know, they're just kind of like walking around the Saddle Ranch if you want to get a little bit more risque, you know, you know, the clothes.

1607
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,040
Now I know it's a sad sad day.

1608
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:08,040
There's like, you know, like there's a big cup or something or the King Kong.

1609
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:14,040
There's big giant things you can take a picture of if you want, right? You don't have to learn a whole fucking story.

1610
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:17,040
It just seems like that's what you like when you want to go out.

1611
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:21,040
It's like, yes, we'll get a pizza and then go see a movie like I don't need to like.

1612
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:27,040
Yeah, come my friend to a universe that your eyes may not understand.

1613
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:32,040
That said, I mean, obviously we like the theming restaurants itself.

1614
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:36,040
Also, when I was there packed everywhere, I walked by lines out the door.

1615
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:41,040
Yeah, August, if I was eating a bubblegum and Laurel and Hardy wandered by, I'd love it.

1616
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:45,040
Oh, I'm again, I'm seeing dismissive of all this.

1617
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:50,040
I'm 100 percent there. I ate at Jock Lindsay's by myself and waited until I could sit in the little like portal.

1618
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:55,040
Of course, like the submersible submarine thing.

1619
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,040
Populist idea.

1620
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:00,040
City Walk is the one that appeals really to the most.

1621
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,040
That's what I think everyone's trying to do.

1622
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:07,040
When they try to get too cheeky with it and I feel like Pleasure Island walk this weird middle ground of like a good bad idea.

1623
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:10,040
It's like it's almost Disney and it's almost City Walk.

1624
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:14,040
And what it turns out to be is a mess because the theming is half ass.

1625
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:17,040
It's like, well, Disney Quest doesn't fit with the theming of this.

1626
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:23,040
The comedy club is very different than an adventurous club and the clubs are just clubs.

1627
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,040
Well, that's I mean, we've barely talked about, though.

1628
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:31,040
I mean, even after reading for hours about these clubs, I had to go like, wait, so neon armadillo was the country.

1629
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,040
What was your age?

1630
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,040
Cage was different from Mannequin.

1631
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,040
And then one was the the roller skating one.

1632
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:42,040
I do. While we're on Disney stealing, I may have I have a story.

1633
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:47,040
Yeah. So I used to do comedy at this place called Chicago City Limits.

1634
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:51,040
It was in New York City and they did short form improv very much like what you'd see on who's on this.

1635
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:54,040
And anyway, like every time a bell rings, we're going to change our thing.

1636
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:59,040
So when they're opening a pleasure island, some people from Disney came and saw Chicago City Limits.

1637
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:03,040
And they're like, this is what we're opening up a brand new place.

1638
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:09,040
This is what we want to be in in in our in our new park.

1639
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:13,040
And we'll call it Chicago City Limits and we'll buy it.

1640
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,040
We'll do the whole thing. We'll move you guys there.

1641
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:21,040
So the head of Chicago City Limits at that time goes.

1642
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:28,040
We want 10 million dollars, you know, for the name, the name that didn't even really mean that much.

1643
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:31,040
Now, I was a member of Chicago City Limits. I've heard this now from multiple people.

1644
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:36,040
This is a true story. And then in Disney, OK, OK, OK, let's think about it.

1645
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:44,040
And Disney walked away, then went to behind Chicago City Limits, the owners back, hired everyone in the main stage show,

1646
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:50,040
took them and stole the entire show. So what you see, they open up with this review.

1647
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:57,040
And that was essentially what Chicago City Limits was. It was like improv, very mediocre sketch, improv, mediocre sketch.

1648
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,040
And that's kind of what this thing was.

1649
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:07,040
And then and then everyone, those people who perform there, who sold out Chicago City Limits, would just occasionally steal another performer.

1650
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,040
They would come down and then they would teach improv and then go.

1651
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:18,040
So I have all these friends who, like, migrated down there to do a essentially Chicago City Limits show that they just completely stole.

1652
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:21,040
And and it was lamented when I was at Chicago City Limits.

1653
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:28,040
I was like, oh, we could have been this we could have ultimately branded ourselves by being like Chicago City Limits at Disneyland.

1654
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:35,040
And the step to making it like a second city multiple others, like a silly or second city like that.

1655
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:39,040
They have a Vegas thing and exactly whatever something that feels like it makes it.

1656
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:46,040
But I just said that was like the best example of hubris and also the smartestness of like of Disney just going like, right, right, right.

1657
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:51,040
And then I was like, OK, cool. Think about it. And now we'll just take everyone from your show and make them.

1658
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:56,040
When it first opened, they were doing like a review called Forbidden Disney.

1659
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:02,040
Right. It was like a body sketch show about it was like body to the body.

1660
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:09,040
It was like I think it was like someone would play like Small World and let's kill this guy or like shoot him or something.

1661
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:14,040
But even if they shot him, it was like a gun that's a bang.

1662
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:22,040
Like, yeah, slumping down the adventure club, much more body in terms of people, the characters being drunk and horny.

1663
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:28,040
Like, yeah, like to me, like the Disney body was like, oh, the lines at Disney are pretty long.

1664
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:34,040
Oh, I can't believe they said it like, hey, we just spent a lot of money eating these hot dogs.

1665
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:37,040
It was like the most like we're poking fun, but not that much.

1666
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:41,040
Yeah. Thanks for coming down and, you know, it's a way we're we're always here.

1667
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:44,040
I appreciate it. It is a good value for your money.

1668
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,040
Really, if you think about all the things we have to offer.

1669
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,040
But it doesn't seem like that lasted.

1670
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:50,040
It seems like they pivoted to that short form.

1671
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,040
That short form thing.

1672
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:56,040
And then, yeah, and that's when I would go when I got a I think I'm back there in college.

1673
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:59,040
I went and visited a few friends that just were doing that show nightly.

1674
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:06,040
And I once got to play on that stage because I said, oh, yeah, so that was a very, you know, a fun thing.

1675
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:12,040
But then also a nerve wracking thing, because it is a level of improv and a level of language and a level of content.

1676
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,040
Yes, they are very comfortable with.

1677
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:18,040
And so I could only do the latest show that they had.

1678
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:26,040
And because it was like it's severely monitored by everybody like and it was like I was kind of snuck in to do the show and kept it very clean.

1679
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:31,040
It was a sort of like but yeah, it was not it used to be you can sort of do whatever you want.

1680
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,040
This is like this rules and parameters. Yeah.

1681
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:37,040
It's really polished. Yeah. And it was very simple improv games like literally.

1682
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,040
I think like every time this bell rings, you'll say something different.

1683
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:45,040
I was like, I just went to the store. Ding. I just went to the mall. Ding. I just went to the car dealership thing.

1684
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:51,040
You know, it wasn't like you weren't like improvising. You were just basically like coming up with specifics and puns.

1685
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,040
There's lots of rapid speed. Yeah.

1686
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:56,040
Did you that's that's cool. You got to play there.

1687
01:14:56,040 --> 01:15:04,040
The other there's there's folks who are there people who like did improv there who've made it out to New York or L.A.

1688
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,040
Jamie Denbo. Jamie Denbo. Yeah, I thought so.

1689
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:09,040
Yeah. James Dembeau. I performed at that comedy club as well.

1690
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:17,040
And then she had the real, in my opinion, crappy gigs that she worked at like innovations like she was doing like this this atmosphere of innovation.

1691
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:20,040
The innovation in the event in the Epcot. Yeah. And then inventions.

1692
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:29,040
Yeah. And I know I'm the only show you'll ever be on that will correct you on that.

1693
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:34,040
I knew I was like, I just want to make sure I wasn't trying to be a no, I didn't take it.

1694
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:37,040
The video drone. No, I'm like this is where I knew I was going to.

1695
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:42,040
I have so much Disney knowledge, but it's all falsely categorized.

1696
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:50,040
That's OK. But yeah, like she had like those jobs where like you'd have to like showing the houses of the future and doing the funny.

1697
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:54,040
But also we're also showing off that like, you know, Black and Decker does have a pretty cool back.

1698
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,040
You know, wow, that's a thin line.

1699
01:15:56,040 --> 01:16:04,040
And she was saying that there were like these dots on the floor that you'd have to step on and that would activate a light like it was like an automated show.

1700
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:08,040
It was a one person show that you were controlling all by what you were doing on the stage.

1701
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:15,040
Wow. Did you ever think about like, did you try to do like theme park entertainment as a regular anywhere?

1702
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:18,040
Yeah. All right. I'll tell you the two darkest moments of my life.

1703
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,040
That's funny. That's the response. They all involve.

1704
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:24,040
Yeah, I know. It's like so I was dating this girl.

1705
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:28,040
This is a girl who we met their parents at Rosie O'Grady's, you know, fun place.

1706
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:31,040
We got flaming drinks, watch show girls. A lot of fun time.

1707
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,040
But we were on the down. We were in the downward spiral of Rosie O'Grady.

1708
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:38,040
I think it was your great. He's like stuck it out because it's a great establishment.

1709
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,040
You know, it was on its way to being a bad time.

1710
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:42,040
Emporium. Yeah, it was an OK. Right.

1711
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:47,040
It was like a mediocre time to show girls not not on the bar.

1712
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,040
They would just be in the back. They don't kick all the way up.

1713
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,040
Yeah, like 30 degrees.

1714
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:58,040
So we were dating in college and I went to go visit her at home and she was like, we got to break up.

1715
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:01,040
And, you know, you're I was doing improv in New York City at this point.

1716
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:06,040
I was doing Chicago City Limits and and I was not going to spend New Year's Eve with her

1717
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:09,040
because I was going to do this New Year's Eve show in New York.

1718
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:12,040
It was like a really cool opportunity. It was cool.

1719
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:15,040
It was exciting. Like this is like the beginning of my career.

1720
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,040
I still kind of in college at this point.

1721
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,040
And she's like, oh, you got to break up.

1722
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:24,040
And, you know, you're too involved in this stuff and I can see it's not going to go away.

1723
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,040
And this is not going to work out.

1724
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:31,040
And and I was like, all right, you know what? I need to keep this relationship going.

1725
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:42,040
I'm going to join the comedy company at Pleasure Island and literally like because I know I've been in there.

1726
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:51,040
I can do this. And if I would have made that choice, my career would have gone in a drastically horrible, different.

1727
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:54,040
I would argue of not be here.

1728
01:17:54,040 --> 01:18:00,040
I would probably be in Orlando, you know, working at some something sad.

1729
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:04,040
The king of Orlando. I don't know.

1730
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:08,040
I don't know. I don't know.

1731
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,040
I would go to Orlando a million times.

1732
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:15,040
I just feel like if I would have just went there and been like, hey, I'm like trying to do comedy and be an actor.

1733
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:19,040
And then like I just maxed out at the comedy connection or whatever it is.

1734
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:22,040
Or you would have gotten it in sync.

1735
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:25,040
I think right. You've gotten the dance in that alley.

1736
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,040
You probably want to grab me.

1737
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:30,040
And then the second is this is not a dark moment.

1738
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:33,040
It was more like again, it was an opportunity.

1739
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:37,040
I always made this choice of not taking like the easy path.

1740
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:42,040
Like so Disney Cruises came and Disney Cruises like, hey, you want to come do Disney Cruise.

1741
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:48,040
And that was a really like you make one hundred and ten thousand dollars like for like a six month cruise.

1742
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:52,040
You couldn't get off. You were on the boat for six months.

1743
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:57,040
Like you could get off the boat. You could get off at ports, you know, but like you were you couldn't go home.

1744
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,040
Right. Right. So you're there. All your food was provided for.

1745
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:06,040
So you're you're keeping your hundred and ten like your room and board and your food is paid for.

1746
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:09,040
And you're just doing an improv show on that boat.

1747
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:12,040
And it was right at the start of the UCB.

1748
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:15,040
And I was like, should I do this? Like one hundred and ten thousand?

1749
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:19,040
Like that seemed like a gigantic sum of money.

1750
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:26,040
It is a gigantic sum of money. And and I and I opted not to do that and just do like free shows at UCB that were like, you know,

1751
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:31,040
robot TV at midnight on a Friday night, which I'm so happy that I did do.

1752
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:34,040
But it was like a moment where I was really like, what do I do? Do I do Disney?

1753
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:37,040
Because I love Disney. I was like, oh, that would be kind of great. I would. And that's the other part of it.

1754
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:43,040
I would love to work at Disney. Like my my dream thing would be like, wouldn't it be great if you could like run the Jungle Cruise like one time?

1755
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,040
Like that would be awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Like something like that would be fun.

1756
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:49,040
You know, I did. I was a tour guide. Oh, I know. Yeah.

1757
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:56,040
And I like I always say I would do if I could do it once a month, if they give me one shift a month, I would so happily.

1758
01:19:56,040 --> 01:20:00,040
That's the best. Then that was a fun one, too.

1759
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:03,040
But now it's like, isn't all it just like Jimmy Fallon doing it all. Right.

1760
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:08,040
They kick a lot. There's a lot of like clips and things you're required to do, but not necessarily any way.

1761
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:14,040
Anybody at the tour guide gig listening, you know, unless you're being secret shopped, you can kind of do what you want.

1762
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:18,040
Unless and then you imagine you had to fill a lot of time and that guy died on the earthquake ride. Right.

1763
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:22,040
Oh, I did talk about that. Yeah, that was an hour straight.

1764
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:26,040
The tour guide, the tour guide prays for something like that so we can really let it rip.

1765
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:33,040
That's what they told us in the training is like you will beg for these moments because it'll throw you off.

1766
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:43,040
It's like something different happening is such a big deal. So when so when that man died of a heart attack, I was time to shine in there.

1767
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:49,040
My friend, my friend who into like worked at Disney, like a couple of people I knew who worked there like out of college.

1768
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:54,040
And again, last night and I don't know, maybe I'm just depressed or something in general in life.

1769
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:59,040
But I was again getting very nostalgic. I go, why didn't I just go for six months and intern at Disney?

1770
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:03,040
That would have been so much fun because I'm reading all these pleasure island and we'll get to it.

1771
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:16,040
But I found the Pleasure Island memories Facebook page and I was reading through all of this stuff and I was legit going, man, this would have been fun if I was a certain age.

1772
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:19,040
And it was like there's no I think there's a right time to go.

1773
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:23,040
It's almost like you can go to Europe or you can go to Disneyland or Disney World.

1774
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:29,040
Like my sister in law did it, but she got like she worked there. She had a great time. She all lived in these big dorms. Everyone was in college.

1775
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:34,040
It was like a college thing. But she like was the pooper scooper behind the animals in the parade.

1776
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:40,040
Like that's what I was like her like her face job was that like, you know, some people like to be like Pluto.

1777
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:44,040
She got to be, you know, the person who picks up the poop in the parade.

1778
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:53,040
I went to an information session at my college for the college program and answered a trivia question correctly and got like a antenna topper.

1779
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:56,040
You know, the other pleasure may as well.

1780
01:21:56,040 --> 01:22:03,040
But it was some sort of thing where it's like there was no competent like my hand went up immediately.

1781
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:07,040
But they they have their own semester schedule.

1782
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:18,040
So it's like I would have had to missed a semester and missed half of a break. Like it was very it's almost it's almost built to mess up your college life.

1783
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:21,040
Yeah, it's like it because it doesn't work with any other kind like everybody is there.

1784
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:24,040
It's like, oh, yeah, you you mess up a year. Yeah.

1785
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:27,040
And you can do it after you finish your undergraduate.

1786
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:35,040
You can start right after like you can get your degree and then that summer like do the college program, even if you're out of college.

1787
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:39,040
But then at that point, I was kind of like, no, I did internships in L.A.

1788
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:43,040
And I have a lot of friends out there and I think I'll just go right out there.

1789
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:52,040
But yeah, I mean, I would love to like work in the like the if you could imagine years like that kind of level, that would be like the dream.

1790
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:55,040
That's what this is. This is just an ad for us to like, hey, guys, let us in.

1791
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,040
Like we got ideas to like it would be me.

1792
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:03,040
I would just love to see that like that to me is like because again, we can make a better pleasure island.

1793
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:07,040
We would never make a Jessica Rabbit themed store like you would.

1794
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:13,040
You know what? That's not going to be that's not going to run the life of this park.

1795
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:16,040
Sure. You know, I a store for Jessica Rabbit.

1796
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,040
That was like the third piece of the puzzle.

1797
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:28,040
There was like the pleasure island as Pinocchio, the fun of the pleasure island backstory plaques and then also the massive Jessica Rabbit Idol.

1798
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:29,040
Yes.

1799
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:40,040
And that very briefly was above the Jessica Rabbit store that didn't seem like it lasted long, but sold like sexy T-shirts and like lingerie with Jessica Rabbit on it, which is insane to say.

1800
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:43,040
Yeah, yeah. It's it's all like a comp.

1801
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:46,040
I assume I didn't read this, but this from other other stories about all this stuff.

1802
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:52,040
It's a compromise between the imagineers, probably like the sales department for merchandise and then just like corporate.

1803
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:55,040
So like I feel like it's all everyone's compromising.

1804
01:23:55,040 --> 01:24:03,040
So like the imagineers, I'm assuming because we know Joe Rody is an imagineer behind the Avengers Club and he's a guy who did Avatar land.

1805
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,040
He's a guy who did the Guardians.

1806
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:10,040
Right. Alani. He's very he loves these backstories and stuff.

1807
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:13,040
So that's Alani has like Kiki like I met Kiki at Alani.

1808
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:16,040
Alani is a Kiki is just like a Hawaiian woman who is yes.

1809
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,040
Yeah. And you go to Kiki's house.

1810
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:22,040
That's where the kids like have a thing and Kiki does breakfast and it's like and there's a story about Kiki.

1811
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:26,040
Kiki is a Disney character. She is in the mythology.

1812
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,040
I met Kiki. I have a picture with Kiki.

1813
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:34,040
Sure. You know, but how do they teach you about when do you get accustomed to Kiki?

1814
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:39,040
Do they send you a video or something? Kiki is it's sort of like where were you?

1815
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:43,040
Of course, this is Kiki's house. Like it was like you like you like catching up.

1816
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:46,040
Is it like Duffy the Disney? It's like hey Duffy, you love him.

1817
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:56,040
Yeah, because they have like a they have a great thing there where you can like they will babysit your children from like eight in the morning to nine at night or later.

1818
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,040
Yeah. And you could do that.

1819
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:01,040
And I saw many people drop off the kids. We didn't do that.

1820
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:05,040
We just would go there for family play every morning from eight in the morning to nine thirty.

1821
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:08,040
And then Kiki would be running family play.

1822
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:15,040
And, you know, and you think, all right, because Kiki's house and oh, well, so Kiki's house and you go in Kiki's house and you can go up the stairs.

1823
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:19,040
And you can go up the stairwell to her room and you put your ear to her door.

1824
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:22,040
You could hear her and her husband and they're talking like, oh, we're so excited.

1825
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:25,040
The kids are coming today. It's like a pre-recorded thing.

1826
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:31,040
And they're like they have like a whole conversation, Kiki and her husband about what they're going to do.

1827
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:36,040
So like that's yes, we got to watch the electrical bill this month.

1828
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:39,040
It's just way too high running the air this much.

1829
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:45,040
There should be like one day when they play of like again, kids are coming over again.

1830
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:48,040
We shouldn't disturb Kiki today.

1831
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:50,040
This is all news to me, this mythology.

1832
01:25:50,040 --> 01:26:00,040
Do you do you think because I am like I am a legitimate Disney World fan and theme park fan, but I think I am because I don't work there.

1833
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:04,040
Like I never worked there. Well, we talked to a past guest, Jenny Nicholson, about it.

1834
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:08,040
I worked there and she said she was exactly the same coming in and coming out. OK.

1835
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:11,040
So I mean, I think it's probably different for any of everyone.

1836
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:18,040
But the first script I ever wrote in L.A. was called Enchanted Kingdom, and it was a Disney World based script.

1837
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:21,040
And I'm like it's the one thing I wish I always got to do.

1838
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:26,040
Like I read all those books and stuff like I like it because there's like a book called like Mouse Secrets or something like that.

1839
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:30,040
Oh, yeah. Yeah. What's the what's the other tragic kingdom?

1840
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:35,040
Mouse tales. I think it's two books of mouse tales. Yeah.

1841
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:40,040
By the way, I feel like you guys often on the show reference some sites that I'm not familiar with.

1842
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:44,040
You don't say them by name. What are the sites that what are the sites?

1843
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:49,040
Oh, yeah. I see that on these Disney sites. I don't know what those Disney sites are that you guys go to shout them out.

1844
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:55,040
Is mice chat or mouse plan? I was I was mouse planet was a godsend for this.

1845
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:59,040
They had a lot of Pleasure Island, Screamscape, theme park.

1846
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:02,040
University played a lot into Hard Rock Park.

1847
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:07,040
Yes, there's WDW magic dot com, which I go to for the boards.

1848
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,040
That's the real gossip. There's a couple.

1849
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:15,040
There's a couple of real gossip pounds on that message board and you get some good tidbits from these people.

1850
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:18,040
Those are the basic ones. I think then the podcast we always talk about.

1851
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:21,040
Yes. Yeah. Jim Hill. I mean, I'm all on that.

1852
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:24,040
Listen to Lentus. Oh, yeah. I'm all I'm all on board.

1853
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:27,040
I have like sometimes two to three Disney podcasts.

1854
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:30,040
Season pass. Oh, I haven't heard season passes. Very good.

1855
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:35,040
I see. Like sometimes I always like the things they always shut me off about Disney podcast.

1856
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:40,040
Ultimately, there's a lot of them that are really hard to listen to from a just audio standpoint.

1857
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:45,040
Yeah, like Golden Shoe Horseshoe Review. I was like, I'm kind of interested in this, but I'm just having a.

1858
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,040
So everyone's someone's always calling in on Skype.

1859
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:50,040
You know, they're never in that same room together.

1860
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:53,040
Yeah, I was going to tell you that there's a great one.

1861
01:27:53,040 --> 01:28:03,040
I was on a podcast and they challenged me to they challenged me to like they they find out what you like and then they go.

1862
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:08,040
OK, well, I gave them like 10 10 things and then they surprised me with what they were going to test me on.

1863
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:12,040
They test me on my Walt Disney Land knowledge and I did very well.

1864
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:19,040
But I met this guy who was like the expert on Disneyland and his his Instagram tag is exploring Disney World.

1865
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:24,040
And he has all this really cool stuff. He runs the Walt Museum.

1866
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:30,040
So he will occasionally post pictures that you've never seen of like Walt's apartment on Main Street in Walt Disneyland.

1867
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:37,040
Like he you know, a lot of times there's normal stuff, too, but he will do some cool stuff from an Instagram thing.

1868
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,040
I mean, I'm on Jolly Poppins and stuff like that, too.

1869
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:44,040
Wait, I think I. Yep, that's it. Yeah, I follow this guy. Yeah, this guy's real good.

1870
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:48,040
I can't believe you have you have different ones. Jolly Poppins. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know that one.

1871
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:51,040
Wow. I used to follow a guy and then it depressed me.

1872
01:28:51,040 --> 01:29:01,040
He goes to Disney. He goes to Disneyland every single day and would take a picture and he was going for the biggest consecutive record of Disney.

1873
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:06,040
Like the like unbreakable record. And then it was a sort of like, I got to stop following this guy.

1874
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:11,040
Just say I don't know why. I just don't know. Like because it didn't seem fun anymore.

1875
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:15,040
It seemed like it seemed like day 4000, you know, or like whatever it was.

1876
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:19,040
I was like, I can't since he was like the smile wasn't real anymore.

1877
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:25,040
It didn't feel like it was like, well, then when it becomes a job, like it's like you're just like, I like got to go to Disneyland today.

1878
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:29,040
Just like that seems like the other part of it. That's good to hear that she likes Jenny.

1879
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:32,040
You like to go in it. Yeah, yeah, I think so. I think it's possible to come.

1880
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:44,040
I think it's all the line to ride is like not losing the joy and the silliness of it and not because you do get a sense from people on the message boards a lot that they are that they're they've they've gotten cynical.

1881
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:54,040
Some of them and they're so like they're mad that things are changing and they're eyeing every like, you know, a piece of paint that's scratched off and they like, I don't know, you got to like have a little bit of blinders on.

1882
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:59,040
Remember, this is all stupid and fun. It's just fun to incorporate this into your adult life and we'll take it.

1883
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:04,040
So yeah, like I mean, to me, the place I'd like to hang out though is that Disney bar where they have all the name tags up on the wall.

1884
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:09,040
Have you heard about that? That's in Orlando. I've heard of this. Yeah, I've been. It's like I've never been either.

1885
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:17,040
I don't even know where it is. It's basically all the former employees whenever they that's like their watering hole, which is prominently in the script that I wrote.

1886
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:24,040
But but but but when you retire, your name tag goes up like on the wall.

1887
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:29,040
So apparently the way it sounds is like it's just covered in name tags.

1888
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:35,040
When I was in City Walk in Orlando last year, they told me that all the people all the Disney people party at City Walk.

1889
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:39,040
That's where you go to party, just to party on site.

1890
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:42,040
They go. Yeah, they leave the mouse to go to City Walk.

1891
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:53,040
I found a TripAdvisor post where someone was like, hey, I bought I was going to book a trip to Disney and stay by Pleasure Island and mostly like eat at the restaurants and down to Disney and go to the clubs.

1892
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:57,040
I found out they're all closed. Like what else is there doing or land?

1893
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:01,040
And like immediately two people wrote back. Yeah, you're looking for City Walk now.

1894
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:09,040
Like what you want now is just go to City Walk like that is probably what you're the best approximation of what you want.

1895
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:14,040
They really they struck back like Disney got Disney was winning in this nightlife game.

1896
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:18,040
And I think now they're losing it. Maybe maybe Disney Springs will eventually take the metal bag.

1897
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:29,040
I think what's interesting with Disney Springs and what is slowly happening to downtown Disney in Anaheim is that it's like becoming like a fashionable L.A.

1898
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:38,040
sort of like an L.A. or Brooklyn neighborhood was like two, three years ago because it's like, all right, there's going to be an intense milkshake place.

1899
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:43,040
There's going to be a cocktail bar. There's going to be a brew pot like it's all sort of stuff.

1900
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:55,040
I think they realize if they put places like those VR places in like because the void is awesome and they should almost have, you know, they once they are able to have multiple experiences in, then it even be better.

1901
01:31:55,040 --> 01:32:03,040
Like, you know, it's when they have the Ghostbusters one, the Hulk one and the Terminator and Star Wars ones like that would be like, but like I think what they want to do is get people there.

1902
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,040
But you don't have to go to the park, but you have to do that by.

1903
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:10,040
I don't like that restaurant. Is it KTAL like that one?

1904
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:11,040
It's all.

1905
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:13,040
Yeah, I don't like that one.

1906
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:16,040
I like it. They just need to get kind of like revamp.

1907
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:20,040
I think they have to continue to revamp that place a little bit like it's all it's this odd.

1908
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:27,040
None of them are actually that great. The best that some of those dented Disney restaurants are like, well, it's better than the park.

1909
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:33,040
It's close to like a good restaurant. You'd go to 20 minutes north of here in LA.

1910
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:41,040
But like when they put in the bowling alley, the bowling and Disney Springs has this to those are like I think Disney Springs is the right direction for Disney.

1911
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:49,040
It's like, yeah, good, legitimately good restaurants, bars where you can kind of bar hop, which is like, but it's respectively.

1912
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:53,040
Nice looking architecture, nice looking architecture, free parking parking garage.

1913
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:56,040
Huge, huge benefit. Big deal, I think, for the locals.

1914
01:32:56,040 --> 01:33:02,040
Yeah. And then you have like the nice bowling alley. It's, you know, based on the the Incredibles or whatever it is.

1915
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:04,040
You know, it's like splits or whatever V8.

1916
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:08,040
So it's kind of got that 60s. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1917
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:11,040
Yeah, it's it's all getting there. The bowling alley is a good step.

1918
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:22,040
Every time they do stuff like that's more like like kids, like, for instance, the Videopolis out here, they closed once violence started erupting in the parking lot.

1919
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:26,040
And a very similar incident. I found an article from 1989.

1920
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:31,040
Videopolis East also a stabbing happened very early.

1921
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:37,040
I remember this. Yeah, because I remember there was a nervousness that there were like that.

1922
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:42,040
That means I used to bring it back in a very big way that there was a little bit of an unsavory nature to it.

1923
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:46,040
Now, when I look back on it going like to ever feel unsafe.

1924
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:54,040
And I did. And I do remember like the line to get in was intense because it's like imagine every line to get into a bar.

1925
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:58,040
But that was to get into the pier or whatever it was, the war.

1926
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:08,040
So you're on the line to get into like as a child, you're still on the line to get into the bar or it's like the line getting into Disneyland or Disney World.

1927
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:16,040
But like when it opens, but is all people ready to party? Yes. And that energy, I always felt a little it was intense.

1928
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:24,040
Yeah. I was 20 was the 21 under club in Pleasure Island. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1929
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:28,040
And that was the stabbing. I have the article here. I mean, I don't need to read from it.

1930
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:32,040
I mean, we get the gist. A guy got stabbed a couple of people.

1931
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:40,040
But then I also I didn't find this maybe someone else did it because they quickly changed the name of Videopolis, Videopolis East to Cage.

1932
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:45,040
OK. And that's the one I know nothing. And then they changed it like pretty quickly in a couple of years to Atrax.

1933
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:48,040
Oh, I remember Atrax. Yeah.

1934
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:59,040
No, that you know, that to me was I would like like my big move was when I got older, walk in, do like a circle through it and then like walk out and then like head to the adventures.

1935
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,040
I don't know what I was looking for there. I didn't know.

1936
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:05,040
Like maybe my like high school mind is like, well, I'll pick up.

1937
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:13,040
I'll either pick up some girls. I literally just do a full circle through here without stopping or drinking, you know, and I don't know what I did.

1938
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:19,040
I didn't talk to anybody like but I wanted to look and see what it was like. They had a roller skating place there.

1939
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:25,040
Oh, yeah. That was the one like the roller skating was on the second floor, second floor.

1940
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:35,040
And the backstory on that one is also it's saying that's where Mr. Pleasure wanted to like built his experimental aircraft spruce goose kind of aircraft like.

1941
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:46,040
And that that leads me to the fact that a lot of these clubs would change names or change themes. And so the plaques would get taken down or the backstories would just never get updated.

1942
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:52,040
And so that all reality started to fall apart, the funniest of which to me is the neon armadillo.

1943
01:35:52,040 --> 01:36:08,040
The country western bar eventually became the B.E.T. soundstage club, which that seems like a conservative meme like made into life of like our honky tonk became a hip hop club.

1944
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:12,040
What is happening to this island of bars? What happened?

1945
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:22,040
Also, the neon armadillo is just like, again, reading spending hours reading all this, I had to still remind myself like, OK, yeah, that was the country one.

1946
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:28,040
And the backstory was that a family of armadillos they found in that abandoned building like it's so so many steps.

1947
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:35,040
It was abandoned. And then when they came back, it was full of armadillos, armadillos creepily similar to that part of Discovery Island that was full of vultures.

1948
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:44,040
Yeah, they stuck them in a shed and they all died. It's crazy. It's one of the strangest pockets in the world.

1949
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:51,040
Absolutely. So real quick back to this pleasure island. So I found this Facebook group called Pleasure Island Memories.

1950
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:58,040
And I don't is it legal for me just to say things that people say in a public place? I won't use their names, but they'll know.

1951
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:07,040
Where are the audio when you say that? So you were talking about the roller skating rink. So what's that? It's XCFR Rockin Roller Drome.

1952
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:13,040
And when Pleasure Island was announced, there's a different club called Zephyr Rockin Roller Drome.

1953
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:19,040
All one word and kind of like the Guy Ritchie. So many index cards on white and white boards.

1954
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:28,040
I mean, there are terrible names. I mean, yeah, you want to go to the XCFR ZF Rock and Roll good time. It's Drome.

1955
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:35,040
No, I'm going to the Portobello Yacht Club. Mannequin's Dance Palace is just an eye.

1956
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:38,040
And they all seem like they were also like hitting very weird music.

1957
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:45,040
It was like, oh, yeah, we need we need a new wave club. We need a techno trance club country. Country makes sense.

1958
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:51,040
Country makes 100 percent sense. But like New Wave and techno trance are like very niche.

1959
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:58,040
It's like why don't you do like a country and like a rock club and like just like again, it's like too many things.

1960
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:01,040
Yes, they're trying to hit every demographic. They're trying to hit everything.

1961
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:06,040
Mannequin's also filled with the scariest phrase I've ever heard. Human mannequins.

1962
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:12,040
Yeah. Which are like mirror suits. They all look like something out of American Horror Story.

1963
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:17,040
And the music at mannequins from all the videos I saw seems like horseshit.

1964
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:24,040
It's like Sub Hataway. What kind of music is this? I'll debate that.

1965
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:28,040
I kind of like the music in mannequins. The few videos I've listened to.

1966
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:32,040
It's insane. And there's a whole don't don't don't don't don't.

1967
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:36,040
It's very like not as good Mortal Kombat or something.

1968
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:43,040
Had a very cool light show. Had a very cool light show. It starts off with a very like floor lit up.

1969
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:46,040
Right. That was the whole thing. Like there was just so many lights everywhere.

1970
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:53,040
It seemed overwhelming. Again, the theme of this episode is Pleasure Island was overwhelming in numerous ways.

1971
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:57,040
Except with restaurants. There was not a lot of restaurants.

1972
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:03,040
At the start of mannequins, at least for the thing, either would be like a calming, calming female voice.

1973
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:10,040
It was like, good evening. In the next hour, we will take you into the world, a world of music, spirit, meditation.

1974
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:19,040
Take a deep breath and relax. And then like, boy, I mean, it's it's bad, but it's also very good.

1975
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:24,040
So what what were you pulling from the memories? So pleasure island memory.

1976
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:31,040
So what's very great about this and I everyone should go on this message board if you if you have any fondness for this place.

1977
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:33,040
If you're still on Facebook as you. Yeah.

1978
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:38,040
Even though I claim to get off of it like two episodes ago, I totally forgot because we recorded it weeks prior.

1979
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:42,040
And then I said, who cares? And then I don't know. You need it for this show.

1980
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:46,040
You need to find the dirt. Yeah. You know, stay. I'm staying on it.

1981
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:51,040
I'm so sorry. I will never lie to you guys again. Anyway, so pleasure island memories.

1982
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:56,040
And what's great about this is that it's it seems like it's mostly former employees.

1983
01:39:56,040 --> 01:40:03,040
So there'll be a thread, for instance, that just said like, hey, biggest celebrity you ever waited on a pleasure island.

1984
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:07,040
And this is like 50 long, 500 comments long.

1985
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:11,040
So, I mean, I just picked out some of the greatest in the roller skating reminds me.

1986
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:17,040
So somebody just wrote Michael Jackson was the biggest roller skating with Eisner and George Lucas.

1987
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:24,040
And so this is full. So I'm going to quickly run down some of the other ones here.

1988
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:29,040
I was talking to you. So somebody says, yeah, I was at the comedy warehouse one night.

1989
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:38,040
And Robin Williams and Bobcat Goldthwait showed up with their wives and they got Williams got up and did about 20 minutes of stand up and improv based on the drink.

1990
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:42,040
The wobbly Wally that was sold on the island. Whoa, that's amazing.

1991
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:47,040
Then Bobcat got up and joined him. He dropped the bomb and all the Disney suits almost passed out.

1992
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:53,040
Somebody just lists all the celebrities that came through here. Michael Jackson, George Lucas, John Lasseter.

1993
01:40:53,040 --> 01:41:05,040
Bobcat Goldthwait, Dorothy Hamill, Taylor Negron, Larry Miller, Demi Moore, Howie Mandel, Al Jarrou, Mary Tyler Moore, Charles Barkley.

1994
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:12,040
So somebody's got a fun anecdote about Leslie Nielsen. He says, surely whatever that one is fine.

1995
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:19,040
Multiple people, multiple like more than three say Jimmy Carter.

1996
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:29,040
And then someone has an anecdote. President Jimmy Carter was using the upstairs at eight tracks and he sat right next to the DJ booth just smiling and singing along the whole time.

1997
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:34,040
Whoa, songs of his presidency. Yeah, 70s and 80s. That's it.

1998
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:40,040
He's up there. That means there's secret service. Yeah, of course. Eight tracks in Pleasure Island.

1999
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:51,040
Don't you feel like it's like Jimmy Carter went there and then like whatever his itinerary is like now you go to the nightlife. You go to Fulton's Crab House, which is like an old riverboat or whatever.

2000
01:41:51,040 --> 01:42:01,040
And then you go to eight tracks. Steam ships. I can imagine them probably saying, I have dinner. What kind of music do you like? We have every we have everything you want.

2001
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:14,040
Yeah. Oh, I don't know. I like stuff in the 70s. Great. We have the club for you. Jimmy Carter. I like techno trance. I want to see the mannequins with reflective mannequins. That sounds trippy.

2002
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:22,040
I need to go get some souvenirs for my daughters. Meet me at Doodles. So somebody just wrote OJ.

2003
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:33,040
Oh, man. I enjoyed speaking with OJ two weeks before he committed the murders. I was going to say right after he got out of jail. No, it's not recent.

2004
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:45,040
So I mean, first after the trial. This, this, this, I love this. I was again getting nostalgic for a time because all these people worked there and they loved it. Like that's the commonality.

2005
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:55,040
Can I ask one quick question? Of course. Do you think that the layout of Pleasure Island was so insane that it drove OJ Simpson to murder? Like he was carrying the weight of it.

2006
01:42:55,040 --> 01:43:05,040
Like it doesn't make any sense. The signs don't make any sense. He's trying to make someone. I want to know. I want to be Merriweather Pleasure. I can do it right.

2007
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:10,040
I think he went and he got some bad advice at the Adventurers Club. That's my guess. Oh, no.

2008
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:15,040
There was a comedy warehouse joke about like, you know, like, like Wanda kill your damn wife. And then he took it seriously.

2009
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:24,040
It's like, oh, yeah. All right. When I first was there and I was probably there when it first opened, it was a good vibe.

2010
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:32,040
I mean, we're talking, we're breaking it down because it doesn't really make sense. And ultimately, the end of the day, I guess their thought was who cares if it makes sense.

2011
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:40,040
It's it's places where you can dance places, you can drink places where you can like and they have like a little bit of the theming towards the end of the island, which is the New Year's every night.

2012
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:49,040
And but it was for me as a kid, it was super exotic and it felt cool and and not dangerous, but different than Disney.

2013
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:57,040
It didn't feel like clean, you know, I'm sure it was, you know, if I was there now, I think it was a good hang.

2014
01:43:57,040 --> 01:44:02,040
And then it fell off hard. And I only saw that part in the daytime.

2015
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:07,040
If you went every year, do you have any idea when the turn started to happen?

2016
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:15,040
I think I remember when like when more shops are coming, like you like when you feel it, see that first like Sunglass Hut or something like that.

2017
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:21,040
Like, you know, it's going to get shut down for like a fully like some like like, yeah, like a thing like that.

2018
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:24,040
The Sunglass Hut was the harbinger of death.

2019
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:33,040
Well, I think like I mean, they expanded to that, like what they would call downtown Disney Westside with the Virgin Megastore and the Cirque du Soleil and all that.

2020
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:36,040
And like that was a very different concept.

2021
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:44,040
And then also there was the, you know, the shopping village downtown Disney area and then Pleasure Island kind of just in between.

2022
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:51,040
And then like I think it was 2004 I came across was when they're like, OK, no admission to get on the island.

2023
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:55,040
It's just admission per club now. And then they dial back.

2024
01:44:55,040 --> 01:45:02,040
They stopped doing the midnight every night celebration, which they did right when it closed as like a, you know, send off.

2025
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:06,040
But even like an adventurous club, they always referenced one character.

2026
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:09,040
And then on the last night he appeared, but he never appeared.

2027
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:14,040
It was like, you know, yeah, I met your mother. Yeah, like kind of.

2028
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:18,040
Yeah, like they were like, and he came on the last night. He was finally there.

2029
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:32,040
Although that has a weird story like the adventurous club closed and then like one year later open for one night for like a special ticketed event that I think like WDW radio organized.

2030
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:37,040
God knows how much those individual tickets cost. But yeah, it was the full thing.

2031
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:44,040
And the Avengers Club, it seemed like towards the end, the reputation became like shows are still great characters still great.

2032
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:49,040
The way they've cut back is they've dialed back on the waitstaff. It's impossible to get a drink.

2033
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:53,040
I see. I think I remember trying to go there and it was like less shows.

2034
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:58,040
I think when I went there, it was like you could go in there like eight and stay for a long time.

2035
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:02,040
And I think now is eight o'clock is when we do our adventures club.

2036
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:05,040
And then it was like over by like that. It's just a nine thirty or something.

2037
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:10,040
I think no, I think again, my memory of this might be bad, but I remember being so excited to go there.

2038
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:15,040
Like, no, no, no, it's done for the night. Like it's done for the night at a certain time. It wasn't like, oh, OK.

2039
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:20,040
It wasn't just like and it's improv until midnight, you know, which probably makes sense.

2040
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:23,040
It probably was for sure. You know, like, yeah, let's not keep this.

2041
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:29,040
So I mean, even if they're not paying equity rates, they still have to pay those people decent money.

2042
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:34,040
Yeah. If this were in the park, I think it would be maybe still there.

2043
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:40,040
Like it like this is this to me is the outlier of all the obviously of all the stuff because the most thing that's the most.

2044
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:46,040
But like if it was in the park right now, either park, either coast, I feel like it would be like reservation only.

2045
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:51,040
And especially now that the parks are so insanely crowded versus 2008, 2008, everything was going downhill.

2046
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:57,040
We talked about you get a pass for 200 bucks. Right now it's like like 500 times the price.

2047
01:46:57,040 --> 01:47:03,040
I feel like if it had just stuck it out or if it was in a location like inside the park, the adventure club could have hung.

2048
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:09,040
I mean, the venture, the debt, the venture club is the thing that just was in the wrong spot at the wrong time.

2049
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:17,040
And but I feel like I do. I do believe that people don't want this experience from Disney Ventures Club.

2050
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:23,040
Yes. You know, but I even think like Disney Quest was that went down like that should never gone down.

2051
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:25,040
You are a place that is full of children.

2052
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:28,040
You're saying pay 25 bucks and play every video game you can play.

2053
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:31,040
You're in a giant pinball machine. You're in.

2054
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:33,040
I played the first the most fun I've ever had.

2055
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:41,040
There was like they had the Star Wars game where like the first cool Star Wars game where you had the lightsaber and you could play that for free all night.

2056
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:43,040
And it was like that. You know, I don't know.

2057
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:48,040
I feel like they just couldn't people that weren't there for nightlife or kids weren't allowed to go there.

2058
01:47:48,040 --> 01:48:00,040
I think there was some not enough of the audience was like making it out because this if you don't know the Disney layout, this is this whole mall zone is this separate area as opposed to downtown Disney or the area outside of Paris.

2059
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:06,040
It's not like or CityWalk. It's not connected to the part you got to specifically get on a bus and go to this different area.

2060
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:11,040
And maybe if you only had three nights or whatever, you're not going to take a bunch of your time to go find this.

2061
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:15,040
But if it was right outside the Magic Kingdom, right, that would be easier.

2062
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:21,040
I mean, the Disney Quest, I also think is 10 to whatever 20 years ahead of its time.

2063
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:26,040
Because I think Disney Quest now Disney Quest was not when I went to Disney Quest, I was so hyped about it.

2064
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:35,040
And it was a letdown with all the stuff like the VR for the medical for the for the magic carpet thing was not that cool and all the other things like water rafting.

2065
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:40,040
Yeah, you're just on a thing because as a kid, I was like the VR is amazing.

2066
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:46,040
I'm so excited about it. And it just it fell short. Whereas the void is lives up to for the most.

2067
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:56,040
The void is the future that the void that we saw, you couldn't still be running that in five years like they're going to have to keep updating it.

2068
01:48:56,040 --> 01:49:07,040
And I think that the void, though, is it is a simple maze that they all do is give you a new VR thing to watch because then they can reconfigure the walls.

2069
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:11,040
But the quality of the footage and stuff, they'll have to keep. Oh, I think they're rated.

2070
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:16,040
I think I know that the void has like literally like five or six things in the.

2071
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:19,040
Oh, yeah, they've got the expansion plans.

2072
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:22,040
Yeah, I think. But like Disney Quest never changed.

2073
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:32,040
Yeah. Wow. They've made the Terminator Hulk like it's all like it's they're not like going they're not going like do a virtual reality experience.

2074
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:35,040
Like, no, no, no. You know, this world, you're going to now be in this world.

2075
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:37,040
That's really smart. I do think they could do it.

2076
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:42,040
I do think of Disney Quest were like starting now and they had like five experiences on the void level.

2077
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:49,040
I think it would last. It would have like I guess the Disney Quest honestly lasted a long time, but that would have wowed everybody.

2078
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:54,040
I didn't come out of Disney Quest even as a kid going, wow, I like playing arcade games, but that was the best almost part of it.

2079
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:57,040
All the stuff that was supposed to be amazing fell very short.

2080
01:49:57,040 --> 01:50:00,040
It was like it was like sort of like the scope was big.

2081
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:07,040
It was like, you know, like like whatever that stupid pinball machine was where like the Mighty Ducks pinball machine where you're in the pinball machine.

2082
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:10,040
It's like it's like all right. It was fine.

2083
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:14,040
It was like, yeah, but like I feel like, oh man, I just lost my.

2084
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:22,040
Oh, I mean, I bet you Star Wars land will have a lot of the themed hangout areas.

2085
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:28,040
But I think this is going to make a comeback like things like the void, which are simple and you're it doesn't take up much space.

2086
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:33,040
But I know you guys are talking about like shield and a couple of episodes ago.

2087
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:43,040
But the idea, like if you created like the collectors, if they made that, like if the new Adventures Club was attached to like the Guardians of the Galaxy, right.

2088
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:45,040
And it just like it was like you're on nowhere.

2089
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:48,040
You're in this weird club of all these cool things.

2090
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:51,040
And, you know, and then you're like these aliens that you don't have.

2091
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:56,040
They can all do funny things and sing and you would be it would I mean, I would, you know, but it would be fun.

2092
01:50:56,040 --> 01:51:04,040
It would be the most popular thing. I think I said it on the show that idea also at Dr. Stranges Sanctum Sanctorum.

2093
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:08,040
A magic. It's like a magic club. It's also like there's weird spirits.

2094
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:14,040
There's people coming out of doors and dimensions like that's that would be the hottest place to go.

2095
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:19,040
Well, and at Disney's Hollywood Studios, it seemed like they were so close the way the rumor blogs were.

2096
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:26,040
It seemed like they were so close to pulling the trigger on putting a bar at the exit of Tower of Terror in Florida.

2097
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:34,040
They have a huge like unused like storage area by the store there where it would have been like a smaller bar like Trader Sam style.

2098
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:40,040
But like a bar that would have made sense for this, like the hotel bar for the Hollywood Tower Hotel.

2099
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:49,040
And that would have been a huge hit. Now, like that also would have driven a lot of traffic to a dead end in the park.

2100
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:55,040
But honestly, it could have helped. It could have helped with people complaining about how like there's so much construction in this park.

2101
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:59,040
There's not enough to do. It's like, well, if you had a fun bar there, that would have been something to do.

2102
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:02,040
Well, that's I think that's the thing they should be playing to.

2103
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:09,040
And ultimately, it's I think it's liquor. Bars are better than dance clubs or anything like that, because it's sort of like for the people like us.

2104
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:13,040
It's like, oh, I would like to go to and sit like that same. I won't go to Trader Sam's.

2105
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:18,040
Like I want to I will go for the like give me the really good Disney experience in a theme bar.

2106
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:23,040
And I'm way like it's like it's it's so much more fun.

2107
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:30,040
Having a drink at Trader Sam's is more fun than yes than going to, you know, Rosie O'Grady's, you know, you know,

2108
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:33,040
or like, you know, like how much people like Clifton's here in L.A.

2109
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:39,040
Like how fun it is to be like to be having a drink, settle in and there's you're in some weird forest.

2110
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:42,040
Yeah, people I think appreciate those themed experiences more.

2111
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:48,040
And maybe it's just I'm sure there's a cynical angle of it of like millennials never put away childish things.

2112
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:51,040
We still just want to go to Disney World.

2113
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:56,040
But I wonder if now the future will be it all needs to be property based.

2114
01:52:56,040 --> 01:53:03,040
Like you can't just be like a Ventures Club is like if you put a Ventures Club next to the Jungle Cruise,

2115
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:06,040
then it's like, you know, the way they have Aladdin's Oasis in Disneyland.

2116
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:13,040
It's like, you know, oh, this is something that feels like you have to really connect it like the hotel bar to the hotel.

2117
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:17,040
It's like, I think or it's just got to be Marvel Star Wars.

2118
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:21,040
Yeah. If there's an adventurous club in the Rock's Jungle Cruise movie.

2119
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:25,040
Yes. Then the adventures club could be built anywhere. And if that's a hit.

2120
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:32,040
That's an interesting idea. But Paul, do you know about CSEA, the Society of Explorers and Adventurers?

2121
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:36,040
No. OK, this is the Mike. Correct me if I get anything wrong.

2122
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:44,040
This is the the continuity that ties together all of Disney's like explore.

2123
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:53,040
Like so the Adventurers Club, the Jungle Cruise, Harrison Hightower, who is the basis for Tower of Terror in Japan.

2124
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:57,040
And he looks he's he's modeled after Imagineer, Joe Rody.

2125
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:59,040
Yeah. Oh, wow. Portrait of him.

2126
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:06,040
They and it shows up in little play like there's C stuff in Trader Sam's like. Oh, cool.

2127
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:08,040
Is that Alani part of it? Is it?

2128
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:11,040
There's got to be some C something in a lot.

2129
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:20,040
I will tell you that Alani bummed me out because I I am again, as a dad, I was like, this is great.

2130
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:25,040
It's like a Disney hotel. It didn't have anything that was like it didn't have enough theming for me.

2131
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:27,040
They went to like they went to a hotel, right?

2132
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:31,040
Like they're too like they didn't want to like it's goofy Hawaii or something.

2133
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:37,040
It's like it's kind of like the big. So it's basically like I think the conceit is Mickey's on vacation.

2134
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:45,040
So like I mean, like that, like so like he's walking around in cargo shorts, you know, and and then goofy is like hanging out by the pool.

2135
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:48,040
So like that's like so you see the characters are interacting with the characters there.

2136
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:50,040
Kiki's house is the kids thing.

2137
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:54,040
So if I didn't have kids, I wouldn't be able to go in Kiki's house.

2138
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:58,040
And rightfully so, I'm not advocating for that.

2139
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:01,040
I'm kind of sad I can't see Kiki's house.

2140
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:08,040
But and by the way, I was really excited because I've heard about Never Neverland Club and that's supposed to be like amazing for kids to like that's a Walt Disney World.

2141
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:12,040
Oh, yeah. Where it's like, oh, I did that. Yeah.

2142
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:18,040
So but they didn't have anything like they had no cool restaurants.

2143
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:22,040
By the way, Trader Sam's is the perfect place to put in a lot. Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah.

2144
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:29,040
No, it's it's hotel restaurants on the most mediocre level.

2145
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:34,040
It's like fine hotel restaurant. You could put that restaurant in any hotel and you'd be like, you know, huh.

2146
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:40,040
And and I was like, give me something. Give me like they have a lot of boats, you know, hanging from the thing.

2147
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:47,040
It's it's you know, it's nicely done. But there's no there's no and I actually the thing that was really bummed out about was their luau.

2148
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:55,040
I've been to many a luau and oh, yeah. You know, and that's that again just speaks to my like theme park love.

2149
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:59,040
Like I'm always like, well, we should go to that luau. I mean, I think there'll be something there.

2150
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:03,040
And like, no, why? And we went to the luau there.

2151
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:12,040
And it was like, like pretty unspectacular, like Disney, you should be doing the best luau in Hawaii, like because you could afford it.

2152
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:19,040
Like you could just like there should be like fireworks and fire dancers and this and like and it was big should talk before he gets cooked.

2153
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:31,040
Yeah. Wait, don't. Yeah. I thought it was the most I was surprised that the lack of like nothing for the Disney people there at all.

2154
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:35,040
And when you're I assume you're paying like exorbitantly more than the tip.

2155
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:43,040
Well, we use all of our points. So we had a we had a sweet three bedroom place.

2156
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:52,040
Oh, good deal. Did your family ever go to the other the Disney timeshare hotel like Vero Beach or the one in the Carolinas?

2157
01:56:52,040 --> 01:57:01,040
No, yes. My dad just went there. Yeah. My dad went to the Carolinas because it's awesome. He's like, it's great. It's really good. He's talking very highly.

2158
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:08,040
There's no rides and shit. Yeah. My parents were like kind of into like they were like, that idea sounds good to me.

2159
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:12,040
My brother and we were kids were like, there's no rides. And now to me, I'm like, oh, that sounds great.

2160
01:57:12,040 --> 01:57:19,040
Just a Disney hotel in the middle of nowhere. Sure. Yeah. Well, then, you know, but it's like to me, you want some of those.

2161
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:27,040
I don't know. You want some of those things like I remember being so excited when I was a big Universal Studios fans because I loved Islands of Adventure and it was so fun.

2162
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:33,040
I just went back there recently. I was so excited. Like I had a day in I basically like detoured my day.

2163
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:39,040
I had to make sure I got to do Universal again because I hadn't done it in years.

2164
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:45,040
And it was right before the Jimmy Fallon ride opened. So I didn't get to go on that. But like they had some cool stuff there.

2165
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:51,040
I did like the Max Pass and Harry Potter land is amazing. But I remember like Universal's like we're going to do our hotels.

2166
01:57:51,040 --> 01:58:00,040
Every one of them is going to be themed. So one floor will be the psycho theme and one floor will be like it was every floor is going to be a different movie.

2167
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:05,040
I was like, that's awesome. Like I would love that. And then they just never did. Yeah.

2168
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:16,040
I think now they're going back to like trying to do more stuff with like Volcano Bay. And I think I think I heard her talk of a Harry Potter theme.

2169
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:21,040
They've rumored that it seems like it because they're doing it with Star Wars.

2170
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:26,040
That's going to be amazing where you don't even see daylight. You just have the windows.

2171
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:37,040
Like you'll easily go insane. Oh, I mean, I'm like I can't wait to justify to my wife why I need to go to Orlando by myself unless I can get my kid into Star Wars real quick.

2172
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:41,040
Yeah, more of them than there used to be. Yeah, you got to get in.

2173
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:51,040
But the only people who do seem to tell is great. In my opinion was Legoland. They have like they have like a every floor is a different thing.

2174
01:58:51,040 --> 01:59:00,040
So one floor is like the Indiana Jones like adventure floor in your room has like monkeys on the wall and like it's every room is fully themed out.

2175
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:03,040
Like and there's a special safe there and there's clues around the hotel.

2176
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:10,040
And if you get the clues right, you open up the safe and there's a gift in the safe. It's like really, really well done.

2177
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:16,040
I'm like more of that. I want to think Great Wolf Lodge has like little adventures and games.

2178
01:59:16,040 --> 01:59:24,040
Oh, really play like yeah, there's the other some like in or like through the hallways of the that's kind of fun. Yeah, I like that.

2179
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:36,040
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, so I mean what we're finding, I feel like is there's like this fun ideas in a lot of in some of this Pleasure Island stuff that maybe has not been capitalized on to its full extent.

2180
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:51,040
I think like yes, some some new if it has to be an IP, whatever, but the general notion of the of the Adventures Club in a place where there's like a lot of odd little different shows and experiences and skill and like puppets clattering around that puppets are cool.

2181
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:55,040
Oh, the animatronics puppets in the Adventures Club were great.

2182
01:59:55,040 --> 02:00:08,040
Well, but what if you like if you really just committed to the idea of an adult playground, but you don't try to be like it's almost like could you make Chuck E Cheese for adults and like that's like like that would be the perfect kind of thing.

2183
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:15,040
It's like where you're where adults can kind of be kids without kids. I don't know like what that middle ground is. It's like that's what you want.

2184
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:21,040
Ultimately, I think that it's kind of the odd ones. We may be the odd one. We're odd, but we're getting less odd.

2185
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:29,040
Yeah, that's the greatest generation dies off. I think we're more common is that we're all stuck in our child like our childhood.

2186
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:49,040
Well, that's what I because I pleasure Island totally made sense at the time and it made sense for Disney World because like I seen a lot of the like 70s and 80s like Disney World Resort and the promotional material emphasized the resort stuff and they were angling for like couples and stuff to like come without kids.

2187
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:55,040
Even we've got nice restaurants. We've got dancing and and shows and all this sort of thing. So it made sense.

2188
02:00:55,040 --> 02:01:07,040
But now people want seem to want something more and whether that is I think part of some of that was people want more bang for their buck like after a couple recessions.

2189
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:20,040
Yeah, and that that sort of thing. I mean pleasure Island closed right around or right before the recession. But like I was just saw like a blog post about like new Disney afternoon mugs in the park.

2190
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:34,040
I was like, what? What is this? And I'm like, oh, they're to cater to adults. Now they're not building nightclubs. They're making mugs that you look like you would find at Goodwill from your childhood.

2191
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:47,040
Well, that's the newest thing. I feel like everything is retro. I bought an Epcot sweatshirt that I love that it was like looks like it was like it's designed like the top from the drawer full of like retro Epcot.

2192
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:50,040
Like stairs. I'll show you.

2193
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:53,040
Off guys. So impressed.

2194
02:01:53,040 --> 02:02:12,040
I do think you're right. I think that is becoming more and more common. But now he just said they're getting into escape rooms now. So that's a big oh yeah. And so to me it's like if you had like like I like I like the scary ones like a scary walk through like you like a maze or some sort of like jumpy out thing.

2195
02:02:12,040 --> 02:02:23,040
Like a scary one like that. You had an escape room. You had the void. You had like like that sometimes like that kind of like more mature experiences. But they're all fun. Yeah, I would. I think that would be great.

2196
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:35,040
And like you could still do a comedy club. Some version of that. I actually do think like the improv stuff is probably very fun for a lot of people that are there for like a vacation.

2197
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:43,040
Oh, this is they made it a rare. They probably are not pursuing improv typically. Yeah, it's like maybe the one of the only times they see something like that.

2198
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:56,040
Well, you and I said like we got like that was my end. That was amazing. Yeah, that was the first live cut that and like a cruise ship like a topical review on a cruise ship where like the first things I saw in terms of live comedy.

2199
02:02:56,040 --> 02:03:08,040
Maybe Disney Springs needs to just exist. That was Disney Springs and maybe a new Pleasure Island must rise somewhere on the grounds of the Disney World Resort or maybe we're like we're River Country used to be.

2200
02:03:08,040 --> 02:03:24,040
I think this is Anaheim. That's what I think you do. I think you start it in Anaheim. Okay, because I think because I think I know you're saying there's more land there, but I guess I think you rip up that that strip and you build out from the void like you sprinkles is good.

2201
02:03:24,040 --> 02:03:39,040
That's good. Like the void is good. Like start doing more of that. They got a whole restaurant. That's Adventurers Club. Yeah, two point. And you have a bowling alley there. It's like I feel like you have to make it a place where people will be like, do you want to go down to like, we can go down to Disneyland.

2202
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:47,040
We got VR thing. We can go play go go bowling go. If you can like name like three things you could do right now to go down there to do the void.

2203
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:58,040
Well, I'm going to the park because I'm not going to go down. I'm not going to go down there for one thing. Right. They're putting like two micro breweries that like to like a ballast point is doing a restaurant brew pub.

2204
02:03:58,040 --> 02:04:12,040
And then there's that black tap. Something like that. The desserts. Isn't that crazy milkshakes with like a slice of cake in it. Oh, yeah. And then they're building a massive new hotel like on top of where the ESPN zone and stuff.

2205
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:25,040
And that seems like this like it's a four diamonds, triple A, four diamond. It seems like they're trying to actually build a luxury luxury hotel. So yeah. Yeah. But more tent pole jams.

2206
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:35,040
Well, I obviously I want themed experiences everywhere you can possibly fit them. Hey, shout out to Glendale for that. You can go to the void and you can get on that trolley.

2207
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:46,040
It's like my pitch is that everywhere in the world be like this rides everywhere. I want I want them. I mean, more church street stations. I think that's what we're saying.

2208
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:56,040
It's like how can we find like that? That is I think what people want. It's like it's like almost like fake community. It's like you like this is a place where you can go.

2209
02:04:56,040 --> 02:05:06,040
We can knock off like five things and not have to park one spot and you can have when you make a night of it. Right. It's a little we all need to like we just we need some capital.

2210
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:16,040
We all need to start a sale company. Use the earnings from that to become the new pleasure. The new grand fun Meisters.

2211
02:05:16,040 --> 02:05:29,040
Don't you think I mean I just that to me the simplest thing would have been just to have a guy like always there every night like I'm very well the pleasure and this and tonight we're going to like his and his whole thing is you have to live every night.

2212
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:41,040
Like it's the last night of the year because tomorrow is a new day and that's the thing. And so we're all going to make a resolution like you just it's like a simple themeing like he just he's like almost like a spiritual guru like and we're going to have this experience.

2213
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:52,040
You're going to laugh. You're going to dance. You're going to this you know you have like a near death experience on New Year's. He was like sailing lightning struck his ship and he almost died but he made it back and he knew when he got back to port.

2214
02:05:52,040 --> 02:05:59,040
I will live every day like it's New Year's Eve because that's the most exciting part of the year because on New Year's Eve anything can happen in the new year.

2215
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:19,040
I would like it if they would do put these plaques outside the businesses in Disney Springs quite frankly if there was a plaque outside the unique low and it was like well as you know his son was you know messing around with some textiles and we found them in this place and we decided to sew them into t-shirts here in the Coca Cola store.

2216
02:06:19,040 --> 02:06:30,040
Like we I we could still do that. Hire us to write these. Yeah we'll write for everything there. What is there what's those pretzels there. Backstories everywhere. I have one quick question for you rabbit.

2217
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:45,040
You know the comedy the comedy warehouse has done reunions you said the adventures club came back for one night only. If you guys if everybody here if suddenly Pleasure Island was back you could go for just one night and you can only there's only time for one club.

2218
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:54,040
Which one how old how old am I. It's you right now. Okay. Yes. Pleasure Island exists and you because it was twenty two I would say mannequins.

2219
02:06:54,040 --> 02:06:55,040
Yeah.

2220
02:06:55,040 --> 02:07:07,040
I think I'm mannequins today. That's my kind of music that I really like the light show. I guess it was the one on watching of the Disney in room entertainment just like mannequins. What the fuck. Oh yeah.

2221
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:28,040
When when the episode we were talking about that that watching that Disney in room TV was my favorite. I literally made a big an adult swim commercial based on an in room like hotel commercial because I just I got like obsessed with it was like I got obsessed with Steve Wins version.

2222
02:07:28,040 --> 02:07:57,040
Yes. And I made a whole like it was it. So the idea was that your TV at midnight or whenever it aired just came I was like welcome to the so and so spot. It's like it's on YouTube. I don't remember it's called but it's it but it looks just like a hotel screen and then it just like it's like this is what we have this we have this we have this and it's a crazy. I mean I don't want to build up too much but it was it was like something that I'm obsessed with. I was like oh I love like yeah I love that like soft music playing.

2223
02:07:57,040 --> 02:08:12,040
It's like impossible to convey the appeal of this to somebody who doesn't just naturally get it. Yeah I feel blessed to know so many people now like those in room. Oh yeah. It's hypnotic. I mean I don't know what the guess it's the music and there's something comforting.

2224
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:32,040
And I was like clearly the theme is like specific like location specific experiences and I like that this is a video I can only watch in this hotel. Yeah the only place that it exists and occasionally you'll hear like Mario Lopez chime in and be like hey we sat down with everybody from Slender Man and to answer your question.

2225
02:08:32,040 --> 02:08:49,040
I mean it has to be. Yeah I got it right. Yeah so I'm taking a venture because mine was going to be a venture scope I'm taking it off the table because I feel like that's my go to. I'm trying to like challenge myself. What's your number to AMC 24 movie theater.

2226
02:08:49,040 --> 02:09:10,040
Yeah. Big awning. I saw the Santa Claus there as a wonderful place. I think I would go to I think I would be really interested in going to the roller skating place. I feel like that like that to me feels really unique in the sense of like yeah I would be curious to see what that is about.

2227
02:09:10,040 --> 02:09:27,040
On the night that Michael Jackson was skating with Michael Eisner and George Lucas I mean that's the answer. I want to be Michael is also brought up in that through I'll send this thread to you obviously but Michael has brought up so much in this thread like Michael was a pleasure island nonstop.

2228
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:31,040
That's perfect guys of course he was one of the mannequins. Oh yeah.

2229
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:52,040
Very possible. Another thing I said the rock and roll the rock and roller drum at some point turned into the rock and roll beach club. Yes. And look up as many in sync references on this episode you can look up an in sync like looking for a record deal concert from 1995 in that venue in the beach club and they and they're so young.

2230
02:09:52,040 --> 02:10:06,040
Oh my God they are they're so tiny is forever good but the like they do a weird like boy bandified version of we can work it out. We can get out we can get out. Life is very short.

2231
02:10:06,040 --> 02:10:22,040
Big recommend for somebody on the message board says Joey Fatone hit on me. He asked me out. They turned him down. Do you ever see Joey Fatone's like his home movie theater. No designed it to look like the Death Star. So it's like you enter and it's pretty cool. It's pretty pretty well done.

2232
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:38,040
Have you screened a film personally or no I just thought of some sort of I think I think I think I saw it on like a hotel TV. I was like we went to Joey Paton's. I don't know why I was watching whatever it was. I was just going to mention one thing here which I thought was interesting.

2233
02:10:38,040 --> 02:11:06,040
It was another thing another fact about Mary Weather pleasure that they he there's a restaurant called the fireworks factory. Also fireworks. This is a band of fireworks but then they did a good deal with the group cheese who were like we're now I mean at least when I was growing up the group cheese like these big like fireworks people in New York like they just would set off like a ton of and like they did a thing where they would like give them their old fireworks setup. So it's like like the after the cannons were used to do the Macy's day whatever.

2234
02:11:06,040 --> 02:11:13,040
Like so the place is like full of like discarded fireworks like paraphernalia to make it look like. Yeah. Yeah.

2235
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:42,040
Yeah which all smells great. What a great I also I in my notes I have the drinks menu from the fireworks. Oh yeah. Oh and just just to name a couple. These are explosion themed drinks. You got the detonator daiquiri the you got the 21 rum salute. You got the the bang master and then finally very bizarre name even at the time and the most bizarre today.

2236
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:59,040
The border bomber. Oh my God. Why. And I know we're wrapping up. I will just say one thing I just realized this when you said that thing about the daiquiri I just recently went to the saved by the Bell restaurant that opened up here in L.A. I brought a Weiger and Mike Mitchell the doughboys there because I figured that would be right up there.

2237
02:11:59,040 --> 02:12:23,040
That place is incredibly packed there sold out or there have limited availability for the next nine months. That's the right like tone to like again themed great. It's fun. I'm like a medium saved by the Bell family. I know all I think I know all the references I can understand all the menu jokes but I'm like I'm not obsessive but it's like that was great.

2238
02:12:23,040 --> 02:12:39,040
Like that's the kind of like that weird. It's like I don't know what that is. I guess it's brand. It's like you know it's a brand and you go there but like I think that would pack them in like if they say by the Bell restaurant in or like in Orlando in Pleasure Island that would work.

2239
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:55,040
I think maybe downtown Disney and all these places need to have spaces that they trade out and like put in. It's like every couple months. Yeah. Disney should embrace the pop up. That's a great idea. They never ended up using the plan for a bar where all the Disney villains drank at.

2240
02:12:55,040 --> 02:13:22,040
Oh. Great. Because also like Universal does the horror nights mazes and they put up very crazy elaborate mazes that are themed to like movies and stuff and they do it for what three months. And the in the park works functionally during the day with those mazes. Yeah. It's sort of like that's you can do it. Yeah. I also feel like the fact that Disney has had Star Wars for such a long time. They never built a cantina bar like I know they're building Star Wars and yeah. I think they've done that. I think that's great.

2241
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:34,040
And they never built a cantina bar like I know they're building Star Wars and sure that will be coming. Yeah. But it's like but they've had Star Tours since the 80s. Yeah. Like and this even the and even jocks like that was just built.

2242
02:13:34,040 --> 02:14:03,040
You've had these properties. You could have done any of these things and you've never. Well when they opened the Star Wars launch bay and there's just like a little corner with a table and then it's like hey Star Wars themed food and every I know you and me were like blue milk and they're like no hamburgers. Huh huh. Yeah. And yet in all with everything that you're complaining about this is all felt as though it is the last factoid they did not even opening Pleasure Island for some reason not a priority to do an Indiana Jones thing or Star Wars thing or something from any of the.

2243
02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:31,040
The big animated films. Did anybody come across in their research Madison's dive. No no Madison's dive is was the first bar to be cut when Pleasure Island started going over budget and this was a bar themed after splash. It was Madison. Whoa. A mermaid from splash and it was going to be a place where you could sit and watch an old sailor wax nostalgic about the one that got away and then behind it was going to be partially sunken.

2244
02:14:31,040 --> 02:15:00,040
Oh my god. So in the actual water behind the sailor the mermaid swims by. Holy crap. For some reason we've talked about this with splash. That's where I want to go. I would love to go there. Wow. I actually legitimately yeah. Now let's do the splash pop up now. Why not. I know no one remembers. Why. Why are the good ideas are the ones they never come in on like the villains on these are all simple like down the middle ideas but then they go no no no mannequins wearing mirrors.

2245
02:15:00,040 --> 02:15:30,040
That's our thing. Like you know it's a coked out guy had too much power at Disney at that he was like they were scared of him like we're going to do it's going to be living mannequins and they look like disco ball. Sure whatever you hear just go away. It's got to be like the Imagineers like when you hear any story about any movie being made it's always like well I had this idea it was pretty good and then there's a producer that had just an insane idea that he got stuck on. So there must be like some executive that was just like a club with mannequins is good. We should get that club with the mannequin in there and they're like yeah yeah that's fine but how about we like do a cool.

2246
02:15:30,040 --> 02:15:45,640
Theme thing. Yeah okay you can have your theme thing but can I have my mannequins please because you will be fired if you don't finish the mannequins are like oh sorry ran out of money. Here's my one pitch on pleasure and what would have been better instead of having a badge on your thing.

2247
02:15:45,640 --> 02:16:15,640
What you do is every time you went to a club you put on a you're getting full donkey like like you're like Pinocchio. So like so the first couple go to you have nothing on but you have a head. You have a headband when you go in and the headband if you're the red if you're this or that you know and so you get an ear and the next time you get another ear and then next thing it knows. So like when you're full donkey you've done all the things right and then that's when you have to leave and when they pin a tail on you that means like don't serve him. Yeah.

2248
02:16:15,640 --> 02:16:28,280
How amazing would it be if everyone left looking like donkeys like it was like you've partied too much now you must go home. That is such a good idea. They would be hundreds of donkey's leave.

2249
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:36,920
And there would be all these people with like CEOs of Polaroids of them in college looking like donkeys.

2250
02:16:36,920 --> 02:16:54,920
And everyone would cherish those. Yeah. Yeah. Man what an idea that is. I'm in if you're OK Disney new pleasure island 2.0. Let's install the donkey system donkey system. Sleep No More escape rooms adventures club and the boys splash club.

2251
02:16:54,920 --> 02:17:12,120
We want all of it. Damn it. We demand it. Paul Scheer demands it. Thank you. You will show you survive. Thank you so much. So much. Anything you would like to promote or especially key us into while you're here.

2252
02:17:12,120 --> 02:17:25,120
Yeah I'm trying to know. I mean you guys gave me a lot of good stuff. I would say listen to unspooled which is now wherever podcasts are listened to. We watch 100 of the AFI is movies the best movies of all time apparently. Wonderful.

2253
02:17:25,320 --> 02:17:35,120
And then we have actually some we have a quick we have an exciting and exciting announcement. We actually were talking a little bit about this place earlier and I got so excited. But here we go.

2254
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:49,120
We'd like to officially announce that we are doing podcast the ride presents the city walk series a 19 part exploration of universal Hollywood city walk. All right. This is obviously something that you guys have been demanding that we really get.

2255
02:17:49,120 --> 02:18:09,120
This is the exploration of the parking garages of the hotels of maybe some of the sock related businesses that are at city walk. We're going to do it all. It's not going to be in a row. It's going to take like six years for us to get it. But I've divided city walk into 19 sectors and we will review each sector.

2256
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:24,120
There's a moment where I was like this is April Fool's joke. We're doing it. I talked about the defunct mall for two and a half hours. You better believe it. Yeah. So I have we'll post some of this stuff. There'll be more details to come.

2257
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:42,120
And start to let us know what you want to hear about. Yes. One of the city like stores with the artificial waves outside. Can I make a request that of course when you get halfway through you should do one of these live from city walk like the Gordon Bursch brewery because I'm waiting for you guys to go.

2258
02:18:42,120 --> 02:18:56,120
Like I was like I'm waiting for you guys to go and start touring around like Jim Hill and Len Testa like yes. Yeah. Get the podcast the right fans. I'll come down to Orlando and you guys could guide it around to a live. We got a Pandora.

2259
02:18:56,120 --> 02:19:17,120
We know you're willing to abandon your family and go to Orlando. So you won't be so. Yeah. Well let's find a spot. If anybody at city walk has a hook up to a live entertainment venue. What's going on that comedy club. I think John Lowe's comedy club has been empty for a long time.

2260
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:34,120
Make it the podcast the right. We've been to the Kevin Smith podcast lounge. The second theater inside there. Podcast the ride podcast lounge. Yeah. I think that I think we could do a live Hall at the Moon episode where we just go on. We do you know five hours at Hall at the Moon.

2261
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:51,120
We're doing piano guys learn our theme song. Oh yeah. Screaming at them by the end. Please stop. We paid you to stop. Why won't you stop. So we don't have the rights to don't stop believing. Stop playing. I can't wait for the one where you guys do the parachuting one.

2262
02:19:51,120 --> 02:20:08,120
Where is it. Yeah. I guess. Is that crazy with that freak pansy like me out. Probably. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's safe. I think I think I think it will be scary because you'll be in the air and get a voodoo donut afterwards. You'll be fine. Not in the same sector though.

2263
02:20:08,120 --> 02:20:31,620
There aren't they right across. Well but in the way I've sector. That one's closer to the comic store. Yeah. I like that comic store. Yeah that's an actual business at City. Well something do you what sector we starting with. Do you know that information to becoming forthcoming.

2264
02:20:31,620 --> 02:20:33,620
Yeah forthcoming. I already said too much

2265
02:20:34,420 --> 02:20:40,340
Not figured that bad plug. This sounds very exciting. I don't hear anything else, but this I think you should just go

2266
02:20:40,740 --> 02:20:42,740
19 episodes in a row

2267
02:20:46,100 --> 02:20:49,440
Entire season and more for a summer and half a fall

2268
02:20:54,340 --> 02:20:56,860
If you did I think if you did this

2269
02:20:56,860 --> 02:21:01,220
19 days in a row you released an episode a day. It would be amazing

2270
02:21:02,900 --> 02:21:06,140
You know, it wouldn't even be like you then you go right back to the normal schedule

2271
02:21:06,140 --> 02:21:10,620
But you have a break where it's 19 episodes that are out. It's a good idea

2272
02:21:10,980 --> 02:21:16,260
Yeah, it is a good idea. I just spent 30 minutes on each section. It would be we don't have to do a full two

2273
02:21:16,260 --> 02:21:18,260
Yeah, two and a half hours

2274
02:21:18,260 --> 02:21:27,180
That's a relief. I was assuming we were we owe two hours on all of these sock market will get two hours

2275
02:21:27,180 --> 02:21:31,180
We'll scale them based on I assume by the way the sock market is doing very well right now, too

2276
02:21:31,180 --> 02:21:33,180
Yeah

2277
02:21:33,180 --> 02:21:35,180
Thanks Trump appreciate it

2278
02:21:37,180 --> 02:21:40,740

2281
02:21:52,900 --> 02:21:57,020
So you need a class? I think you like a bright lights big city kind of like you need like a

2282
02:21:57,260 --> 02:22:01,220
Like a kind of a moniker like someone's like bright lights big city

2283
02:22:01,220 --> 02:22:06,380
Not that that's a good title by like colon the city walk series like you need like that, you know

2284
02:22:06,380 --> 02:22:07,540
It's like yeah

2285
02:22:07,540 --> 02:22:15,340
Well in the trailer it starts with the Avengers music and then it ends up it turns into walk this way. So

2286
02:22:15,500 --> 02:22:18,580
It could just be called walk this way. I love that. That's yeah

2287
02:22:18,820 --> 02:22:21,300
