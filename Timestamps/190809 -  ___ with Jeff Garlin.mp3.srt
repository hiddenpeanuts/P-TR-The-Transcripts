1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,080
Warning, the following podcast contains discussion

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,340
about the changing media landscape.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,260
Adam West impressions, hubris,

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,440
and at least five to seven minutes

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,100
that relate to theme parks.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,340
Jeff Garland joins us for a rousing discussion about,

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,920
you know, all sorts of stuff.

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,920
Oh, the places we'll go.

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,120
It's podcast, The Ride.

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,940
["The Ride"]

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,360
Welcome to Podcast, The Ride, a theme park podcast

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,280
hosted by three men, me, Mike Carlson, Jason Sheridan.

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,120
Say hello, Jason.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,940
Hi.

17
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,780
And Scott Gairdner.

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,900
And we are about to go on a fast,

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,780
rollicking madcap attraction I like to call

20
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,820
Mr. Garland's Wild Ride.

21
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,940
By the way, that would be awesome.

22
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,940
If I was an Imagineer and they said,

23
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,540
create a ride based on,

24
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,540
it'd just be a ride full of non-sequiturs.

25
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,860
And I'd have people at certain points during the ride,

26
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,060
what I'd go for is them going, what was that?

27
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,820
But numerous times, by the way,

28
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,900
I don't want that at the end of the ride.

29
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,060
At the end of the ride, I don't want to, what was that?

30
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,740
I want them to really know what that was.

31
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,540
But along the way, confusion.

32
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,380
Sure.

33
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,220
But they would feel like at the end

34
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,820
that they knew exactly what you were going for.

35
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,660
Yes, yes.

36
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,480
Right.

37
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,900
That you would get it by the end.

38
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,180
But along the journey, much confusion.

39
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,020
Right.

40
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,300
Halfway through the ride, the animatronics all lie down

41
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,860
and do the rest of the ride lying down

42
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,020
with your trademarks.

43
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,220
I would like that.

44
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,340
That would be great.

45
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,300
You have like Peter Pan of halfway through the ride,

46
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,620
Captain Hook just took a nap.

47
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,460
Yeah.

48
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,900
That would be good.

49
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,740
That would be good.

50
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,260
That feels like that would be your ride too though.

51
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,100
I would love that too, yeah.

52
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,020
There was that one time that the Lincoln robot

53
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,580
bent at the knees.

54
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,100
That was essentially you're watching an animatronic.

55
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,940
It was like an America's Funniest Home Video.

56
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,780
Yeah.

57
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,540
But it bent like sort of from behind,

58
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,900
like in like a limbo sort of manner,

59
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,740
but kept talking.

60
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,220
As if Lincoln was doing a limbo?

61
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,060
Yeah, pretty much.

62
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,900
That's really funny actually.

63
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,740
I'm not sure what happened,

64
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,020
just those knees started bending.

65
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,980
No, but that's really funny.

66
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,820
Yeah, yeah.

67
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,500
And by the way, what did that create?

68
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,100
I'm sure much confusion in the Hall of Presidents.

69
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,740
Did they have a special name for that theater?

70
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,460
Well, this was just the Lincoln Theater at Disneyland.

71
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,780
It might have been the Hall of Presidents.

72
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,740
I'm not totally sure.

73
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,580
I think a lot.

74
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,420
What's the Lincoln Theater?

75
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,540
I don't even know about this.

76
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,420
It's on Main Street.

77
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,820
It's like when you walk right into Main Street,

78
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,580
there's a great moment with Mr. Lincoln.

79
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,420
That's what it is.

80
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,340
It's the Main Street Opera House.

81
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,180
Okay.

82
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,020
You ever seen that?

83
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,020
You ever sat and watched Lincoln talk for a while

84
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,860
on a Disneyland visit?

85
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,700
No, I would like that.

86
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,460
Here's how I imagine he talks.

87
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,860
Hello, everyone.

88
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,500
I'm Lincoln.

89
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,980
That is actually right.

90
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,660
Well, I mean, that's what I would be going for

91
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,380
if I was producing the Lincoln,

92
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,180
you know, a few minutes with Mr. Lincoln.

93
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,820
Hello, everyone.

94
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,180
By the way, here's what I would do.

95
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,500
All right, so people would go into here.

96
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,740
If I was in charge of the park.

97
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,580
Yeah, go ahead.

98
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,140
All right, so you go into the Lincoln thing

99
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,820
and he says a few things.

100
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,780
I just want to say that I grew up a proper young lady

101
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,940
and I love lemonade.

102
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,220
And then he would give some true things

103
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,900
and then later on go, I'm telling you,

104
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,540
I was a proper young lady who loves her lemonade.

105
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,380
Just to upset people.

106
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,420
And it would upset people.

107
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,380
Oh, completely.

108
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,220
Yeah.

109
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,900
Do you realize that Lincoln is a proper young lady?

110
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,140
He likes lemonade.

111
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,220
People are standing up during the show

112
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,820
and saying like, no, this is not correct.

113
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,740
I know my history.

114
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,020
You know, the lemonade was not even popularized

115
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,100
until the 1902 or so.

116
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,500
Orange County Republicans would hit the roof.

117
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,780
They would be so upset

118
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,380
because they've been upset in the past.

119
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,780
We learn more and more about Lincoln as the years go.

120
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,380
I feel like a more and more nuanced portrait of him

121
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,900
comes out as the years go on.

122
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,740
You're saying.

123
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,260
I'm more curious now as to whether lemonade

124
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,100
was around then.

125
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,940
I imagine it was.

126
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,940
I threw that out in a very haphazard,

127
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,140
I don't know, I don't know my lemonade history.

128
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,620
But you were taking on the character

129
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,300
of an angry audience member

130
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,580
who maybe didn't,

131
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,740
who were just spewing stuff because they were upset.

132
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,500
And who might be wrong themselves.

133
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,260
So they might be, if they were wrong about that,

134
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,540
they could very well have been wrong

135
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,100
about Lincoln being a proper young lady.

136
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,300
Yeah, a proper young lady.

137
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,140
Sure.

138
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,980
Yeah, could have been.

139
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,460
As time goes on, that was forever ago.

140
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,060
We have no idea in the childhood.

141
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,900
I don't really know.

142
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,020
Well, a glass of lemonade was like

143
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,380
going to the movies back then.

144
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,460
It was a real treat.

145
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,260
The nurse did for two hours.

146
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,020
It was like seeing the Avengers.

147
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,300
Yes, yeah.

148
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,940
When they figured out pink lemonade,

149
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,260
it was like infinity war.

150
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,980
It broke all the records.

151
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,020
People are, tickets sell out instantly.

152
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,020
Most ambitious beverage event.

153
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,540
All people had to use were their imaginations.

154
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,740
Yeah.

155
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,940
Everything else was just water with arsenic in it

156
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,100
and then someone figured out lemonade.

157
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,740
Are there any other, like when you go in Disneyland, Jeff,

158
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,420
are there any other things where you're like,

159
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,460
I wish this was totally different?

160
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,900
Well, no, I don't really wish it,

161
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,820
but if someone were to ask me, I'd wish it.

162
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,380
Okay, so if I were to ask you.

163
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,140
If I'm walking down Main Street and I'm going into,

164
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,220
like I'd like it to be Ben Varane's cat.

165
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,780
Well, I think we can agree on that.

166
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,620
We can change that.

167
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,060
And then it's just like,

168
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,420
there's pictures of Pippin on the wall.

169
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,700
And he, yeah.

170
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,940
I want him to be Mayor Ben from Zubali Zoo.

171
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,140
From Zubali Zoo, I remember Mayor Ben.

172
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,860
My childhood, you guys saw that, right?

173
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,700
Yeah.

174
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,900
Where he was like a cat man.

175
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,300
He was like a cat man, yeah.

176
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,100
But the point being is I love Disney as it is.

177
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,940
I really do.

178
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,760
Yeah, sure.

179
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,740
But if I could, you know,

180
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,420
look, it's like one of those things like,

181
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,140
you know, like you wish that,

182
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,020
like I've always had this dream of someone I hate

183
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,460
being naked for a day and not knowing it.

184
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,300
Like walking through the city, going grocery shopping,

185
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,380
completely naked and they think they're dressed.

186
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,180
And when people come up and go, you're naked.

187
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,500
This is someone I hate.

188
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,220
I don't hate that many people, but.

189
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,060
Okay.

190
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,900
Yeah.

191
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,220
I wish they'd experienced that.

192
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,980
So wait, you wanted, what do you want?

193
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,420
What does that have to do with Disney?

194
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,100
No, I'm just saying.

195
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,300
That's just a wish you have.

196
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,140
I see, I see.

197
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:27,140
I always could use the premise of looking at something

198
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,780
and going, if you could for a day or an hour.

199
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,980
But Disneyland is perfect.

200
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,820
Right.

201
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,800
No changes.

202
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,640
Of course.

203
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,660
Disneyland is actually, you know,

204
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,300
what the Disney company should be.

205
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,940
Yeah.

206
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,060
Maybe once was.

207
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,060
Now they just want everyone's back end.

208
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,260
On a writing deal.

209
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,540
They want everyone's everything.

210
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,700
Yeah, they want everyone's everything.

211
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,540
They're an evil empire.

212
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,060
Yeah, I think you probably could argue.

213
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,900
Yeah.

214
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,740
Yeah.

215
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,560
I mean.

216
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,740
I tend to think so.

217
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,580
Currently.

218
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,260
All right.

219
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,080
Sure.

220
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,180
Are you worried about saying that

221
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,220
in a possible Toy Story 5?

222
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,060
No.

223
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,880
Okay.

224
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,720
Cause they're not gonna listen to this shit.

225
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,220
They don't care about podcasts.

226
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,940
By the way, I love Toy Story

227
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,380
and I think Toy Story, everything's right about Toy Story.

228
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,220
Yeah, it's perfect.

229
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,780
I've seen Toy Story 4 of you.

230
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,620
It's great, yeah.

231
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,440
Is it great?

232
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,280
You have like the funniest runner in the movie.

233
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,120
No, I'm not seeing it.

234
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,900
I was out of town for the premiere.

235
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,180
That's when I usually see it.

236
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,020
Oh, gotcha.

237
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,780
Yes, the runner is the funniest thing.

238
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,620
Oh my God.

239
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,300
Very foot gets the biggest laugh, I feel like.

240
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,140
Oh good.

241
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:30,980
That's nice.

242
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,660
Desiring the dad to go to jail.

243
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,660
Oh, I remember something like that when I was little.

244
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,480
That's what I was wondering.

245
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,820
Is that like one of many things

246
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,140
or did you know while recording it?

247
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,300
No, I did many things.

248
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,180
And I did other people's lines.

249
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,500
What they do, I think at certain points is go,

250
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
all right, who should say this here?

251
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,320
Okay, okay.

252
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,740
So I recorded many different lines.

253
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,080
I improvised.

254
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,980
I did all sorts of stuff.

255
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,500
I have no idea what the, you know.

256
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,340
Oh, yeah.

257
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,900
I feel like we spoiled it for you then by telling you that.

258
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,100
That's not my experience.

259
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,220
That wasn't my experience on WALL-E.

260
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,900
That was not my experience on the first,

261
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,740
the Toy Story 3 that I did.

262
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,780
But that was my experience on Toy Story 4.

263
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,300
I did a lot of lines where they go try this

264
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,340
and I saw that it was for somebody else.

265
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,180
Oh, gotcha.

266
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,000
Well, it is.

267
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,180
When you watch the credits at the end of the movie,

268
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,740
they are balancing 70 characters.

269
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,700
When you realize everything you took in,

270
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,580
like, oh my God.

271
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,300
And now that like, now the crew from three is around

272
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,500
and needs to be serviced and like,

273
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,820
and then a whole new set of people.

274
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,980
Like, so I'm impressed by the filmmakers being able to like.

275
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,500
They were very nice, very thoughtful.

276
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,580
And they had great sense of humors.

277
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,180
So that's all I can say.

278
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,540
It was a very wonderful experience, actually.

279
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,860
All three of my, four of my experiences

280
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,820
were all wonderful in different ways.

281
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,380
I was also the lemon in one of the Cars movies.

282
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,580
Cars 2, I think.

283
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,420
Yeah, I never saw it.

284
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,260
Yeah.

285
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,100
Well, you could pay me to see a Cars movie.

286
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,620
What do you think about it?

287
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,940
That one is wild.

288
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,220
Well, the thing about the Cars movies,

289
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,540
they're not generally Pixar movies for years,

290
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,540
were the what if.

291
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,780
What if the toys talked when you're not around

292
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,980
and had meetings?

293
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,300
What if there were monsters?

294
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,140
There's a meeting.

295
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,860
What if there were monsters under your bed?

296
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,700
You know what I mean?

297
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,540
And had meetings, also.

298
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,360
Different types of things.

299
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,340
Okay, well then Cars, they live in a car land with cars.

300
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,460
They're taught, it's not a what if, it's just cars.

301
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,140
Now I can, I don't want to belittle the Cars movies,

302
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,860
which I've never seen,

303
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,860
but their toys sell more than all the other Pixar toys

304
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,420
put together, the Cars movies.

305
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,860
Yes.

306
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,060
So that might be a motivator to keep making Cars,

307
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,900
is what you're saying.

308
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,020
Yes, I would say, keeping it.

309
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,740
And then when you're seven years old, you don't care.

310
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,580
Yeah.

311
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,580
About the quality of the vroom, vroom.

312
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,900
You're not sitting there going,

313
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,740
this is just a James Bond movie plot with Mater.

314
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,580
Yes.

315
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,420
That is what it is.

316
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,260
With Mater.

317
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,900
He's Larry the Cable Guy's junkyard character.

318
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,980
Oh, okay, how exciting.

319
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,300
Love your back of, do you know who the,

320
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,660
well what is the Lemon and who does the Lemon talk to?

321
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,900
The Lemon, I talk to maybe Larry the Cable Guy.

322
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,260
I don't remember, I get towed.

323
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,100
You seen a tow truck?

324
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,100
Yeah, he tows you.

325
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,100
He tows me Larry the Cable Guy towed you in the movie.

326
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,820
In the beginning or the end of the movie, yes.

327
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,900
So I don't even, I knew him,

328
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,900
I don't want to give away his secrets,

329
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,060
but I knew him before he was Larry the Cable Guy in Florida.

330
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,900
When it was Dan, right?

331
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,740
It was just Dan.

332
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,580
Dan Whitney.

333
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,420
Yeah, he talks a little bit about it.

334
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,260
Oh, he does?

335
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,100
I've seen him kind of half.

336
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,820
I've heard that he doesn't come out of character.

337
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,140
He's never Dan Whitney,

338
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,940
that he's always Larry the Cable Guy,

339
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,620
even when he's interviewed at his house.

340
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,860
I watched him do an interview

341
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,740
where he was half out of character.

342
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,580
I don't know what that means.

343
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,420
He means he had-

344
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,540
Is it that accent?

345
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,060
Yes, that is what it means.

346
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,020
He was like, well, you know,

347
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,620
I can go in and out of Larry and it just,

348
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,100
we know he goes depending on what state I'm in,

349
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,120
that's sort of how I talk.

350
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,460
So if I'm really hanging out with my Southern friends

351
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,300
and then he goes back into the Southern accent

352
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,620
and he's talking about cars

353
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,460
and he talks about how much it means to him.

354
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,620
So he's like kind of half out of character.

355
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,820
By the way, I heard very nice things about him

356
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,900
from the Pixar people,

357
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,540
because I haven't seen him in years.

358
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,420
The ride where he sings these little songs,

359
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,500
the Mater's Junkyard Jamboree.

360
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,340
That's like a ride?

361
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,820
I've never had a lot of fondness for him

362
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,660
or him in the movies,

363
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,940
but I'm listening to those songs in the line.

364
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,140
I'm like, these are great.

365
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,980
Those are good.

366
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,100
Those are like Larry Cable Guy thing I really enjoyed.

367
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,940
Oh, how about that?

368
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,780
I agree.

369
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,140
And that's also in like the Cars Land?

370
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,980
Yes.

371
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,660
On the way to the big one, there's two smaller ones.

372
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,500
Oh, okay.

373
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,780
Essentially just like a spinning around.

374
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,260
Who's the voice on the big one?

375
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,140
Would that be me?

376
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:34,980
Which big?

377
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,820
What are you talking about?

378
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,660
The big one.

379
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,500
The big ride?

380
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,740
By the big one, I mean the big cars ride.

381
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,180
Oh, yeah, screw that.

382
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,340
Not Midway Mania, which you were talking about.

383
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,180
Oh, yeah, yeah.

384
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,020
Your arm was in there.

385
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,860
If that's where you're talking about.

386
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,700
But can I say something?

387
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,540
Yeah, yeah.

388
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,900
I don't love that part of the park.

389
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,140
Oh, really?

390
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,340
I'm more into the Disney part.

391
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,300
Well, you should know that you've been with me.

392
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,540
Yes, we went, famously, the listeners know,

393
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,900
because we talked about it last year.

394
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,140
Yeah, we spent more time in Disneyland,

395
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,980
because it's got the history.

396
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,820
Disneyland is just, it's truly,

397
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,820
and I hate to sound like a doofus,

398
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,420
it's the Magic Kingdom.

399
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,260
Yeah.

400
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,900
It's, there's a specialist to Disneyland

401
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,140
that does not exist on the other park.

402
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,500
The other park's kind of, by the way,

403
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,980
I saw, I don't know if I talked about this last time,

404
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,900
I saw the other park as a, on a table.

405
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,020
The model, when it was a model.

406
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,460
Yeah, when it was a big, it was a big room.

407
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,340
Like, this model of the whole thing.

408
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,180
She's really.

409
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,460
Huh, wait, like when it was in development, you're saying?

410
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,260
When it was in development, yeah, I was allowed to.

411
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,980
When I did the voice for Midway Mania.

412
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,820
Oh, gotcha.

413
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,700
They pulled me into a room.

414
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,260
They made love to me gently.

415
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,700
When I, by they, I mean.

416
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,420
Careful, careful.

417
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,620
By they, I mean all the Pixar people.

418
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,460
Oh, okay.

419
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,260
They're all eager to poke me.

420
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,540
But anyhow, yeah, so.

421
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,580
Yeah, because at that time,

422
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,900
they were redoing a lot of it.

423
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,020
Like, 2008 to 2012,

424
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,020
they were kind of giving that park a facelift.

425
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,180
Yeah, that's what I saw.

426
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,020
Yeah.

427
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,940
You were right in the middle when you guys got.

428
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,780
I saw the mountains and all that.

429
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,620
The cars and mountains, yeah.

430
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,700
Yeah, and the, yeah.

431
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,980
I just realized in the Cars Land though,

432
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,940
they have a ride where Larry the Cable Guy sings a song,

433
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,620
and then they have a ride where Tony Shalhoub sings a song.

434
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,060
Who's Tony Shalhoub?

435
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,820
He's Luigi the car, he's an Italian car.

436
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,660
Oh, I forgot that.

437
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,980
And he has multiple songs that he sings as well.

438
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,540
So you can hear Tony Shalhoub sing.

439
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,900
So where's your multiple songs?

440
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,740
Yeah, you should have a ride.

441
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,500
I'm happy that I don't,

442
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,460
because they would not offer me a lot of money.

443
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,820
It's not something I have interest in.

444
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,660
That is true.

445
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,500
They would not.

446
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,220
I have no interest in singing on a ride,

447
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,220
and they don't pay that much.

448
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,140
It's kind of like if you're not busy that day type of money.

449
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,980
Yeah. Okay, sure.

450
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,820
Yeah.

451
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,740
Like might as well,

452
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,580
but you're not gonna go out of your way.

453
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,420
Might as well type money.

454
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,260
Sure.

455
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,380
You go, yeah, I'll be on the Toy Story ride.

456
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,740
I'll be part of the history of it.

457
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,860
You know what I mean?

458
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,220
But in general, no, it's not like,

459
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,820
oh, I gotta get, I hope they call.

460
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,140
Because it's also that's, from what I understand,

461
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,140
that is it.

462
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,980
That's the payment.

463
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,100
That ride can run for 20, 30 years.

464
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,940
Yes, I never get another payment.

465
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,780
It's a buyout.

466
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,620
It's a buyout.

467
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,660
There's no residuals.

468
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,820
No, there's nothing.

469
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,660
Nothing.

470
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,500
And it's just one little thing.

471
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,020
Because it is being aired more than any TV show

472
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,460
could ever air.

473
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,340
Yeah, it's constant all day, every day.

474
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,180
Millions of times.

475
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,660
But you're agreeing to a buyout,

476
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,100
and what the hell, I don't care.

477
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,940
Sure.

478
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,780
Sag should step in though, honestly.

479
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,340
It would be so funny if there was somebody

480
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,540
whose job was to count how many performances.

481
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,220
We heard though that this is what they did

482
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,980
for the music union, whatever you call it, ASCAP,

483
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,540
that they had to have someone count

484
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,980
how many times Small World plays every day.

485
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,020
And then that's how they figured out

486
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,300
how much you have to owe the people who compose the songs.

487
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,140
So that is-

488
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,340
Wait, the people who compose the songs

489
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,540
get money every time?

490
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,740
It's what I was told.

491
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,420
But it's a Small World, it's an infinite loop.

492
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,380
Right, but you have to, I guess when the loop loops over.

493
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,700
This was told to me by someone who should know too.

494
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,540
This wasn't just like-

495
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,540
Is it someone that you knew?

496
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,380
What do you mean?

497
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,260
Because it's a Small World.

498
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,100
Nice.

499
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,300
Maybe you knew them and you go,

500
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,700
hey, I can't believe I knew him

501
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,420
and he was the one doing that.

502
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,420
It was a tiny little girl from India.

503
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,260
Proper young lady?

504
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,620
Yeah, proper young lady from India.

505
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,740
So yeah, so maybe the Sag needs to just do

506
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,220
what the ASCAP people are doing.

507
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,140
We are calling today for the unions to invade

508
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,700
and take care of this wasteland of illegality.

509
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,180
Sure.

510
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,100
Jeff, have you been to any theme parks

511
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,420
in the last year at all?

512
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,940
Anything that would constitute a theme park

513
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,180
with a ride, a Ferris wheel even?

514
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,820
I've probably been to Disneyland in the past year.

515
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,980
I've been there since we went.

516
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,820
Sure.

517
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,640
Yeah, and I'm going again.

518
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,660
We're filming there.

519
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,500
Really?

520
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,980
Next week I'm filming in Disneyland.

521
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,340
Oh my God, oh no kidding.

522
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,380
Yeah, I can't really give specifics as to why.

523
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,500
But it's Skolberg's.

524
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,340
Yeah. Sure, yeah.

525
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,220
Yeah, filming in Disneyland next Wednesday.

526
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,060
Wow.

527
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,220
The great tradition of,

528
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,420
the theme park episodes of sitcoms are my favorite things.

529
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,860
This is a yes.

530
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,380
We are, the Goldberg family is going on a trip

531
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,380
to Disneyland.

532
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,220
Oh boy.

533
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,380
Wow. Fantastic.

534
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,660
We're filming there next Wednesday.

535
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,420
So does it need to be like aged then in some regard?

536
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,380
I don't think so.

537
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,380
I think they'll probably put us like in an area

538
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,100
with the cups or.

539
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,940
No, tea cups.

540
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,300
I think we're filming near the roller coaster

541
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,220
with the water.

542
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,060
Which one's that?

543
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,380
The Matterhorn.

544
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,220
The Matterhorn, you mean?

545
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,040
Yeah, the Matterhorn.

546
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,880
That's right.

547
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,720
That was in the 80s, right?

548
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,540
Yeah. Yeah.

549
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,260
So I assume that's right.

550
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,060
You're not taking a road trip through a time portal

551
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,540
and ending up in Galaxy's Edge to get a little of that.

552
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,380
Can I say something?

553
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,220
Can I be honest with you?

554
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,040
Yeah.

555
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,180
If we were, I'd be more excited.

556
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,020
No, I mean.

557
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,420
And if we were, I would take less money

558
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,020
than I currently take from the Goldberg.

559
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,620
Is that true?

560
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,700
If there was time travel.

561
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,420
Let me tell you something, in all sincerity.

562
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,300
I had a talk with Adam Goldberg,

563
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,600
who's no longer on the show.

564
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,340
He signed a deal with ABC, Disney,

565
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,260
and he's left.

566
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,180
Sony couldn't close a deal with him.

567
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,420
Which is funny.

568
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,780
We have new producers this year

569
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,980
who are already writers on the show, and they're great.

570
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,480
And I love Adam and Miss Adam.

571
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,860
But Adam and I had a discussion

572
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,620
because it's hard to come up with these stories.

573
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,780
I said, after five seasons, let's have aliens, let's have.

574
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,420
Let's have cousin Oliver II the second.

575
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,740
All these different things that jump the shark.

576
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,940
Let's do a jump the shark season.

577
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,940
And at the first episode, we're watching Happy Days,

578
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,340
and Fonzie jumps the shark and we comment.

579
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,260
And then everything that could possibly happen

580
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,740
in terms of new children, every aspect.

581
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,620
And he agreed, and then we didn't do it.

582
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,140
We're still not doing it.

583
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,420
Because if I ran, there'd be gunplay.

584
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,780
There'd be lots of stuff.

585
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,500
Yeah, meeting past selves all the time.

586
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,020
And then very special episodes, learning about things.

587
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,100
I would love it.

588
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,660
Oh man, that would be fun.

589
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,500
Yeah, like a really serious episode about crack.

590
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,740
Yeah, crack, specifically.

591
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,620
Crack, when my character gets addicted to crack.

592
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,100
It's a bad sign.

593
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,940
No jokes on the entire episode.

594
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,300
Yeah, or I do one episode about the word allegory.

595
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,700
Sure.

596
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,260
Just to confuse people.

597
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,420
That's part of my ride.

598
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,100
Oh, I was gonna say, you're moving through the 80s,

599
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,540
so you will hit the point where John Woo

600
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,660
has started to get very successful in Asia.

601
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,780
So you could do John Woo bullet time episodes

602
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:24,100
with the doves going by the camera and everything.

603
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,580
If only you and I were in charge.

604
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,900
I know.

605
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,740
I'd be so into that.

606
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,260
If you pitched that to me, I'd go, let's do it.

607
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,500
Go write it. Sure.

608
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,340
Cause somebody's gonna find doves.

609
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,580
And then what you'd do, you'd write a first draft,

610
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,100
and I'd go, let's film it.

611
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,940
Yeah.

612
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,620
I guess I wouldn't even read it.

613
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,980
I wouldn't even read it.

614
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,820
What if it was like too short?

615
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,900
Don't care.

616
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,220
It's five pages long.

617
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,380
By the way, just me break dancing

618
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,420
in the middle of Main Street.

619
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,980
Oh boy.

620
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,060
This is the kind of thing I love on shows.

621
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,500
Cause I love when my favorite episodes are where

622
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,820
the beach boys show up and then they just do three songs

623
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,020
and the plot's out the window.

624
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,620
One of my favorites was from What's Happening

625
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,340
when the Doobie Brothers came up.

626
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:05,140
And then Raj said, which doobie you be to one of the doobies.

627
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,020
I got two years later to meet the man who wrote that show.

628
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,140
Oh really? And I thanked him.

629
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,380
Wow.

630
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,540
You had that in your head?

631
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,220
Yeah, I never left it.

632
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,100
That is a great part where they all get,

633
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,500
what rerun is like bootleg recording in the concert.

634
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,900
Oh yeah, that's the one.

635
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,740
Oh yeah.

636
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,580
That's a thing.

637
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,400
But here's the thing.

638
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,300
Here's what was beautiful.

639
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,940
You guys are young and you never got to experience this.

640
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:32,180
And what that is, it's like the equivalent of your show

641
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,660
and the people who listen to your podcast.

642
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,380
You're all on the same page.

643
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,740
You're all share a love for something.

644
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,620
When I was able to, during most of my younger years,

645
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,780
pre-college if you will, when I watched a TV show,

646
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,500
most everybody else was watching the same show.

647
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,940
You shared the reruns, even Bewitched, whatever.

648
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,940
People had shared experiences from now everything to,

649
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,500
I mean, the degree with Hulu and all the channels,

650
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,700
all the podcasts, people only go to

651
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,780
what they feel comfortable with.

652
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,420
That's what they jump in on.

653
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,540
And there's really, unless you share views,

654
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,660
it's why we're so fractured politically,

655
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,020
because unless you share a view

656
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,660
with someone you're not going there,

657
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,240
you're gonna watch the news that presents the news

658
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,640
the way you like it.

659
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,980
That's the world we live in.

660
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,780
It's all split up.

661
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,780
Hearing the Rajan rerun, that made me very happy.

662
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,100
Everyone was united.

663
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,500
There's 30 million people all watching rerun bootleg.

664
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,340
Right.

665
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,140
Now the Goldbergs, I think, after the Watchma,

666
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,020
call it six point some million people or eight million,

667
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,580
whatever, it's a low amount,

668
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,780
but yet it's one of the top rated shows.

669
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,900
Back in the days of what's happening at shows like that,

670
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,220
it would have been canceled first week.

671
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,500
Yeah, I would say even in must-see TV,

672
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,060
that would have been a low amount.

673
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,820
In terms of people even watching TV,

674
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,020
it's a fraction all over the place,

675
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,580
because everyone's all over.

676
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,560
Yeah, which is the cool end of it

677
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,820
is that then people can find things that are like,

678
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,420
this is made for me, this is the nichiest thing.

679
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,380
Without a doubt, that is delightful.

680
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,380
So, you know, I'm not a crotchety, I'm an old man.

681
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,940
I'm a weak old man, my body hurts.

682
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,020
But I will say this, I'm not complaining about it.

683
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,140
It just is what it is.

684
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,380
Well, actually, I am crotchety about this type of thing.

685
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,060
Mostly, I'm not even saying.

686
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,540
I was trying to think of one good,

687
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,780
one glass half full thing about the plant

688
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,620
just splintering over there.

689
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,380
No, I think there's lots more to choose from,

690
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,300
and I think a lot more actors are working.

691
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,580
But even when you talk about actors working,

692
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,860
they're working on shows that run six to 10 episodes,

693
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,120
13 if they're lucky, and then they're tied in,

694
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,820
they can't do something else.

695
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,660
You know what I mean?

696
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,580
It's like, you don't, it's a different world.

697
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,780
You know, yeah.

698
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,900
And then there's the thing of like,

699
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,180
I made a thing, I'm on a thing.

700
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,000
And then the entire channel went away.

701
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,460
Like never to be found again.

702
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,900
By the way, you say that.

703
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,100
True TV, I think, is leaving.

704
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,940
Yeah.

705
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,900
And TBS is taking their program, I think.

706
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,740
Oh.

707
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,580
Yeah, that sounds right.

708
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,400
Something like that.

709
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,980
Yeah, yeah, and HBO Max is in charge of all of them.

710
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,580
It's gonna be the whole thing.

711
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,420
Yeah.

712
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,240
It's all.

713
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,300
My DirecTV Now is now gonna be called AT&T Now.

714
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,140
Is it really though?

715
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,980
Yep.

716
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,800
Wow.

717
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,640
That's creepy.

718
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,480
It is creepy.

719
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,420
AT&T, who wants that in something you like?

720
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,700
No, but now they run our entertainment.

721
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,180
Speaking of evil empire.

722
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,020
Yeah, I know.

723
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,980
Yeah, it all sucks.

724
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:42,020
I'd love for the main people of Disney

725
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,980
and the main people of AT&T to wrestle to the death.

726
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,980
And the survivor gets to produce whatever show they want.

727
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,220
Hey, yeah, which hopefully if you had like a.

728
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,060
In the name of my show.

729
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,900
We do this for in their ear.

730
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,100
I've got a new detective show.

731
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,460
I play proper young lady.

732
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,900
What happens is I go to a crime scene.

733
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,420
I go interview bad guys and I say,

734
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,180
I'm officer proper young lady.

735
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,860
They're so confused, I get them to say anything.

736
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,140
Pull out my badge, I'm officer proper young lady.

737
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,020
How do you spell that?

738
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,260
Never you mind.

739
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,420
Where were you?

740
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,260
Boom, done.

741
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,080
Done, sure.

742
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,920
Show over.

743
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,020
It's a six minute episode.

744
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,460
You know, I admire your commitment.

745
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,020
You gotta pick a bit and stick with it

746
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,380
because all this fragmentation makes

747
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,420
pulling universal references in comedy so difficult.

748
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,740
Like I tried to pitch a sketch at UCB

749
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,300
of like that involved the dilly dilly people,

750
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,340
the Bud Light people.

751
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,060
And everyone's face in the room was blank

752
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,700
because it's like, oh, no one has cable.

753
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,540
Who are the dilly dilly people?

754
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,860
I don't even know.

755
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,300
But this is the point.

756
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,220
Back then, if you watched Happy Days

757
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,020
and the dilly dilly commercial came on,

758
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,540
we all had the shared experience.

759
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,380
Yeah, yeah.

760
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,860
I just asked you guys if you ever saw a show

761
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,660
called DCI Banks, which I'm enjoying.

762
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,900
And as I'm watching it and it's really well done,

763
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,900
there are so many parodies you could do of it

764
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,180
that no one would give a shit about.

765
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,020
Sure, yeah.

766
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,860
Yeah.

767
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,340
But we would probably like, if you like,

768
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,140
we're all, I think we all, everyone in the room is similar.

769
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,980
Oh, no, you would enjoy it very much.

770
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

771
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,460
We all enjoy an old Batman episode

772
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,060
where Jacques Gabor plays the owner of an evil day spa.

773
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,020
What was her name again?

774
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,020
Miss Minerva.

775
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,260
Yeah.

776
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,100
That's real, that's.

777
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,620
Hold on.

778
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,420
Miss Minerva, so help me.

779
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,540
If you've harmed Aunt Harriet

780
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:37,540
when she came in to get her nails done,

781
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:42,540
I will, quick, Robin, get Chief O'Hara over here.

782
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,460
Mm-hmm.

783
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,500
Damn, that was great.

784
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,340
That was fantastic.

785
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,380
That was that little warble that Adam West.

786
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,060
Adam West, I've done it for Adam West twice.

787
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,060
First time.

788
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,020
Was he amused?

789
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,820
Was, evening at the improv.

790
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,060
He was hosting a different episode,

791
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,020
but they had me go up on stage,

792
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,340
like during one of the breaks and do it for him.

793
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,180
Wow.

794
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,380
He came up to me afterwards.

795
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:08,060
From behind, he said, excuse me, you are very talented.

796
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,940
Good luck to you, really good luck.

797
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,940
Ha ha.

798
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,860
Then, only like a week before he died,

799
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,980
I was on a radio show with him and I did it.

800
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,860
And he's not gonna remember, you know.

801
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,580
And I did it and he said to the host,

802
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:27,100
and I went, that is the worst impression I have ever heard.

803
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,700
And I laughed so hard, I almost died.

804
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,420
You know, so.

805
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,260
You vile fiend.

806
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,100
You fiend.

807
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,940
How dare you.

808
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,740
How dare you, Riddler.

809
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,300
Scott did a couple things with him.

810
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,980
He was on Scott's cartoon that he made

811
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,700
called Moonbeam City.

812
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,580
And he was on Gilbert Gottfried's podcast promoting it.

813
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,140
And he didn't know the name of the show.

814
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,300
The show was called Moonbeam City.

815
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,220
And he goes, there's a wonderful show.

816
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,940
And it's called Razzle and Dazzle.

817
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,780
He really said that.

818
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,020
He sweared it, because it was a character's name.

819
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,940
The main character's name is Dazzle,

820
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,060
it was Rob Lowe and his father for one episode.

821
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,660
Did you ever see that cartoon that the guys,

822
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,980
guy who did this other cartoon,

823
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,060
I never knew that, I never put it together.

824
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,660
But Bob Odenkirk and I used to laugh so hard

825
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,100
at the Cosby cartoons, the little shorts.

826
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,020
The mysteries.

827
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,180
Justin Roiland, who does Rick and Morty.

828
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,140
Oh, Rick and Morty did a thing where he created robots

829
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,660
of all these Cosbys.

830
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,380
And Cosby made them stop.

831
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,380
It was awesomeness.

832
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,420
It was like bathtub Cosby.

833
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,980
And like anything there was,

834
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,300
it was one of the greatest things I've ever seen.

835
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,860
I wonder if it's on the internet now,

836
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,900
because Cosby can't stop anything.

837
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,300
He lost all his power.

838
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,740
Or he'll just make that his cause.

839
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,980
Try to win that lawsuit.

840
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,380
Well, by the way, the idea that he announced

841
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,020
on his website, Happy Father's Day.

842
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,860
On Twitter, right?

843
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,680
Wasn't it Twitter?

844
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,460
Twitter or whatever, it's just a guy.

845
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,420
He's out of touch, he doesn't get it.

846
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,180
Yeah, he is out of touch, I would say.

847
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,900
He's a fucking rapist.

848
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,940
Did he auto fill out his Twitter calendar

849
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,340
before going to jail?

850
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,180
So I was getting these.

851
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,020
That's really funny to think about that.

852
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,660
Schedule my tweets might be a way for a while.

853
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,100
I just want to say hello to all the proper young ladies.

854
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,820
I'm sorry.

855
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,820
I'm sorry to the listeners,

856
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,060
because that's not even that funny.

857
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,180
And I laughed.

858
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,020
I keep going.

859
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,260
You don't have to apologize.

860
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,140
I was going to ask you, I was thinking about this.

861
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,780
When you were a young man,

862
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,580
did you go to Kittyland in Chicago?

863
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,500
I went to Kittyland in Chicago.

864
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,940
I can tell you, here's something for you.

865
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,780
So everyone's birthday,

866
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,980
it was a big deal to have your birthday at Kittyland,

867
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,940
which is this little teeny amusement park,

868
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,300
but my memories of it are wonderful.

869
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,300
However, I was a very wild child.

870
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,660
I had impulsivity issues, all that sort of shit.

871
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,580
So dig this.

872
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,740
If someone had a party, this happened numerous times,

873
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,700
they had a fire truck that would take you,

874
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,540
this back in the days

875
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,260
where they weren't going to strap you in.

876
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,340
They just had a fire truck

877
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,260
where kids were in the back of a fire truck,

878
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,380
which is essentially probably a truck.

879
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,980
It was a fire truck.

880
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,900
I had to ride in the car

881
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,260
with the mother of the birthday kid behind the fire truck,

882
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,100
because I was the garland boy,

883
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,460
and they were afraid I'd throw some other kids off

884
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,980
or do something.

885
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,820
Yeah.

886
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,660
Oh, that's 100% true.

887
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,500
Wow.

888
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,340
And I would ride and watch the kids have fun

889
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,300
sitting with the mom without a seatbelt on.

890
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,220
If you hadn't been there,

891
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,820
would you have thrown one of the kids out?

892
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,060
By the way, highly unlikely,

893
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,060
but I was an impulsive young lady.

894
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,900
Sure.

895
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,740
Yeah.

896
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,580
Yeah.

897
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,980
I wouldn't have thrown one of the kids off, no.

898
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,820
Right.

899
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,660
Because I mean, I look back,

900
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,620
but I was a wild kid for sure.

901
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,460
Yeah.

902
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,300
But I never, here's the thing,

903
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,820
I was always a class clown.

904
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:47,580
I was a wild kid, but I never did mean things.

905
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,420
Do you know what I mean?

906
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,260
Yeah.

907
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,660
I never was bad.

908
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,580
I just did things that upset people

909
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,420
because I was loud and impulsive.

910
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,380
Was there a ride you liked the best?

911
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,620
I mean, they had the standard,

912
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,460
there was a Ferris wheel, there was a Tilted Whirl.

913
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,500
I liked the ride, the little train

914
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,180
that went around that you controlled.

915
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,860
It was like, you were-

916
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,940
It was like the Autopia at Disneyland, I think, right?

917
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,780
Yeah.

918
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,620
There was a little movement.

919
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,780
I didn't get to, Kittyland Closet,

920
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,100
I was alive, but we never went.

921
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,940
I think it was on Dempster or one of those streets.

922
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,780
I don't know.

923
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,620
Yeah, something like that.

924
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,660
Yes, but I did go to Kittyland quite often.

925
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,500
Mm-hmm.

926
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,620
Are there, you grew up with anything else

927
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,420
amusement park-wise?

928
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:30,660
There was, well, I moved from Chicago

929
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,820
when I was 12 to South Florida,

930
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,180
and there was a place called Pirates World.

931
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,020
Oh.

932
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,140
Pirates World was like an amusement park like that

933
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,740
with roller coasters, but also they'd have concerts.

934
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:46,740
Someone just sent me a JPEG of Led Zeppelin tickets

935
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,940
to go see them at Pirates World.

936
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,780
Whoa.

937
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,860
They had lots of concerts there at Pirates World.

938
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,700
Yeah.

939
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,700
It was Griffin Road and I-95 in Hollywood, Florida.

940
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,940
So if you wanna go visit the empty spot,

941
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,780
the vacant spot, I don't know, maybe-

942
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,860
I don't even know what's there now.

943
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,700
I wonder.

944
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,540
I don't know, but anyhow,

945
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:08,420
Pirates World was a big deal in terms of amusement parks.

946
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,380
And then also there was Monkey Jungle and Parrot Jungle

947
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,940
in South Florida that I would go to and the Seaquarium.

948
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,180
Is one of these a thing, our guest told us about a thing

949
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,780
where like a monkey had to go off a diving board

950
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,500
where they made monkeys do bad things to amuse the grad.

951
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,180
That might've been Monkey Jungle.

952
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,300
My big thing, memories of Monkey Jungle

953
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,180
were going with my uncle and then he would say,

954
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,940
when they went and say, how was Monkey Jungle?

955
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,020
And he'd go, we saw a lot of monkey duty

956
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,620
and I thought that was so funny.

957
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,340
That's pretty funny.

958
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,180
Yeah.

959
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,020
Yeah, I don't disagree with that.

960
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,860
Yeah.

961
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,460
So you left Chicago in like 19-

962
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,500
75, 76.

963
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,340
Okay.

964
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,260
75.

965
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,780
Cause there was, I was looking this up

966
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,860
and I didn't know anything about this.

967
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,780
There was a place called Old Chicago Amusement Park.

968
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,620
Yes.

969
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,440
Do you remember this?

970
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,040
No, but you know, by the way,

971
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,860
the most famous amusement park was the one over on Western.

972
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,700
What was it?

973
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,540
It was-

974
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,380
Oh wait, yeah.

975
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,700
No, it's like the most famous in Chicago.

976
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,700
Everybody talked about it for years.

977
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,540
My dad went there as a kid.

978
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,380
Yeah.

979
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,220
It was-

980
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,460
Chicagoland?

981
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,300
No.

982
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,780
No, that's a good name though for one.

983
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,620
Just trying.

984
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,660
It was just called Grandma.

985
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,260
And you'd go there and old ladies

986
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,420
would just take you home with them

987
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,620
and touch your genitalia.

988
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,460
Yeah.

989
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,300
Riverview?

990
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,140
Yeah.

991
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:27,140
Riverview was very popular in Chicago.

992
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,220
Yes, it was there for years.

993
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,900
It was gone, I think, by the time I was born.

994
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,100
67, it was closed.

995
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,820
I was born in 62, so I was five.

996
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,660
My parents never said,

997
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,380
let's take the boy to Riverview.

998
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,700
I never went to my knowledge.

999
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,380
This Old Chicago one was in 1975.

1000
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,220
Where was it?

1001
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,040
It was one year?

1002
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,880
It was Bolingbrook.

1003
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,060
No, no, it lasted for, well, it lasted for six years,

1004
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,380
but it was the first indoor amusement park.

1005
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,220
Oh, did it?

1006
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,060
It was a mall?

1007
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,220
Yes, it was a mall, but they had roller coasters,

1008
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,220
they had fun characters,

1009
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,820
and they had musical performances.

1010
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,380
And I would like to read some of the performers.

1011
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,220
Paper Lace.

1012
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,040
Lace.

1013
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,880
That went through.

1014
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,020
Tommy James and the Shandels,

1015
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,700
The Coasters, Wild Cherry, Willie Ames.

1016
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,720
Oh, from...

1017
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,620
Eight is Enough, Charles and Charge.

1018
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,420
And what was the movie he did with Zapped?

1019
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,260
Oh yeah.

1020
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,100
Yeah, well, yeah.

1021
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,060
And he also in the 90s was Bible Man on TV.

1022
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,460
Yes, our...

1023
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,500
We were going to do a whole episode about Bible Man,

1024
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,860
which is a real religious show he was on,

1025
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,900
Bible Superhero.

1026
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,900
And you know, he and Kirk Cameron date now.

1027
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,740
I didn't know.

1028
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,660
Yeah.

1029
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,660
Those hypocrites.

1030
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,260
Anson Williams played there from Happy Days.

1031
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,100
What?

1032
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,580
Here's what Anson Williams did.

1033
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,580
He stood on the stage and people in the audience just went,

1034
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,900
Pottsie!

1035
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,260
And he'd give a light wave.

1036
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,020
He just endured Pottsie-ells for 90 minutes.

1037
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,860
Sit on it.

1038
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,540
Sit on it, Pottsie.

1039
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,260
By the way, that was in his writer.

1040
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,180
No one was allowed to say sit on it.

1041
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,020
Someone says sit on it,

1042
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,820
you get the fuck out of there.

1043
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,740
You rough them and don't be soft.

1044
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,780
Don't be easy on them.

1045
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,060
Get them out of there.

1046
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,580
Don't be easy on them.

1047
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,740
As if they would be really kind to the people

1048
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,980
being kicked out for saying sit on it.

1049
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,780
Move them, but give them a nice couch to sit on afterwards.

1050
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,060
Rip Taylor performed there.

1051
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:18,900
Nice.

1052
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,740
Yeah, nice.

1053
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,140
It's good it's indoor too,

1054
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,220
so the confetti couldn't get far.

1055
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,100
The Star Wars robots, C-3PO and R2-D2,

1056
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:26,940
listed as performing.

1057
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,780
What the fuck are you talking about?

1058
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,180
They did a live act?

1059
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,020
I don't know.

1060
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:30,860
What do you mean?

1061
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,580
Well, you know I'm in the new Star Wars.

1062
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,380
I knew that, but I thought that was a secret.

1063
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,940
I guess it is, but I don't have any lines.

1064
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,540
You want me to cut this out?

1065
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,180
No, no, no, I'm one of those people that's in it

1066
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,740
and you go, who's that?

1067
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,980
That looks, because I think people will know that it's me.

1068
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,060
Well, they'll know if they-

1069
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:47,900
What's the tell?

1070
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,740
I'm not telling.

1071
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,820
You can't tell the tell.

1072
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,860
Yeah, I'm not gonna tell the tell.

1073
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,700
I don't wanna do that.

1074
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,540
Don't tell the tell.

1075
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,380
But I am in it.

1076
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,860
Huh, but you think we, with no information,

1077
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,700
we're watching the film, but we would know.

1078
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,740
My point being is I worked with the CP-3O guy.

1079
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,580
You did?

1080
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:05,180
Who, by the way, wears the outfit, literally,

1081
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:09,380
and he's very proper and he's very kind gentleman,

1082
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,060
but he takes it very seriously.

1083
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,900
Wow.

1084
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,620
Crazy seriously.

1085
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,460
Huh, were you-

1086
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,620
So if he was touring the nation in Chicago, then he was-

1087
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,940
No, I think it was fake CP-3Os.

1088
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,780
I don't think so.

1089
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,420
I don't know.

1090
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,260
If I were him, I'd wanna tour.

1091
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,500
I'd wanna go sing songs, go sing like, you know,

1092
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,340
Parking Family covers.

1093
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,020
He sings the Luigi songs from Cars.

1094
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:36,860
Yeah, he does some Shakespeare sonnets,

1095
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,700
some soliloquies.

1096
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,140
Nobody was very focused and serious,

1097
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:44,340
cause I, you know, I'll actually have a good bit

1098
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,860
after the movie comes out,

1099
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,940
because I really did a lot to distract everyone

1100
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,220
and fuck things up.

1101
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,060
Sure, yeah.

1102
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,900
Including JJ.

1103
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,380
Starting with calling him CP-3O.

1104
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,540
JJ would say to me, he goes,

1105
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,180
stop moving to your right,

1106
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,900
cause you know you're filling the whole screen.

1107
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,180
I'm not making that up,

1108
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,020
cause I saw where the camera was

1109
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,460
and I would make my way into like an area.

1110
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,260
And he goes, you can't cause everyone's gonna go,

1111
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,860
because what I was in it, I can't talk about,

1112
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,140
but you would be, it would put all your focus there,

1113
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,980
trust me.

1114
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,900
Okay, okay, sure.

1115
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,020
Didn't you say there were versions

1116
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,820
where you were allowed to just say whatever you wanted?

1117
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,540
I did it for the dailies that they sent to Disney.

1118
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,740
I did one where I talked about,

1119
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:33,100
I'll be making, I told certain characters to leave,

1120
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,820
go do what they're about to do.

1121
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,660
When they come back, I'll have built a puppet theater

1122
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,020
and there'd be fresh pancakes for everybody.

1123
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,660
So this was just sent blinds to Disney for them to go what?

1124
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,540
I don't know if they'll put that on the CD, the DVD,

1125
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,820
but there are DVD extras, whatever extras.

1126
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,700
iTunes has extras now, but the point being is,

1127
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,500
I don't know if they'll include any of that.

1128
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,340
Wow.

1129
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,980
Yes, I did do that on the Star Wars set.

1130
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,260
This is another character though,

1131
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,020
that could end up in a ride maybe.

1132
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,980
Well, by the way, there was a,

1133
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,300
I did a 3D thing of my character.

1134
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,540
I was with you when you did it.

1135
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,380
What?

1136
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,460
Well, that was actually,

1137
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,300
That's a different day?

1138
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,580
That was for, yes.

1139
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,420
There was another scan.

1140
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,100
What you came with me for was the scan for my costume.

1141
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:17,940
Oh.

1142
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,420
The scan for everything I wore.

1143
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,740
So it would fit me exact.

1144
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,820
No, I got scanned for a fucking toy.

1145
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,660
Wow.

1146
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,500
Wow.

1147
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,340
Yeah.

1148
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,340
I will tell you the name of my character, Zebra Girl.

1149
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,980
That's all I can say.

1150
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,140
Pretty little Zebra Girl.

1151
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,980
It's not what many other names sound like

1152
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,820
in the Star Wars universe.

1153
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,740
Honestly, it does.

1154
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,580
There's a character named Yak Face.

1155
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,420
That's real.

1156
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,260
Yeah, but I think so.

1157
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,500
That's extremely similar.

1158
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,380
I don't think it's similar at all to Zebra Girl.

1159
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,020
I don't even know what my character's name is.

1160
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:47,860
I'll name my character.

1161
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,420
There's this whole damn well, I'll name it.

1162
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,260
That's great.

1163
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,100
I think,

1164
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,940
Jizamina.

1165
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,220
It's not a porno.

1166
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,180
It's not a G.

1167
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,020
Yeah.

1168
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,860
Yeah.

1169
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,380
Maybe that character will have

1170
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,180
their own Disney Plus series though,

1171
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,060
cause everything's spinning out.

1172
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,020
By the way, who knows?

1173
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,140
Would you do it?

1174
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,540
Play this whatever character.

1175
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,380
No.

1176
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,200
No.

1177
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,040
Cause they're coming for your back end, so.

1178
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,880
What's that?

1179
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,720
You know, they're taking your back end.

1180
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,700
Disney's coming for the back end.

1181
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,660
Yeah, no, no, I would not have no interest.

1182
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,900
What if the character,

1183
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,220
your character was played by Jason?

1184
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,500
Would you sign off on it?

1185
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,420
Would you give him the blessing to portray the character?

1186
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,940
Last thing, I beg them.

1187
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,780
I would too.

1188
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,620
I would say please.

1189
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,460
Please.

1190
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,300
Please.

1191
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,100
Yeah, we're looking.

1192
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,340
But I would only, if it was called Nursing Richards.

1193
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,220
Did it have to be the name of the show or the character?

1194
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,060
Both.

1195
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,900
Both, okay.

1196
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,720
It's fine.

1197
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,560
That's fine with us.

1198
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,940
A Star Wars spinoff called Nurse.

1199
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,140
See, I love confusing people.

1200
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,980
Yeah, yeah.

1201
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,580
Well, it's working.

1202
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,300
Yeah, I know, people will be so confused.

1203
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,380
The new Star Wars show is a character we don't know

1204
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,620
whose name is a verb.

1205
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,300
And then it's played by the podcast

1206
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,060
that rides Jason Sheridan, I think.

1207
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,380
Come on, how awesome would that be?

1208
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,220
We'd love it.

1209
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,040
Yeah.

1210
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,880
I'd beg for it.

1211
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,720
Yeah.

1212
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,460
So I had not been to Wrigley Field.

1213
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,700
We went to, you were very nice

1214
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,980
and took me to Wrigley Field last year.

1215
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,040
And I hadn't been in many years.

1216
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,260
And to me, it's starting to look

1217
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,300
a little more like a city walk around there.

1218
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,140
The outside?

1219
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:18,980
The outside.

1220
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:22,180
As much as you say city walk, it's really not.

1221
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,940
It looks like a place where people would gather

1222
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,380
and there's lots of funds and there's a big board.

1223
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,420
It's not, city walk is disappointing.

1224
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,260
What?

1225
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,940
I said heresy.

1226
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,140
Outside of Wrigley Field is delightful.

1227
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:36,980
I agree.

1228
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,820
Well, but the thing is, we three think city walk also

1229
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,980
is disappointing, but also is delightful.

1230
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,820
We feel like it's both things at the same time.

1231
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,020
Like we have a lot of affection for it.

1232
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,820
I've actually never had a bad time at city walk.

1233
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:52,260
But I've just seen all the things open and close.

1234
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,740
It just seemed so unfocused, city walk, the randomness.

1235
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,580
Yes, certainly.

1236
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,420
Of it all.

1237
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,940
It's tacky.

1238
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,940
It's tacky, that's exactly the word.

1239
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,820
And actually at times you hear dangerous.

1240
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,940
Once in a while.

1241
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,220
There are some bad stories.

1242
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,540
There's been some deaths in the parking lot.

1243
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:14,020
By the way, supposedly there's secret meetings

1244
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,420
of people who are into old West collectibles.

1245
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,260
Here we go.

1246
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,460
They meet near where the water pops up out of the ground.

1247
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,260
There's an area over there where people exchange spurs.

1248
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,060
The seediest thing I've ever heard.

1249
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,060
And that's the thing that makes the most sense to me

1250
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,900
about city walk.

1251
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,980
There's one good thing in it's course.

1252
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,380
Yeah, well we agree, that's good too.

1253
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:40,180
What would really ruin the Wrigleyville area?

1254
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,860
Would it be a full Cubs theme park?

1255
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,380
Would that be a terrible,

1256
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,340
it would be a terrible idea, no doubt.

1257
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,740
No, but by the way, I actually disagree with you.

1258
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,020
In terms of everything is about execution.

1259
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,580
Now my automatic response to anything

1260
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:00,260
is a bit of cynicism.

1261
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,060
And cynicism is not good.

1262
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,020
Skepticism is good.

1263
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,340
But now the way the world is all so corporate

1264
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,820
in terms of these things,

1265
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,460
I'm actually more cynical than I am skeptical.

1266
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,180
And that makes me sad.

1267
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:20,060
But the execution of, I'll give you an example.

1268
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,460
Man, I always have loved the farmers market

1269
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,620
at Third and Fairfax.

1270
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,660
And when they talked about the Grove, I was skeptical.

1271
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,500
I wasn't cynical.

1272
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,740
I was like, really, is this gonna work?

1273
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,420
And it's great.

1274
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,020
I think it's great.

1275
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:37,220
And it brought a whole new life to the farmers market.

1276
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:40,060
The farmers at night is vibrant.

1277
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:43,260
And it's just, the whole area is just, it's,

1278
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:48,140
I mean, the bad part is the traffic at Fairfax and Third

1279
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,820
is really the negative part of it.

1280
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:53,940
But outside of that, the execution was done well.

1281
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,060
Wrigley Field, people were like,

1282
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,900
you're gonna put a scoreboard here and do this and do that.

1283
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,740
But the execution is wonderful.

1284
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,580
I like it.

1285
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,660
You don't go into Wrigley Field going, this is horrible.

1286
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,460
It still is a magical place.

1287
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,020
By the way, Wrigley Field's one of the only places

1288
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,460
that I feel on in America that you can compare

1289
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,540
to Disneyland in terms of how one-

1290
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,380
The feeling you're getting.

1291
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,200
Yeah, yeah.

1292
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,040
I agree, yeah.

1293
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,880
Magic, history.

1294
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,540
Especially when you come out,

1295
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:25,220
when you walk first into the park in the middle of summer

1296
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:28,580
and it's all green, the vines, it's pretty remarkable.

1297
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,980
It does have like an imagineered feeling to it.

1298
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,340
It's like touched by an Imagineer.

1299
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,940
If you wanna see a bad version of that,

1300
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,660
go to where like the New York Mets play,

1301
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,500
where it's cavernous and it looks old-timey, but it's not.

1302
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,340
It's just-

1303
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,140
And then the worst version of that

1304
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,420
is where the White Sox play,

1305
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,140
where they couldn't even get that down.

1306
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,900
There was no field.

1307
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,300
So, I mean, everything is about execution, intention.

1308
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,500
What's the intention?

1309
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,820
And then how's the execution of the good intention.

1310
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,260
You're open to a Cubs amusement park

1311
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,700
sitting next to- I'm open to everything.

1312
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,100
I'm open to nine more Avengers movies.

1313
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,360
Please make them good.

1314
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,460
Please make me care about the character.

1315
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,580
I love comic books.

1316
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,980
I collect comic books.

1317
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,700
I do not like most superhero movies.

1318
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,180
Again, I'm anti-Disney suddenly,

1319
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,740
but I do because I don't care.

1320
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,380
And these are characters I grew up with.

1321
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,640
I don't care.

1322
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,580
It's like, that's why I love Deadpool,

1323
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,420
cause I cared about the characters.

1324
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,380
I cared about him, his girlfriend, the whole thing.

1325
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,620
I bought into it.

1326
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:37,520
Same with Batman, the Christian Bale one.

1327
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,300
I bought into that universe

1328
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,300
and I cared about the characters.

1329
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,940
It's all about caring about what goes on

1330
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,860
and the emotionality of it.

1331
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,820
And most of these, I'll just even say the Marvel movies,

1332
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,740
I don't care.

1333
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:56,100
I watched Ms. Marvel, I mean, Captain Marvel,

1334
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,740
who was based on the-

1335
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,660
We have the Marvelous James Marvel.

1336
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,100
The very storied history of Carol Danvers.

1337
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,300
Danvers, exactly.

1338
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,140
I'm just saying the whole thing of it,

1339
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,780
like who didn't spot the bad guy

1340
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:10,180
from the first time he walks on the screen?

1341
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,340
And what do I care?

1342
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:14,620
I actually watched it going, defeat them you scrawls.

1343
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,620
By the way, I saw the first episode,

1344
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:19,700
or first 15 minutes of the episode of Pennyworth,

1345
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,540
is that his name?

1346
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,380
Yeah, the Alfred show.

1347
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,340
Oh, sexy Alfred, yeah.

1348
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,180
Yeah, he's sexy, right?

1349
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,020
Sexy Alfred.

1350
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:24,860
It's so bad.

1351
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,260
Oh no.

1352
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,820
It's so bad because people don't understand.

1353
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,180
When you see a movie, any movie,

1354
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,140
and it's an outer space movie,

1355
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:39,660
and it starts with lots of explosions and fighting,

1356
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,740
but you don't care about who's fighting,

1357
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,900
the filmmaker has no idea what they're doing.

1358
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,740
The people who are producing have no idea.

1359
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,900
You have to care about characters.

1360
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,660
If you're not emotionally in, what's the purpose?

1361
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,500
Yeah.

1362
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,500
Well, I think that works on rides.

1363
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,820
It's rides as well.

1364
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,940
If you care about the characters,

1365
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,140
if you care about what's happening,

1366
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,780
there's rides we've been in that suck.

1367
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,540
By the way, thank you, tie it again.

1368
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,260
I'm trying to tie it back.

1369
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,900
Why is Luigi singing?

1370
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,740
What is he singing about?

1371
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,260
Why is he rollicking?

1372
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,300
Getting back to rides, it's also, is the ride fun?

1373
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,140
Do I care?

1374
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,660
Do I wanna do it again?

1375
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,220
I mean, sometimes you go on rides,

1376
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,140
not often in the world of Disney,

1377
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,660
but you go, I've gone on rides where after I was done,

1378
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,540
I was like, what was that?

1379
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,420
Can you think of one?

1380
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,220
Yeah, you gotta tell us what you're.

1381
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,060
I don't know, name one.

1382
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,220
What don't you do?

1383
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,060
Disney.

1384
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,020
Have you done Falcon yet?

1385
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,580
You haven't done Star Wars.

1386
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,380
Oh, I have not done the new Star Wars park, no.

1387
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,220
Okay, sure, sure.

1388
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,060
I will.

1389
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,300
The Millennium Falcon is a little like,

1390
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,980
I mean, you know you're on the Millennium Falcon,

1391
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:36,820
but the plot of the ride is a little.

1392
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:39,020
But I was on the actual Millennium Falcon.

1393
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:39,860
Oh, no kidding.

1394
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,900
So my experience is a little bit different.

1395
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,740
That might be better.

1396
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,580
It's a little more specialized.

1397
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,340
It's not exactly repeatable for the American public.

1398
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,180
No, it's not.

1399
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,020
You're saying.

1400
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:47,860
By the way, you know what's interesting

1401
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,460
about the Millennium Falcon and being on it?

1402
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:53,540
It really is, the only thing that it can't do is fly.

1403
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:56,940
When you're on it, you're on the ship.

1404
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:57,780
And it's the full thing.

1405
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,940
There's no aspect of it where you go,

1406
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:03,380
oh, there's the plastic thing or whatever.

1407
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,180
You feel like you're on the Millennium Falcon.

1408
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:09,100
They have built the Millennium Falcon, okay?

1409
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,020
It's fascinating.

1410
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,020
Geez.

1411
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,580
Is there anywhere to use the bathroom?

1412
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,420
Do they got a bathroom on there?

1413
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,980
No, there's no bathroom on the Millennium Falcon.

1414
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,580
So there's one where you can't fly and you can't go to the.

1415
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,740
There's little cups with your name on it.

1416
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:19,980
It's really how they know.

1417
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,860
That's better than just a PA going like,

1418
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,580
Jeff's on the move, we got eyes on Jeff.

1419
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:26,420
We got eyes on Jeff.

1420
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,260
He'll be right back.

1421
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,940
By the way, one of my favorite things to do when I work,

1422
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,580
this is one of my own personal things,

1423
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:34,380
whoever's got eyes on me and I run away from and hide.

1424
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,020
And they're like, I've lost Jeff and I'm already on set.

1425
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:42,300
And like, don't tell him that and keep looking for me.

1426
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,860
Yet I just said I wasn't mean-spirited.

1427
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,580
I guess that is mean, but it's fun.

1428
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,940
I don't know, that's playful.

1429
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:47,780
Yeah, playful.

1430
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,740
You know we talk about Clooney doing those pranks.

1431
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,660
You get to do some pranks too.

1432
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,700
Yes, yes I do.

1433
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,620
Yeah, what is it?

1434
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,380
Was that Disney movie that Clooney did that I didn't like?

1435
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,940
I wish I had. Tomorrowland.

1436
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,180
Yeah, it's rough.

1437
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:00,020
It is rough.

1438
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,420
I wanted. That's cynical.

1439
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:02,460
That's very cynical.

1440
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,140
By the way, that premise, I wanted to jump into that.

1441
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,620
And be part of it.

1442
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:07,460
It was such a great idea.

1443
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,940
All the buildup stuff, all that like,

1444
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,780
promotional stuff was really fun.

1445
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:12,700
How cool is that?

1446
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,620
And then, wow.

1447
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,460
They caught Walt Disney out of it.

1448
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:17,300
He was gonna be in it.

1449
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,340
I mean, obviously not the man.

1450
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,580
He wasn't alive to shoot it,

1451
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,260
but they were gonna put archival footage.

1452
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,260
That's the secret that I'm gonna

1453
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,740
podcast the ride listeners.

1454
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:24,580
Oh, right now?

1455
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,620
As Walt Disney is still alive.

1456
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:28,540
Oh my God.

1457
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,780
Wait a minute, so when you saw the model

1458
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,140
of future California mention,

1459
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,140
then did they take you to another room

1460
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,860
where he was cryogenically frozen?

1461
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,660
Nope, I know where he's hiding.

1462
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:38,500
He made love to you.

1463
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,100
He made love to me, stop, I know where he's hiding.

1464
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,180
Where? He's actually Lincoln.

1465
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,020
Lincoln.

1466
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:44,860
He's Lincoln.

1467
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,180
He became that which he loved the most.

1468
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,020
Yeah, he does.

1469
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:48,900
He has a beard on him.

1470
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,060
You can't tell at all.

1471
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,700
The only lapse is when he bends at the knees.

1472
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,380
I love Disney so much.

1473
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,060
The only thing that's hard for me at Disney

1474
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:56,380
is I can't have ice cream.

1475
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,780
He's still not doing sugar?

1476
00:46:58,780 --> 00:46:59,780
Still not doing sugar.

1477
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:00,620
Wow, congrats.

1478
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:01,440
Can I say something?

1479
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,660
Truly, Disneyland is so much,

1480
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,980
as great as Disneyland is,

1481
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,660
you throw in some ice cream,

1482
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,220
oh my God, it's heaven.

1483
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,060
Yeah.

1484
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,820
Ice cream and Disney, a mixture,

1485
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:12,780
forget about it.

1486
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,780
You don't gotta tell Jason twice.

1487
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:15,900
Proof of God.

1488
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,740
We talk about ice cream maybe every episode with Jason.

1489
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,940
By the way, I've not had sugar almost two years.

1490
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,380
The only thing that I can tell you that I miss,

1491
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,540
like literally miss, is ice cream.

1492
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:29,320
Like, cookies are great, cupcakes, all that stuff,

1493
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,500
but let me tell you something.

1494
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,520
Ice cream is like an experience no other.

1495
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,360
It's so special.

1496
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,180
Yeah.

1497
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,020
Do you know?

1498
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,060
Oh, I would love,

1499
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,700
all right, here's me taking over Disney.

1500
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:39,540
Sure.

1501
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,180
I'd have Ice Cream Village and Ice Cream the Ride.

1502
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,020
And everything.

1503
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:43,860
Yes.

1504
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,220
Do what Ice Cream the Ride would be.

1505
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,620
I'd have a bunch of chairs

1506
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,320
and give people ice cream and tell them to close their eyes.

1507
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,540
Do I think of anything?

1508
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,380
It's up to you.

1509
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,820
Just use your imagination.

1510
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,260
It all comes true with ice cream.

1511
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,100
Actually, yeah.

1512
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:57,920
Wow.

1513
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,300
Do you know that there is a pin available

1514
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,620
that is your WALL-E character eating

1515
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,840
and staring at a big old cup of ice cream?

1516
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,680
The Captain?

1517
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,520
Yeah.

1518
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,340
That's a pin?

1519
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,180
Where do you get that?

1520
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,020
It's a pin.

1521
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:11,860
Is that an official Disney pin?

1522
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,680
Yeah, and it's available,

1523
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,340
I had to learn all this weird code.

1524
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,060
It's available at like, what is it?

1525
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,540
DSF.

1526
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:18,380
What's DSF?

1527
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,620
Disney Soda Fountain.

1528
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,780
It's exclusively at the Ghirardelli Soda Fountain

1529
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,900
next to the El Capitan.

1530
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:24,740
You can get it now.

1531
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,780
Yeah, I think, or you could at one time.

1532
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,580
Now they're going on eBay.

1533
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,060
Kind of reasonable, but it's like,

1534
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,700
yeah, look at it, big old cup,

1535
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,540
a lot of whipped cream.

1536
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,940
Somebody I know is gonna order those.

1537
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:37,900
Whenever Mike goes to Disney, what do I have you do?

1538
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,020
Buy the whole shelf of Buttercup dolls.

1539
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:40,860
Buttercup the Unicorn.

1540
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:41,900
Oh, I would say, yeah.

1541
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,780
I've got a garage full of, I really do.

1542
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,580
I probably have like 25 Buttercup dolls.

1543
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:49,220
Whenever people have kids, I give it to them.

1544
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:52,420
But at a certain point, like I run out of people with kids.

1545
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:56,540
I'm 57 years old until I have grandchildren.

1546
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:59,740
I'm just gonna fill it up my grandchildren's room.

1547
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,220
Papa, why are there so many of these?

1548
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,620
Because I get a dollar for every one, and I am Lincoln.

1549
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,860
You have to force Mike to have a child in order to,

1550
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:11,700
you're gonna force him at gunpoint.

1551
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:12,540
And then with a granddaughter,

1552
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,260
you know what she's gonna be.

1553
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,580
Proper young lady.

1554
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,940
A proper young lady.

1555
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,900
Will she be in any magazines or anything?

1556
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,020
Granddaughter magazine.

1557
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,020
By the way, your listeners who only knew

1558
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,500
that I annoyed them with this.

1559
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,820
Did you ever tell them what happened

1560
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,020
with granddaughter in the magazine?

1561
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:27,860
And it ultimately is said.

1562
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,660
I told them, but I didn't tell the listeners.

1563
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:34,260
It was heard by some people at Mad Magazine,

1564
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,500
your podcast, The Ride episode.

1565
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,900
And they asked me about granddaughter magazine,

1566
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:45,100
and I was asked to, and I offered Mike to write it with me.

1567
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,820
They were gonna give me, one, two, three, four page,

1568
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:52,420
wait, one, two, yeah, four pages in the book

1569
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:55,900
for like a parody magazine of granddaughter magazine.

1570
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,340
And we were gonna have Bob Saget be the centerfold.

1571
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:02,540
I got Bob to agree to pose for granddaughter magazine.

1572
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,580
And the whole thing, but what happened?

1573
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,340
Mad Magazine went out of business.

1574
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,180
No more.

1575
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:09,060
I broke that news to my father last night

1576
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,500
who was crestfallen.

1577
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,140
I cannot believe there's no more Mad.

1578
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,180
Yeah, I know.

1579
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:18,100
It's really unfortunate, but it's kind of a no-win situation

1580
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:22,900
because Mad Magazine becomes irrelevant

1581
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,780
the second that South Park comes on the air.

1582
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:29,620
South Park does way more damage,

1583
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:33,780
makes fun of more in a better way than Mad Magazine.

1584
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:38,740
Mad Magazine served its purpose probably into the 80s.

1585
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:43,740
And then after that, or late 70s with National Lampoon

1586
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:46,700
taking it to a harder place.

1587
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,500
But for its time, Mad Magazine was comedy

1588
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,300
and the most important thing.

1589
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,540
Sure. Really, yeah.

1590
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,500
But yeah, it's like,

1591
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,580
Mad couldn't get like crazier or harder.

1592
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:58,420
It just wouldn't have been.

1593
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,660
There was nothing you could do.

1594
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:00,780
Really, it wasn't.

1595
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:04,140
There was nothing, it was a no-win situation.

1596
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:07,020
I actually even towards the end offered myself

1597
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,580
to be the editor.

1598
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,180
I was trying to be the editor.

1599
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:13,140
I'm happy to be the editor

1600
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:17,060
and I'll help make it at least funny.

1601
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,580
How far did you get?

1602
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,420
What happened?

1603
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,500
Someone suggested and someone said no.

1604
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:28,940
I don't know what happened because actually

1605
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,540
this is during the time that the magazine fell apart.

1606
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,340
That's why I was offering my help.

1607
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,180
Oh, I see.

1608
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:35,020
Okay, yeah.

1609
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:38,140
And they've also had multiple owners

1610
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:41,420
and I think that's, is it AT&T now,

1611
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,500
Owens Warner Brothers?

1612
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,740
Yeah, so it's AT&T now.

1613
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,020
So Warner Brothers thing.

1614
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:46,860
Were you ever in there?

1615
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,700
Was there ever like a, did they do Curb?

1616
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,540
Yes, Curb.

1617
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,380
They did a Curb.

1618
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,220
And there was other things.

1619
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:54,300
But I actually have a frame somewhere in my garage,

1620
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,940
a framed picture of the Art Fort

1621
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,860
signed by the writer and the artist.

1622
00:51:58,860 --> 00:51:59,900
Wow, that's fantastic.

1623
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:00,740
That's great.

1624
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:05,660
It was truly one of the most wonderful

1625
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,100
from a not even an ego standpoint,

1626
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:12,780
but from a, my childhood,

1627
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,500
tying into my childhood.

1628
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,340
Oh yeah.

1629
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,540
You know, like, oh my God, I'm in Mad Magazine.

1630
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:18,380
Yeah.

1631
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,540
It seemed like at a certain point,

1632
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:22,100
it mostly existed for people to go like,

1633
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,020
this is meaningful for me to be in here.

1634
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,580
Right, well by the way, you say that.

1635
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,420
It existed for a few dozen people.

1636
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:31,580
I have the last like seven, eight issues, whatever it is.

1637
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:33,260
I just was supporting.

1638
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,100
Yeah.

1639
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,260
They tried some interesting stuff in the last year or two.

1640
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:40,260
I only did it because I wanted to help support it.

1641
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,940
Like I went to that comic book store today

1642
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,060
and I bought comic books

1643
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,340
because I want them to stay in business.

1644
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:45,180
Sure.

1645
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,100
I bought some expensive back issues.

1646
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:47,940
Yeah.

1647
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:48,760
I go to a pro wrestling show.

1648
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,580
I buy the t-shirt from one of the wrestlers

1649
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,180
to give him a little more money in his pocket.

1650
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,020
So it comes back.

1651
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:53,840
I love that.

1652
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,680
I just did it.

1653
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,520
I just bought a shirt.

1654
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,340
You love.

1655
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,540
By the way, do you ever listen to Matt's podcast

1656
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,380
about wrestling?

1657
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:59,900
I have not.

1658
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:00,740
What's it called?

1659
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:01,580
We'll give him a plug.

1660
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,400
Grandma.

1661
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,240
Oh, okay.

1662
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,060
Actually to tell you the truth,

1663
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:04,900
I do not know the name of the thing

1664
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,060
because I don't listen.

1665
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,700
By the way, I don't listen to your podcast.

1666
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,540
That's fine.

1667
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,380
Yeah.

1668
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:11,220
No one needs to do that.

1669
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,540
I have no interest whatsoever

1670
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:15,220
except as you as individuals.

1671
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,060
Sure.

1672
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:16,900
Well, thank you.

1673
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:17,740
I appreciate it.

1674
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:18,580
I have no connection with the product.

1675
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,980
We talked about if you had wings.

1676
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:21,820
Yes.

1677
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,100
And therefore, once we were done with that,

1678
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,700
my interest in your show went down.

1679
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:26,740
If someone said to me,

1680
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:30,060
there's a podcast they're talking about if you had wings.

1681
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:31,500
I'd go, yeah, that's me.

1682
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,580
It's the one time I was on podcast.

1683
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:37,300
It was if you had wings in granddaughter magazine.

1684
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,620
It's kind of a split episode.

1685
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:41,460
I understand why your show is great.

1686
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,900
I understand why people would listen to it.

1687
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:48,020
And you guys are hysterical and you're great guys.

1688
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,340
So I get the whole thing.

1689
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:51,860
Sometimes you're like, well, what is this?

1690
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:52,700
What?

1691
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:53,540
I get this.

1692
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:54,360
Thank you.

1693
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,460
And podcast The Ride is a great title too.

1694
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,300
Okay, thanks.

1695
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,140
That was Scott.

1696
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:58,980
Scott came up with the title.

1697
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,900
I'm doing a new podcast called Genevieve.

1698
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:02,740
That's a great title too.

1699
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,580
That's a great title too.

1700
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,420
That's a great title.

1701
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:07,340
It's just all little snippets that confuse people.

1702
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,180
Yeah.

1703
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,340
The thing is, I'm like, you know.

1704
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:13,540
I am bringing a new podcast back, I swear to God.

1705
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:14,500
Do you want the name of it?

1706
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,340
No.

1707
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,580
Jeff Garland's Lemonade Stand.

1708
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,300
And I'm going to record once a week

1709
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,860
and set up somewhere in town.

1710
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,820
I'll be sponsored by some lemonade

1711
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:25,020
that doesn't contain corn syrup.

1712
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,820
And I'm being totally serious.

1713
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,260
We're working out a deal now.

1714
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,140
And it's not gonna be, like you guys could stop by.

1715
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:35,780
I don't want it to be celebrity driven,

1716
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,100
which I don't mean to insult you.

1717
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,420
Yeah, accurate.

1718
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,540
No, no, but I'm saying,

1719
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:43,300
it's like I'll get plenty of big name people

1720
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,040
who will come hang out with me.

1721
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,660
But I want it to just be a really fun,

1722
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:50,140
interesting hour to an hour and a half.

1723
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:51,540
It's not automatically interesting

1724
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,460
because a celebrity is around.

1725
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,620
I feel like it's the base of celebrity equals interesting.

1726
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,180
You know what the sad thing is?

1727
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,380
Some celebrities think that.

1728
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,220
Yes.

1729
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,740
Anyway, one of the great things to see,

1730
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,580
and it happens quite often,

1731
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,820
and I used to watch talk shows.

1732
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,180
I don't watch them anymore,

1733
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,880
but you watch a talk show,

1734
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,500
you watch an actor come out

1735
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:16,820
who thinks that their stories are interesting

1736
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:18,700
and they don't really have to work at it.

1737
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,140
And it's awesome.

1738
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,900
It's awesome.

1739
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,420
It's just like anyone who believes the hype

1740
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,620
and you can see through it, awesome, awesome.

1741
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:29,740
Anyone who's got a Twitter account

1742
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,620
and is putting their personal opinions

1743
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:36,140
like you care for this celebrity, idiot, awesome.

1744
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:37,660
But no, celebrities who are impressed

1745
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:40,140
with their celebrity, delightful.

1746
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,500
I find it more enjoying than aggravating.

1747
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,580
I agree.

1748
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:46,180
Watching people just at the height of hubris.

1749
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,740
Oh, the height of hubris.

1750
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:53,180
And by the way, I used to love Humblebrag.

1751
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:54,700
The Harris. Harris.

1752
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,060
Yeah, Harris Whittles.

1753
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:58,340
Humblebrag, it was so,

1754
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,380
especially people he would nail over and over

1755
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:03,100
who didn't understand the premise.

1756
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,100
Awesome.

1757
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,540
Yeah, I think people also don't even,

1758
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:08,140
I think people still incorrectly use the term Humblebrag.

1759
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:08,980
Oh, they most certainly do.

1760
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:09,800
They don't even get-

1761
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,020
But by the way, I come from a world

1762
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:17,020
where the words hip and cool meant you were above it all.

1763
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:21,740
That you were like truly, you knew stuff, man.

1764
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:24,860
They came from an era of like Miles Davis

1765
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:27,260
and Louis Armstrong, jazz musicians

1766
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:31,780
and just people that were ridiculously cool.

1767
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:34,380
Now, what do you, you know what I mean?

1768
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:38,420
By the way, hipster is like a negative connotation.

1769
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:42,420
Hipster used to be you were cooler than everybody else.

1770
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:46,220
Now hipster is you're in Silver Lake, enjoy your beard.

1771
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:47,420
Right, yeah.

1772
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,900
And a copy of a copy of what somebody-

1773
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:50,740
Might be really-

1774
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,380
Was something that was organically cool.

1775
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:55,460
Yeah, no, it's just, it's, so yes,

1776
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:58,980
the Humblebrag people use it wrong constantly.

1777
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,260
Because sometimes you wanna point out

1778
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:04,260
something you've accomplished and it's not,

1779
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:06,620
you're not being humble and you're, you know what I mean?

1780
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,940
You're not even bragging.

1781
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:10,380
You're just like, I went here, nice Humblebrag.

1782
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,860
No, I wasn't hiding it.

1783
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:16,380
It wasn't subtle, I came out and said, look at me.

1784
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,980
It's like when you were to say, you're like,

1785
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,060
well, not to brag or well, not to criticize

1786
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,420
and then do exactly that.

1787
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,260
That's the new version.

1788
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,860
If I say it, then that's excusing it, right?

1789
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,220
No, you're going to have anything calling out.

1790
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,340
You're calling out, yes.

1791
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:30,180
Yes, yes.

1792
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1793
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:35,060
Well, that's why we don't get in all that hip cool stuff.

1794
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:35,900
No.

1795
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:36,740
We don't worry about that.

1796
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:38,260
By the way, as we sit in this room,

1797
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:39,620
isn't it fun how it's gotten darker?

1798
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:40,540
It's very, yeah, yeah.

1799
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,980
The listeners should know, yes,

1800
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,860
we've gone from day to night,

1801
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,700
so now we're sitting in here totally dark.

1802
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,100
We're not sitting in the dark though,

1803
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,660
but it is, it is just-

1804
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,500
It's starting to feel-

1805
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,700
It was completely light and then now,

1806
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:55,540
I'd say, would you describe the room as gray?

1807
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,380
Yeah, but I'm seeing you-

1808
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,420
De-saturated, certainly.

1809
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,340
By the way, Dracula would be comfortable in here.

1810
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,660
I'm seeing you in silhouette.

1811
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:03,780
Dracula would be comfortable in parts of the room.

1812
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,620
Yeah.

1813
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:05,900
Yeah, I think he'd still might get in trouble

1814
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:06,740
right over here.

1815
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,540
He would be like, his skin would be a little irritated.

1816
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,180
But over here, he'd be very comfortable.

1817
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,020
Yeah.

1818
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,620
You're in like a perfect silhouette, honestly,

1819
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:15,020
which is cool, like a really nice shot,

1820
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:16,500
like a really nice shot in a movie.

1821
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,420
It feels like when you hear about like,

1822
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:19,980
oh, Steven Soderbergh shot a whole movie

1823
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,980
with only available light on an iPhone.

1824
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:22,820
Yeah.

1825
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:23,660
That's what-

1826
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:24,500
We only are shooting in the contrast.

1827
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,540
By the way, if you wanna see a great version of that,

1828
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:32,540
watch the Kubrick movie that takes place in the 1700s.

1829
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:33,780
Barry Lyndon.

1830
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:34,620
Barry Lyndon.

1831
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:37,540
He shot with the fastest lenses,

1832
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:41,020
like really fast lenses, with only candlelight.

1833
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:42,180
Remarkable.

1834
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,020
Yeah.

1835
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:43,840
You haven't seen that movie.

1836
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,680
I've seen most of his movies.

1837
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,860
It's an excellent movie, by the way.

1838
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:46,700
I would believe it.

1839
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,940
Did you see the big Kubrick exhibit

1840
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:50,860
that was at LACMA a few years ago?

1841
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,140
No.

1842
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:55,260
I kept on saying, I'm gonna go next week.

1843
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:56,100
I'm gonna go next week.

1844
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:56,940
I know, yeah.

1845
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:57,780
And then it was gone.

1846
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:58,620
I do that all the time.

1847
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,820
But I have all the Tash and Kubrick books.

1848
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:01,660
Yes.

1849
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,980
I have all, I have Blu-rays of,

1850
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:06,860
I even have Blu-rays and I've bought all the 4K movies

1851
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:08,860
that have come out on iTunes.

1852
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,380
I tend to waste my money, but I have Kubrick.

1853
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,220
Well, sure.

1854
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:14,260
Well, Kubrick's hard, because they haven't gotten the,

1855
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,100
some of those, they haven't gotten the aspect ratios on.

1856
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,780
You know what I did, and I haven't looked at them ever?

1857
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:20,660
I took a camera, a really good digital camera,

1858
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:24,300
to the 70 millimeter showing at Arclight

1859
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:27,380
when they just the last time released the new version.

1860
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,140
And I took stills during the movie

1861
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:32,380
where I framed just the picture screen.

1862
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,700
And on the back of my phone, I mean, I found my camera,

1863
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:35,740
it looked really cool.

1864
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:39,020
And then a lady came in and like kicked me out.

1865
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:40,220
Really?

1866
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:41,620
I got kicked out of the Arclight

1867
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,420
because I was taking pictures.

1868
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:44,260
You're always getting into-

1869
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:45,100
Two questions.

1870
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:47,940
Are you Jeff Garland and what are you doing?

1871
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:50,660
She would not know who anyone is.

1872
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:51,500
Wow.

1873
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,540
By the way, most people don't know who I am.

1874
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:56,220
So I'm gonna say that as not a humble brand.

1875
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:57,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1876
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:59,500
By the way, Jeff used it the wrong way.

1877
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:03,660
But anyhow, no, she would not know anyone

1878
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:06,340
of any entertainment accomplishment.

1879
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:09,900
She was security in the Arclight.

1880
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:13,780
There is no humor at any point coming from her body.

1881
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,340
Could you even like negotiate,

1882
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:16,180
or was it just you're done?

1883
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:17,020
I made love with her.

1884
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:18,780
I did the best I could.

1885
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:20,180
And she called me- Can you go back?

1886
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,460
And she called me Dre, the boy,

1887
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,900
and she told me her name was Proper Young Lady.

1888
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,180
Can you go back to the Arclight?

1889
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:28,420
Are you allowed back to the Arclight?

1890
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:31,300
By the way, I also, I had my movie premiere there,

1891
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,740
Handsome, the Netflix movie premiere.

1892
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:35,580
Starring.

1893
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:36,420
Yeah, you were there.

1894
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:37,260
The Mike Carlson vehicle.

1895
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:38,100
I was not at the premiere.

1896
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:38,940
Did I invite you?

1897
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:39,780
I don't believe so.

1898
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,660
No, I invited you, shut up, I nodded.

1899
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:42,940
This was not a thing I meant to bring up,

1900
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:45,140
but I don't believe I was invited.

1901
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,220
There's no way you weren't invited.

1902
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,460
I will look through my email again,

1903
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,580
but I remember seeing a picture of it and going,

1904
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,060
oh, but I wasn't like offended either,

1905
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:53,900
cause I was like, I don't even know-

1906
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:54,740
That's weird.

1907
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,380
Well, that was just an oversight on my part.

1908
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:59,060
I went to, you invited me to various screenings.

1909
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:00,860
I went to a screening pre before.

1910
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,780
There was like multiple screenings I did go to.

1911
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,500
Maybe I didn't invite a lot of people

1912
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,420
that were in it to the actual,

1913
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,100
maybe it had nothing to do with who they invited.

1914
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:08,940
I don't remember.

1915
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:09,780
It's okay, I'm not upset.

1916
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,740
The point being is, yeah, you saw it numerous times before.

1917
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:12,580
Yes.

1918
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:13,420
Gave me notes.

1919
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:17,020
But that night at the theater,

1920
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:21,500
I left my camera, expensive camera under my seat.

1921
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,940
And I came back like an hour later

1922
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:26,100
cause I realized I'd left it, gone.

1923
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:29,540
And the theater and everyone said, no, it's cleaning crew.

1924
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:32,980
Like everyone blamed everybody else and just gone.

1925
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:36,140
So you like lost money essentially at your own-

1926
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:36,980
Yeah, by the way-

1927
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,700
Well, but yeah, the memories are more-

1928
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:42,180
Because it wasn't like, oh, but it's screened for many days

1929
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:43,540
and I made millions.

1930
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:46,380
It all worked out.

1931
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:47,200
It all works out.

1932
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,340
I'm not, you know, but that was actually to tell you

1933
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:52,860
the truth in the new way of doing things

1934
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,780
which is not shooting film anymore.

1935
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:57,340
Although I do still shoot film.

1936
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:58,940
Oh, I'm gonna tell you a great Disney story.

1937
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,500
I'll get back to Disneyland in a second.

1938
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,340
Sure.

1939
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:06,340
But I would have paid $500 just for the card

1940
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:08,780
out of the camera, the SD card.

1941
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:09,700
That was the value.

1942
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:10,540
Right.

1943
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,540
About the expensive camera.

1944
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:15,740
I cared because I took some pictures on there that night.

1945
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:17,540
Yeah, big night for you.

1946
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:19,740
There was some pictures on there that I really,

1947
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:22,420
that to this day I'm sad that I've lost.

1948
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:23,260
So you're-

1949
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:26,060
Some creep has, some pervert is doing God knows what.

1950
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:29,620
So anyhow, I remember I brought with me

1951
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:33,660
one of my Leica film cameras to Disney and I used up,

1952
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:36,060
I brought two rolls and I wanted to buy,

1953
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:38,460
there was nowhere in Disney that sold film.

1954
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:39,300
No.

1955
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,860
I threw a fit to myself.

1956
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:43,820
There was no one, who am I gonna yell at?

1957
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:45,060
And my wife goes, you gotta calm down.

1958
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:49,180
I was so upset because I felt like,

1959
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,140
it made me feel like a Luddite.

1960
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:51,980
Do you know what I mean?

1961
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:52,940
Even though, you know what I mean?

1962
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,100
It made me feel antiquated.

1963
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:57,940
Even though it's like, come on man, really?

1964
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,900
There's not one like main street shop.

1965
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,260
And by the way, there are signs that say film,

1966
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,300
buy your film here and all that.

1967
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,260
Now it's sort of like, oh, how sweet.

1968
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:11,940
And I went in there, where's the film?

1969
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:12,900
We don't have it.

1970
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:13,940
Do you sell SD cards?

1971
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:14,760
No.

1972
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,820
See that was like my bonus question.

1973
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:17,460
The SD cards one is weird.

1974
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,460
Cause I've seen like parks have,

1975
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:20,300
have them sometimes.

1976
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,980
They don't have a lot of them but-

1977
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:24,260
But does Disney sell SD cards anywhere?

1978
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:25,100
I don't know.

1979
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,140
They have, somewhere they have to,

1980
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:27,500
but maybe they don't, I don't know.

1981
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,060
But by the way, you'd think one place would have,

1982
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,540
yeah, they have the rolls.

1983
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:33,540
By the way, leftover from the sixties.

1984
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:36,700
But no, the point being is, I was so upset.

1985
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:37,740
That's the last time I,

1986
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:39,260
and one of the only times I ever was upset.

1987
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:42,300
No, the last time before that was I got in a fight

1988
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:45,220
with my brother in Frontierland in the bathroom.

1989
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:46,060
What?

1990
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:47,020
Yeah, this was like two years ago.

1991
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:50,580
No, no, when we were little and I remember it was,

1992
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:53,620
my brother was, I love my brother,

1993
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:56,220
but my brother, he was at fault, no doubt about it.

1994
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:58,180
And I wouldn't, I would say if I was,

1995
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:59,580
he truly was at fault.

1996
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:01,420
And I remember this lady pointing at me,

1997
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:02,660
it's the big one.

1998
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:03,900
And I, who did it?

1999
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,980
And I remember my parents being upset with me

2000
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,580
and I'm like, no.

2001
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,740
She caught the last part.

2002
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:11,500
You know, it was not, you know,

2003
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,500
but that, those are my two Disney upset moments.

2004
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:15,340
That was it.

2005
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:16,180
Not with Mike.

2006
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:18,940
By the way, no kidding around,

2007
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:22,700
I actually have been to the park with the Goldbergs.

2008
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:26,980
We didn't do one, I didn't go this past year,

2009
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:29,380
but every year we do an annual trip to the park.

2010
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:32,260
And I will be like at the end of Pirates of the Caribbean,

2011
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:35,260
all the people waiting, I go, yes, it's me, Jeff Garland.

2012
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:37,060
Just assuming they all know who I am.

2013
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:42,260
But I also don't go on roller coasters or things like that.

2014
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:45,180
Like as wild as I get is Pirates of the Caribbean.

2015
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:46,900
So when everyone goes on Space Mountain,

2016
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:50,620
I'll sit outside and the minute one person recognizes me,

2017
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:53,060
especially at Disney with the Goldberg stuff,

2018
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:54,860
I'm bombarded and I'm happy.

2019
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,980
I'm not happy because I want it to happen,

2020
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,180
but I'm nice to everyone.

2021
01:04:58,180 --> 01:04:59,460
I don't lose my temper.

2022
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:00,980
I don't, someone save me.

2023
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,740
I'm like, I'm honored that anyone would come up

2024
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:05,060
and wanna, you know what I mean?

2025
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:05,900
Of course.

2026
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,300
I don't get upset by that.

2027
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,220
When you feel like you're like Pluto or something,

2028
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:11,100
you're like a character in the park that day.

2029
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:11,940
There is that aspect.

2030
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:13,820
My head is like a giant cartoon.

2031
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:16,900
You're your own mascot of yourself.

2032
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:19,300
Yeah, yes, yes.

2033
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,900
You got the beard since you were last on.

2034
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:21,740
It looks good on you.

2035
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:22,820
I know, I'm shaving it on Thursday.

2036
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:23,660
You gotta shave it for the day.

2037
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:24,500
Oh, okay.

2038
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,500
So it does a spoiler for the Disneyland episode.

2039
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:27,340
You will not have a beard in the episode.

2040
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,980
I will not have a beard, but I have a full beard right now.

2041
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:32,540
And by the way, this is my, I'm 57 years old.

2042
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:33,700
First beard of my life.

2043
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:34,540
Really?

2044
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:35,380
Never had a beard.

2045
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:38,180
You just shot a Netflix special, right?

2046
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,020
Yes, and I'm bearded in the Netflix special.

2047
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:39,860
And you're bearded in that.

2048
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:40,700
Bearded in the special.

2049
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,860
Yep, that comes out probably in January.

2050
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:43,700
Okay.

2051
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,380
Let me see, I'm supposed to get a call back

2052
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:46,860
from Netflix tonight.

2053
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:47,700
Let me see if they called me.

2054
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:50,580
About the, and as you pull up your phone,

2055
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:53,020
this is the only light in the room now.

2056
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,300
This is one of the strangest settings.

2057
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,220
Never have we done a podcast in the dark.

2058
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:58,060
That's true, yeah.

2059
01:05:58,060 --> 01:05:58,880
Which is kinda interesting.

2060
01:05:58,880 --> 01:05:59,720
Which is a surprise.

2061
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,420
If we have a Halloween episode, we should.

2062
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,940
No, nobody called me back.

2063
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:04,580
Point being is though, I'm discussing

2064
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:07,100
to see when is the best time to air it.

2065
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:09,340
But as of right now, it's January.

2066
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:12,220
I read a little write up from someone who was there

2067
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:16,020
that said it was your 37th anniversary

2068
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:17,020
of comedy performance? Ironically,

2069
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:18,580
I didn't do it on purpose.

2070
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:20,620
I only realized like the day before,

2071
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:23,220
it was my 37th anniversary of doing standup

2072
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:24,900
that particular night that I filmed.

2073
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,420
Which kinda blew my mind.

2074
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:27,260
Wow.

2075
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:28,080
Yeah.

2076
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:31,820
And also, I feel really proud and happy

2077
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:34,260
that for this special, I've done a couple before,

2078
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:35,780
and I've seen many.

2079
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:37,820
Mine were good.

2080
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:39,780
No, I'm being said, mine were good.

2081
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:42,940
And you aspire to like make a great special.

2082
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:46,980
And I did the first, I did two shows that night

2083
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:47,820
after the first show.

2084
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:48,900
I'm like, great, I got it.

2085
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:51,340
But the second show, I think I actually captured

2086
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,500
lightning in a bottle.

2087
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:56,040
I think that I captured digitally or however,

2088
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:59,100
what makes me funny.

2089
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:01,140
And if you're gonna think I'm funny,

2090
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:03,580
and you're gonna dig me, which a lot of people won't.

2091
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:06,980
But if you're going to, this would be something you'd go,

2092
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:08,420
oh my God, I love that.

2093
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:10,260
I'm like so proud of it.

2094
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,700
And I hope that people, by the way,

2095
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:14,940
it's like having made what you believe

2096
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:16,620
is a great record album.

2097
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:18,420
And like, is anyone gonna buy it?

2098
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:21,140
Like, I have no idea when they show it on Netflix.

2099
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:22,700
Is anyone gonna watch it?

2100
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:23,540
I'm so proud of it.

2101
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,100
And they don't give you a number, you don't know that.

2102
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:25,940
So, just wait on feedback.

2103
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:27,780
But by the way, you'll know.

2104
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:31,820
You find out, you know, so we'll see.

2105
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:32,660
People will see it.

2106
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:34,460
We'll tell everyone to watch it.

2107
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,460
Yes, well, by the way, that's what you want.

2108
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:37,300
Yeah.

2109
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:41,620
You want you three to come on Jeff Garlin's Lemonade stand.

2110
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:42,460
Oh, we're there.

2111
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:43,300
Yeah, we're there.

2112
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,140
Sure.

2113
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:46,060
By the way, you can act any way you want.

2114
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:48,380
You can be rude, you can knock things over.

2115
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:49,620
You can spill lemonade.

2116
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:50,620
I don't care.

2117
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:53,420
Certainly we can't spill it on what you're recording

2118
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:54,260
the podcast on.

2119
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:55,860
Well, you actually could.

2120
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:58,820
But then you'd really be hurting yourself

2121
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:01,100
because you wouldn't be heard as a guest on my podcast.

2122
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:02,500
Oh, you're right, that's self-sabotage.

2123
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:04,180
That sounds great.

2124
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:06,300
It sounds even better than the time I went to the Arclight

2125
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,740
and walked out with a brand new camera.

2126
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:10,780
Oh, Jason.

2127
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:12,700
Unrelated, unrelated.

2128
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:13,540
What did it look like?

2129
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:15,500
I'm used to breaking a dark room.

2130
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,340
It looked expensive, that's all I know.

2131
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:19,780
And I say like, not because I'm into expensive cameras,

2132
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:22,020
but I'm into the history of photography.

2133
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:24,180
And Henri Cartier-Bresson,

2134
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:27,180
who's like the greatest photographer of all time,

2135
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:29,780
he used, I like range finders.

2136
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:33,580
And it's not like Canon or Nikon makes a cheap range finder.

2137
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:36,780
The only people that make range finders are Leica.

2138
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:38,740
So it's like a throwback in time.

2139
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:39,580
Right.

2140
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:40,940
It's a minimalistic camera.

2141
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:43,660
There's a minimal amount of controls and it's manual.

2142
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:44,500
And I love that.

2143
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,460
Very aesthetically pleasing design too.

2144
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:48,300
But by the way, going back to Disneyland,

2145
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:50,620
that's what I love about Disneyland

2146
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:52,780
is aesthetically it's pleasing.

2147
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:55,100
The simplicity and the thought

2148
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:57,060
that went into designing that place.

2149
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:58,540
That's why I don't really love

2150
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:01,660
whatever they call the Cars Land or California Adventure,

2151
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:03,020
whatever it's called across the way.

2152
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:04,620
California Adventure. I don't love it.

2153
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:06,020
So let me ask you a quick question.

2154
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:06,860
Yeah, go ahead.

2155
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:10,020
What is the Star Wars thing a success?

2156
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,500
Well, it depends who you talk to

2157
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:14,100
because some people it's not that full.

2158
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:18,060
Well, Tomorrowland was initially something wonderful.

2159
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:21,100
And when I was a kid, I loved Tomorrowland,

2160
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,740
but it turned into a wasteland.

2161
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:24,860
It was not great at a certain point.

2162
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:26,700
It was probably the embarrassment

2163
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:30,300
for anyone who worked at Disney was like,

2164
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:31,820
yeah, Tomorrowland.

2165
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:35,380
So they put in the Star Wars thing and I was hopeful for it.

2166
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,220
We all liked it a lot.

2167
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:38,060
It looks great.

2168
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:41,980
If you like Star Wars, you're really gonna like it.

2169
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:45,660
Is there anything that looks like Tomorrowland?

2170
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:47,700
Well, no, it didn't replace Tomorrowland.

2171
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:48,540
It didn't?

2172
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:49,780
No, that was a rumor for a while.

2173
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:50,700
That is not true.

2174
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:52,540
So is Tomorrowland still Tomorrowland?

2175
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:53,780
It's still a wasteland.

2176
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:55,340
It is a wasteland though.

2177
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:56,180
It's really-

2178
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:57,020
The wasteland's still there.

2179
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:58,340
It's so bad.

2180
01:09:58,340 --> 01:09:59,380
I'm glad you agree on that one.

2181
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:00,220
It's a bummer.

2182
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:03,860
I feel bad because, you know, wow, man.

2183
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:06,660
The word was is if that Tomorrowland movie had worked,

2184
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:09,300
it was gonna get a big redo.

2185
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,180
Well, that probably would have happened,

2186
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:13,740
but I think it should get a redo anyhow.

2187
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:14,860
Regardless, I agree.

2188
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:15,700
We all were pining for it.

2189
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,100
Who's in charge of the park now?

2190
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:20,820
I know John Lasseter was for a while, but who is now?

2191
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:22,580
A man named Bob Chapek.

2192
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:23,740
Does he love the park?

2193
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:25,060
No.

2194
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:26,580
Wait, what?

2195
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:28,420
What do you, are you an ant?

2196
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:29,700
That was so confident.

2197
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:31,620
Well, here's, you know, maybe I'm being too hard

2198
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:34,420
on Mr. Chapek, but now they've combined the park

2199
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:36,020
into a department of like, what is it called?

2200
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:37,780
Consumer products and parks.

2201
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:39,540
Consumer products and experiences.

2202
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:42,020
I think he cares about it to some degree.

2203
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:45,140
I think his job is also not, it's not an enviable job

2204
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:47,380
because you get a lot of flack from nerds.

2205
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:48,220
But-

2206
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:49,060
Like right now.

2207
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:52,700
I was incredibly confident that he does not care

2208
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:53,540
about the parks.

2209
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:56,300
God is now defending Bob Chapek to me.

2210
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:57,940
I just don't know where this is coming from.

2211
01:10:57,940 --> 01:11:00,220
Well, I think it's coming from the fact that I do think-

2212
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:01,380
I don't know the man's history.

2213
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:04,260
He's just been in like, he's like, he's a, you know,

2214
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,100
he's a numbers man in the company.

2215
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:10,180
Does he go to like, like did he ever watch Million Dollar Duck?

2216
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:11,020
Did he ever see-

2217
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:12,100
I don't, does he like the Apple,

2218
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,500
does he like the Apple dumpling game?

2219
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,340
I bet he does not like the Apple dumpling game.

2220
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:16,180
It's clear to my heart.

2221
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:21,180
Does he like the original Dumbo or even 101 Dalmatians

2222
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,140
or Jungle Book?

2223
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:23,460
It's unclear.

2224
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,260
Does he like Pixar movies?

2225
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:26,100
I mean, to me-

2226
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:26,940
No.

2227
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:29,660
I think, I saw an interview with him and again,

2228
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,860
it's not an enviable position,

2229
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:32,100
but they were asking him about like,

2230
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:35,020
cause all the rides now are always just based on a movie

2231
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:37,140
and there's no original ones anymore.

2232
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:40,860
And he gave like a very like businessman answer of like,

2233
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,300
you know, anybody else would be doing this

2234
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,860
if they had the movies we have.

2235
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:46,460
And it's like, where's the, where's a little bit of like,

2236
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:47,980
we love the Haunted Mansion.

2237
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:50,020
We love to make another one and we will soon,

2238
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:52,980
but like, he gave a very kind of cold answer.

2239
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:55,340
And I was like, ah, come on and acknowledge

2240
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:56,180
what we all like.

2241
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:58,180
I want to nominate someone to run the place.

2242
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,020
Sure.

2243
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:02,300
A young lady I know named Chantilly Cock Richards.

2244
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,940
And I think she would do a great job.

2245
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:06,020
Just based on her name.

2246
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:06,860
Yeah.

2247
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:07,680
If you heard her name,

2248
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,100
would you have good faith that things could work out?

2249
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,660
I think she sounds whimsical.

2250
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,500
So I think that she has a whimsy for a park.

2251
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:13,820
You may have to censor that middle name,

2252
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:14,660
the middle part of it.

2253
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:16,100
By the way, I want to stay on the air

2254
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:17,940
till it truly is black.

2255
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:18,780
All right.

2256
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:19,620
It's where we're heading.

2257
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:20,460
It's getting there.

2258
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:21,300
Yeah.

2259
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,140
I think it's only the lights at the scene.

2260
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:22,980
It's the lights of the sea.

2261
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:23,820
That are lighting us at this point.

2262
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:24,660
It's the lights of Universal.

2263
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:28,500
And without the podcast recorder, we got nothing.

2264
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,540
Here, if I pull out my phone light,

2265
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:31,780
I have to tie back to something

2266
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:32,620
we were talking about earlier.

2267
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:36,100
I was just in Japan and I got to see.

2268
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:38,060
Well, this is a connection here.

2269
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:39,120
Yeah, yeah.

2270
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:42,140
I saw while I was there a big old wall

2271
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:46,500
of apparently new Buttercup memorabilia.

2272
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,380
Like a lot of it.

2273
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:49,060
There was a ton of it. Really?

2274
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:51,780
Here, there's like a, there's headbands.

2275
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:54,260
There were a lot of girls wearing these things.

2276
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:55,100
Like it was spread already.

2277
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:56,780
They don't have these in America.

2278
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:58,500
And it says new items down there.

2279
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:01,460
And then there's like a hood that's also a big towel

2280
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,260
that kind of drapes down both sides of you.

2281
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:05,900
Like a Pope uniform, like a clergy kind of uniform.

2282
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:06,820
And they're just to look like Buttercup?

2283
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:07,660
Yeah.

2284
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:08,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2285
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:09,340
Uh-huh.

2286
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:11,700
It's a pretty big implement you would wear.

2287
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:14,220
And I thought, while I was in the store,

2288
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:17,820
I thought, should I tell Mike, who could then tell Jeff?

2289
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:21,100
And then I realized then it was distinctly possible

2290
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,500
you might say, get 25 of everything.

2291
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:24,340
By the way, can I tell you something?

2292
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:26,180
And then I keep calling creates.

2293
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:27,020
Distinctly possible?

2294
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:28,820
Have you ever heard a done deal?

2295
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:31,020
That's what it would be.

2296
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:33,260
Cause I would get so excited.

2297
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:34,260
Now I love that.

2298
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:38,300
By the way, it never, the fact that I'm

2299
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:40,500
the voice of the captain in Wally,

2300
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:44,580
the fact that I'm Buttercup the unicorn makes me,

2301
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:48,300
I can't tell you how the pride I have and the joy I have

2302
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,260
and what it means to me.

2303
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:52,820
I love the work that I love doing

2304
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:56,180
is either for families or for adults.

2305
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:58,380
Like I love doing adult work like Curb.

2306
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:00,700
And I love doing stuff that,

2307
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:03,540
like the Goldbergs is the number one show on television

2308
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:05,220
that families watch together.

2309
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:06,380
That's nice.

2310
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:07,220
It is really nice.

2311
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:08,060
Yeah.

2312
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:09,540
So I love being involved in that world,

2313
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:11,820
but it doesn't get any better

2314
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:14,740
than being the captain in Wally.

2315
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:17,260
That is just like, that's,

2316
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:19,660
but people ask me, what's my most proud accomplishment?

2317
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:23,700
That is my more than Curb, the captain in Wally.

2318
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:25,100
Cause that's, no kidding, that's number one.

2319
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:28,460
Yeah, that's like being in Sleeping Beauty or something.

2320
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:29,620
Like I'm not even joking.

2321
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:31,940
I'm saying like a classic animated film.

2322
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:35,180
Sleeping Beauty is the fact that 70 millimeter

2323
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:36,820
and you can see it that way is great.

2324
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:38,860
But I think that's an insult to Wally

2325
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:40,620
to compare it to Sleeping Beauty.

2326
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:42,860
It's more sophisticated.

2327
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:43,700
Wally's more sophisticated, of course.

2328
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:46,780
No, no, but I think that Wally falls

2329
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:49,620
into a modern day version of let's say

2330
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:55,580
Snow White or one of the classic, classic Disney things.

2331
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:59,060
But by the way, I'm not saying better for anyone listening

2332
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:01,140
because you know, people, I love Snow White.

2333
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:05,020
I love all those original, I love all the Disney movies.

2334
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:05,860
I love-

2335
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:06,700
Why not Sleeping Beauty then?

2336
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:07,940
I was gonna say Sleeping Beauty,

2337
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:09,860
some people say is the best one.

2338
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:11,860
Sleeping Beauty is so beautiful.

2339
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:12,700
Yeah.

2340
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:13,540
So great.

2341
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:14,460
Well, I'm sorry.

2342
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:16,700
That was just my impulse.

2343
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:18,900
Sleeping Beauty is like everyone's favorite.

2344
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:19,740
Now that I've thought about it,

2345
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:21,580
maybe Sleeping Beauty is better.

2346
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:22,420
Again, aesthetically pleasing.

2347
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:24,100
And maybe I wanna be the witch.

2348
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:24,940
But I guess like Wally-

2349
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:25,780
Maleficent?

2350
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:26,620
No, the point is, how did it turn

2351
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:28,540
into something ego and comparative?

2352
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:30,660
No, you were making a compliment.

2353
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:32,980
I know, it was that humble brag in the air, I guess.

2354
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:37,420
But the point is I am so proud of Wally

2355
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:39,820
and Toy Story 3 and even though I haven't seen

2356
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:41,180
Toy Story 4, I assume.

2357
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:42,020
Yeah, I mean-

2358
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:43,500
It's part of that world.

2359
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:44,660
My voice is part of the world.

2360
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:46,260
But Wally more than anything.

2361
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:47,100
You saved humanity in this film.

2362
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:50,380
Wally, the fact that it's pretty much a silent movie

2363
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:54,420
and my voice is 80% of the people talking

2364
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:55,980
in that movie is me.

2365
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:57,260
That's kind of exciting.

2366
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:58,100
Yeah, very exciting.

2367
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:00,420
Although I do think the best part is the silent part.

2368
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:03,300
You still would agree you like it better without you.

2369
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:06,060
I know, I think the silent part,

2370
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:08,260
the first 45 minutes or so is silent.

2371
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:11,380
And I think that is astonishingly beautiful

2372
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:13,100
and the way that it was done.

2373
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:15,940
Andrew Stanton, it was remarkable.

2374
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:17,380
So I don't even think the part,

2375
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:21,020
like how do I turn this thing into negative all the time?

2376
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:21,860
What?

2377
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:22,700
I don't know.

2378
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:23,540
Not all of it.

2379
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:24,380
It's because it's dark out.

2380
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:25,460
The stuff you were saying about yourself,

2381
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:27,540
you say you're like the heart of it too.

2382
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:29,340
You're the hero of the film in a way.

2383
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:30,180
Yeah, I do.

2384
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:31,020
You save humankind.

2385
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:33,660
By the way, when I saw, here's, I'll tell you something.

2386
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:36,700
When I saw, I worked three years on it.

2387
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:38,740
And when I worked on it, I never looked.

2388
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:40,860
I never looked at anything I saw.

2389
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:42,940
They gave me a presentation when it first started

2390
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:44,940
and I thought, oh, that character looks like me.

2391
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:46,620
Kind of looks like Jackie Gleason.

2392
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:47,580
Okay.

2393
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:50,100
I did the voice for three years.

2394
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:53,540
Even when I looped and they wanted me to loop something,

2395
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:54,980
I didn't look at the screen.

2396
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:55,820
I never looked.

2397
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:56,660
I just.

2398
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:57,700
Even when you were like matching the.

2399
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:00,380
By the way, yes, when I loop any job,

2400
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:02,140
I never look at the screen.

2401
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:04,180
I listen to it and I go, what do you want?

2402
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:06,380
And I match it to what they want

2403
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:08,820
based on what I'm hearing and what they want.

2404
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:10,340
I don't even look to match it.

2405
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:14,020
And I'm in there quicker than any actor who's looking.

2406
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:15,180
Okay. That's a secret.

2407
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:18,380
Is it too, is it like distracting in a way to be like.

2408
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:19,220
Yeah, yeah.

2409
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:20,660
For me it's distracting.

2410
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:23,380
But also I didn't want to see anything.

2411
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:24,260
I didn't want to.

2412
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:26,300
So the first time I saw anything

2413
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:28,500
was at a premiere for Pixar.

2414
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:29,380
They have their own premiere

2415
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:31,060
before they have the world premiere.

2416
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:33,100
It was in Oakland in this beautiful theater.

2417
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:35,420
And I wept because I couldn't believe

2418
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:38,060
I was part of anything so beautiful.

2419
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:40,020
I was in awe.

2420
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:41,380
It overwhelmed me.

2421
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:42,940
I'll never forget that feeling.

2422
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:44,060
So.

2423
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:44,900
Oh yeah.

2424
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:45,740
Yeah.

2425
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:46,900
It's a really, it's like one of the ones

2426
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:48,300
I've been the most emotional at.

2427
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:50,460
If not the one I've been the most emotional at.

2428
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:52,540
Yeah. Well, you know, everyone always brings up

2429
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:55,220
also the opening of Up and I would agree with that.

2430
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:57,420
By the way, to me, the opening of Up

2431
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:59,900
is the most perfect filmmaking I've ever seen.

2432
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:02,100
To tell a story like that,

2433
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:05,780
a long big story in about what, 10 minutes?

2434
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:07,180
Yeah, a life in 10 minutes.

2435
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:10,340
A life in 10 minutes is, I don't even know.

2436
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:11,540
I still don't know how they do that.

2437
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:14,460
I think a class, a film class,

2438
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:16,820
could study that for a whole semester.

2439
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:18,740
Yeah, sure. And still maybe not even

2440
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:20,380
understand how they pulled that off.

2441
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:22,380
To be able to distill it all down.

2442
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:24,540
Yeah, Pixar's done some magical stuff.

2443
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:27,420
I tend to think now those days are over though.

2444
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:28,380
And I know the Pixar people

2445
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:29,620
wouldn't be happy with me saying that

2446
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:31,860
because I know some there are passionate,

2447
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:35,020
but they now, they never used to

2448
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:38,220
and now it's all about what celebrities are in the movie.

2449
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:39,980
And there's a lot of sequels.

2450
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:41,780
The sequels, yeah, the sequels,

2451
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:44,540
but here's the thing, if you're making great sequels,

2452
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:46,940
that's why I said everything's about the execution

2453
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:47,980
and the intent.

2454
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:51,780
But I think now the marketing and the way they go about it

2455
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:55,340
is like every other animated company.

2456
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:57,940
I don't think that it's unique anymore.

2457
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:00,420
Hopefully as they're, like, you know what,

2458
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:02,620
that movie made me just go crazy.

2459
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:04,260
What was the one in the brain?

2460
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:06,740
Inside Out. Inside Out was the best movie.

2461
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:07,580
Yeah. Yeah.

2462
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:12,580
Oh my God, that movie was so special and so original.

2463
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:15,180
And nobody listed the people who were the voice.

2464
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:19,500
All these movies now, the Toy Story 4,

2465
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,940
everyone, who's this, who's that, they tell you.

2466
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:23,300
And it's like a big deal.

2467
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,300
And that is just ridiculous.

2468
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:26,140
Yeah.

2469
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:26,960
Well, hopefully-

2470
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:27,900
As you go back to Sleeping Beauty,

2471
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:29,420
who the hell's in Sleeping Beauty?

2472
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:31,500
I don't know one voice in- I have no idea.

2473
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,500
Clark Gable, Sheena Easton, Molly Raywald.

2474
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:36,260
Oh wow.

2475
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:38,300
Molly Raywald. Molly Raywald.

2476
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:39,580
And Anson Williams.

2477
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:41,580
And one of the Olsen twins I forgot.

2478
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:42,700
That's the original cast.

2479
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:43,540
Rerun from what's happening.

2480
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:46,300
No, but the point is that I don't think

2481
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,860
any little kid gives a crap.

2482
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:50,220
They don't.

2483
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:51,060
No.

2484
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:51,900
You have room for like one celebrity in your brain.

2485
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:54,380
By the way, to me, the only thing you have to announce

2486
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:55,980
is that it's Pixar.

2487
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:56,820
Yeah.

2488
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:58,740
You know what, by the way, I love, there's people at Pixar,

2489
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:01,180
people, actually the people that are in charge.

2490
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:03,260
I can't wait. I haven't seen them in a while.

2491
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:05,220
Maybe I'll even go up and visit Pixar.

2492
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:07,700
I usually like when I do something, I screen something.

2493
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:09,660
Maybe I'll screen like the first episode of Curb

2494
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:10,660
or something.

2495
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:13,380
I go up there, every one of my movies I've screened for them.

2496
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:15,320
And it's been so joyous and fun.

2497
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,140
But I want to go up and ask them

2498
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:20,100
why the different approach to marketing their movies.

2499
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:20,940
That's a good question.

2500
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:23,500
It is a good question. I'm curious.

2501
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,980
I wonder, could you ask them also,

2502
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:28,960
cause they promised us that on that Toy Story Minway Mania,

2503
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,620
they promised more like new levels and it hasn't happened.

2504
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:34,660
And it's been years now.

2505
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:36,100
By the way, I will ask that,

2506
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:38,340
but I think that's not a Pixar decision.

2507
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:39,340
Yeah, probably not.

2508
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:40,180
You're probably right.

2509
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:41,380
What's the dude's name?

2510
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:42,380
Bob Chapek.

2511
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:43,220
Bob Chapek.

2512
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:45,380
I think he's the one specifically in charge.

2513
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:49,580
He says, he says, I'll delegate to every ride

2514
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:52,380
except the fucking Toy Story ride.

2515
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:53,740
He has it out for you.

2516
01:20:53,740 --> 01:20:55,660
It's an anti-garland thing.

2517
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:57,380
Yeah, he doesn't like the amount of points

2518
01:20:57,380 --> 01:20:59,100
that he gets when he's shooting at me.

2519
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:01,720
I wonder how long it would take to get his phone number.

2520
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,480
Could we do it tonight and text him just directly?

2521
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,480
I could probably get his phone number the next day or two.

2522
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,800
Okay. Well, maybe next time you're on.

2523
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,600
He'd be expecting a call from me

2524
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,520
cause that's what I would go down.

2525
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:14,480
It'd be like, Jeff Garland needs to talk to you.

2526
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,720
But what if it was Jason Sheridan

2527
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,760
needs to talk to you, Bob?

2528
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:19,760
That would not work.

2529
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:20,600
Hi, Bob.

2530
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,240
I'll be Bob. Let's do a little improv.

2531
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:25,280
I imagine the show's over right now, right?

2532
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,120
Oh yeah, sure.

2533
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,160
Yeah, whenever we want it to be.

2534
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:29,800
I got like cotton mouth, so I want to quit.

2535
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:30,640
Yeah, that's fine.

2536
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:31,560
But let's do a little improv.

2537
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:32,400
We'll do a little improv for this one.

2538
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,840
What's my name again?

2539
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:34,800
Bob Shapek.

2540
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,080
I'm Bob Shapek and you're calling me.

2541
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,160
Go.

2542
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,000
Hi, Bob.

2543
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,760
It's Jason Sheridan of Podcast the Ride.

2544
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:41,880
So good to hear from you.

2545
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,280
Thank you for your time today.

2546
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,120
How you doing?

2547
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:45,080
Hold on one second here.

2548
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:45,920
Who are you?

2549
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,320
I work with Jeff Garland.

2550
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,520
I'm Jason Sheridan from Podcast the Ride.

2551
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,240
Who's Jeff Garland?

2552
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,080
You know him.

2553
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,320
He's in a bunch of stuff.

2554
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:54,640
He's in the Goldbergs.

2555
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:55,640
You guys make the Goldbergs.

2556
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:56,460
Look out your window.

2557
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:57,400
Oh, TV show the Goldbergs?

2558
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,240
Yeah.

2559
01:21:58,240 --> 01:21:59,080
Okay.

2560
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,680
How can I help you today?

2561
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:01,520
Jason, you said?

2562
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,800
You know, I was just wondering like what is your, yeah.

2563
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,320
Okay, Jason, what is your question?

2564
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:08,520
Yeah, what is your overall like perspective of the parks?

2565
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:12,760
Do you have a theory behind how to treat the theme parks?

2566
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:13,880
You know, we're very curious

2567
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:15,800
because we are seeing a lot of licensed stuff

2568
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:18,200
and you famously on record as saying like,

2569
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,920
well, we own Marvel, we own Star Wars.

2570
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,200
Why aren't we getting it in the parks?

2571
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,640
And that's fair and that's simple

2572
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:24,120
and people recognize that stuff.

2573
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:25,320
Ask him if he likes Million Dollar Duck.

2574
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:26,400
I bet he doesn't.

2575
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,320
But like, what's your feeling on like,

2576
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:31,200
say original ideas or even older stuff

2577
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,720
like Million Dollar Duck?

2578
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:38,080
Well, I'm gonna get going, Jason.

2579
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,520
Thank you for calling.

2580
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,240
And do me a favor.

2581
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:45,000
Would you let my assistant know who you are

2582
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,760
when she gets back on

2583
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:49,640
so I can understand what this conversation was about?

2584
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:50,960
Again, that's Jeff Garland.

2585
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,240
That name is Jeff Garland.

2586
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,240
Wait, no, you're Jason.

2587
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,080
I'm sorry.

2588
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,040
No, I, Jason set the call up.

2589
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,200
I'm Jeff Garland.

2590
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,720
You're Jeff Garland from the Goldbergs?

2591
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:02,720
From the Goldbergs.

2592
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:03,720
All right.

2593
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:04,760
And why are you calling me?

2594
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:07,600
I'm asking your theory, your broader theory

2595
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,080
on how to treat theme parks in the early 21st century.

2596
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,360
No, I'm a comedic actor and director

2597
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,480
and I dabble in photography.

2598
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:16,320
You dabble?

2599
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,400
Yeah.

2600
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,640
Jason, just hang up Jason.

2601
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:20,480
Hang up Jason.

2602
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,760
Jason, I'm gonna tell you one thing.

2603
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:24,600
And I want this to really get out there.

2604
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,520
Sure.

2605
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,600
I treated you fairly like a proper.

2606
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:31,800
I'm done doing my character.

2607
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:32,640
All right.

2608
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:33,480
Jeff Garland.

2609
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,920
I think he seemed pretty nice, I gotta say.

2610
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:38,120
I think I like this shape.

2611
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:41,000
Jeff Garland, you have survived podcast the ride yet again.

2612
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,320
Yes, and I'm happy to do it again in the future.

2613
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:44,160
Yeah, we'll do it again.

2614
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:47,320
But how do we make sure it's in an even darker room

2615
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:48,360
next time? Well, by the way,

2616
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,360
let's schedule it for when it was originally scheduled,

2617
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:51,400
which is for eight.

2618
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,240
Oh yeah.

2619
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:53,680
It would have been much darker.

2620
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:55,560
Let's just do it in a closet.

2621
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,000
Let's all jam into a closet together

2622
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,760
where we can control the darkness.

2623
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:01,040
But yeah, just like in South Park.

2624
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,240
Yeah, do you wanna plug anything?

2625
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,840
You wanna exit through our gift shop, plug anything?

2626
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,440
Man, I don't need to plug anything.

2627
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:07,280
Okay.

2628
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,120
It's all good.

2629
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,400
Just check me out if you do.

2630
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:11,240
Okay, everyone knows.

2631
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:15,600
And hopefully you'll bump into me when you see a movie,

2632
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,360
when you watch TV or anything,

2633
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:21,040
you'll say, oh, that's that guy.

2634
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,160
Yeah, so do that folks.

2635
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,240
Actually, what I really want is,

2636
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:27,160
look, my job is to ease people's pain.

2637
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,160
You have a crappy day.

2638
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:31,280
Hopefully you watch Curb, the Goldbergs, Wally,

2639
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:35,040
whatever it is that I can make anyone's day better.

2640
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,440
That's what I do.

2641
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:37,260
Thank you.

2642
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:38,920
I'm lucky enough to earn a living that way.

2643
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:40,760
And you have made our days better as well.

2644
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:41,600
That's completely true.

2645
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,440
That's exactly how I feel.

2646
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:43,260
That's great.

2647
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:44,280
Yeah, I was being sincere too.

2648
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,120
Yeah.

2649
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:45,960
Yeah.

2650
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,000
I know you, Mike, you're a very sincere guy.

2651
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:47,840
Thank you, I try.

2652
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:48,680
All right.

2653
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:52,040
And by the way, no one goes along with my stupidity

2654
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:53,200
better than you.

2655
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,040
Really?

2656
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,720
Yeah, and you know, by the way,

2657
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:58,280
big meeting coming up on our show.

2658
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:59,120
Really?

2659
01:24:59,120 --> 01:24:59,940
Yeah.

2660
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:01,480
We'll leave that as a tease for the listener.

2661
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:03,480
Oh my God, yeah, as he was almost there.

2662
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:04,320
All right.

2663
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,560
Good talking to everyone.

2664
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,280
