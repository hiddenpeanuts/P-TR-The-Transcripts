1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Welcome to Podcast-a-Ride, the second gate.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
McGruff 2, the sequel.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Will it be like Attack of the Clones, or Empire Strikes Back, or The Last Jedi?

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You'll have to stay tuned to find out.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
My name is Mike Carlson, as always joining me, Jason Sheridan.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, when I saw Attack of the Clones opening day, one of the biggest pops I'd ever heard from a theater-going audience when Yoda pulled out a lightsaber.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
People went nuts.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Sure. Did you pop so hard?

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We were very excited. I didn't know it was coming, you know?

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So you did pop so hard.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I did, yeah.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Scott Garner's here. Did you pop when you saw that, Scott?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I didn't see it in the theaters. So when you say all those, McGrowen McGruff says all of those sequel names, I'm not sure what he means by what his feelings are about any of those.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Not sure either.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Empire Strikes Back is the worst.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What do you mean? It's his dad. Makes no sense.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The sequel trilogy is better. I love the sequel trilogy.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I didn't like any of them until JJ.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I can't wait to get bombarded from all those investor day announcements. We're all going to remember and enjoy those programs for many years to come.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
All 10 series.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Sorry. So we're too excited. This is going to happen a lot, especially over the Zoom where we're all like, we want to do the voice.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We don't want to talk like him.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Cheaper by the dozens coming back and I couldn't be more thrilled.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's been a real shame living in a world without the mighty ducks. About time Emilio took matters into his own hands.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I hope it's grittier than the original.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Counterfeit hockey pucks are a danger. They could explode if hit too hard.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Make sure to only buy hockey pucks from a licensed dealer.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Counterfeit duck calls an entire other piece of business. I'm more lenient on those, honestly.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm good friends with a guy named Wild Wing.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And the Iceman. He got done dirty.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Mascots remain close. Once in the mascot brotherhood, always in the mascot brotherhood.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We're only getting started here, folks.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We've got to save the voice. It's going to be a raspy time for all of us. We might all end up feeling it.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Boy oh boy, McGruff 2. I can't believe we're there and not just because, you know, the anticipation is assuredly incredibly high.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If you don't know, we did an episode a while back, a pretty well received episode, I have to say, from what you, the audience, tell us,

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
which was devoted mostly to a McGruff album called the Smart Kids album. McGruff's musical career.

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
There's some other stuff. Some of the Burger King era made its way in there, but I think that it seems like that's what we're going to explore a little more today.

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes. And so just, yeah, just in case you, I'm sure if you're on the Patreon and you've listened, you've heard McGruff 1, but just in case,

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:59,000
let's do a quick refresher because there's an album called Smart Kids and our, I think we all agree, Smart Kids is funny because McGruff is singing, but it is also good.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The album is good. So like, we'll just play a little bit. This is alcohol, the song Alcohol.

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Like this is a good groove.

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I re-listened today. It hooked me right.

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Hey, open up your eyes.

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This is called Make Your Body Last.

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That one snuck up on me. It's a side two and you think it's kind of tipping by side two, but then this shows up.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah.

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I also, I haven't listened to him a little bit and I listened to a couple of the tracks this morning and I went, man, this is great. This is not faded. This is not a novelty. These songs are great.

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You know, yeah, we've all, you know, they've all stuck with us, I think, ever since. Hopefully with some of you, the audience, hopefully these are classics to you now.

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:02,000
My strongest memory, post McGruff 1, was that there was, and I don't know who it was, but there was a guest who came over to your apartment in the recording in your apartment days.

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And it was somebody who was a friend of ours, but like not as mired in everything as us.

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So we were explaining the situation with the McGruff Smart Kids album.

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And I think whoever this was kind of filled in the gaps and said like, oh, and it's actually kind of good.

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And Mike, your response was, it's really good.

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Like you had, there was like a voice quiver. It like shook you to explain how really good the McGruff Smart Kids album is.

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I had like a slightly orgasmic reaction to what you're saying.

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You popped kind of hard.

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's completely, I don't deny that at all. I don't actually remember it because I probably, that's probably happened a lot to me in the last couple years.

60
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You couldn't pick out which instance it was. Yeah.

61
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah. Somebody's gone like, oh, so it's like, yeah, it's like, it's like good or something. And I go, no, no, no, no, you don't understand.

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's great.

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Am I going to kill me?

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah, I'm going to kill you. It's really good. It's really good.

65
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah. So, yeah. So it's, it's a fantastic album. It's on YouTube.

66
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
There's a little bit of a cult around it. I think there's a little bit. People who know people, if you know, you know, is what I'm saying.

67
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah. With McGruff Smart Kids.

68
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Kind of an underground kind of a college rock sort of vibe at this point.

69
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah. Yeah.

70
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And it's, I think we've said it's like sort of an indie rock lo-fi masterpiece.

71
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Like, you know, it's, it's very analog. It's very drum machine. It's got the cassette hiss, you know.

72
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's very, it's very cool to like it, I think.

73
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I think so. I think it also makes you cool.

74
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And I, yeah, I like every sound on it. I think the instrumentation is fantastic.

75
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And that's maybe my biggest question heading into McGruff 2 is are we going to feel the same way being that like, of course, it's completely in my wheelhouse and probably your guys too, that something recorded in what, 86?

76
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That that's going to like have the exact kinds of keyboard and drum machine and sax vibes that we like.

77
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But is, is it going to work to head into the perilous 90s where sounds get a little cheesier and dicier?

78
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yeah, I hear what you're saying. And this was a concern going in.

79
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And I do want to let the listener know in general that I'm unfortunate.

80
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's unfortunate to say that the songs we'll be listening today, I don't believe are as high quality as SmartKits.

81
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Well, look, we're going to have a lot of fun today.

82
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And I will say, do I have nearly 40 songs ready to go in iTunes?

83
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yes. Yes, I do.

84
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh my God.

85
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay, should we all take an extra bathroom break right now?

86
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Do we load up on supplies?

87
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It sounds like you are announcing a McGruff 3 in a roundabout fashion.

88
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, I just, you know, we're not going to we're not going to gush over these songs like we did SmartKits, I don't think.

89
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I could be wrong. Maybe McGruff 3 will have to happen because this episode goes too long.

90
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But I'm just saying that I want the listeners to know ahead of time that I don't think there's a couple bright spots that really surprise you.

91
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You go, well, that's cool. That's pretty cool.

92
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That actually reminds me of SmartKits, but it's not going to be as good as SmartKits.

93
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And again, I want to say we're going to have a lot of fun, a lot of laughs.

94
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But this is more what you think of when you would think of a McGruff song.

95
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Okay.

96
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I mean, I think we're going to have a lot of fun with that children's song with limited effort, perhaps, in putting the song together.

97
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But as long as, I mean, we're learning lessons, right?

98
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I mean, that's that's a lot of it.

99
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There are plenty of lessons to be learned.

100
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And I will say that there's a lot more making McGruff into some sort of Jesus-like figure on these songs.

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He's pulled up in a way that he does not.

102
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
McGruff, you know, you think of him as a musical artist.

103
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
SmartKits was when he was like sort of pretension free.

104
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
He was just sort of purely in it for the music and to get kids to stop doing drugs.

105
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
These songs, he doesn't sing a lot on these songs.

106
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
He lets kids, he's obviously got an ego at this point.

107
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He lets kids sing about him and puts it on an album.

108
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You know, he's kind of he's in the I am a god stage of his career.

109
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The Kanye, the Yeezus, I think.

110
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I was wondering. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

111
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And like the the is it like the hustle isn't there as much that the insecurity of the early era that feels very far away now.

112
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The urgency is missing. Yeah.

113
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
These songs.

114
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Well, I think it's important that you you calibrate us correctly here.

115
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So, you know, we don't get our hopes up, but it's you do have to explore a musician,

116
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
a prolific musician with honesty.

117
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And, you know, we're we're big Prince fans.

118
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
We talk about Prince a lot.

119
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Where I think we're more we've been more excited to see the 80s vault opened up than the 90s.

120
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Well, where I think we're honest about how we feel about the 90s Prince body of work.

121
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But when you find the gems in there, they almost shine brighter because they're mixed in with a lot of rocks and coal.

122
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What's the end of that metaphor?

123
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah, coal, I guess coal, because coal is kind of bad, even though it like I guess you I guess it's used to heat.

124
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So there's some use to it.

125
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But coal is the stock.

126
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You don't put it you put it in a stocking is and that's supposed to be like you did bad all year.

127
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah. Take this coal.

128
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's bad. Yeah.

129
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So but amidst all the coal, there will there could be some diamonds and pearls.

130
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So maybe that's what I'm I'm curious if any of these will prove to be the late era masterpiece, a lot of diamonds and pearls.

131
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What's McGruff's diamonds and pearls?

132
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Right. And like you could say that McGruff's revolution, which of course, Bobby Z, Wendy and Lisa, his his revolution are I'm looking at a McGruff book now from the Burger King tape.

133
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
His revolution is there.

134
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Members are Anne, Anthony, Joy and Miguel.

135
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So that's print.

136
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That's gross revolution, I think.

137
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And we'll talk about that more when I get to because I have this book just for Book Four of McGruff Cares for You cassette.

138
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So we'll get there at a certain point and talk more about the book when we get there.

139
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Well, maybe we should.

140
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You know, I don't want to delay the music too much, but we should say that there's been considerable effort put into attaining all of this music, which only Mike has been through.

141
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Mike is now the supervisor of the McGruff estate, and he's kind of curating all the material for us.

142
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The you know, we're kind of executive producers on the project and you the patrons are the listeners, the motivated McGruff fans.

143
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So this is a surprise mostly to Jason and I.

144
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes. And we had some Indiana Joneses, some Lara Croft, Tomb Raider-esque archaeologists helping with us.

145
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Our friend Andrew Grissom gave us one of the cassettes with a book.

146
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yes.

147
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And then I went, I double checked the date on this email.

148
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This has been almost a year in the works this episode because.

149
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yes.

150
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I, a gentleman named Alexander Hoffman wrote and had come across one of the cassettes in like a collectible store, antique store in one of my home stopping grounds in like South Jersey area.

151
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And he sent it to us to the Forever Dog Address, along with a second cassette that he found.

152
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And then to on top of that, a listener named Ian Rich sent us a bunch of digitized files, like very nicely organized digitized.

153
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Digitizing? Oh my God.

154
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes. With metadata, with like album art, like a properly named too.

155
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So thanks to you all for your excavations.

156
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Thank you heroes.

157
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yeah, our true heroes.

158
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Thank you heroes for making McGruff 2 possible.

159
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yes, it really helps. It really helped out. So yes.

160
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We appreciate it. However, don't copy music for the most part.

161
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I mean, somebody bought the tapes at some point in time, but I don't want to look on Napster and Kazaa and see a bunch of McGruff on there.

162
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Technically I could still sue you guys, but I won't.

163
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Alexander and Ian and Andrew.

164
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Alexander, Ian and Andrew, just pass a drunk test and then all will be copacetic.

165
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Piss onto a strip and send it to me.

166
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'll sniff it.

167
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That's a pregnancy test, not a drug test.

168
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Piss on a stick.

169
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I want to know if you're pregnant too.

170
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I got a lot of questions.

171
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
If there's a red dot, you're pregnant. If there's a green leaf, you've been smoking marijuana.

172
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Is it a baby or weed?

173
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Anyway.

174
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh man, McGruff, the greatest. Okay, so.

175
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Let's okay. Let me organize myself here. There's a lot on the table, as I said.

176
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So yes, McGruff released four Burger King cassette tapes called McGruff Cares for You.

177
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Cassette one through four.

178
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And we had played a couple and we'll get to there that we had played a couple from cassette three.

179
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Okay, which is on YouTube.

180
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
That's the only one that was kind of available publicly before we got into this endeavor.

181
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Right. So we played a little. We'll refresh when we get there.

182
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And then so I'm just setting those four up.

183
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And then I also found another very not documented album called McGruff and Scruff and the Crime Dogs,

184
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
which I don't know where that was released.

185
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
There's really not much information on it.

186
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I haven't even seen a cover and maybe I did a bad job researching it.

187
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But do we know that the time even like where it falls into this discography?

188
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I think it's in 94 ish because so basically I found this album

189
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
because I have been hunting for the person who wrote Smart Kids.

190
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And we do have a name at this point, but I have not had any contact, but I thought I found the writer of it.

191
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And I messaged him over and over again and never responded.

192
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And finally, I think maybe on LinkedIn, I had sent an email and he responded.

193
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He said, Oh, I didn't write Smart Kids. I wrote a different McGruff album.

194
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And at first I was saying, Oh, it must be the Burger King ones.

195
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
No, the answer was no. He wrote another one called McGruff and Scruff and the Crime Dogs.

196
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And I will say that one musically, I think is better than the four Burger King tapes.

197
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And again, we'll get to there. So I'm just trying to tease exactly everything we've got going on here.

198
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So we'll get to we'll get to that. I think it's after the McGruff Burger King tapes.

199
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So also, what is the cut off where we have to do part three?

200
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Is it if this goes beyond two and a half hours?

201
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's a good question. Yeah. If we go over two and a half hours and we have like 30 percent left,

202
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I think we'll find a natural stopping place maybe before and go ahead.

203
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But I don't know. I think we can. You might get tired of some of this quickly, so I will see.

204
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,000
OK, yeah, I have three and a half hours left on this SD card because I've been negligent of clearing off source files.

205
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So, yeah, but I can always you know, I can always clear.

206
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I can always clear, you know. Well, I'm running out of space on my hard drive because I have found 12 more McGruff albums that you guys don't even know about.

207
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What? Wow. This man was prolific.

208
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
We've all been very prolific on our LinkedIn burners that we made for this show.

209
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You don't want to make it on LinkedIn.

210
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
He got I think I signed up for LinkedIn to email McGruff has most of his best stuff still in his vault.

211
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah, I got three Smart Kids era albums in the vault.

212
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
No one's heard them and I have to wait for me to die for McGruff to die.

213
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Scruff is going to have to decide.

214
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I've instructed him not to let anyone hear any of it.

215
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But if he betrays me for a buck, I don't have a will.

216
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So good luck sorting out the estate.

217
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Sorry.

218
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Okay.

219
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So all right, Burger King McGruff cares for you.

220
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So this is the start of the whole what do you call it?

221
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Not a trilogy, a quadru. What is that word?

222
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Cycle?

223
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Quadro. No, no, it's quadriology or something.

224
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Okay.

225
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
There's it's a word that's like not trilogy but four.

226
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Well, it's all McGruff's quadrophenia.

227
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's yes. Okay. Well, that's good. That's good.

228
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So this starts out with like the McGruff worship and it's called a whistle for McGruff.

229
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And it starts out right away.

230
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
McGruff, McGruff, McGruff.

231
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
He's a crime dog.

232
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
He's our guide.

233
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And he's always on our side.

234
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah!

235
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
McGruff's a kind of friend who cares for you.

236
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
He understands the things that kids go through.

237
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
He'll help you any place you go, go, go.

238
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
He'll show you what you need to know, know, know McGruff.

239
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
He comes to see us in our schools.

240
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
He speaks to us as prom dog rules.

241
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
He shows us how to help our friends and how to be good citizens.

242
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
He shows us how to clean our block and how to always lock the lock.

243
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
He taught us how to use the phone when we are in the house alone.

244
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
McGruff!

245
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The phone.

246
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I feel a little condescended too with this one.

247
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I agree. Yeah.

248
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's very basic, you know.

249
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yeah.

250
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
He's tough on crime.

251
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
He warns us of dangers.

252
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I like this part.

253
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
He tries very hard to keep us on guard.

254
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
A good bridge, yes.

255
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
He helps us a lot.

256
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
He's McGruff!

257
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
When things get tough, you need McGruff.

258
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
He's there for you all of the time.

259
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You never know when you've got a problem.

260
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So this should set your expectations where they're at.

261
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
This is sort of what we're at.

262
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
On occasion you get a little interesting musical breaks.

263
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
But in general, you're going to have a bunch of not great kids singers.

264
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Which is funny.

265
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
He's tough on crime.

266
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
He also looks sharp.

267
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
He looks so good in a trench coat.

268
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Yeah, wouldn't McGruff be like, a little too much kids.

269
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You don't need to butter me up this much.

270
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's not really about me.

271
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's about stopping crime, I guess.

272
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Never been comfortable with compliments.

273
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Not me, us.

274
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
That's my catchphrase.

275
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
He's from a generation that doesn't want to open up.

276
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
This would be embarrassing to him, I would think.

277
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You would think, but he allowed it on his album with his name.

278
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I guess it's kind of like when a TV show says previously on.

279
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's like, well, sometimes people come in later on.

280
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Right.

281
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So that is, by the way, that is the tip of the ass kissing iceberg.

282
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What?

283
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You ain't seen nothing yet until we get to a song later on this album called

284
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Wish.

285
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
That is a dreamlike ballad.

286
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Dreams of only McGruff being in your life.

287
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm excited for Wish.

288
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
There's a lot of laziness on this album.

289
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
This next song is called Phone Smart.

290
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
McGruff sings on this, which I like, but this is some of the laziest

291
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
melody I've ever heard.

292
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Like just.

293
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Hi, it's me, McGruff.

294
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I got a question for you.

295
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Who's your best friend when you're at home alone?

296
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
McGruff!

297
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Your best friend when you're at home alone.

298
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'll always be your friend and I'll always tell you the right things to do.

299
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
But your best friend when you're at home alone is you.

300
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So he does kind of do it there, but he still takes the compliment.

301
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But you gotta be phone smart.

302
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I thought he was going to say a lot.

303
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
When you're home on your own, you're never alone.

304
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What is this melody?

305
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
When you got the phone, the telephone.

306
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It feels like he's making it up on the spot.

307
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Phone and telephone.

308
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Here's how to be phone smart.

309
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Now he doesn't get out of the song.

310
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Have your parents make up a list of all emergency numbers for you.

311
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And people to start.

312
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm fast forwarding here.

313
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
To get phone smart.

314
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Phone smart.

315
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
This isn't even good enough to be a commercial jingle.

316
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
This is nothing.

317
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
This is a demo. He's screwing around.

318
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
This song is not fleshed out at all.

319
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
If you've got a phone.

320
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And your phone is smart.

321
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
The biggest gaps in the melody ever.

322
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Just take a little while.

323
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And learn to use the buttons.

324
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Or dial.

325
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
At least that's a rhyme.

326
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Than anybody.

327
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
That you need.

328
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You can reach with lightning speed.

329
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
If your phone is smart.

330
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
That's right.

331
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I mean, phone smart.

332
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Come on. This is track two on the album.

333
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Let's get a little energy here.

334
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
McGruff. Gee whiz.

335
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
The voice is weird to me also.

336
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's very weird.

337
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's kind of higher.

338
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Our impression doesn't work as much.

339
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It's got to be a little more.

340
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm getting.

341
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You veer into the Yoda zone.

342
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
If you aren't careful.

343
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
But this seems pretty good.

344
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
There is something on tape too.

345
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Where he sounds hammered.

346
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
But that's a problem with this song.

347
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
He went right from the viper room.

348
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
To the recording.

349
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
He never went home that night. Didn't sleep.

350
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Just got in the car from the viper room.

351
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I do as I say. Not as I do.

352
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
He was drunk on the phone song.

353
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
He was not being phone smart.

354
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Right before recording the liquor song.

355
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
He's not practicing what he preaches.

356
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Not at all.

357
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And again, like track two.

358
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
There should be a better melody on phone smart.

359
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
This is like.

360
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
The McGruff of smart kids would not allow phone smart.

361
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
That bullshit phone smart melody.

362
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
To happen.

363
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So yeah.

364
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
So it's a bad start to tape one.

365
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Unfortunately.

366
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
An artist metaphor here.

367
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Where you're so anticipated.

368
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
From that first one.

369
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
The next one is going to be a masterpiece.

370
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Maybe Lauren Hill comes to mind.

371
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Because she's sort of like.

372
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
That was a pretty perfect first album.

373
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And then it was a lot of.

374
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I don't even remember what she did second.

375
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Like a weird unplugged.

376
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Or like a badly drawn boy.

377
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
With a really good first album.

378
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And a very sloppy career following that.

379
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Well that's a name I haven't heard in a long long time.

380
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's as current as I get.

381
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
2001 era.

382
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Casey or Dewey music.

383
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I think that's.

384
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I think that is absolutely correct.

385
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Analogy.

386
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So yeah. So anyway. I mean it does get better.

387
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So he does a little right and wrong.

388
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
There's this thing called right and wrong song that comes up next.

389
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And.

390
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's so tubby. He explains like a game.

391
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Everyone ready for our sing along?

392
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Ready.

393
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And.

394
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
We're all going to sing the right and wrong song.

395
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So clap your hands and sing along.

396
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Loud and strong.

397
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
You tell me which one's right.

398
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And which one's wrong.

399
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Here's how. Clap your hands once for right.

400
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Like this.

401
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And twice for wrong.

402
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Kind of a confusing game.

403
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
That's right. You got it.

404
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
In 1917.

405
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Columbus sailed the ocean green.

406
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
1917?

407
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
That's wrong.

408
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
In 1492.

409
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Columbus sailed the ocean blue.

410
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
See.

411
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
That's right. You clap once.

412
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It's a confusing game.

413
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah. It's a confusing game.

414
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I will give him credit because you could rap like Paul Revere over this.

415
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I think.

416
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
In 1907.

417
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
That's right. You got it.

418
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
You have to know the story.

419
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You know so well.

420
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
But two bad brothers.

421
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I can't screw with the line up.

422
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
There is none higher.

423
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
In 1492.

424
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
So I appreciate that he's kind of getting into rap there.

425
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
But that's a bad.

426
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
That's nothing. That's also nothing.

427
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
That song is nothing. Now we get to track four.

428
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And we have a skit.

429
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Oh. Also not something I like on my albums.

430
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I agree.

431
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Great albums are ruined by inessential skits.

432
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Yeah. So he has a skit.

433
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Track four. Like we're already off to a snoozy start.

434
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And it's track four with a skit.

435
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:46,000
The only reason I'm going to play this is because it's about a little girl not answering the door because a man who's pretending to be a delivery man is trying to get in and steal her.

436
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Steal her.

437
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I will play it.

438
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Steal her. Not rob the house.

439
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Sort of the implication is he's going to kidnap her I think.

440
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,000
But the only reason I'm playing this is because I'm pretty sure the guy who does McGruff's voice is doing the guy at the door.

441
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And I find the fact.

442
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I think. You tell me.

443
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
So we'll set the plan here.

444
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Okay Melissa.

445
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Let me fast forward here a little bit.

446
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Package for Peterson.

447
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Thank you. Just leave it there.

448
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
No you have to sign for it.

449
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You have to open the door.

450
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
The door's locked.

451
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Just leave the package.

452
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You have to open the door.

453
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It sounds like Joe Biden.

454
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Come on now or you'll get in trouble. Hurry up.

455
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm going to get more McGruffish.

456
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
She phoned next door. Listen.

457
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Hello.

458
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Mrs. Garcia.

459
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Mrs. Kim. There's a man who wants me to open the door.

460
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
He wants me to sign something.

461
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Open up.

462
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Don't open it.

463
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I'll be over right away.

464
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I'll try to get his car license number.

465
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Kim.

466
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Dial 0 for operator.

467
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And ask her to call.

468
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Mrs. Garcia's. You're in there kid.

469
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm sure this package is important.

470
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Is it not?

471
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Operator.

472
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I'm home alone and a delivery man.

473
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Says I have to open the door.

474
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So basically Mrs. Garcia calls 911 and they find out that yes indeed that man was a criminal.

475
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Oh my god.

476
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
This is still hold over from like the satanic panic error.

477
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Like I feel like we got the tail end of it.

478
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
You know when we were growing up.

479
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Uh huh.

480
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
So yeah.

481
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Luckily Mrs. Garcia was there.

482
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I'm fascinated. It's like hearing Gilbert Godfrey's real voice.

483
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
If you ever heard that it's very strange.

484
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Because Gilbert Godfrey does not sound like you thought he sounded forever.

485
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
He actually is a human man's voice.

486
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I want to show my range.

487
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm tired of being typecast as a hero dog.

488
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So.

489
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Yeah the guy finally got to flex his acting muscles a little bit there.

490
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And maybe he appears other places on this.

491
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I don't think he's one of the children.

492
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I don't think he's that good.

493
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Oh yes.

494
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It would be funny.

495
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
But McGruff.

496
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Mommy and daddy.

497
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
My pinky and my daddy.

498
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Mommy and daddy said it's fine if it's a friend of theirs to get in the van.

499
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Mommy and daddy liars.

500
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
No.

501
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Yeah.

502
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Yeah.

503
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
So maybe he's a prize.

504
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I will say Mrs. Garcia I wasn't.

505
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Mrs. Garcia might have been a white lady.

506
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm not sure.

507
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
You want to listen to that.

508
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I could be totally wrong and I apologize if that's not right.

509
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Anyway.

510
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So the next song I'm skipping it's called it's only a dime.

511
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And it's about how if you take a dime from your mother.

512
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
You're going to eventually rob like banks.

513
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
That's not what he says because that would be funny.

514
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
You're in a better and I would play it if that was the case.

515
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
But that's the message of like it starts with one and then you then you're off and you're a criminal.

516
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
You take a dime from your mother like it's all like you're going to do.

517
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Who knows what you'll do.

518
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It's a it's a gateway crime is what he's saying.

519
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I think there's a chain shortage in this country.

520
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Now is not the time to steal dimes.

521
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Stealing dimes the ultimate crime.

522
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Dimes are important.

523
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
So here we go.

524
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:29,000
We're getting here we are now at Wish and Wish is the most ambitious song on this cassette.

525
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And I'll just I've already kind of set it up.

526
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
This is the song where they just kiss McGruff's ass so thoroughly.

527
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And here we go.

528
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
It's also like a romantic ballad.

529
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It also sounds like.

530
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Sounds like.

531
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I want to hire him pony up kids.

532
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It's weird.

533
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
The song.

534
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
We're in love with him.

535
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
The girls too.

536
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Share my seat.

537
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Yeah.

538
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Plenty of room here McGruff.

539
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Key change.

540
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I wish McGruff would always be my bride.

541
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I wish he was our house when he could.

542
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I wish McGruff lived in our neighborhood.

543
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I'm part of every neighborhood that takes a bite out of crime.

544
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
That's my job.

545
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
That's what I do.

546
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I kind of like this one.

547
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And if you listen to everything I tell you.

548
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Learn how to take care of yourself.

549
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Well you know.

550
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
That's like having me right there.

551
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I'll be there for you.

552
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
This is good too.

553
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Because I care for you.

554
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
We'll be there for you.

555
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Alright that's basically that's the gist of it.

556
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I mean it's surprising that he goes I'm marrying your mom kids.

557
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm part of your family now.

558
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
You got your wish.

559
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It's yeah why are two songs that have to like mythologize this dog?

560
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Like it's this guy's he's got a big head.

561
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
McGruff.

562
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Maybe it's McGruff's obviously McGruff's creator at this point.

563
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Started being like you know McGruff is great.

564
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
He like maybe the creator and the writer is like.

565
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
McGruff is worthy of this Jesus level.

566
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Yeah it is very Jesus level.

567
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Like that I'm in every neighborhood.

568
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm all around even if you don't see me.

569
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I can always hear you.

570
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And if a priest takes a piece of bread or a wafer.

571
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And says McGruff be with you then and then you eat it.

572
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
You're eating McGruff.

573
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Two sets of footprints and one set of footprints.

574
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
One set of paw prints on the sand.

575
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
If Dylan can go gospel why can't I?

576
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
No.

577
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I'm God.

578
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
McGruff is Jesus.

579
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I don't know what the Holy Spirit is.

580
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
The Holy Spirit is my music.

581
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I wish there was a third.

582
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
There was a BJ or Griff in the McGruff verse.

583
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Maybe Griff.

584
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Or is not.

585
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Yeah.

586
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Griff was initially supposed to be part of the McGruff family.

587
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Like it was painted like a dog.

588
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Like the suit was made for McGruff.

589
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And McGruff rejected him.

590
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Put him up for adoption.

591
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Sell him to those Barney losers.

592
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
They won't know any better.

593
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
He could still play sax on some of the songs.

594
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I'll hire him.

595
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Dude's got chops but I don't want him hanging around all the time.

596
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I don't want to have to feed him and clothe him.

597
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I'll hire him but not raise him.

598
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Okay.

599
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
All right.

600
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So wish.

601
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Are we that?

602
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
We are six songs in.

603
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Yeah.

604
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
You know what this is reminding me of?

605
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
The swing from Smart Kids to this.

606
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And it's not a perfect metaphor.

607
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And I'm not a Ramones expert.

608
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
But do you guys know End of the Century?

609
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
The Ramones album, it was like their fifth album.

610
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
But they had Phil Spector produce it.

611
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Oh, right.

612
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I know this.

613
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And it.

614
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
He pulled a gun on them.

615
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Yeah.

616
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
He pulled a gun a number of times.

617
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Yeah.

618
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
He does that a lot though.

619
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
But that album has some skits.

620
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Like some radio skits.

621
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It's only 34 minutes long.

622
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I like the album, but it is very much like a pretty sharp change from like early Ramones

623
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
sound.

624
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Is there a lot of like, we love you, Joey Ramone.

625
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
We love you, Mark Ramone.

626
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I mean, it sounds like when you like the Ramones, like got a bunch of Ronettes records and like

627
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
tried to marry the sounds.

628
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Well, you can't be mad at that.

629
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah.

630
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I know it's all right.

631
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
But I don't.

632
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I pull the difference with me is I pull a gun on my producers.

633
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I'm the boss of you, Phil.

634
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Phil.

635
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Phil was scared of me.

636
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You run off to that castle of yours.

637
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Stay there.

638
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
All right.

639
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
The opposite of the Walla sound, really.

640
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
This this music.

641
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It's very thin, in fact, and it makes you appreciate the production of Smart Kids.

642
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Yeah.

643
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's like a paper, a thin piece of paper of sound.

644
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Easily crash throughable.

645
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
If you lean on it, it breaks open.

646
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Yeah.

647
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
All right.

648
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
This next song.

649
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Now, this this next song was a surprise to me.

650
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It's called Stay Clean.

651
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And it's like somebody woke up.

652
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It's like the album wakes up a little bit here.

653
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Like pretty like, oh, OK.

654
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
What is this?

655
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It's I feel for you.

656
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
You can make your daydreams come true.

657
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And do whatever you want to do.

658
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
First kid talent, I feel.

659
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Just.

660
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Don't do drugs.

661
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
You can live your life as you please.

662
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Like a real good groove.

663
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Yeah.

664
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Good things will come your way like a breeze.

665
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
If you just stay clean.

666
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
No drugs.

667
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Not you.

668
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
You can climb a hill and be king.

669
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Climb a hill and be king.

670
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You can have it all.

671
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Everything.

672
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
If you just stay clean.

673
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Stay the way you are.

674
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You can be what you want to be.

675
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Pretty good.

676
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yeah.

677
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Yeah.

678
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
That's a pretty good groove that could have like you could you could see a version of that

679
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
being on Smart Kids.

680
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Mm hmm.

681
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Yeah.

682
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Yeah.

683
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
The first one that's of the caliber.

684
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
It also it is all very principles that there's so many protege's.

685
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
He's really like given the spotlight to the protege's and the some of those as with Prince

686
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
some of them are good, some of them are bad.

687
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I think that last girl was a good protege.

688
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Right.

689
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
She was who?

690
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Yeah.

691
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Who is the who's most successful Prince protege is Sheila E technically a protege.

692
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
You'd have to call I guess Sheila.

693
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Yeah.

694
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Yeah.

695
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
That's the Sheila.

696
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
The most not the Carmen Electra who's fine and other mediums.

697
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
But the Prince album is not the best.

698
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
A cultural icon certainly.

699
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
But the album maybe wasn't so successful.

700
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I always remember his lake, one of his late period protege's Bria Valente.

701
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
As much as he could pass it over to ladies and gentlemen, Bria Valente.

702
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Bria Valente.

703
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Which is just fun to hear.

704
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It's fun to hear him say that name.

705
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
That's a good name.

706
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I'm sure she's very talented.

707
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
But yeah, that he bundled that see he bundled three CDs together.

708
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I remember at Target.

709
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
At Target.

710
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Two of his CDs and then her solo album.

711
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Yeah.

712
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
At the time.

713
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Well, that's what this is.

714
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
This is a bundle.

715
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
This is a corporate tie in.

716
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Right.

717
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Yes.

718
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Okay.

719
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
This song.

720
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
This song is funny.

721
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And maybe I don't even want to set it up.

722
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Just listen to what he's saying and then where the music goes.

723
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Hi, boys and girls.

724
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
It's your old friend McGruff, the crime dog.

725
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Let's talk about crimes committed by somebody with a mask.

726
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Yeah.

727
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
The crime is called arson.

728
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
He's talking about arson.

729
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Arson is when a person sets a fire to a building.

730
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It's pretty serious, right?

731
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Now, if you ever see anyone try that, tell a grownup right away.

732
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
He's right.

733
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
The first sign of arson or any other fire is usually smoke.

734
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Right.

735
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Now, if you're home alone and you smell smoke, remember this.

736
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Smoke from a fire can be just as dangerous as the fire itself.

737
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Smoke can creep up on you and make you unconscious.

738
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Smoke is sneaky.

739
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Yes.

740
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Don't take chances with it.

741
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
He's right.

742
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
He's right.

743
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
One, two, three, four.

744
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
If you smell smoke, even just a little whiff, get out.

745
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
What?

746
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Get out.

747
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Don't take another sniff, get out.

748
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
What is this funny joke?

749
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I like this, John.

750
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Get out and tell a grownup get out.

751
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
It's a no-smoke jitterbug.

752
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Get close to the floor, get out.

753
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Get out, get right out the door, get out.

754
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Out, out, out.

755
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And shout about it, get out.

756
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Out, out.

757
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Tell the neighbors all about it, get out.

758
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Out, out, out.

759
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
And shout about it, get out.

760
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Out, out.

761
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Tell the neighbors all about it.

762
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And if there's no fire, you can still feel cool.

763
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Think of all the fire drills they have at school.

764
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Even when they don't smell smoke.

765
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Got the message?

766
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
OK.

767
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Let's play the I smell smoke.

768
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm going to ask you some questions.

769
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Number one, when you smell smoke, should you try to find it?

770
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Find it?

771
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Never mind it.

772
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Get out fast.

773
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
How does this game work?

774
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Number two.

775
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It's unclear.

776
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Clap four times if you smell smoke.

777
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Leave it alone.

778
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Get out fast.

779
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
There was a long pause before the questions because he had to take a plug of cutting.

780
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
How do you smell smoke?

781
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Yeah, so I just like arson is a very important crime.

782
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Now let's play like a like blues brother song and celebrate arson.

783
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Wap babaloo ba no smoke for you.

784
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I feel like I got so many warnings in school, like all of the drug stuff and and inhalants.

785
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And I feel like we watch at least two after school movies in school about like watch out for arson or like your friend might be an arsonist.

786
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
And I looking back, I'm like, is that why I was such a nervous child?

787
00:41:51,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Because I was constantly being warned about the danger of the world of like serial killers calling to see like you have to foil a serial killer with my mom can't come to the phone right now, but she's here.

788
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Like I that was just a thing in the 90s.

789
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Yeah, it was.

790
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
We all got fed a lot of this stuff.

791
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I mean, I will say it's, you know, things happen here and there.

792
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I remember, but it did feel like you were going to be consistently fighting off abductors.

793
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Yes, like that was going to be a consistent part of our lives growing up, like constantly lying to adults of like, no, my mom is she's here.

794
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I can't come to the door right now.

795
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,000
But your friends are all turncoats and addicts who are going to get you hooked on something.

796
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

797
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Don't trust friends.

798
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Friends are bad.

799
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I don't ever have one.

800
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Imagine being my friend instead of meeting someone.

801
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I'm here.

802
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I woke up here.

803
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I'm very dear mom.

804
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Yeah, so I'm McGruff certainly was part of that.

805
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I mean, you got to warn kids about a lot of things, but maybe it doesn't have to be unrelenting.

806
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Yeah, yeah.

807
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Point, Jason.

808
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Yes, I am.

809
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I did meet an arsonist growing up and I'll never forget it.

810
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I do have a story about meeting an arsonist and I'll see if I can say this quickly that there was like a family gathering and there is an older cousin in the family who would often have bring boyfriends to things where you sort of even as a 12 year old or whatever it was like.

811
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
That's a shady boyfriend, wasn't it?

812
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And she brought this guy who was like kind of little and squirrely and intense and like a little too fit and kind of manic.

813
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Right.

814
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
And like, hey, good to meet you guys seem like such nice folks and hey, little Scott.

815
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Hey, what do you what do you run your bike a lot?

816
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Okay.

817
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And just kind of a weird energy from the guy.

818
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:58,000
And then hours into this family barbecue, this guy stops everything cold and says like, you know, you guys have been so nice and accepting to me that I feel like I just want to be honest with you and open up to you guys.

819
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
You seem like good folks.

820
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I've had some problems with arson in my life and I have it has happened several times.

821
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I've burnt down several buildings and it has it has been tough for me to progress and to to move forward.

822
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
But I just want you know, because I, you know, I'm enjoying being here so much.

823
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I just want you guys to know that because I feel free to tell you who I am and what I'm struggling and trying to process.

824
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:37,000
And then I remember that this this family member's father, who was just dead silence until the father goes, all right, and then just leaves the house like for a while.

825
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And then we never saw this guy ever again.

826
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Wow.

827
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Oh, my God.

828
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Oh, my God.

829
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
My childhood was like very nice, but very dull.

830
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
A lot of the time just like pleasant.

831
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Well, that was a nice gathering.

832
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:02,000
So the time where like a little like a little like coked out squirrely arsonist admitted that he's an arsonist.

833
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Oh, my gosh.

834
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Wow.

835
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Yeah, that was that was a fun story for my childhood.

836
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And I think as McGruff would say, it's never that easy.

837
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Most most arsonists are not going to announce themselves to you.

838
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
They're just going to do the arson.

839
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Right.

840
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I appreciate his honesty.

841
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Yeah.

842
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Yeah.

843
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
You know, he's struggling with it, I guess.

844
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:34,000
But if I heard that this same guy started like three of the fires that have been ravaging our part of the state, I couldn't be that surprised either.

845
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
That's a good point.

846
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
There's a fire truck outside my house right now.

847
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
It's probably him.

848
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,000
If you heard if you had heard this tape before that incident, would you have tackled this guy and placed him under citizen's arrest?

849
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Maybe a dog told me that you're bad news.

850
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Get out.

851
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I'm taking you to the police.

852
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
What about it? Get out.

853
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
You're like singing the song like while crying, holding this guy down.

854
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
If you meet an arsonist at a barbecue, there's one thing that you can do.

855
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Get out and tackle him.

856
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Bind his ankles.

857
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Get out.

858
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Grab an extension cord from the garage and tie him to a tree.

859
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:22,000
If you see a stranger lighting a cigarette and then rubber banding six matches around it to make a slow burning fire starter, tell it out.

860
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
That was one of the movies.

861
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
They told us how to commit arson.

862
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Arson did it the same way every time and it always worked.

863
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And I was like sitting there watching this.

864
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Like, why are you telling us?

865
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Why are you telling us this trick?

866
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
McGruff.

867
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I'm telling you every step of what you see somebody pulling out a spoon and then starting to boil the spoon.

868
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
And I don't know the steps enough of free basing drugs.

869
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So I'll stop there.

870
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I'm a good boy.

871
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
McGruff.

872
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Right.

873
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
It's like Breaking Bad.

874
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Breaking Bad.

875
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
They had to make sure that the meth steps were out of order so people wouldn't learn how to make meth.

876
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Oh, is that right?

877
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Like you couldn't watch it and then purposely.

878
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Well, you probably could figure it out and look Google it.

879
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:13,000
But apparently they did steps out of order for making meth in the prep scenes so people wouldn't know exactly how to do it.

880
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Oh, huh.

881
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Technical consultant McGruff.

882
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Right.

883
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I know how to make it.

884
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I know how to make it.

885
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And I know how to show it so it isn't easily copied.

886
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I make the purest meth there is.

887
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Watch me do a batch.

888
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
But then don't do what I do.

889
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
The purest crystal.

890
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
All right. How many how many minutes are we into this?

891
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I'm not sure.

892
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
47.

893
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Okay.

894
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
All right.

895
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Okay.

896
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Okay.

897
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
That's not crazy.

898
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
You could have said like an hour forty five and I've been like, yep, makes sense.

899
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I just think you have a promise of McGruff three is I mean, but God knows if we make it through, then let's make it through.

900
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Well, we could.

901
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I mean, we could stop.

902
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
We could stop at the end of this next one.

903
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Oh, no, that's not.

904
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I don't think that's enough.

905
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I think we got the next album.

906
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
The next cassette.

907
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Oh, not the next.

908
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
No, no, no.

909
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Okay.

910
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I mean, I don't think McGruff three is out of the question, even if we get through all the songs today.

911
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Somehow.

912
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Sure.

913
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Hmm.

914
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Well, another yearly series, then we just keep.

915
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Yeah.

916
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Yeah.

917
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
It should be.

918
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Is there a crime prevention day that we should be doing this on?

919
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
National no arts and day.

920
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
It's very.

921
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Yeah.

922
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
You bring up a good point.

923
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Okay.

924
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
So this is cassette two.

925
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
We're at cassette two of McGruff cares for you.

926
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
The Burger King series.

927
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Now, I will say tape two is a little bit experimental.

928
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Oh, there's a different vibe on it.

929
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Like McCartney to it's a lot like McCartney to.

930
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I agree.

931
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:00,000
This is McGruff to the official album of Gruff to where we were a week away from McCartney three as we're recording this.

932
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Oh, so excited.

933
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I wonder how does it compare to McGruff three?

934
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Well, McGruff three has the alphabet alphabet or song on it.

935
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Oh, and Zards, right?

936
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
And Zard.

937
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Yeah.

938
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Yes.

939
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Which we didn't know what they were, but somebody pointed out that that's just a slang for hazards, which I believe is correct.

940
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Oh, sure.

941
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Yeah.

942
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It's gonna be a good album.

943
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I'm covering Zards.

944
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I'm doing a couple McGruff tracks.

945
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Yeah, they recorded in the eighties, like after he was done with Elvis Costello.

946
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
He'll collaborate.

947
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Yeah.

948
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
This song is called You're a Winner, which is a nice sentiment.

949
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And you'll hear what I'm saying.

950
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
It's a little more.

951
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Life is full of choices, small ones and big ones.

952
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It's a spoken word.

953
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Small ones like deciding which pair of socks to wear today.

954
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Big ones like what you want to do when you grow up.

955
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
You can be just about anything you want.

956
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
That's very Prince.

957
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Yeah, yeah, actually.

958
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
It's to put your mind to it and stay in school.

959
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
You're a winner, not a quitter.

960
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
You'll be all right, cause you have what it takes.

961
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
You're a winner, not a quitter.

962
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Stay in school.

963
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Don't put on the break.

964
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Some kids know what they want to be.

965
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Maybe a police officer or a teacher.

966
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
But a lot of folks don't decide until later.

967
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Stay in school and you'll have more job choices.

968
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Do your best to keep your options open.

969
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
It takes education, not just wishing and hoping.

970
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
The choices you make, you choose them.

971
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Keep your options open kids.

972
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Are going to be with you all along your way.

973
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Some kids decide to quit school.

974
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
When they get older and have to earn a living, they learn a tough lesson.

975
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Dropouts don't get the good jobs.

976
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
And rather than work at a job they hate for little money,

977
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
some of these kids turn to crime or drugs and lose everything.

978
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
They may even end up in prison and that's no place for a winner like you.

979
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
That's true. There are no winners in prison.

980
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
You're a winner, not a quitter.

981
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
You'll be alright cause you have what it takes.

982
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
You're a winner, not a quitter.

983
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Stay in school.

984
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Don't put on the break.

985
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
There's no such thing as a born loser.

986
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
But everyone is a born chooser.

987
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
And winners...

988
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I get the crazy melody here.

989
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Like it feels like he's improvising this over this track.

990
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
It doesn't feel like a lot of time was put into that.

991
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
There's a winner to be found in you.

992
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Like his singing is off, you know.

993
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
So there's a little bit of that.

994
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
The first part is a little experimental and I like that.

995
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
There's a little more of that on this album.

996
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Confusing message.

997
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Boy, I didn't know what that song was about by the end.

998
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Again, yeah, not focused like Smart Kids.

999
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
You know exactly what each song on Smart Kids is about.

1000
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
This one is like all over the place.

1001
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
He's talking about like college and options.

1002
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Shale.

1003
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
You're not inherently...

1004
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
You're not a loser.

1005
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
That's not inherent, but you are inherently a winner.

1006
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
And you can lose that if you don't go to...

1007
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
There's too much going on here.

1008
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I appreciate the ambition, but stick to one or two things.

1009
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Core messages.

1010
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
The game.

1011
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
The game of the...

1012
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
The game of the song.

1013
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
The drug song.

1014
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Yeah.

1015
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
The Be Smart song.

1016
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Okay.

1017
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
So Check It Out is the song that I was referencing earlier when I said it

1018
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
sounds like he recorded this hammered.

1019
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
That one wasn't it?

1020
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Oh man.

1021
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
That one was not it.

1022
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
You ain't heard nothing yet.

1023
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
A little more lively.

1024
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Like, you know, it felt like a little lively, you know.

1025
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Yes, I agree.

1026
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I joined Hill's song and my pastor Carl Lentz has inspired me and reinvigorated me.

1027
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I think this album has got better stuff on it.

1028
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
It's got some more interesting stuff on it.

1029
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
All right.

1030
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I'll start out with Check It Out.

1031
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
It doesn't get drunkish till a little bit later in the song.

1032
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
By the way, it starts out like back in the USSR.

1033
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
It's an airplane engine warming up.

1034
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Before pilots take off a plane, they go over a checklist to make sure everything is right.

1035
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Magnetos.

1036
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Check.

1037
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Altimeter.

1038
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Check.

1039
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Cylinder head temperature.

1040
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Check.

1041
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Flaps down.

1042
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Check.

1043
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Pilots go through a whole checklist before they take off.

1044
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Okay.

1045
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Well, you're a pilot too when you take off and go someplace.

1046
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
So before you take off from your house, go over your checklist just like a pilot.

1047
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
So the premise of this song is that you're a pilot when you leave the house.

1048
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:40,000
And you need to be prepared in the same way a pilot is with all your stuff, which I guess just means bring your wallet and keys.

1049
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Yeah.

1050
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Did this inspire the Adam Sandler song from that last special keys while at phone?

1051
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Perper house.

1052
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Or you think about checking for your keys while at phone.

1053
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
It's very possible.

1054
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
This is from a gruff.

1055
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Yeah, you stole it from a gruff.

1056
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Yeah.

1057
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Okay.

1058
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Let's do it.

1059
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Let's go through it.

1060
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Have you memorized your whole address in case you ever get in a mess?

1061
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
réal.

1062
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,000
The whole address of the city and state.

1063
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Did you practice that and get it straight?

1064
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Check.

1065
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Do you know your phone number, area code and all?

1066
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Whatever you are, you can just make a call.

1067
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Check.

1068
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Telephones, you know, come into style.

1069
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
It gets worse too.

1070
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Learn how to use a touchstone and a diamond.

1071
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Telephones come into style.

1072
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
You may need some change.

1073
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:40,000
So have you got a quarter to put in the payphone slot?

1074
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Check.

1075
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Two pilots are always better than one.

1076
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Are you taking a friend along on your run?

1077
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Check.

1078
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Do your parents know where you're going to be?

1079
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
And did you remember to take your keys?

1080
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Check.

1081
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I want to tell you one thing more.

1082
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
You're going out.

1083
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Did you lock the door?

1084
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Lock the door.

1085
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Check.

1086
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Am I doing it right?

1087
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Lock the door.

1088
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Lock the door.

1089
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Barney gumbling it, you know?

1090
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Yeah.

1091
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
He's hammered.

1092
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Yeah.

1093
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
He's drunk.

1094
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
McGruff, McGruff, you're drunk.

1095
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
McGruff, you're drunk.

1096
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I'm fine.

1097
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Fuck off.

1098
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Remember the style of the house you live in?

1099
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Mid-century or Gothic?

1100
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Rancher colonial split level by level.

1101
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
What kind of roof?

1102
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I do remember that was a big change when we had to start using our, for our younger listeners,

1103
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
when you had to start dialing the area code before your seven digit phone number.

1104
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:59,000
And then a change when phone calls stopped being 25 cents and started being 35 cents at a payphone.

1105
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
What a pain in the ass that was.

1106
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I vaguely remember that.

1107
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
They're stealing a dime from you.

1108
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
They're stealing the dime from us.

1109
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Like your mom.

1110
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
And that was the little cuts we used to have to deal with.

1111
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I remember the holidays where like, you know, the president, the outgoing president, it's like, well, he's mad at Iran's Revolutionary Guard.

1112
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And a month later, he's made of toilets who have to flush too many times.

1113
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
The world has changed since 1994.

1114
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
If he had focused on the toilets, I think he would have won reelection.

1115
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Yeah.

1116
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
There's always a winning message.

1117
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
They want us to get different light bulbs.

1118
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,000
He should have felt he needed to focus on being mad at toilets, light bulbs and Lady Gaga.

1119
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Lady Gaga too late.

1120
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:46,000
And then John Bon Jovi, he just that was so intriguing, but he should have been talking about Bon Jovi at every rally.

1121
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Yeah, I agree.

1122
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
And then McGruff, he was not very nice.

1123
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
We love our law enforcement, but McGruff was not nice to me.

1124
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
He's got a Messiah complex.

1125
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
He's got these children, these little kids.

1126
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
They walk around, they think he's God.

1127
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I did vote for him in 2016, though.

1128
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I thought a businessman shake things up.

1129
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
He ran his business as well.

1130
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I figured he'd do it.

1131
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
He'd do the same thing for the government.

1132
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I voted down ballot Republican every other race.

1133
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:25,000
But when I was with him until I was with him until covid.

1134
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I mean, everything else was great.

1135
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
The economy, fantastic.

1136
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
McGruff stocks were soaring.

1137
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
COVID though, I know I get it.

1138
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I would have put on a whole covid album.

1139
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Warning people what to do.

1140
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:54,000
It's time I present Trump because if I had lead time, I could have put out my covid album and none of this would have happened.

1141
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:01,000
If I had distributed emergency copies of McGruff says, don't get covid.

1142
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Let's talk about washing hands.

1143
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Got to start with six feet away.

1144
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Let's talk about indoor gatherings.

1145
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:15,000
But I can't go in the studio to record that and I can't set it up at home because I don't know computers.

1146
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I'm not a Pro Tools guy.

1147
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I never made the leap.

1148
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I need the studio, man.

1149
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I need an engineer.

1150
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
My nephew is good with that, but he will not come over.

1151
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Says we're supposed to stay at home.

1152
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Get out.

1153
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Get the covid germs out.

1154
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Get out.

1155
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:38,000
If you see a covid germ, tell it to go home.

1156
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
The scram, scram covid.

1157
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
You're not wanted here.

1158
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
But covid germs says he's supposed to be inside.

1159
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
He's got a package for you.

1160
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Tell him I've got your number.

1161
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
You're a germ.

1162
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Hey, it's me, covid germs.

1163
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I'm outside.

1164
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I just want to say I'm sorry for my early April release.

1165
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Herd immunity is the way to go.

1166
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
We didn't know much back then.

1167
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Sweden, Sweden was right for a while.

1168
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Look, Fauci changed his mind about the mask.

1169
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:19,000
So we're growth can't change his mind about stuff.

1170
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Oh, God.

1171
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
That's a good idea.

1172
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
The whole yes, the entire.

1173
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Well, maybe we'll see.

1174
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:35,000
And then just like the dark like now protests shouldn't do those either.

1175
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I don't make me mad seeing those on TV.

1176
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Oh, yeah. No, he doesn't like the protests.

1177
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
They're against his friends.

1178
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I haven't.

1179
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And I won't watch the NFL either.

1180
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I said it.

1181
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Oh, it's Sarah.

1182
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
The wall guys out NFL's out.

1183
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
He was friends with Reagan, folks.

1184
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Yeah, come on.

1185
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
We know where he stands.

1186
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
We know where he stands.

1187
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
The first half of the album is about wash your hands.

1188
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
And the second half of the album is about don't take a knee.

1189
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:17,000
And then the closers just Nixon shouldn't normalize shouldn't have normalized relations with China.

1190
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Still bad about it.

1191
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
It all goes back to tricky.

1192
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,000
The message out of there is very thick.

1193
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Oh, God.

1194
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
What are we 90 minutes?

1195
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Yeah, one hour.

1196
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Let's go back to the real the real deal, man.

1197
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I've lost my place.

1198
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:45,000
OK, this song is called Respect is a two way street.

1199
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,000
The Lincoln Project song experimental.

1200
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Listen to this beat.

1201
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Bring it back to Coram.

1202
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Respect is a two way street.

1203
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Show respect to everyone you meet.

1204
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I've been around and found this to be true.

1205
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Give respect and it'll be good right back to you.

1206
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Pretty good.

1207
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
That's a good little keyboard riff synth riff.

1208
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Consideration is the key.

1209
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It costs you nothing to give others courtesy.

1210
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Put yourself in their shoes.

1211
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Life is better when respect is what you choose.

1212
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Respect is a two way street.

1213
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Show respect to everyone you meet.

1214
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I've been around and found this to be true.

1215
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
What kind of world.

1216
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Hi, it's me, McGruff.

1217
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
It's OK.

1218
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Your tape recorder is not broken.

1219
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
That's the sound of something going wrong.

1220
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Wrong.

1221
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Now, McGruff here.

1222
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
That's what happened.

1223
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
That was the most Robert Evans delivery I've ever heard.

1224
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Wrong.

1225
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Wrong.

1226
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Wrong.

1227
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
All right.

1228
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
It was also kind of bug.

1229
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
That's what happened.

1230
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Oh yeah, yeah.

1231
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
There is nothing wrong with your stereo cassette.

1232
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
It happens to people who get hooked on drugs.

1233
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
And drugs are a real hook, like a fish hook.

1234
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Once most people get hooked, they can't get free again.

1235
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Just like a fish.

1236
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Some kids you know, even some kids you like, may offer drugs to you.

1237
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
They may even give them to you free.

1238
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Why should they give them to you free?

1239
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Well, two reasons.

1240
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
One, misery loves company.

1241
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
They're hooked and they want you to be hooked too.

1242
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
The other reason is this.

1243
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Once you're hooked, they can sell you drugs.

1244
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
They know that.

1245
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
They seem just like the other kids you know, but they're pushers.

1246
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
When someone offers you drugs, think of a big sharp hook.

1247
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Drugs are a hook as sharp as it can be.

1248
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Drugs are a hook that never lets you free.

1249
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Drugs are a hook, you know what hooks can do.

1250
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Drugs are a hook, they're not for kids like you.

1251
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Drugs are a hook, and any kid who's smart says I'll pass up the hook.

1252
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Cause I don't wanna start.

1253
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
That's right, you're right.

1254
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
That's right, drugs are a hook.

1255
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Okay kids, let's play the song.

1256
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
The whole little game.

1257
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
What's a little tiny river?

1258
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
That's a brook.

1259
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Not a hook.

1260
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Who makes food in pots and pans?

1261
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
That's a crook.

1262
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Not a hook.

1263
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Alright, this is off game.

1264
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Who's the guy police arrest?

1265
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
That's a crook.

1266
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Not a hook.

1267
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
What's something that you read?

1268
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
That's a book.

1269
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Not a hook.

1270
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
What catches fish and catches kids?

1271
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
That's a hook.

1272
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Look out!

1273
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Drugs are a hook, as sharp as it can be.

1274
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Drugs are a hook, that never lets you free.

1275
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Drugs are a hook, you know what hooks can do.

1276
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Drugs are a hook, they're not for kids like you.

1277
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Alright, that's a hook.

1278
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Drugs are a hook.

1279
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
With another confusing game.

1280
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Who wrote Citizen Kane?

1281
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
That's a mink.

1282
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Not a hook.

1283
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
That's right.

1284
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Where you get your money from.

1285
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
That's a thing.

1286
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
My mom's wallet, dime at a time.

1287
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
No, you go to jail now.

1288
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
No!

1289
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Don't hit me!

1290
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
For crux in charge, you want to end up like Specter?

1291
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Then fall in line.

1292
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:25,000
This is why California's three strike law needs to go nationwide.

1293
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I'm running for DA of Los Angeles.

1294
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Just had those elections, but I don't care.

1295
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I'm running, I'm doing my own election now.

1296
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I'm going after this reformer.

1297
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Stop the steal.

1298
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Stop the vote.

1299
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I'm throwing myself in there.

1300
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
What's Joe Biden?

1301
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
That's a crook.

1302
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
That's right.

1303
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Well, he heisted an election.

1304
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Hunter's laptop is a thing to look at.

1305
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Tony Bobolinski is a good man.

1306
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Everything Rudy does is perfect.

1307
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
It's off game.

1308
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
We said he doesn't like Trump.

1309
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Alright, I'm exhausted.

1310
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
He doesn't like it.

1311
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
He didn't vote for him, but he believes in the fraud.

1312
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Yeah, he believes in the fraud.

1313
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
That's how it is.

1314
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:35,000
No, just because I didn't vote for him doesn't mean millions of upstanding Americans.

1315
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
They did.

1316
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Reagan won with 48 states.

1317
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
So did Donald.

1318
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Drugs are a hook.

1319
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Drugs are a hook.

1320
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
All drugs.

1321
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Imagine all the types of drugs you can think of.

1322
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Put them all in a pile and watch them all turn into one giant hook.

1323
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:01,000
But then the hook is going to get you and multiple people.

1324
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
It's not different hooks for different friends.

1325
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
It's again, the message is confusing.

1326
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
If this were on Smart Kids, the message would be very clear.

1327
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
But it's not.

1328
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
There's some tidiness to that.

1329
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Those are really polished tweets.

1330
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
There's not a word wasted.

1331
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Like a good sketch, you know what it's about from the first two lines.

1332
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
And that's what every song on Smart Kids does.

1333
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,000
And I understand you want to get crazier and more experimental.

1334
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
And that's what he's doing.

1335
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Again, this is his sign of the times.

1336
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
It's a big sprawling effort.

1337
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Right.

1338
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Many, many songs.

1339
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
But maybe it would have been smarter in a way to tighten.

1340
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
I don't know.

1341
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
But yes, sometimes.

1342
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Yeah, there are double albums that should have, could have been killer single albums.

1343
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Yeah. Yes.

1344
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
And this might be this is four albums that maybe could have been one.

1345
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Okay.

1346
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I would take I do think there's a strong album in here.

1347
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Which I would, with all my problems, I would put Drugs Are A Hook on the main album.

1348
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I would put Wishes or Wish.

1349
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Wishes.

1350
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
There was one.

1351
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Or Wish. I'm sorry. Yeah, it was Wish.

1352
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I mean, all the ones where he sounds drunk, I would put on the main album.

1353
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Right, of course.

1354
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
And the least, the less McGruff there is, it's not making the tight, the Scott cut down.

1355
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
It's got to have more McGruff.

1356
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
That's obviously, he's the star.

1357
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Yeah.

1358
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Not the protegees.

1359
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
This song is called Map and a Plan.

1360
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Ken, he's like obsessed with like planning before you leave the house.

1361
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
That's one of the top issues.

1362
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
This again, second song about it.

1363
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Let's talk about you taking a trip on your own.

1364
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
It's a trip.

1365
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Away from home. Maybe even outside the neighborhood.

1366
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
How do you do it?

1367
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
With a plan and a map.

1368
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
A plan is an idea of where you're going to go.

1369
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
And a map is how you're going to get there.

1370
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
You could draw a map yourself.

1371
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Or just draw it in your head.

1372
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
A plan and a map.

1373
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
That's the way to go.

1374
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
How to explore the Florida.

1375
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
How to explore the Florida trap.

1376
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
With a plan.

1377
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
This is on the cut down.

1378
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
This is on the director's cut.

1379
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
How is the motor landing done by man?

1380
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
With a map.

1381
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
And a plan.

1382
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
How does a bear find a place for a nap?

1383
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
With a plan.

1384
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
And a map.

1385
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
How does a bear find a place to nap?

1386
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
With a map and a plan?

1387
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Does a bear have a plan?

1388
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Don't you think it's instinct?

1389
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Sorry, I mean smart bears like the ones I know.

1390
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Like Smokey.

1391
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Just because McGruff is a hyper intelligent anthropomorphic animal doesn't mean most bears are.

1392
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Most bears I think are doing their things on instinct.

1393
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
All animals are born choosers.

1394
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
And some choose to talk and be smart.

1395
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
And others choose to be owned by humans.

1396
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
And it's their choice.

1397
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
McGruff, that's problematic.

1398
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do that.

1399
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do that Historically.

1400
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do that.

1401
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do that.

1402
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do that.

1403
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
McGruff, that's problematic.

1404
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Shut up!

1405
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
McGruff, you're drunk!

1406
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I don't care!

1407
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
All dogs could be cops if they just were motivated and didn't quit like me.

1408
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
All dogs could be cops if they just were motivated and didn't quit like me.

1409
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
All dogs could be cops if they just were motivated and didn't quit like me.

1410
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Alright, that's the gist of a map and a plan.

1411
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
This next song is called Lock It.

1412
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Another kind of ballad.

1413
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
But there might be a change.

1414
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
That's nice.

1415
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
That's nice.

1416
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
That's nice.

1417
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I will say, he does a lot more crooning

1418
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
on this album, which I can appreciate.

1419
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
He's crooning a lot, which he doesn't do on Smart Kids.

1420
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
He's crooning a lot, which he doesn't do on Smart Kids.

1421
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
So I appreciate that he's trying up a different vocal call.

1422
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
So I appreciate that he's trying up a different call.

1423
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
He can do, I'd like to see him do a Seth McFarlane-style standards album also.

1424
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
He can do, I'd like to see him do a Seth McFarlane-style standards album also.

1425
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
None of it's about safety.

1426
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
None of it's about safety.

1427
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
It's just pure standards.

1428
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
He could throw in and be like,

1429
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
He could throw in and be like,

1430
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
I got you under my skin,

1431
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
but make sure it's not an infection.

1432
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Make sure you got an ointment.

1433
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Make sure you got an ointment.

1434
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Like he could add things to the classics

1435
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
that he could add.

1436
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Anyway, right back at Lockheed.

1437
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
He starts, baby, it's cold outside,

1438
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
and then stops it, then it slows down.

1439
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
There's nothing wrong with your tape machine,

1440
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
but some songs are problematic

1441
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
by today's standards.

1442
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I always check a Christmas standard

1443
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
to see if it fits today's

1444
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
times or not.

1445
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I didn't hire

1446
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
a new partner because I didn't want to

1447
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
subject someone to that.

1448
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Oh.

1449
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Uh, uh,

1450
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
okay, wait, hold on, lock it.

1451
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Traffic noise, when it rains outside,

1452
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
it's okay with you,

1453
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
cause there's lots inside,

1454
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
for you to do.

1455
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
That's true.

1456
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Yeah.

1457
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Home is the place

1458
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
with the cozy bed

1459
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
and a pillow to rest

1460
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
your sleeping.

1461
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I'll fast forward a little bit.

1462
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
What?

1463
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
When you come in,

1464
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
lock the door,

1465
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
just lock the door.

1466
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
That's what it's for,

1467
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
just lock the door.

1468
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
It only takes a minute then out.

1469
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
That sucks.

1470
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Just lock the door,

1471
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
as hard as a rock.

1472
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Just lock it tight

1473
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
with all of your might.

1474
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Lock it up,

1475
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
it only takes a minute,

1476
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
it guards your home and

1477
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
everything that's in it.

1478
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Especially you.

1479
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
And once you're inside, pick up the phone and check with your folks.

1480
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Or phone a neighbor your folks really trust.

1481
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
If somebody rings the bell or knocks,

1482
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
don't open the door unless it's somebody

1483
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
your parents say is okay.

1484
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
So that's like a

1485
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
band on the run where it has a big change

1486
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
in the music.

1487
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
It starts out

1488
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
a different vibe.

1489
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
I'd put it

1490
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
on the best.

1491
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I like the start.

1492
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I like the ballad-y start.

1493
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Let's see here.

1494
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Sorry, I'm trying to roll through these stranger...

1495
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
So many of these songs are like,

1496
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
hey kids, we know you're curious and

1497
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
you're wide-eyed about the world.

1498
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Knock that shit off!

1499
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Be afraid of drugs

1500
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
and what's under the sink

1501
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
and what lies outside

1502
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
of a locked door.

1503
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Have you ever thought

1504
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
what's in your closet at night?

1505
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Think about it

1506
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
really hard.

1507
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Could it be a monster

1508
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
or a murderer?

1509
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Think about it really hard.

1510
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Basements are

1511
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
easy to sneak into

1512
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
and from there,

1513
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
somebody would just have to drill

1514
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
a hole in your closet

1515
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
and then they could be there for days

1516
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
and you wouldn't know.

1517
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
It's easy to drill a circle under your bed

1518
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
and have the bed drop out

1519
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
under the house.

1520
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
You've seen cartoons.

1521
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
It could happen right now

1522
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
at this very moment.

1523
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Any tunnel that you see could just be

1524
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
a painting on a brick wall.

1525
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Am I even the real McGruff?

1526
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Someone could have killed me

1527
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
and replaced me and given you bad information.

1528
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Trust your neighbors.

1529
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
You've got to think about it.

1530
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Trust your neighbors and let's say, call in the phone.

1531
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Then make sure to lie to them and tell them

1532
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
no matter what hour of the day,

1533
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
your mom is in the shower

1534
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
and can't come to the phone.

1535
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
I'm talking to you little Jason Sheridan.

1536
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Be afraid of the world.

1537
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
It's all scary out here.

1538
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
When you have to do laundry as an adult,

1539
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
you're going to get freaked the fuck out.

1540
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Your whole week is going to be shot.

1541
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
You're going to cancel all your plans.

1542
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Just cause of laundry.

1543
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Laundry is a scary thing.

1544
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
When it's time to get rid of objects,

1545
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
make sure to really work yourself

1546
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
into a nice lather.

1547
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
I'm going to be a good boy.

1548
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I'm going to be a good boy.

1549
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I'm going to be a good boy.

1550
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Make sure you get into a nice lather.

1551
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Each one is important.

1552
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
It earned its way into your life.

1553
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
You're just going to throw it away?

1554
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
If the object goes, the memory is gone.

1555
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
The object has a brain and feelings.

1556
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Think about its feelings before you throw it away.

1557
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Would you throw away your mom?

1558
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Marie Kondo can do nothing to assuage your fears

1559
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
and intrusive thoughts.

1560
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
If there's something you got at a carnival

1561
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
like 12 years ago,

1562
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
first watch Toy Story

1563
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
and realize that inanimate things

1564
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
have very complex arcs

1565
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
and emotions.

1566
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
But when you're older,

1567
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
just make sure you learn the difference between

1568
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
the toy and the man the toy is based on.

1569
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
And just to be clear,

1570
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
just to be clear,

1571
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
you're going to be a good boy.

1572
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
You're going to be a good boy.

1573
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
You're going to be a good boy.

1574
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Just to be clear.

1575
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
This is not Buzz Lightyear the toy.

1576
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
The real man.

1577
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Don't get confused

1578
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
by actor's tweets.

1579
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Assume that they mean

1580
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
that they're tweeting about a movie

1581
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
about a man who a toy is based on.

1582
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
If you don't understand

1583
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
what an actor is saying, just assume

1584
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
they're telling you to vote.

1585
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
When will we get the movie

1586
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
called Ham

1587
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
based on the pig

1588
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
that the toy Ham

1589
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
was based on in Toy Story

1590
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
not starring John Ratzenberg?

1591
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
American hero John Ratzenberg

1592
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
starring Chris Hemsworth.

1593
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Lightyear opens a can of worms.

1594
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
A great can.

1595
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Leave the can open

1596
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
and let every worm out.

1597
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Look at them crawl.

1598
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Cans and the sequel to Cans Worms.

1599
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
This isn't about the worm.

1600
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
This is about the can that the worm

1601
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
came out of.

1602
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Oh Lord.

1603
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
This is why we can only do

1604
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
how many more on this.

1605
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
We have like 30 songs left.

1606
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Well, how many more on this

1607
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
one?

1608
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Yeah. Well, how many more on this

1609
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
tape? Two songs are left

1610
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
on here. Okay.

1611
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Then what? And then how much would that

1612
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
leave us with

1613
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
four? There would be enough

1614
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
that they could be a hearty

1615
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
enough stew if we did a McGruff

1616
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
three, right? We wouldn't leave

1617
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
either side too thin. For sure. There would

1618
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
be a hearty enough stew.

1619
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Hearty stew. McGruff's

1620
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
favorite food. I also. Yeah.

1621
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Oh no, I lost the playlist on my

1622
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
test. It got deleted.

1623
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Be careful. Learn how to

1624
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
be computer smart.

1625
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
It's here. I also. Look.

1626
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Also, there is also.

1627
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I'll say right now.

1628
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
I got something else too that I haven't even

1629
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
revealed for this episode.

1630
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Well, if that's the case. If that's the

1631
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
case, I think the two songs

1632
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
and your big reveal, that sounds like

1633
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
maybe the home stretch.

1634
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
To me.

1635
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
I think probably that's right.

1636
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Because I'll be honest, I'm exhausted.

1637
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Yeah. Yeah. No kidding.

1638
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
From smiling too

1639
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
much.

1640
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
From tapping our toes and from

1641
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
clapping to answer McGruff's

1642
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
game questions. This has been

1643
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
a big physical effort.

1644
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Right. So.

1645
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Yeah. So I guess. I guess

1646
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
McGruff three. It doesn't have to

1647
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
be a year from now. We can also say that.

1648
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
We could do it in a few months. Yeah.

1649
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
And I'm still trying to see if we can

1650
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
get smart kids

1651
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
interview with the guy who made smart kids.

1652
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
So where did that land? You got

1653
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
the name. This ended up being a false flag,

1654
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
but it got us to a different album, which we

1655
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
will get to. So that's good. But then the

1656
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
smart kids guy

1657
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
is who. Right. You don't have to say the name,

1658
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
but what do we know?

1659
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
We just. All we know is in a YouTube

1660
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
comment, someone said, this is my dad who

1661
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
wrote the album and put a name there.

1662
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Whoa. So we have a name

1663
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
now. Somebody pointed this. Somebody emailed

1664
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
this to us actually as well. And I'm forgetting

1665
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
and I apologize for not shouting you

1666
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
out. I will thank you

1667
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
in an email and then I mean, I can

1668
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
shout you out on the McGruff three.

1669
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
If you've got any McGruff related

1670
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
tips, email podcast,

1671
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
the riot and gmail dot com

1672
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
subject line.

1673
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Smart tips for good boys.

1674
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
I'm sure I said this on

1675
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
the other McGruff

1676
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
episode, but I called the National Crime

1677
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Prevention Council.

1678
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Maybe I didn't.

1679
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I called them because it still exists. It's

1680
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
very confusing what it is. I don't know

1681
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
if it's like government funded, but it's like

1682
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
they still technically own McGruff. So they

1683
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
license McGruff out like he was on an insurance

1684
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
commercial in the last couple of years.

1685
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
And it's unclear

1686
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
exactly what it is. And if

1687
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
it's like, I guess Trump didn't cut the National

1688
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Crime Prevention Council because

1689
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
there's still one person sitting in an office because I

1690
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
emailed them and it was tough. And I called

1691
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
somebody on the phone. I was like, hey, I'm looking

1692
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,000
for, there was an album McGruff had in the 80s.

1693
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
And I'm looking

1694
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
for maybe like some information about it

1695
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
and maybe who wrote it or put it together.

1696
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
And the person,

1697
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
it didn't sound like a very old person,

1698
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
but just for comedy's sake, I was like,

1699
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
this is sort of the vibe. Oh,

1700
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
that album, eh?

1701
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Hmm. I remember

1702
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
that. You know,

1703
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I'm not quite sure.

1704
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
I do

1705
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
remember it was someone who lived maybe

1706
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
in Florida.

1707
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
And I was like, okay, thank

1708
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
you. But I'm not sure. I'm really

1709
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
not sure. And I'm like, don't you have

1710
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
any, where are, like, what

1711
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
is this organization that's basically

1712
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
all McGruff? It was like

1713
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
started because of McGruff, which

1714
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I guess maybe we can get into that on McGruff32.

1715
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
We'll do some more investigating there and

1716
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
figure out what the National Crime Prevention Council

1717
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
was or is.

1718
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
I'm sure that's interesting.

1719
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
It's now Trump's last hope

1720
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
to overturn the election. They're the

1721
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
one body. Yes.

1722
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
This is giving me hope.

1723
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Do you guys know about this Reply

1724
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
All episode from

1725
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
really early in 2020

1726
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
where it

1727
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
started out with a guy was trying

1728
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
to, like, tell someone of a song.

1729
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
And it's like, what's this song?

1730
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
And he really remembers a lot of it

1731
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
in the melody and stuff. And he sings it

1732
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
and he cannot track it down.

1733
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
And they eventually

1734
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
contact the Reply

1735
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
All producers and hosts

1736
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
and they start trying to track it

1737
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
down. And then it just spirals

1738
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
and it is fascinating.

1739
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Like, I was, like, sitting in my car

1740
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
waiting for the conclude. Like, I was supposed

1741
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
I was, like, a little

1742
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
early for a thing I had to go to. And I

1743
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
was like, I cannot leave this car until I

1744
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
find the conclusion of this. It's

1745
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
one of the best podcasts I've heard all year.

1746
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Yeah.

1747
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
We'll see. Maybe it'll unfold.

1748
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Maybe we'll become embroiled in

1749
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
some sort of controversy, like

1750
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
incidents, controversy, who knows?

1751
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
McGruff 3, McGruff 4, McGruff

1752
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
5?

1753
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
McGruff 10, in remembrance

1754
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
of Michael.

1755
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Our friend passed away in pursuit of

1756
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
the McGruff mask.

1757
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
He got too close. McGruff

1758
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
7, Michael in Hell.

1759
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And then Michael

1760
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
takes Manhattan. The underworld. I'm in the underworld.

1761
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
You're in the underworld. It's real now.

1762
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
So, yeah.

1763
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
So there's a lot of meat left on the bone.

1764
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I will also say, and I'm, people have

1765
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
noticed, obviously, we've done some live

1766
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
streams. I now, of course, have

1767
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
a full McGruff puppet

1768
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
that was given to me by Andrew Grissom.

1769
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Which is just

1770
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
the most, one of the finest

1771
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
gifts I've ever received.

1772
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
And if you haven't seen these live streams,

1773
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
I'm sure I'll do it

1774
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
again at some point. It's so great.

1775
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I got to, I was working in an

1776
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
office and Andrew showed up.

1777
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Yeah, he just like kind of made a noise by

1778
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
the door. And then I looked up

1779
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
and then I saw the puppet just move

1780
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
into the door frame.

1781
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Peer in. It was a

1782
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
really exciting moment.

1783
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
What? Yeah, this is,

1784
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
the puppet is from a school.

1785
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Somebody just stole it from a school

1786
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
and just put it on eBay.

1787
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
So, and he's missing a shoe. He has

1788
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
one shoe, but he does have cool plaid pants.

1789
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Yeah. Oh, wow. That's very,

1790
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
that's like Rodney Dangerfield caddyshack

1791
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
pants.

1792
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Yeah, that's a very good point. You can take the coat off.

1793
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
The coat is removable. Wow.

1794
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Wow. Have you taken it off?

1795
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Show.

1796
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
You've seen what he looks like with that. Check it out. Yeah.

1797
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I just did a bit with him on a

1798
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
show online and I took the coat off and put a

1799
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Tom Petty shirt on him. Oh, wow.

1800
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
This is really disturbing. He's looking hunky.

1801
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
This is,

1802
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
if someone makes a puppet likeness

1803
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
of you, don't strip it.

1804
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
It's not fair.

1805
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I got no shirt on.

1806
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
What are you going to do about it?

1807
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Is this one of your wishes?

1808
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Phone smart.

1809
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I gotta

1810
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
be phone smart.

1811
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
The pants don't come off.

1812
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
So I guess I can post this. Yeah.

1813
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
They don't come off for you guys.

1814
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Not cheap.

1815
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Phone smart.

1816
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
So that's the most fun thing.

1817
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Kids, if Kweiluds were still around, I'd have

1818
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
to warn you about them, but they're not.

1819
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
So I'll just tell you I had a great

1820
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
time with them.

1821
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
To as I say, not as I do.

1822
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Can I throw out some, here's something

1823
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
actually not McGruff related,

1824
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
but close enough, I think, that you could use

1825
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
the email subject line,

1826
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Smart Tips for Good Boys.

1827
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Have I ever said this on the show that

1828
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
twice in my life,

1829
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I saw a school

1830
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
assembly, there was an anti-drug

1831
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
thing, there was a bunch of puppets

1832
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
and mascots, and that it culminated

1833
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
in a big vulture

1834
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
using his wings

1835
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
like a trench coat and revealing

1836
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
lots of baggies and needles.

1837
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:53,000
I moved schools at some point in elementary school, so I got to see this twice at two of the schools.

1838
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
And I have, like that's one of those, like the song

1839
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,000
You Can't Place, I don't have enough to go off, but

1840
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
it seems possible, and

1841
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:09,000
to remind you, I grew up in Southern California, if that helps, if this was a California thing.

1842
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:15,000
But if you have a faint memory in your life of seeing a vulture

1843
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:21,000
opening wings that were full of baggies and needles clipped to the wings.

1844
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Wow.

1845
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
It was about, I know it was about like a chipper girl

1846
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,000
who wanted to join, not the police, but some kind of squad,

1847
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,000
like of helping kids say no or something.

1848
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Amazing McGruff wasn't part of this, but like it was something like,

1849
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I want to be part of the Be Smart Squad!

1850
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:43,000
And this vulture showed up and said,

1851
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Hey, so you want to be part of the squad, huh?

1852
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I'm the last test. The final test is you got to take one of these things.

1853
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,000
And then she said, well, if that's the test, then I'm not going to do it.

1854
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I don't want to be part of the squad anymore.

1855
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
And she cried and the vulture left.

1856
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
And then friendlier puppets came up and said,

1857
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,000
He was a liar! That wasn't, he's not with us!

1858
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
You passed the test!

1859
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
This is first grade. This might be one of the most vivid memories of

1860
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,000
the first seven years of my life.

1861
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
That has to be like a tour.

1862
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Like unless that was completely just put together by your school,

1863
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
that had to be like a touring.

1864
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
It was absolutely touring because if it was at two schools,

1865
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
then in different years.

1866
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,000
And I remember the second time, it must have been years, it was more like 93, 94.

1867
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
And I remember going into an assembly, not knowing what it was.

1868
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
And then like, it's this again?

1869
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,000
I'm seeing the vulture, the drug vulture again.

1870
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:44,000
So if you have any, if any of that rings a bell, vulture, baggies, please help me.

1871
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,000
I've been like, I've been losing my mind about that one forever.

1872
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Somebody has to have a videotape of that.

1873
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Like they had to have done like a demo of it too.

1874
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Maybe you have like them doing it in a warehouse to present.

1875
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Oh, to see like, yeah, do you want this to come to your school?

1876
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Here's an example of what it is.

1877
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Yeah. Wow. We had, yeah.

1878
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,000
I mean, we had stuff that nothing is memorable as that, but like,

1879
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,000
there were definitely people, we had a man that had,

1880
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,000
that had lost his arms that played guitar with his feet.

1881
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Like Mr. Show.

1882
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
That got to school. Whoa.

1883
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
What's that? Like Mr. Show.

1884
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Yes. Yeah. Yes.

1885
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,000
So like, then I know he did the rounds.

1886
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
We had a guy, there was a guy, I think he's passed away.

1887
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
His name is Richard Lederer.

1888
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
And he would, he would like just, he had like a lot, he would be like,

1889
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,000
why do you park in a driveway and drive in a parkway?

1890
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Like he had like all these like, this was like for seventh and eighth grade.

1891
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
And I think my memory is that my friend,

1892
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
we found his email address and my friend just started sending a mean email.

1893
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
That makes me think of when I was in eighth grade,

1894
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
we all, all the eighth graders got called to the auditorium and the principal

1895
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,000
gave us a lecture about being role models for the younger kids.

1896
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
And then sent us back to class.

1897
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,000
And I just remember talking to my friends and like asking teachers too,

1898
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:03,000
like, Hey, what was that? Why? Why did that? What, what happened?

1899
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Like, like I was the smart alec kid and, but, and,

1900
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
and I was mostly interested in eighth grade.

1901
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:14,000
I was mostly interested in Mark Wade flash comics, but I do,

1902
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,000
I did like, you know, kind of know everyone.

1903
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Like I knew what was going on and I was like, what ha what inspired,

1904
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
why do we have to do that?

1905
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Did you find out? No, I never got a clear answer.

1906
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
And I don't know if people,

1907
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
it was just general rough housing or something going on,

1908
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,000
but like, I have no idea still to this day why that happened.

1909
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Yeah.

1910
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Aaron, my wife was in an assembly one time in middle school where there was a

1911
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,000
yearbook where that the first page of the yearbook had like a guy who was

1912
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:54,000
shaped like a star and he's just like standing really splayed out with a huge

1913
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,000
smile, like I'm the star guy.

1914
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:02,000
And people very quickly started drawing big boners on the star guy.

1915
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:07,000
And I think maybe she didn't have that information when she went to this

1916
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,000
assembly, like quickly everybody in the room that we got to have a thing.

1917
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
And, and the principal, there's like a long,

1918
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,000
long speech just like pacing back and forth.

1919
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
And it's just, it becomes a general assembly about like not writing

1920
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
offensive things in your yearbook.

1921
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
And this, you will not believe in 2020 that this happened in a school,

1922
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:31,000
that the principal of the school points to Aaron in the front row,

1923
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
arbitrarily, we didn't do anything wrong.

1924
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
It points to Aaron, looks her in the eyes and says,

1925
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:40,000
how would you feel if I went up to you and I pointed at you and I said,

1926
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
you're gay.

1927
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Jail, jail to that.

1928
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Yes, to jail immediately.

1929
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
News story trending on Twitter.

1930
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Stripped, stripped of badge and gun, principal badge and gun.

1931
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I think this was a nun by the way.

1932
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Wow. Really?

1933
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:02,000
So probably stripped of whatever you are following this.

1934
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
You know, you're fucked cause they only answered to God's law.

1935
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
So it's like international waters.

1936
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
He pardons. Yes.

1937
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Yeah.

1938
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
And his law changes, you know, the Pope, that's crazy.

1939
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
The Pope has changed though.

1940
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
You know, he's the God's law changes. God reconsider things.

1941
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Oh yeah. He kind of reevaluate. Yeah. Every seven years.

1942
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Anyway, he's just one of us, you know, he's just learning too.

1943
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
It's just a stranger out of us.

1944
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
That's right.

1945
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
That's what I was going with there.

1946
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
All right. Okay.

1947
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,000
See, I'm glad we could like spit, you know, like splay out a little bit,

1948
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,000
like the star man to stretch and we don't feel like we have to get to all these

1949
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
songs, but we do need to finish the album.

1950
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Certainly. Yes.

1951
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
So what's left?

1952
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
We have two songs left.

1953
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Two song on a car.

1954
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
This one is called Stranger Danger.

1955
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Okay. Like that.

1956
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Hear that? It's a warning buzzer.

1957
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,000
If you've learned the right stuff from a gruff, a little warning should go off in

1958
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
your mind whenever something doesn't seem right.

1959
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
So Jason, that's what goes off in your head when laundry is coming due.

1960
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I got to say, I hate whenever a song has like a car horn or police sirens in it.

1961
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:17,000
It's because if you listen to it when you're driving, you know.

1962
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Yeah. And that curb your enthusiasm where there's a commercial with honking in it

1963
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
on the radio.

1964
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Oh yeah.

1965
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Same deal. Yeah.

1966
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Yeah.

1967
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Okay. Let's see how the buzzer works for this kid.

1968
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:33,000
A nice looking man at the park says to him, I've got an extra candy bar here.

1969
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Would you like it?

1970
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:42,000
No, the gruff told me about people who offer candy or toys or something to kids.

1971
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,000
I've got to get someplace safe fast.

1972
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Hey kid, where are you going?

1973
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
There's a lady with kids.

1974
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Lady, that man back there tried to give me candy.

1975
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Good thinking. You can run someplace near like a store and you can speak to a clerk or owner.

1976
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:04,000
If you're not near a store or a firehouse or a school, run to a mother with children.

1977
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Not necessarily.

1978
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Can you help me find the police station?

1979
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Grownups don't ask kids for directions. No.

1980
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Grownups ask grownups for directions. Bad strangers ask kids.

1981
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,000
And they ask for places that seem okay.

1982
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,000
As a kid, you'll never get asked for directions. I want you to remember that.

1983
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
That's something I didn't learn as a kid.

1984
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Wrong.

1985
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:31,000
There's got to be a scenario where you get asked for directions as a kid.

1986
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
I get asked for directions all the time.

1987
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:38,000
I think they just see me and they're like, well, he's five foot nothing.

1988
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:42,000
I feel like since I was very young, they're like, well, he's not a threat.

1989
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,000
I could easily beat up that. Is that a man?

1990
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
What did you say? Kids ask you for directions?

1991
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Kids, adults, whatever.

1992
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
I feel like I'm always getting asked for directions.

1993
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,000
You're saying kids aren't afraid of you because you're a shorter gentleman?

1994
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Anyone. I just feel like.

1995
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
All right. Well, let's continue here.

1996
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Station or firehouse or school.

1997
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Don't talk to them. Walk away.

1998
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Walk away. And if a stranger gets out of the car, run someplace safe.

1999
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Listen.

2000
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Yeah?

2001
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
So long, Susan.

2002
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Susan is outside of school waiting for her mother to pick her up.

2003
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Then a woman who's been watching her comes up to her.

2004
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Susan, there you are. Your mother sent me to get you. Your father is very sick.

2005
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:29,000
She knows my name, but she's a stranger.

2006
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
I'm going into school to tell a teacher about this.

2007
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
No, don't touch me. You're a stranger.

2008
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:42,000
She knew Susan's name because she heard the other kids call her Susan and her name's on her book bag too.

2009
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Mothers don't send strangers to pick up their children.

2010
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:50,000
This was one of the top three fears in my head as a kid.

2011
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:56,000
I was fully prepared for constant strangers knowing my name,

2012
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,000
so much so that we had a secret code word between my parent, my mom and I,

2013
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:10,000
that the stranger would know if she actually had to send a stranger to pick me up.

2014
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
In case it does come to that.

2015
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Yes.

2016
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Yes. Which of course, why would it ever come like...

2017
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Look, my parents don't know so many people, I guess.

2018
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Yeah.

2019
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,000
There has to be one that I go, oh, I know. Yeah, that's my grandparents.

2020
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,000
That's a friend of theirs who's been to the house before.

2021
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Yeah.

2022
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
That's my uncle or something.

2023
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
The stranger had walked up to you and just said, fear.

2024
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Oh, I can go with them. They knew the code word.

2025
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,000
The code is fear.

2026
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Okay, but this, don't worry, this gets musical.

2027
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Your mother would.

2028
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I think. Let's just remember it.

2029
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
There we go.

2030
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Don't say anything to a stranger.

2031
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
She's like putting on the ritz or something.

2032
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Stay away from folks you don't know.

2033
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Updated version.

2034
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Don't go any place with a stranger who loves taco.

2035
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Just how to know I won't go.

2036
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
The instrument sounds so much cheaper than Smart Kids 2.

2037
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:16,000
It sounds like they just bought the cheapest Casio.

2038
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
And that's what all this stuff is being recorded with.

2039
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Yeah, that's what I mean.

2040
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,000
It was still in the era of good instrumentation, Smart Kids.

2041
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Right.

2042
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Yeah.

2043
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Don't ever take a thing from a stranger.

2044
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Either a woman or a man.

2045
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Doesn't matter.

2046
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Get away quick from a stranger.

2047
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Run off as fast as you can.

2048
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Stay far away from a stranger.

2049
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
I mean, that's the kind of rambly.

2050
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
All these are very rambly.

2051
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
It's like can tighten up, tighten up.

2052
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Yeah, we're getting thinner and like what the danger is for sure.

2053
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Right.

2054
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:09,000
So yeah, I guess then we get to the last song, which is called the Knock Knock song.

2055
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Which is not the No No song, a song we like a lot.

2056
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,000
But yeah, this is called the Knock Knock song.

2057
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I walk through the schoolyard ten feet tall.

2058
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Nobody bothers me at all.

2059
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,000
I feel good with all my might.

2060
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Cause I'm right, I'm right, always right.

2061
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
You can be right too.

2062
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
If you learn everything on this tape.

2063
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
I like this tune.

2064
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Let's play the Knock Knock game and see how right we can get.

2065
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I can't game though.

2066
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
One knock for right.

2067
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
And two knocks for wrong.

2068
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
OK, first question.

2069
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
When you're home alone, you should always lock the door.

2070
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Right.

2071
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
How many knocks?

2072
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Sure.

2073
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
It's the best way to take care of your home and yourself.

2074
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:57,000
If a stranger offers you candy, he's very generous.

2075
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Wrong.

2076
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
You bet it's wrong.

2077
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Take off fast and tell someone about it.

2078
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Drugs are open.

2079
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
It's a little generous.

2080
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
You get a lot of candy.

2081
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Right.

2082
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,000
You've never been more right.

2083
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,000
I'm as right as a tail on a kite.

2084
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
I'm as right as a tail on a kite.

2085
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I'm as right as the stars at night.

2086
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
I'm as right as a bright light on sight.

2087
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:21,000
I'm so right, I'm right out of sight.

2088
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
OK, let's get this one right.

2089
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Respect is something you just give your parents.

2090
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Wrong.

2091
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I'll say it's wrong.

2092
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Don't forget to also show respect to teachers, police officers.

2093
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Wait, hold on.

2094
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
I thought he was making a complicated problem.

2095
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:40,000
I thought he was making a complicated idea there, which was maybe like your parents might not be good people.

2096
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:47,000
But I think what he was saying there was not just your parents, less than any adult that's a teacher.

2097
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:52,000
I don't think he was saying like your parents need to earn your respect just like anyone else.

2098
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,000
But that's not I don't think what he was saying, unless I'm wrong.

2099
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:06,000
I think that's probably too nuanced, but also it does raise the question of like, well, wait, like police and teachers and firemen are also strangers to a certain extent.

2100
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Well, that's too complicated.

2101
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Too complicated.

2102
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Don't introduce that into a song, you know, you got to get it still got to be like catchy.

2103
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
This is the thing.

2104
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I'll say it's wrong.

2105
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Don't forget to also show respect to teachers, police officers and of course, old folks.

2106
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
In fact, show respect to everyone you meet.

2107
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:35,000
The one tragedy of not doing this all in one section is tape four is a holiday.

2108
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
The theme tape.

2109
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Oh, really?

2110
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
What holiday?

2111
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Christmas.

2112
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
It's all Christmas?

2113
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
It's all Christmas?

2114
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,000
There's a little Hanukkah stuff in there too, actually.

2115
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:49,000
But there's a song with McGruff and the kids go decorate an old folks home.

2116
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,000
But we'll get to that on McGruff three.

2117
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Maybe it does have to be next year.

2118
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Christmas in July, though.

2119
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Maybe it does.

2120
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
That's nice.

2121
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Yeah.

2122
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
So we'll finish this out.

2123
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
This isn't there's nothing so exciting coming up.

2124
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
How do you kids get so right?

2125
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Getting yourself right.

2126
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Getting so tough.

2127
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Just learn the right stuff from McGruff.

2128
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,000
You feel good when you see the light.

2129
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
And you're right, right, right.

2130
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Always right.

2131
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
You're sure a bunch of right on right kids.

2132
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Got any more songs?

2133
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
I dance right as a big bird in flight.

2134
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
I dance right as a snowflake is white.

2135
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:33,000
I dance right as a big strong mistype.

2136
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I'm so right, I am right.

2137
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Out of sight.

2138
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
I'm so right, I'm right.

2139
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Out of sight.

2140
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,000
So that's the end of tape two, cassette two.

2141
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
We're fucking.

2142
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
This is the click clack song.

2143
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:55,000
If you, McGruff's going to say a question and then you clack your heels together.

2144
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Once if you agree with the statement stamp your click your foot against the ground as like a footstep.

2145
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:12,000
If you disagree and take off your shoes and make no sound, if you have no opinion.

2146
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Or if it's too complicated, that's too complex of a problem to solve in an easy game like this.

2147
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
And write me a letter.

2148
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:38,000
So yeah, so I guess this is this was definitely more about like, this was more of a blues clues style situation where he wanted like call and response on like smart kids, which is more of a passive experience for the listener.

2149
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:49,000
This he wanted to include kids so they could confusingly clap twice, which it's off beat like clapping twice in the middle of a song is hard and it's not.

2150
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:53,000
But this is the way he would set it up with where it would be a fun clap twice.

2151
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Kids don't have rhythm.

2152
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Off the beat.

2153
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,000
It would be like, you know, white people clapping.

2154
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Like one, the one and two.

2155
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:04,000
I mean white people, bad people with bad rhythm.

2156
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
One and three is when they generally clap.

2157
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
You want to clap on the two and four, which is what Prince said to us.

2158
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,000
He said white people clap on the two and four when I saw him in concert.

2159
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Oh, because he knew.

2160
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Oh, that's why they're wrong.

2161
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Okay. Yeah.

2162
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:23,000
They. So McGruff is doing a lot of like bad rhythm clapping.

2163
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Very confusing. But he wanted it to be an immersive experience.

2164
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
That's that's the step he wanted to take forward.

2165
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Like, right. So I appreciate that.

2166
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
I don't know that he nailed it.

2167
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
No, I think he nailed it.

2168
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Right. Like he's he's summing up the album.

2169
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Yeah. The lessons.

2170
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Yes.

2171
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Maybe making kids a little too confident.

2172
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Like when kids are like, I'm right.

2173
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
You know, it's like, all right.

2174
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Well, let's let's have some humility of the knowledge we acquired.

2175
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,000
What's some what's in the books that come with these?

2176
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Well, I only have one book and it's for the fourth one, which is the holiday one.

2177
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Okay. But it's basically just a lyric sheet and some drawings.

2178
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,000
And this is first is a drawing where you're thanking again, thanking McGruff.

2179
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Thank you, McGruff, for all you do.

2180
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Thank you. Thank me for the harvest.

2181
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
The harvest, the bouts of a harvest.

2182
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:23,000
The weather is because of me, the birds and the bees, animals in the trees.

2183
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
It's all McGruff.

2184
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Here's a picture of McGruff with two menorahs on each side.

2185
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Well, post this for this is coming out during on it.

2186
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
This kind of is a Hanukkah present.

2187
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
This right.

2188
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:42,000
And yeah, so there's pictures there and then it has those bios of the revolution.

2189
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,000
McGruff's revolution, the kids there.

2190
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:57,000
And then it has phones, phone smart chart where you put your name, address, phone number, neighbors and phone number, relatives, first aid, police and other.

2191
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
So it's just like you would fill it in.

2192
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
No child has filled this in though.

2193
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Oh, you know, it does have it does have credits.

2194
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Oh, OK.

2195
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:11,000
But we're not less interested a little with these a little bit, unfortunately.

2196
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:18,000
I mean, I'd still be interested to talk about music by Angelo Natalie and lyrics by Sue Slocca.

2197
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
I hope I'm saying that right.

2198
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Donald Booth and Angelo Natalie.

2199
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Any look up any of these people?

2200
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Brief. I did, but I didn't do it enough.

2201
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Let's just say that.

2202
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Sure, sure, sure.

2203
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:39,000
And they it was recorded at the Carriage House in Stamford, Connecticut.

2204
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:46,000
So that's wrestling and that's right.

2205
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Yes, PN McGruff.

2206
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
I'll come from the same.

2207
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:52,000
It's a great Burger King album of art.

2208
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,000
OK, so we're at the end of this second episode.

2209
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
And I will say this.

2210
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
I was I was expecting we would get through more.

2211
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:05,000
But yes, of course, how I was my hubris thinking that this wasn't more is crazy.

2212
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
I'm just glad we get more.

2213
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,000
I mean, yeah, we'd be so wiped, I think, to pack it in.

2214
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
So I hope it's not disappointing.

2215
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:17,000
We're not. I hope they I genuinely feel like some of the audience of this show

2216
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:21,000
and of this episode might have seen the runtime and gone not for hours.

2217
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Boo. Right.

2218
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:27,000
I understand that, but I hopefully what I'm about to say will make up for that.

2219
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,000
So my thought process was.

2220
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Look, I don't want to see an artist go out like this.

2221
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
You know, I don't want to see.

2222
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,000
I don't want to see them sort of rest on their laurels.

2223
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Do you know, do some OK work, but not try to capture the spirit of smart kids.

2224
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:50,000
So I will say I will reveal next week.

2225
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I will say I will reveal now I have helped McGruff record four new songs.

2226
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:11,000
For an EP, an EP called Smart Teens, the Smart Teens EP.

2227
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:17,000
And you will I will be putting this in the Patreon box right now for everyone to download.

2228
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
This is a Patreon exclusive.

2229
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:23,000
It'll be the clip that the songs will be patron exclusive at a certain point.

2230
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,000
I'm going to probably put them up on YouTube and Apple Music.

2231
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
You'll get downloads.

2232
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Our supporters get it first and they have.

2233
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
They'll get it first. It'll be out. You'll have it for weeks.

2234
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:39,000
And then at a certain point, I will probably put it up on YouTube because I spent a lot of time doing this.

2235
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Well, as because we've been saying, should we do McGruff two for a while?

2236
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Yes. And the answer has been like, I need a minute.

2237
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
It's not ready. It's not ready.

2238
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
I'll give everyone a little a little Genesis into this.

2239
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:59,000
I think it's sometime during the summer I said to myself, oh, you know, be funny if I made him a gruff song.

2240
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:04,000
And I was like, yeah, that would be funny. That's because I was like messing around with it very casually.

2241
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:10,000
And then a couple of weeks later, I said, it'd be funny if I made a full album.

2242
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:17,000
And then at a certain point, I said, I can't do a full album because this is killing me.

2243
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:28,000
But I have I will say I don't I have demos of other songs that do exist, but I've settled on four that I like.

2244
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:33,000
You polished it, which McGruff didn't. You're helping McGruff to to curate.

2245
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:41,000
And it's basically I mean, what's taken longer, I think, is is my lack of engineering skills and producing skills.

2246
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:45,000
But I'll say that there's four songs in this collection.

2247
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:51,000
The first song on the album is called Vaping. Oh, very good.

2248
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
He hasn't he hasn't been able to address that.

2249
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Vaping. Yeah. Track two.

2250
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:01,000
This again, this is more for a teen audience. Track two is called Hook Up Apps.

2251
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
They're not supposed to be on there.

2252
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:09,000
They're not supposed to be on there. But in the future also, they shouldn't be on there.

2253
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Yeah. Number track three is called Raves.

2254
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:16,000
The hot button issue of 2020. Absolutely.

2255
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Yeah. Yes. And track four.

2256
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:27,000
It's about families. I'll just say that it's about different types of families and not letting other kids bully you for.

2257
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:31,000
I'll just say McGruff sort of reveals a little bit about his own family in this this song.

2258
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Backstory. Oh, my gosh.

2259
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:40,000
So I yes, that will be I think unless something happens, which I am not I'll say this.

2260
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:45,000
I'm not 100 percent done with it. But by the time this comes out, I should be 100 percent done with it.

2261
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:49,000
And it's probably in your inbox right now. Whoa.

2262
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:53,000
These four songs. Oh, my God. This is huge. Huge announcement.

2263
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Huge announcement. Yes. Huge drop from McGruff at the end of the year.

2264
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Yes. Smart Teens.

2265
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Wow. So there you go.

2266
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:08,000
There's a demo for a song called Butt Chugging. It didn't make it.

2267
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:14,000
But I have it. It's kind of written. I just maybe for maybe for McGruff.

2268
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:21,000
What ever since that movie, Narcs or what was it called?

2269
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Let's Be Cops. Oh, no.

2270
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Like Fun Runers. Oh, no.

2271
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,000
It's John Cena. The John Cena blockers. Blockers.

2272
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:37,000
I will say that in the lyrics, in the half written lyrics, I have blockers does appear.

2273
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:41,000
The scourge of blockers. Ruining teen minds.

2274
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Vibe wise, it ended up being kind of more of like an early 90s song.

2275
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:49,000
So I felt like it didn't maybe fit so much sound wise with these four.

2276
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Oh, you're kind of going for Smart Kids. I see.

2277
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:58,000
I'm going for it. Look, it's not as good as Smart Kids, but I was going for Smart Kids and I was going.

2278
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:02,000
The goal was to make it as good as I could make it.

2279
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Well, you got to aim for you imitate your heroes until it becomes its own thing.

2280
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:10,000
And that's what you've done. You've set the bar really high.

2281
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:15,000
And I'm sure as much as you're trying to be McGruff that a lot of money has come out in the process.

2282
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:20,000
I want it to be, you know, like a McCartney chaos and creation where you go, oh, yeah, that's the magic.

2283
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:25,000
I remember maybe it's not as good necessarily as the early stuff, but I can see it there.

2284
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:30,000
I will say there is a little bit of a dubstep part in one of them, but it's not as good as the early stuff.

2285
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Part in one of them, but it's a little bridge.

2286
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:37,000
It's just sort of a bridge. Nice. So there you go.

2287
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:41,000
I. Yeah. Wait. Yeah. Any other genre to tip or are you trying?

2288
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Sure. I mean, I can see. I mean, people here for.

2289
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Well, first of all, I'll say this.

2290
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Another big part of me not of it taking a while was I learned very quickly that I cannot spend more than 30 minutes at a time singing like McGruff.

2291
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:05,000
That's fair. Yeah. And then I was like, there were like two weeks would pass and I go, I got to do it, but it hurts.

2292
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
So then I'd have to like figure out, try to figure out a different voice to sing with.

2293
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:13,000
There's a lot that I have. That was a lot of my dragging my feet at a certain point.

2294
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:16,000
There is a bunch of kids to sing instead of you.

2295
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Yeah, that's hard to do right now. I have to talk to the FBI about why you're searching a child singer on Fiverr.

2296
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I will reveal I there is another voice on the album that I added literally a week ago.

2297
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Wow. That you'll recognize in the podcast.

2298
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Steve Perry from Journey rarely does any music anymore.

2299
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:43,000
He came back to. I contacted Steve Perry.

2300
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Zach Reno's voice.

2301
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Hey, all right. All right.

2302
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
The King returns.

2303
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,000
City walking. Wow.

2304
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Geez, he's in the background.

2305
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Yes. So, oh, genre wise, the first I think it's like a like kind of synth pop.

2306
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
The first song is sort of synth pop.

2307
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:12,000
The second song is a is a is like a jam, like a sexy jam.

2308
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Oh, boy. Like I wish I if you will.

2309
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:18,000
I McGruff play like there's guitar.

2310
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:24,000
There's two guitar solos on the second song, which I went like, is this indulgent?

2311
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
It's like, well, there were guitar solos on Smart Kids.

2312
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2313
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
And sax solos.

2314
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:34,000
The third song and sort of a droney synth.

2315
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:39,000
And then the fourth one is definitely dream like dream synth pop.

2316
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:43,000
It's very like kind of like fly like what do you want to make dream?

2317
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,000
He is really the best word.

2318
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:58,000
So then you get 90s and you could start doing like, well, how would McGruff have tried to do it like a his version of Radiohead or yes, what's his the prodigy or nine inch nails?

2319
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:04,000
You can start getting because he was probably getting I think some dark industrial kind of stuff.

2320
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
I for sure he was.

2321
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:10,000
I think I have that sort of like 90s hip like early like 89, 90, 91.

2322
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Butchugging is like a 91 style rap song.

2323
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Like a Technotronic.

2324
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Fight for your right.

2325
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
No, not like that.

2326
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,000
More of sort of like old maybe it is like late 80s.

2327
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Maybe it's it's sort of a rave.

2328
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,000
I don't know how to even describe.

2329
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,000
You have to hear I can look I can play it for you at a certain point.

2330
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Now, now the legend of butt chugging.

2331
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:35,000
That's going to be like one of those tracks you hear about and like I wonder if they're ever going to put out that chugging.

2332
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Is he going to finish it?

2333
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
It's been working out for years, they say.

2334
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
You're working on that.

2335
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Meanwhile, I'm just learning surface streets in case someone pulls over.

2336
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,000
It's like, can you small man Woodland Crete large gnome?

2337
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Can you help me get to Van Nuys?

2338
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,000
You know, no one's addressed you.

2339
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Odd shaped creature.

2340
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Help.

2341
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
If you see Jason, leave him be.

2342
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Don't ask him for directions.

2343
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Maybe you know what?

2344
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Maybe I shouldn't put the songs immediately so people hear this and like like they'll hear it, get excited and then it'll come out like a day later.

2345
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Which how should we do?

2346
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
How should that be?

2347
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Yeah.

2348
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Or dump it right now.

2349
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Yeah, I mean, right.

2350
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Probably.

2351
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Well, because they'll see this new episode and then they'll see the four songs and already the secret is already out.

2352
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
I see.

2353
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Which isn't that big of a deal.

2354
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,000
I'll leave it up to you.

2355
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
The secret really is to you guys.

2356
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
It should be up to the artist.

2357
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Yeah, all right.

2358
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,000
I'll think about it.

2359
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
I mean, you'll know when you know.

2360
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:38,000
If it's not in right now, I mean, it'll probably be in right now.

2361
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Just don't want the album to get stepped on by the episode.

2362
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Do you want it all to breathe?

2363
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:47,000
But, you know, like big surprise movie.

2364
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,000
And albums or that that's that's kind of what it's all about.

2365
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,000
You've really done sort of a Beyonce move here.

2366
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Yeah, I'll put it out like the day of and then this episode will come out like at midnight like it normally does.

2367
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,000
And I'll put it out the day of maybe that's a smart way to do it.

2368
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Yes.

2369
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Very good.

2370
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Good really strategy.

2371
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Make a plan before you put out your album inspired by me.

2372
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,000
So, yeah.

2373
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
So happy holidays, everyone.

2374
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Wow.

2375
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
So, you know, I'm going to leave it at that.

2376
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
So, yeah.

2377
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
So happy holidays, everyone.

2378
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Wow.

2379
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Wow.

2380
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:23,000
A Hanukkah present from McGruff and Mike to you.

2381
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
This is huge.

2382
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Wow.

2383
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Wow.

2384
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Wow.

2385
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,000
And obviously another presence to come next year.

2386
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:35,000
So we have one thing to look forward to in 2021.

2387
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
So far, the list is one item long.

2388
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
McGruff three.

2389
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,000
So get the positivity up everybody.

2390
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Probably vaccines eventually.

2391
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:53,000
And also the episode could be like a celebration of that we're out.

2392
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
The vaccine.

2393
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Sure.

2394
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Not until everyone gets the vaccine will we put out McGruff three.

2395
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
That's good.

2396
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Yeah.

2397
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,000
And at that point, somebody will gift me a full suit.

2398
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
A McGruff suit hopefully.

2399
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Andrew Grissom will find it on eBay.

2400
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Well, if you know where there's a full McGruff suit, then email podcastwriter.gmail.com

2401
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:20,000
with the subject line, smart tips for good boys.

2402
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Any other McGruff related information, any information about the vulture who came to my school several times.

2403
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Same email, same subject line.

2404
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:33,000
And with that, you survived podcastwriter the second gate McGruff two.

2405
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Wow.

2406
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Wow.

2407
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,000
We did it.

2408
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,000
What a blast.

2409
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,000
I'm glad we're not done.

2410
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,000
I'm glad our journey with McGruff is not over.

2411
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Right.

2412
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:47,000
And now we have up to what are we going to we have to top we have to top we have to top

2413
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:50,000
it with three and we'll see what we can do.

2414
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Well, full album or full I was saying Beyonce already the the the the film like the lemonade.

2415
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Yeah, that's true.

2416
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Yeah.

2417
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:03,000
You have to make a 45 minute stylized visual.

2418
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Visual.

2419
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Visual.

2420
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Like in its like he's shirtless in it.

2421
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
It's kind of like Madonna's sex maybe.

2422
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Oh, yeah.

2423
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
What you're showing us is already pretty.

2424
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Yeah.

2425
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Yeah.

2426
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:20,000
It feels like a visual sexually challenging visual album.

2427
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Yeah.

2428
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,000
So, yeah.

2429
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,000
So we'll see.

2430
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
We'll see what happens.

2431
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Wow.

2432
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Wow.

2433
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Anything is possible.

2434
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,000

Download that EP and we'll get cooking.

2439
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Mike and I are getting to work on a multi-million dollar.

2440
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,000
We're calling our buddy David LaChapelle.

2441
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
It's going to blow you away.

2442
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:53,000
But whatever we make, don't watch it high.
