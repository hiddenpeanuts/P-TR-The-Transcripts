Dog.

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,860
Warning, the following deep dish podcast features the sauce

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,160
on top of the cheese and can take upwards of 30 minutes to

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,000
cook.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,680
Tonight's proceedings may include aliens colluding with us

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,680
presidents, themed cucumbers and a house where Walt Disney

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,240
certainly pooped his pants.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,920
This show will definitely include both Dan Aykroyd

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,000
and Jim Belushi.

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,360
Live from the former home of the rock and roll McDonald's,

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,400
it's podcast, The Ride.

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,420

Chicago

28
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,420
Hello Chicago!

29
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,340
I barely made it up.

30
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,980
Oh my god, so good to see everybody.

31
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,740
Oh my god, Jason from Mayor's shirt in the front row.

32
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,580
Thank you.

33
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,540
Lots of shirts in the front row.

34
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,180
You have made one before we have gotten around to making one.

35
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,620
I know.

36
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,820
Thanks, it's just word sweet.

37
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,100
We could have done this a long time ago.

38
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,740
What's going on everybody?

39
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,940
I'm Scott Gardner.

40
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,140
Hello.

41
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,380
I'm Jason Sheridan.

42
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,780
It is great to be here in Improv City.

43
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,260
Rom Country.

44
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,540
Charnaville.

45
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,100
All the great heroes.

46
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,580
Chicago.

47
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,020
Oh my god, yes indeed.

48
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,580
Yes, welcome everybody to podcast The Ride,

49
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,420
a podcast about theme parks hosted by

50
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,540
two huge theme park dorks in their 30s

51
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,700
and one returning champion hometown hero.

52
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,060
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our third host from Schaumburg, Illinois,

53
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,780
Michael Carlson.

54
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,420
Hey, we're jumping in here.

55
00:02:49,420 --> 00:03:03,820
At this point, we lost a little bit of audio because the homecoming song kept playing.

56
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,380
Basically, what you're missing at home is that Mike is walking through the aisles in a Letterman jacket.

57
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,660
He catches a football thrown by a member of the audience.

58
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,940
It was very, very cool.

59
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,460
He then turned around to reveal that his high school Letterman jacket was for band and tennis.

60
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,100
It was a great joke and everyone liked it.

61
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,340
I also explained that I am staying in Mike's childhood home,

62
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,020
specifically sleeping in his childhood bed.

63
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,620
And now back to the show.

64
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,300
And we saw the sights.

65
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,740
I drove by the old high school.

66
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,900
You took me through the Portillo's drive through for a chocolate cake shake at 11 p.m.

67
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,740
And I made a few discoveries at the homestead.

68
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,620
So this is my favorite.

69
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,060
It's an exciting new character joining the cast of the show.

70
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,180
This is called Puppet Mike.

71
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,620
Oh, sorry.

72
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,900
I assume that's fragile.

73
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,700
It is a paper mache puppet for the listeners at home, paper mache and burlap,

74
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,300
that as a puppet, Mike made presumably of himself.

75
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,780
Do you do you want to say anything, Puppet Mike?

76
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,700
Oh, he's shy.

77
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,100
Puppet Mike is shy.

78
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,540
Oh, he's really shy. OK.

79
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,700
He's a nurse. Are you nursing him?

80
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,140
I eat. He's just bashful.

81
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,660
I see. I see.

82
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,980
What's the story here, Mike?

83
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,580
I I think I'm sure I made that when I was young.

84
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:39,940
Yeah.

85
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,460
Are you?

86
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,980
I mean, well, the proof is you don't have puppetry on the on your letterman's jacket.

87
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,180
No, I wish.

88
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,820
There's going to be people here who personally know Mike Carlson from his past, correct?

89
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,220
Yell if you know Mike. Oh, yeah.

90
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,580
All right. There's a couple. That's nice.

91
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,380
Yeah.

92
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,180
Just getting engaged.

93
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,420
And also, here's one more question.

94
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,020
Is anyone here just is anyone here for the Chicago podcast festival

95
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,420
and has never never heard our podcast?

96
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,180
Thank God.

97
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,180
Is it puppets of somebody you never met?

98
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,820
He's catching a football.

99
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,340
All right. We're just we're among friends.

100
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,500
Perfect. Perfect. Yeah.

101
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,540
Yeah, we also we went to get a coffee at the cafe next door

102
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,780
and we walked in and the person behind the counter went, Mike Carlson.

103
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,820
Like it was Shears and it was someone you went to college with that

104
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,700
you hadn't seen in 10 years. Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

105
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,500
She was busy, though. She couldn't come to the show.

106
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,980
She didn't make a point of saying that. Yes. Yeah. Apologies. Yeah.

107
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,500
The other thing I found almost like on top of a pile of stuff in your room,

108
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,860
like waiting for me to arrive

109
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,620
was a copy of the Sasa Gula Sentinel,

110
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:03,780
the fake newspaper you get when you check in at Disney's Port Orleans French Quarter.

111
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,060
And it was a 1997 edition.

112
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,340
And some things have changed since then.

113
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,940
Thank you for choosing Disney's Port Orleans Riverside or Port Orleans

114
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,860
as your vacation destination in the gracious tradition of the old south.

115
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,300
We'll make every effort to ensure your stay is comfortable and relaxing.

116
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,340
And some of these establishments,

117
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,540
I don't the cotton co-op is not called that anymore.

118
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,580
And this bar is no longer called Colonel's Cotton Mill.

119
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,260
That's also curious planning that they had two bars with cotton in the name.

120
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:52,180
Also, this isn't 1910. No, this isn't 1997 or 90s.

121
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,780
Yes, I am happy to say this.

122
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,380
Well, down the road at what is now called Port Orleans Riverside

123
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,300
at the time was called Dixie Landings.

124
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,580
The pool is still called Old Man Island.

125
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,380
And that's just good wholesome fun.

126
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,780
OK, that's good.

127
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,500
And nothing nothing attracts you more than a pool named Old Man Island,

128
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,460
which is where you're hoping to retire in five years.

129
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,340
And yes, retire and die.

130
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:29,540
A fun swimming pool, a brim with all sorts of water delights.

131
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,540
You know, water delights, the phrase we all know and love.

132
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,220
Wow. So it's been an eventful trip.

133
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,420
Yeah, really. Yeah.

134
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,220
We're seeing all the sights of Chicago, this one old racist newsletter.

135
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,220
Yeah. And and a puppet.

136
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,300
And today, Jason ate Lou Malnati's pizza.

137
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,100
Oh, Lou Malnati's. Yeah.

138
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,540
So that's good.

139
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,740
Hey, do you have it with you?

140
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,860
It's backstage.

141
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,100
It's backstage.

142
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,740
I was going to walk out eating it, but we we were trying to get the Bluetooth

143
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,620
to work and you have it figured out now.

144
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,540
No, I don't. You don't.

145
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,780
Do you also have my phone? No.

146
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,060
OK, Jason's phone would have my phone.

147
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,140
Oh, Aaron's got it. Hey, Aaron.

148
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,260
You're here, ladies and gentlemen.

149
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,140
Hey, Aaron.

150
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,060
They designed so many of the shirts

151
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,660
a lot of you are wearing.

152
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,460
Much appreciated.

153
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,340
It's nice to see. I see that tiny puppets.

154
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,500
I see that tiny puppets right there.

155
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,260
Vam for two seconds.

156
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,340
I got it. I got it to work.

157
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,340
It's working.

158
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,900
You're the adult. You handle the technology.

159
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,860
Mr. Blue, you're Mr.

160
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,100
Bluetooth, Jason, you're Mr. Pizza.

161
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,900
You shouldn't have tried to merge the two things.

162
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,300
I know.

163
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,780
What do you think of that pizza?

164
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,700
Delicious. Wonderful.

165
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,820
Still have to get a hot dog.

166
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,940
Still have to get a hot dog before we leave town bright and early.

167
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,660
We're flying out very early tomorrow to go to Orlando,

168
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,060
which means you're going to have to eat a hot dog at the airport at 7 a.m.

169
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,260
Would it be the first time?

170
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,460
No, not sure.

171
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,300
I don't think so.

172
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,460
Jason, you had a little history you wanted to quickly talk about.

173
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,380
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

174
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,860
So, you know, we found a lot of Chicago theme park connections.

175
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,620
We can sit, by the way.

176
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,220
Nobody's making us stand.

177
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,700
Oh, that's true. I guess.

178
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,980
Let's say let's settle in, y'all.

179
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,580
Chicago theme park connections.

180
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,540
Walt Disney. You might not think there's a ton.

181
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,740
There's not a ton here. Walt Disney was born here.

182
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,980
Walt Disney was born.

183
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,900
I have the stat.

184
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,580
I think I think six miles west of this very theater

185
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,020
is where is where a young babe named Walt developed his love

186
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,620
for storytelling and exploiting labor.

187
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,900
You know, in a little house,

188
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,580
he was born in 1901 in a little house that Roadside America called, quote,

189
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,020
unmemorable.

190
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,420
Got him.

191
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,420
Walt's father, of course, was a construction worker

192
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:15,580
at an early precursor to theme parks, the 1893 Colombian Exposition,

193
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,420
the Chicago World's Fair.

194
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:22,460
Yeah, World's Fair, where such things were introduced as the midway.

195
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,220
That was the first ever amusement midway, shredded wheat and cream of wheat.

196
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,020
Thanks, Chicago.

197
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,220
Yeah. And the first Ferris wheel.

198
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,820
Mike, can you bring up that visual?

199
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,620
Of course. Yeah, Ferris wheel.

200
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,900
The Ferris wheel is from Chicago.

201
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,460
What? Clap more.

202
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,100
Yeah, Ferris wheel.

203
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,820
Ferris wheel.

204
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,540
Ferris wheel.

205
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,380
Ferris wheel.

206
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,780
Ferris wheel.

207
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,740
The scariest ride.

208
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,300
And then we should make you all chant the name of the person

209
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,980
who invented the Ferris wheel.

210
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:00,460
Sure. That man is his name is George Washington Gale Ferris.

211
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,540
Junior. Junior. Junior?

212
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,020
Yeah. Let's see. All right. So everybody.

213
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,940
George Washington Gale Ferris Junior.

214
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,900
George Washington Gale Ferris Junior.

215
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,180
Yes. Two is fine. Two is a chant.

216
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,300
Oh, you were gung ho for three. I should have let you finish it out.

217
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,660
Thanks for the enthusiasm.

218
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,340
And thank you, George Washington Gale Junior Ferris Junior for the Ferris.

219
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,100
Junior is pictured here looking like a damn snack.

220
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,500
Am I right, folks?

221
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,100
Yeah.

222
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,340
Who knows? Elias Disney could have helped build the Ferris wheel.

223
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,020
That, of course, was, you know, construction was his job.

224
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,100
His favorite pastime was being distant to his children.

225
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,620
Now, Ferris's original plan for the Ferris wheel called for each car

226
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,620
to hold 60 people and have a lunch counter.

227
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,060
Oh, my God.

228
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:52,060
One rotation took nine minutes, and it sounds like my ideal form of transit.

229
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,180
So a thing that doesn't go anywhere and feeds you.

230
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:01,500
Yes. Of course, the Ferris wheel opened two months late.

231
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,900
It did not make opening day, making it the Star Wars ride.

232
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,580
It was making it the Star Wars rise of the resistance of its time.

233
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,820
And like so many other things I first introduced at the fair,

234
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:22,060
the World's Fair, like the Disney parks, has a castle.

235
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,700
Of course, I'm talking about H.H. Holmes, his famous murder castle.

236
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,900
A bigger initial pop for the murder castle than for the Ferris wheel.

237
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,660
Burned down presumably for the insurance money at 1895.

238
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,300
Who knows who got the money?

239
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,180
Because H.H. Holmes had a lot of aliases.

240
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,900
So, yeah.

241
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,020
So that's the history lesson from Jason.

242
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,140
That's it. And I am tapped out.

243
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,260
Take a risk. Go get that loom all notties.

244
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,700
But now it's time for Mike's history corner.

245
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,580
Yeah. So basically, I was thinking like, OK, what is the greatest moment

246
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,060
at a Disney park involving a Chicagoan?

247
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,620
OK, and there are a lot to choose from.

248
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,700
And I've knocked it down to like, I think, six or seven. So

249
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,980
the first thing, apparently, yeah, I was very, very tasteful

250
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,980
with my selection selections.

251
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,100
So the first one, I think, is 2002.

252
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:26,780
Jim Belushi plays with his band, The Sacred Hearts at Disney's California Adventure.

253
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,420
This is counting down also.

254
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,660
So this is still good, but it's the lesser of all of them.

255
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,020
Twenty fifteen. Billy Corgan rides Big Thunder Mountain.

256
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,140
If you've never seen this picture and listeners to this podcast

257
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,340
probably have the poutiest pout.

258
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:57,940
Oh, yeah. Emo could this is really he's like he's he's an old baby.

259
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,940
That's what he looks like.

260
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,540
He is a grumpy baby. Fussy old baby.

261
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,540
All right. Next on the list, we have 2003.

262
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,300
Jim Belushi again plays with his band, The Sacred Hearts

263
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,580
at Disney's California Adventure.

264
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,420
And then, yes, next on the list here, this is just very cute.

265
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,380
Nineteen seventy four.

266
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,180
America's favorite, Bob Newhart.

267
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,940
Oh, isn't that nice?

268
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,460
He's with Mickey Mouse.

269
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,380
And then next on the list, 2004.

270
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,780
Again, Jim Belushi plays

271
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,820
Disney's California Adventure.

272
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,740
And I made sure that I wasn't wrong about this

273
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,740
because he's wearing different clothes in each photo.

274
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:46,340
Yeah, these were three separate times Jim Belushi played.

275
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,460
Now, they got better as they went, seemingly the quality increased.

276
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,780
It was something called like prime time week for ABC.

277
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,420
Yeah, exactly.

278
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,580
So we have two more on this list.

279
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,420
Does anyone remember this gentleman?

280
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,700
Uh, Governor Rod Blagojevich.

281
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,300
Former governor, obviously, he is in prison.

282
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,180
Yeah, I tried to sell a Senate seat, essentially.

283
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,020
But anyway, that's you can look it up.

284
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,780
So I googled about five days ago.

285
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,060
I said, hmm, let me Google Rod Blagojevich Disney World.

286
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,260
As you do.

287
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,860
And this came up.

288
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,900
Blagojevich indicted while on trip to Disney World.

289
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:40,860
Can you imagine they they harshed his buzz

290
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,620
on a trip to the greatest place on Earth?

291
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,180
The article specifically says like another reporter

292
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,620
tried to corner Blagojevich and another guest was like, hey, come on, man, not here.

293
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,260
He hasn't been convicted yet.

294
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,140
My dad is a newspaper man.

295
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,460
Give it up for my dad.

296
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,460
Yeah.

297
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,300
He he works for the Chicago Tribune.

298
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,780
And last night, after I told him this, he brought home

299
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,220
like a couple printouts from he looked it up and he found out which resort Rod was at.

300
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,660
And for just for your information, Saratoga Springs.

301
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,900
2009, still pretty new in 2009.

302
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,100
Yeah. So he he was shelling out the big bucks, I guess, at the time.

303
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,100
I wonder where he got the money from.

304
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,340
There's no way to know. Yeah.

305
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,860
All right. So we have one more.

306
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,700
And I mentioned my father.

307
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,420
Let me quickly bring up my mother to the stage, who is also here.

308
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,460
Oh, boy.

309
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,180
So my mother, I've talked about my mother on the show a lot.

310
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,260
She is meeting. Hello.

311
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,820
Oh, yeah. That's Scott.

312
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,980
You can shake Scott's hand.

313
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,340
Hi. Hi.

314
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:11,060
So my mom is the reason I have this weird Disney illness

315
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,380
where because we only basically we we vacationed in Disney World

316
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,940
almost exclusively, except for one year when we went to Dubuque, Iowa.

317
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,740
I guess we went to the Wisconsin Dells once as well.

318
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,460
Yeah. Yeah.

319
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,060
Which are which are fun.

320
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,740
But also, I think both times when my mom was like, we're never going back here.

321
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,540
Yeah. So so you were a Disney, obviously, as a child.

322
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,220
You went a lot as a child. Maybe.

323
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,740
Not a lot, but I love Disney. Yeah.

324
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,860
Yeah. An important clarification.

325
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:55,980
So I got, you know, my my mother loves to perform.

326
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,700
She was in Charlie Brown in high school.

327
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,820
And you're a good man, Charlie Brown. She played Lucy.

328
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,820
So she was a performer.

329
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,740
So when we were Disney, Hollywood studios, then MGM studios,

330
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,780
there was a thing you could do on like the main drag, which was you could make

331
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,100
do you you could set it up here.

332
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,740
Music video.

333
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,500
So I wanted to bring my children in.

334
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,700
And our 18 month old daughter was just crying and crying.

335
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,820
So she stayed with her dad and Mike.

336
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:32,100
And I went in and it was a very memorable experience, very exciting for us.

337
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,300
And Mike is a bit of a ham if you don't know that.

338
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,180
So he went with it right away.

339
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,380
Well, you're going to see that maybe I wasn't that big of a ham yet.

340
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,660
Well, surely that video was lost to time.

341
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,620
The video was not lost to time.

342
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:59,260
So it's been it's been a thing my mom will pull out if a friend comes over

343
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,620
for many years.

344
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,900
And what specifically I don't want to be too vulgar here.

345
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,260
I have friends and family.

346
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,620
But what happens when you're nervous and it's involved?

347
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,940
Something happens when you're nervous and it's involuntary.

348
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,460
And you're a young boy.

349
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,780
Yes.

350
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,740
Did someone guess what it is?

351
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,900
You are very right.

352
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,500
I'm extremely uncomfortable with this being said with your mom here.

353
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,300
That's OK. I mean, she knows this part.

354
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,860
She doesn't like that she lived it.

355
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,100
Yes. So pay attention here, even though it's being projected on brick.

356
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,780
And we're going to be recording this.

357
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,580
We're going to step off the stairs at home.

358
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,060
I mean, my mother.

359
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,940
Hey, Mrs. Carlson.

360
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,220
Hey.

361
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,500
And listeners at home, imagine the most beautiful backdrop you could ever

362
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,900
you guys will see here in the room.

363
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,460
Eyes on the lower left.

364
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,540
There's a little bit lower left.

365
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,900
veterans of gold and einge handsome

366
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,900
I am squeezing.

367
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,900
I am squeezing.

368
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,900
I am squeezing.

369
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,900
I'm just gonna keep on counting until you are mine.

370
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,900
I'm just gonna keep on counting until you are mine.

371
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,900
Viperspeed Tunnel!

372
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,900
I mean, yeah.

373
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,900
Alright, I mean that's the rest of it.

374
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
How about a hand?

375
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:23,900
So, young Mike white knuckling his penis out of fear and like the way they edited the video, they like cut to the wide shot right as you realize what song it is.

376
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,900
Like right as you're like one, two, three, four.

377
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,900
It's Miami Sound Machine, right? Gloria Estefan?

378
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,900
That's correct. Miami Sound Machine.

379
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,900
Yeah.

380
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,900
How's that feel? Now you're back in your hometown showing this fine performance.

381
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,900
You know what? You get older and you mature.

382
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,900
And I, you know, look I stay humble.

383
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,900
So that's just the thing about me.

384
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,900
So I feel good, you know?

385
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,900
We're also probably gonna post it on YouTube.

386
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,900
Sure.

387
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,900
Yeah, it'll be out there.

388
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,900
Cause we gotta get those clicks, baby.

389
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:07,900
And I gotta say you've come a long way because we've been out on stage for nearly half an hour and I haven't seen one nervous crotch grab yet.

390
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:13,900
I don't know. When we talk about what the official topic is for the show, perhaps I will get very nervous.

391
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,900
Yes, indeed.

392
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:21,900
It is nerve wracking. What are we really here to talk about besides Mike's crotch?

393
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,900
And here's what I'll say.

394
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,900
Everybody here, most people here seem to listen to the show.

395
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,900
If you do, then you know that we are a podcast about theme parks.

396
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:39,900
But like, I don't know, like 35% of the time we are a podcast about vaguely themed shopping malls.

397
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:49,900
And with that in mind, I'm really happy to reveal that what we will be talking about tonight is the true greatest thing that we've ever done.

398
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:55,900
The place we will be talking about tonight is the true greatest themed entertainment destination in the Chicago area.

399
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,900
And that is the Woodfield Mall.

400
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,900
What a pop.

401
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,900
Made me nervous talking about it.

402
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,900
The three of us walking around is like that video with Bill Gates dancing to Start Me Up.

403
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,900
Yeah, what were we, we couldn't decide if it was something or not. So we just sort of staggered around.

404
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,900
I hope that was exciting.

405
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,900
Electric stage presences.

406
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,900
We really, yes, very secure, very self-assured.

407
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:40,900
The Woodfield Mall, and you know what's crazy is that we threw out that we were coming here to Chicago and people demanded it.

408
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,900
It's got to be the Woodfield Mall.

409
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,900
For anyone listening who doesn't know why, it has come up so many times on the podcast.

410
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:56,900
And when we talk about a store that we love, especially a themed restaurant that we love, Mike always says they had that at the Schomburg Mall.

411
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,900
Yeah.

412
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,900
We are really lucky here.

413
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,900
You know, you think about it.

414
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,900
Any locals here?

415
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,900
Who's been to the Schomburg Mall?

416
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,900
How about that? What's the percentage?

417
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,900
Yeah.

418
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,900
Woodfield Mall.

419
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,900
I got to correct myself.

420
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,900
But in my heart, it's the Schomburg Mall.

421
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,900
That's how I learned of this magical place for the first time.

422
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:25,900
You know how a lot of people sitting at home learned about this place for the first time is through a commercial that I love very much.

423
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,900
We might end up wanting to move our bodies a little more when this commercial play.

424
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,900
Everybody in the audience should.

425
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,900
This is a hell of a song.

426
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,900
It's a treat. Get ready for it.

427
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:50,900
Over product shots.

428
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,900
No shots of the place could be anywhere.

429
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,900
And.

430
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,900
We have it all.

431
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,900
Woodfield.

432
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,900
Yeah.

433
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,900
Amazing.

434
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,900
More a commercial for objects than anything else.

435
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,900
No signs or stores or restaurants.

436
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,900
Like just little objects.

437
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,900
Yeah.

438
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,900
Do you know what ties are?

439
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,900
Humans love your objects.

440
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,900
Here's a lot of them.

441
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:30,900
I'm a particular if you can imagine that if I'm a fan of sports shuffles, I'm also a fan of local mall songs.

442
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:36,900
And I would I have to unfortunately have to say that's number two because number one is the Yorkdale Mall, wherever that is.

443
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,900
Real catchy Yorkdale.

444
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,900
Incredible.

445
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,900
But we look that one up on your own time.

446
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,900
But I was thinking I would love to do this just as a little call and response.

447
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,900
It just is here to teach you the song.

448
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,900
I'll sing the first part.

449
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,900
You sing the second.

450
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,900
It's we have it all at Woodfield's will be your part.

451
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,900
This may come up throughout the show.

452
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,900
So here we go.

453
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,900
Oh, we have it all.

454
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,900
Yes.

455
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,900
That's how we're cooking with gas.

456
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,900
That's that's like all that's like a fun live show.

457
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,900
And it's also like a cult, a weird cult thing.

458
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:16,900
Especially when we're in this ballroom where we came up from the back and like, hey, everybody, we excited.

459
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,900
And yeah, we're trying to get people to invest in Woodfield Mall.

460
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,900
Yeah.

461
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,900
But that's not you know, that's not the case because Woodfield Mall is, you know, it's constantly being updated.

462
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,900
It's you know, it's a very modern place.

463
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,900
However, there have been some recent troubles.

464
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:40,900
Yes, you locals well know like a month and a half ago, somebody tried to drive their damn car into the place.

465
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,900
Yeah.

466
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,900
No more than try.

467
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,900
They did it.

468
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,900
They drove their car and luckily nothing happened.

469
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,900
Nobody even got injured, thankfully.

470
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,900
Yeah.

471
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,900
Because obviously that would be bad.

472
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,900
But then also we wouldn't have been able to do it as the topic of the show.

473
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,900
Yeah, that would have been we couldn't touch it.

474
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,900
We'd have to wait like years to do it.

475
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,900
Yeah.

476
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,900
Yeah.

477
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,900
But being that thank God crisis averted.

478
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,900
But I do feel like the morale of the Woodfield Mall has been hurt a little bit and we got to build it up.

479
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,900
We got to get excited with things like that song.

480
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,900
We got to remind them that we got it all.

481
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,900
At Woodfield.

482
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,900
Nice.

483
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,900
So let's go back.

484
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:25,900
Let's let's learn what made this place why we were so excited to come here and talk about this place.

485
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,900
What do you got slidewise?

486
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,900
Well, I mean, slidewise, we went there yesterday.

487
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,900
Oh, my God.

488
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,900
That's the main headline.

489
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,900
What am I saying?

490
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,900
Sorry.

491
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,900
Yeah.

492
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,900
So I don't know.

493
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,900
This is not.

494
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,900
Yeah, that's good.

495
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:43,900
So, yeah, we'll start with we'll start with our personal journeys when it comes to what you are.

496
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,900
Yeah.

497
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,900
So, yeah, last night, Jason, Mike and I and my wife, Aaron, all went to the Woodfield Mall.

498
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,900
We all had a night at the Woodfield Mall.

499
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,900
Jason, as you learned, stayed in Schomburg in my childhood bed.

500
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,900
Yeah.

501
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:05,900
And then I spent the spent the night in Schomburg and at a hotel with a Nordstrom View room,

502
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,900
which is probably like getting like a lagoon view at Disney World.

503
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,900
Yes.

504
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,900
Yes.

505
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,900
The optimal situation.

506
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:21,900
And, you know, just to be I mean, the main thing is to be to be in Schomburg at all and to walk in your footsteps.

507
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,900
Delightful.

508
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:29,900
You know, we get you pointed in the vague direction of the container store where you used to work.

509
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,900
Yeah.

510
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,900
Who's been to that container store?

511
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,900
Does anyone have a closet planned by the container store?

512
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,900
Oh, nice.

513
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,900
We've got one.

514
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,900
They went and didn't buy.

515
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,900
Maybe if a better salesman had been there to.

516
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,900
Well, this was a long time ago.

517
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,900
So, you know, I'm sure it's slipped since I've been there.

518
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,900
I'm sure they've.

519
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,900
Yeah, it's slipping.

520
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,900
How could it?

521
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,900
How could it deal with me leaving?

522
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:01,900
We also this is, you know, near the Woodfield Mall, but not not really.

523
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,900
But you took us and we had a one.

524
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:08,900
I'm just happy to say that I was able to go to the Bahama Breeze restaurant in Schomburg.

525
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,900
On Golf Road.

526
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:17,900
Where I celebrated the very solemn, solemn holiday of rum tober.

527
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,900
I had an amazing rum tober and there's a couple more weeks left.

528
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,900
So make sure you do, too.

529
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:32,900
So, yeah, so we went to Woodfield last night and Jason and I got out of my mom's car that I was borrowing.

530
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,900
Because that's what you do.

531
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,900
And the trip ended.

532
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,900
It ended or she ended.

533
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,900
It started with tragedy.

534
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,900
Fallen brother.

535
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:49,900
Panda Express, two items and noodles for for listeners and people who were blocking with our chairs.

536
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,900
What's on the ground?

537
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,900
It is what appears to be the remains of a Panda Express.

538
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,900
Two chicken entrees and noodles.

539
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:04,900
And when we went back at the end of the night, it remained.

540
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,900
Not even an animal.

541
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,900
Died with its boots on, buried where it fell.

542
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:17,900
Jason got his Bible out in a shovel and he read the meal, its last rites.

543
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:22,900
And then we buried it in a pet cemetery.

544
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:33,900
So then we went into Sears and it's confusing because like Sears doesn't have a logo.

545
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:39,900
Sears, I don't know if you've heard, hasn't been like the best store for a while.

546
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:44,900
They were running a promotion where if you spent a hundred dollars, you got fifty dollars in credit.

547
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:52,900
And that is not really how stores are supposed to work.

548
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:58,900
That is like a late, late stage capitalism where like logic just is gone.

549
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,900
It's a big if if Sears will even be there at all.

550
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:11,900
And it's funny because I learned Woodfield is a combination of the names of Robert E. Wood, who ran Sears, and Field of Marshall Fields.

551
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,900
And Mrs. Carlson told me that.

552
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,900
She was right.

553
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:21,900
Robert E. Wood also started Allstate Insurance, which Mike was in commercials for.

554
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,900
And I am a customer of.

555
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,900
Pretty cool. Pretty cool.

556
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,900
Wow, it all ties together.

557
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,900
Yeah, simulation.

558
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:48,900
So in case you were wondering where the Sears actual sign might be on the level that we parked at, which is the second level, it's behind some shrubs.

559
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:55,900
I mean, maybe I'm sure from some angle you can see it, but they should probably cut those.

560
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,900
And then we walked around. I hadn't been in about a year or so.

561
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,900
There's a new place caught Jason's eye immediately.

562
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,900
Stan's Donuts.

563
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,900
A lot of fans.

564
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,900
We did not eat there.

565
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,900
But someday.

566
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,900
And then we wandered around a little bit.

567
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:19,900
We will get back to our trip sort of towards the end of where we ended up.

568
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,900
I'll let you guess.

569
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:27,900
Where do you think in Woodfield Mall today some childless men in their 30s would end up at?

570
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:32,900
I couldn't understand.

571
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,900
I think I heard FYE.

572
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,900
Oh, yeah, sure.

573
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,900
Which we did not step foot in.

574
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,900
Yeah.

575
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,900
No, we don't have any customers for a while.

576
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,900
Yeah.

577
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,900
FYE also looks like they're in the process of closing every time I've ever been in there.

578
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,900
But, you know, they've got Funko Pops.

579
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:57,900
Well, we'll get to the big reveal at the end.

580
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,900
Let's do some vintage Woodfield.

581
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,900
Oh, yeah, let's see what this place used to look like back in the days of that commercial.

582
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,900
Oh, so beautiful.

583
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,900
There was a bunch of ramps and cool stuff.

584
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,900
And then there was these giant crescent moon sculptures.

585
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,900
Yeah.

586
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,900
Which everyone is cooing about it.

587
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,900
It's a little more boring now.

588
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:30,900
And there are like what replaces these crescent moons is like a big screen with a tweet about where Angelina Jolie says she's been sad lately.

589
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,900
That's literally what I saw in the courtyard.

590
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,900
Not progress.

591
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,900
Go back to the moons.

592
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,900
Yeah.

593
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:45,900
Well, we also saw like the one massive like center of the mall was there's a lot of different vertical and horizontal lines.

594
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:50,900
And they were all covered in black and red Batwoman logos.

595
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,900
And it was very unnerving.

596
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:57,900
Apparently a cast member of Batwoman was making an appearance there today.

597
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,900
Today. Did anyone go meet Cameras Johnson?

598
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,900
You could have done both.

599
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,900
Him and us.

600
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,900
What a day.

601
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,900
So, yeah, it's like a lot less fun.

602
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,900
Like I do.

603
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:14,900
I mean, everything, everything mall-wise seems like it used to be a little more fun.

604
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,900
Like these days, very everything seems more practical.

605
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,900
Yeah.

606
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,900
But they got those ramps, those ramps and those sky bridges.

607
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:27,900
And there's the upper level and the lower level, but then weird sporadic intermediate levels.

608
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,900
What what are you talking about?

609
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,900
It's like hitting levels in a video game.

610
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,900
Incredible.

611
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:37,900
So if you don't know what we're talking about, that would feel mall, you know, like most it is two levels.

612
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:44,900
There's two floors, except on one part when they split into three floors, but it doesn't go all the way around.

613
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:50,900
They just decided to make the part with the McDonald's a secret middle floor.

614
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,900
Hard to like you are to find McDonald's.

615
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:58,900
It's very short with a play place in it, which is new.

616
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,900
I'll be honest with you.

617
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,900
I was upset with it.

618
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,900
I was upset to see that because I longed for a play place in that McDonald's as a child.

619
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,900
It was only a place.

620
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,900
The cool thing about it was you could get like sometimes they would test out pizza and hot dogs there.

621
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,900
Yes. You know what I'm talking about?

622
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,900
Yes.

623
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,900
I want to say some of these facts a section of the audience has been responding to with.

624
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:24,900
Yeah, like like like we had just said, like, you know, Christ is king.

625
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,900
Amen, brother.

626
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,900
Like it's a call and response.

627
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,900
I mean, I assume most of the things we say on the podcast, people go, yeah.

628
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,900
Yeah.

629
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,900
Yeah.

630
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,900
Like listening to a mildly interesting conversation.

631
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,900
Yeah. Munch Munch's Make Believe Band is really good.

632
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,900
Yep.

633
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:58,900
But I think if we go a little bit forward, we start getting into the the insanity and the pop culture clashes that make this place so vibrant and exciting because the opening opening day was a big deal in in the 70s.

634
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,900
Seventy one maybe I could be wrong about the year.

635
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:08,900
So yeah. So like you when you open something, you want some of the biggest names of the day to open the open a mall like this.

636
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:16,900
And of course, they got Vincent Price and Robert Goulet's wife.

637
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,900
And don't forget to not one but two marching bands.

638
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:26,900
Yes. I can't remember the other one, but the Conan marching band is a who.

639
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:31,900
Hey, now I want to show Conan is here tonight.

640
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:36,900
I went to Schomburg High School, Conan arrival high school.

641
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:42,900
So nothing boils my blood like hearing the marching band of Conan got to play the opening of this.

642
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,900
Should have had a football flew right over his head.

643
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,900
He should have tackled you.

644
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,900
Yeah, that's true.

645
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,900
So yeah, they open they open Woodfield.

646
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,900
Is this a good time maybe to talk about some of the other celebrity presence?

647
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,900
Oh, yeah. Let's do that.

648
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,900
Okay. So many stars.

649
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,900
All your favorite stars have been to the Woodfield Mall.

650
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:11,900
Not in October 1976, soon to be former president Gerald Ford visited the Woodfield Mall in nineteen in nineteen seventy six.

651
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:16,900
Also, John Travolta, then in the height of his powers on Welcome Back.

652
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:23,900
I have signed a lot of accounts of just mobs of screaming girls following John Travolta around young just like today.

653
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,900
Nothing has changed in 1982.

654
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:33,900
Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared in the Woodfield Mall to promote Conan the Barbarian, but it was very poorly promoted.

655
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:41,900
So less than 10 people showed up and Arnold casually walked away.

656
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,900
Let's hear quick hits.

657
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,900
Gabe Kaplan.

658
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,900
Also, so much Carter.

659
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,900
Wow. So much of Carter.

660
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,900
Richard Dean Anderson.

661
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:56,900
And then my favorite thing in 1974, also eventful time, the the Great Kiss Off was held.

662
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,900
Has anyone heard of this?

663
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:06,900
There was an event where they tried to top the Guinness Book of World Records for longest continuous kiss.

664
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,900
And this was overseen by the band Kiss.

665
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:16,900
Yeah, I could find no record of them actually doing that.

666
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,900
I could find no record of them actually doing anything.

667
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,900
And it very well may have been their doubles.

668
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:29,900
But two people kissed for over one hundred and fourteen hours.

669
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,900
One hundred and fourteen hours.

670
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,900
What kissing?

671
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,900
I think a lot of people in the room like kissing.

672
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,900
But yeah, who likes kissing?

673
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,900
That's a level we the good boys are comfortable with.

674
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,900
Yes. But that's it.

675
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,900
We no more.

676
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,900
But one hundred and fourteen hours.

677
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:56,900
That's a long I would say more than 90 seconds on a kiss.

678
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,900
You're probably getting tired of it anyway.

679
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,900
I could be wrong.

680
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:06,900
So we just learned Scott's limit for kissing.

681
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,900
I hate kissing.

682
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,900
You got to breathe too.

683
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:18,900
Scott sets a 90 second timer and he hits it and then he goes kissing.

684
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,900
And we are done.

685
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,900
Thank you for kissing me.

686
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:26,900
This has been Scott's great kiss off.

687
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,900
Oh, my God.

688
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,900
And real quick concerts.

689
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,900
OK, some really good ones. Ray Charles, Tony Bennett, Tiffany.

690
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,900
We have mall rock Tiffany Sticks.

691
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:42,900
Chicago native sticks performed at the House of Lewis clothing store.

692
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,900
Why?

693
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,900
And also I'm stepping into it with this.

694
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:53,900
But in 2013 to open the Microsoft store, Weezer performed.

695
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,900
Scott's band arch enemy is Weezer.

696
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,900
Well, it was a set that included no covers.

697
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,900
So I'm fine.

698
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,900
Yes. Nothing.

699
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,900
Which is the cover?

700
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,900
Oh, oh, oh.

701
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,900
I want to get off you off on a tangent.

702
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,900
No, no, that's not.

703
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:14,900
But it's it's when Weezer covers Africa because and I correct me if I'm wrong.

704
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:23,900
It's that they went for the cheap midi style since and didn't use the real since since that Toto used when recording.

705
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,900
This sounds terrible.

706
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:30,900
And it's just really in a front to the legacy of David Page and Steve Picaro and the incredible sounds they pioneered.

707
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,900
Am I right?

708
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,900
You're right.

709
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,900
Glad to have support, even if you didn't actually know what I was talking about.

710
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,900
Yeah. So they played.

711
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:45,900
They open with the song Greatest Man Who Ever Lived, which is one of my favorite Bad Weezer songs.

712
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,900
No.

713
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,900
Does anyone know that song?

714
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,900
Yeah. OK.

715
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,900
Really? Four people?

716
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,900
I would have assumed 15 at least.

717
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:58,900
Mike, why don't you get up and perform it and put your hands wherever you feel?

718
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:11,900
The I will say that's there's a spoken word section of that song where he says, like, if you don't like it, you can shove it, but you don't like it.

719
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,900
You love it.

720
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,900
And he does it like all dead.

721
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:26,900
So, yeah, anyway, that's a word that I when I think of Rivers Cuomo now, the first word that comes to mind is cool.

722
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,900
So that was that was 2013.

723
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,900
Yeah. Yeah.

724
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,900
Yeah. What's what's next in the slideshow?

725
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,900
Well, I have a little bit.

726
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:39,900
There's a first I found a picture of a scary cop looking at the mall.

727
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:52,900
It looks if you've ever seen the photos from when Stanley Kubrick was like a news photographer before he directed movies and they're all like strangely evocative.

728
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:59,900
That is what this photo of a mall security guard looking down on a center plaza looks like.

729
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,900
Yeah. So I don't know.

730
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,900
I just thought it was I thought it was scary.

731
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,900
So I put it in. Yeah.

732
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:09,900
Yes. Here's my probably my favorite other than as a child going to KB Toys.

733
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,900
My favorite part of the mall is not there anymore.

734
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:18,900
There was a waterfall and like fish tanks and it was like a little secret.

735
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,900
I know it's hard to see this.

736
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,900
It was a little like kind of secret entrance.

737
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,900
You walk downstairs.

738
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:29,900
There was a waterfall and then fish tanks and it was such a cool little weird imagineered kind of a thing.

739
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,900
There's no reason practically to have it in a mall other than just ambiance.

740
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,900
And like this is the stuff that malls are getting rid of.

741
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,900
Is the there was a waterfall at Stratford Square.

742
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,900
My room held me out.

743
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,900
Yeah. Yeah.

744
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,900
Where there was a movie theater under the waterfall.

745
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,900
Which is amazing.

746
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:54,900
And it's gone stripped away all the heart and soul taken out of these malls.

747
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,900
Could not make out the movies because they were projected through the waterfall.

748
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,900
So like so yeah.

749
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,900
So anyway that that is gone.

750
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:09,900
That has been replaced by a Comcast booth I believe.

751
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:13,900
And there's like there's maybe like locker storage there as well.

752
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,900
Yeah I know it's very sad.

753
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,900
But I was yelling I was like telling I was like I think that's where the waterfall was yesterday.

754
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,900
It's probably also wrong.

755
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,900
So that's that's another picture of the waterfall.

756
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:32,900
I think that one of the things that struck me is like Schomburg just has so much like shop.

757
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:39,900
Like this mall is so big and I looked up the size of the city Schomburg is about seventy four thousand people.

758
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:51,900
And from what I could find looking online cities of that size like Kalamazoo Michigan and Bethlehem Pennsylvania do not have malls of this size.

759
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:56,900
They have like a few malls but not like something this massive.

760
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,900
Well that's because we got it all.

761
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,900
Yeah.

762
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,900
Nice.

763
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,900
That explains that.

764
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,900
Yeah.

765
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:13,900
So yeah it's the thing I was gonna say like the amount of chain restaurants in that area is truly mind boggling.

766
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:20,900
It's like the Dubai of mid-level chain restaurants like just excess everywhere.

767
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,900
But the excess isn't like so much money.

768
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:34,900
It's you know like as many different kinds of mozzarella stick appetizers as you and your parents and grandparents could eat because you're celebrating someone graduating.

769
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,900
Like it's just anything you can imagine any type of mozzarella stick.

770
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:45,900
Well should we talk about what might be the most valiant attempt at a chain restaurant.

771
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,900
Probably start with a big the craziest thing that they tried to do.

772
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:50,900
Yeah.

773
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:57,900
This this this is saying it's this is one of the things that definitely piqued my interest because we're talking about a place that only had two locations and one of them in Schomburg.

774
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,900
Yes.

775
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,900
I hear some murmuring people know what it is.

776
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,900
It was out of this world.

777
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,900
It was Mars 2112.

778
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,900
Yeah.

779
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,900
People know it.

780
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,900
It lasted Jason how long again.

781
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:22,900
So it opened in like October of one year and then it closed in November the following year.

782
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,900
And never reopened.

783
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:32,900
And we can we will we will vow to you there will be a full two and a half hour episode about Mars 2112.

784
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,900
Eventually.

785
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,900
Who do you think we are.

786
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,900
And also will vow to you there will be a two and a half hour episode about that waterfall I talked about.

787
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,900
Yeah.

788
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,900
All of it will get done.

789
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,900
But yes Mars 2112.

790
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:52,900
Which was built in the former Plit movie theater which was also the former ice rink.

791
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,900
Incredible zone in this place.

792
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,900
Yes.

793
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,900
I saw movies at that movie theater.

794
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:04,900
It was the first place I saw the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movie poster as a youth as a youth.

795
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,900
I was looking at the posters and I saw the Ninja Turtles and I flipped out.

796
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:15,900
So maybe you stopped and kissed it for 90 seconds.

797
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,900
Very good.

798
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:17,900
Just enough.

799
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,900
Just enough time.

800
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:25,900
But so all right Mars 2112 obviously a Mars themed restaurant.

801
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:32,900
There was another one in Times Square that made it way longer but it was also a restaurant that had a well let me read from this little list.

802
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,900
Lava pools a shuttle ride for 32 guests.

803
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:44,900
There was actually a 747 flight simulator used to train pilots and it rocked and swayed as if the passengers were on a trip to Mars.

804
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:53,900
So before you could go eat a meal you had to sit in the simulator ride for three and a half minutes where you went through what they called a trans lunar wormhole.

805
00:46:54,900 --> 00:47:00,900
So fuck up your stomach and then eat deep fried whatever you'd like.

806
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,900
From the reviews garbage very good.

807
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:04,900
What.

808
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:05,900
Oh what.

809
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,900
Now what I read.

810
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,900
Maybe Times Square is different.

811
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:08,900
OK.

812
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,900
New York City you know.

813
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,900
Yeah they are much more comfortable in a lunar simulator.

814
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:16,900
Yeah.

815
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:22,900
Well and there were some differences between the locations and this might have been key to why Times Square lasted so much longer.

816
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:29,900
Times Square they've been going for a little bit and one of the big keys to the success of it was an arcade area called Cyber Street.

817
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:35,900
So if we're going to do a second Mars 2112 we got to do another Cyber Street right.

818
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:42,900
For some reason the Schomburg zoning board of appeals voted for to to to deny a permit to Cyber Street.

819
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:48,900
The city chased Cyber Street away and thus there was no arcade.

820
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:49,900
Yeah.

821
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,900
Why.

822
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,900
Why would they allow the simulator and the lava pools and the restaurant but no arcade.

823
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:01,900
Well in the ruling was a mixed use issue but it seems to me a ride is another use.

824
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:02,900
Yeah.

825
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:06,900
Fire the Schomburg Board of Appeals impeach them all.

826
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,900
Yeah we'll do and it will find whoever made that decision and interview them on the episode.

827
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,900
Yes.

828
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,900
I'm sure they remember it.

829
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,900
Why do you hate democracy.

830
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,900
So sir.

831
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:21,900
I feel like you guys have some information about the man the man responsible for.

832
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:31,900
Oh I just saw a snippet that it was it was an Irish businessman and the newspaper article about the Times Square location suddenly closing very quickly.

833
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:38,900
It's described it as like a man who fraud seems to follow.

834
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,900
Which I mean 20 years ago that was an insult.

835
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:47,900
Now you can become president of the United States if Rod follows you.

836
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,900
I don't want to jump in anything in the slide.

837
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,900
What's around the corner here.

838
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:57,900
Well there's just some photos of Mars 2112.

839
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,900
See if you can make out that.

840
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,900
It looks really good.

841
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,900
Yeah what you're seeing is something that looks really good.

842
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:10,900
We tried to find the names of the aliens and did not come up successful.

843
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:15,900
So on a future episode hopefully someone will have sent us the handbook like the employee handbook.

844
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,900
But we are not seeing the aliens yet.

845
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:22,900
You need to know you all need to meet the aliens.

846
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,900
Yeah.

847
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:28,900
Hard to describe this for the product pockets because I'm right next to it and it's being projected on brick.

848
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:33,900
So I can't fill it in extremely cool aliens with that suffice.

849
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:34,900
Yeah.

850
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,900
Here's a here's one.

851
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:47,900
This is like what's the opposite of imagination.

852
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:55,900
The opposite of imagineer is that like dreaded near that like nightmare near nightmare.

853
00:49:55,900 --> 00:50:01,900
This this looks like if I assume a female just because of its pink and purple.

854
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,900
There's three eyes.

855
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,900
It has like I assume that's a space bow and its hair.

856
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,900
And then yeah.

857
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:18,900
I will say this I thought the costumes would look worse and they look bad.

858
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:19,900
Yeah.

859
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,900
So they could be worse.

860
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,900
So yes the next one the one you the next one one.

861
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:29,900
So this is something I just happened upon.

862
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:34,900
You know famous people have to eat.

863
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,900
They got to go into trans lunar wormholes to.

864
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:38,900
Yeah they have to do that.

865
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:46,900
So obviously like a famous person you know we mentioned former president Gerald Ford made an appearance at Woodfield.

866
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,900
I'm not sure if this picture was taken in Times Square.

867
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:52,900
I'm assuming it was it would make sense.

868
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:58,900
But here's a photo of one of the aliens with Bill Clinton.

869
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:07,900
And I mean as you can guess that alien is on the flight logs that alien is on the Epstein logs.

870
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,900
Yeah.

871
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:14,900
The space the spaceship flight logs.

872
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,900
It was just X's and Z's and 9's.

873
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,900
That's his name.

874
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:25,900
This is Space Epstein on the left.

875
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,900
Where is Space Epstein.

876
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,900
I know he's with just Lane.

877
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,900
OK.

878
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,900
Space just Lane space just Lane.

879
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:33,900
Excuse me.

880
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,900
He teleported out of the cell.

881
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:36,900
Yeah.

882
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,900
So oh that would explain it.

883
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:48,900
That's why that would explain the cameras not working that explain the guard the guard who wasn't a guard was obviously the alien morphed into something.

884
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:49,900
Jeffrey disappeared.

885
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:50,900
Yes.

886
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,900
Yeah.

887
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,900
Teleporting thing.

888
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:53,900
Yeah.

889
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,900
Should we the menu items.

890
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:55,900
I don't know if you guys have any of those already.

891
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:56,900
You have those.

892
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:57,900
Oh yeah you have those.

893
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:02,900
Well I mean we always love because you don't have time to read these whole menus as much as we'd love to.

894
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,900
But I like when they group them into different areas.

895
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:05,900
Here's appetizer.

896
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,900
Here's a main course blah blah.

897
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:08,900
You got first contact.

898
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:13,900
You got primary orbit and then dessert sweet planets.

899
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:19,900
They gave up.

900
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:26,900
With all of those like felt like we did the episode about Marvel mania which was the Marvel themed restaurant.

901
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:36,900
It does seem like they people run out of steam when they're coming up with them because it'll be like you know the ant adamantium artichoke or whatever.

902
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:37,900
And then you're like oh that's pretty good.

903
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,900
And then it'll just be like hero sauce.

904
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:46,900
You're like well that was you just got people in a room just got like whatever.

905
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:47,900
They're heroes right.

906
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:48,900
Hero sauce.

907
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:49,900
Who cares.

908
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,900
Hulk bread.

909
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:55,900
Space drink.

910
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:04,900
So Mars journey 1-12 one of a litany of things that closed within two years.

911
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,900
We don't have a slide for this one so I'll just name check it real fast.

912
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:14,900
So there was an attempt at you know a cousin of the competitor to the Disney store the Nickelodeon Superstore.

913
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:23,900
It was only it was open for less than two years in the Woodfield Mall and the only real tangible information I could find out about it is that all the benches in the store were whoopee cushions.

914
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:30,900
And all the employees in the store must have then been suicidal.

915
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:42,900
There there are a lot of what we found is like in Woodfield there are a lot of like ideas and concepts that were tried out and like almost across the board.

916
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:47,900
They tried them out and they went no way we will not roll this out nationwide.

917
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,900
This is not going to make us any money.

918
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:53,900
Well is this a good time then to talk about Disney's version of that.

919
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:54,900
Sure.

920
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:55,900
Yeah.

921
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:56,900
Zoom over here.

922
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,900
Yes sure.

923
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:03,900
I'll just I'll just put the first picture up like Mickey's kitchen.

924
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,900
Anyone did anyone go to Mickey's kitchen.

925
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:07,900
Hey all right.

926
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,900
You know more than us because we didn't there's not a lot of photos.

927
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,900
It's not a lot to learn about it.

928
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,900
There were all again there were only two of these second one in Schomburg.

929
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:21,900
They tried it in Montclair California and they tried in Schomburg Illinois open for less than a year.

930
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,900
It was next to the Disney store.

931
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,900
I guess people did not want to eat soupity doodah.

932
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:33,900
And people didn't really understand the tagline of everybody's got a lunching place.

933
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,900
That's not.

934
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,900
That's not right.

935
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,900
No no no.

936
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:46,900
The other similarly tortured one supercalifragid chicken salad.

937
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:50,900
You talk about giving up towards the end of the menu.

938
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,900
That's they bailed in the name.

939
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,900
They didn't get to it should be listed.

940
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:00,900
They turn list stick into chicken doesn't scan at all.

941
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,900
It's not a chicken salad.

942
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,900
It's a chicken salad.

943
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,900
It's a chicken salad.

944
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,900
It's a chicken salad.

945
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,900
It's a chicken salad.

946
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,900
It's a chicken salad.

947
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:16,900
The list stick into chicken doesn't scan at all.

948
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:17,900
Make any sense.

949
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:27,900
Disney's kitchen fell under the regional entertainment umbrella that also had the ESPN zone and Disney Quest.

950
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:33,900
Famously successful reviewed businesses.

951
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:40,900
Disney Quest of course opened two locations in Orlando and one right here in Chicago.

952
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:54,900
And the one in my hometown of Philadelphia as we've talked about before they just stopped construction odd and it's remained a parking lot to this day.

953
00:55:54,900 --> 00:56:00,900
How many people did go to Disney Quest here and got sick on something.

954
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:01,900
All right.

955
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:06,900
Is there a way to can with one word convey what made you sick.

956
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,900
It's more of a story three words three were quick.

957
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:11,900
Yeah.

958
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:12,900
Aladdin's magic carpet.

959
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,900
Yeah that's probably it.

960
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,900
I don't want to make people shout shout a story.

961
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:17,900
Sure.

962
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,900
Wait Mike did you ever go to the Chicago Disney Quest.

963
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,900
No we did not go.

964
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,900
I don't remember why.

965
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:26,900
I'm not going to blame my parents.

966
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,900
I don't know if it's their fault or not.

967
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,900
It might be but I'm not.

968
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,900
I can't say with certainty that it was.

969
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:34,900
So I won't say it.

970
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,900
We did go in Florida though.

971
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,900
We did that.

972
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:41,900
I want to go be in a weird windowless weird box.

973
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,900
And you did get sick in Florida.

974
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,900
I got very.

975
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:52,900
Yeah I got sick on the Aladdin's VR thing which is something I in my mind was like this is going to be the coolest thing I've ever done.

976
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,900
Virtual reality is amazing.

977
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:06,900
I got on there this blocky like sub Nintendo 64 level graphics like trying to maneuver a magic carpet and then 30 seconds in I had a horrible headache and felt like I wanted to throw up.

978
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:10,900
And then we had to get on a plane two hours later.

979
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:14,900
And I remember like finally I ate a sandwich and I felt a little better.

980
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:21,900
But like you didn't jam in the full family style dinner before.

981
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:29,900
We are going to Orlando and someone threw out in case you don't know last time I was in Orlando I.

982
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,900
Yeah.

983
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,900
I feel like we should be doing more applause callbacks.

984
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:49,900
Last time I was in Orlando I half accidentally ordered an all you can eat meal for a family of four.

985
00:57:52,900 --> 00:58:03,900
Because when you go to Liberty Tree Tavern and Magic Kingdom generally as a family that's eating and they don't adjust the portions for a single man in his 30s.

986
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:09,900
So the first thing they brought out was four large pieces of bread.

987
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:14,900
And I think I ate two and then they just brought me the same portions that a family would eat.

988
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:19,900
And I had a flight to catch within two and a half hours flights are cursed.

989
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,900
You said you might do it again.

990
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:25,900
For the content.

991
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,900
Mike Carlson can go home again.

992
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:31,900
He can go.

993
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:32,900
He can come to Chicago.

994
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,900
He can return to Liberty.

995
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,900
I am going to play the Diddy song that I played when I came out.

996
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:43,900
I'm going to wear this letterman jacket and enter Liberty Tree Tavern.

997
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:49,900
And you're going to make the employees go like where is that music coming from.

998
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,900
What is that in your hand.

999
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,900
That glass they have to play along.

1000
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:58,900
But hey thankfully in 2019 you don't have to worry about getting sick from V.R.

1001
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,900
Aladdin because we we all got to experience V.R.

1002
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:07,900
Aladdin thanks to visionary director Guy Ritchie at our local Cineplex.

1003
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:09,900
Yeah that's true.

1004
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,900
We all went on a magic carpet ride.

1005
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:12,900
Very memorable.

1006
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,900
It's like Nassim Padrat is in the room with you.

1007
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,900
This there was this other weird Disney.

1008
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,900
I'll keep this quick because it's very dry.

1009
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:31,900
There was this other weird Disney thing that they attempted in the Woodfield Mall that again was not open for very long.

1010
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,900
And it is you will see how dry this is.

1011
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,900
It's called Disney's doorway to dreams.

1012
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:38,900
Oh yeah.

1013
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:39,900
This was a.

1014
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:40,900
I'll give you a sec.

1015
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:41,900
Here you go.

1016
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,900
The majesty of Disney's doorway to.

1017
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:44,900
Whoa.

1018
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:45,900
People gasp.

1019
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:48,900
Oh like a sense memory came into your head.

1020
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,900
It was real again.

1021
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:57,900
You got to experience the wonder of this which was a timeshare presentation.

1022
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:07,900
Permanently in the mall where you could walk around fake hotel rooms with like a fake window that shows the contemporary and fireworks.

1023
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:17,900
It is Chicago like we kept talking about as we were looking up Chicago so it's like it is a testing ground because it's like a major metropolitan area but it's smack dab in the middle of the country.

1024
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,900
So you can get like honest feedback from regular people.

1025
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,900
And I feel like you people in Chicago like to tell it as it is right.

1026
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:28,900
Yeah.

1027
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,900
Did you say tell it as it is.

1028
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:31,900
As it is.

1029
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,900
Isn't it tell it like it is.

1030
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,900
Well both work.

1031
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:36,900
It's fine.

1032
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:37,900
Yeah that's true.

1033
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:38,900
They do.

1034
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:39,900
Yeah.

1035
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,900
I just I don't want to side note too much.

1036
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:47,900
We have a limited amount of time but I did just do a presentation at the Disneyland Resort in order to get four free fast passes.

1037
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:54,900
So I toured a fake hotel room in the parking lot of the Disneyland Hotel and was given on.

1038
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,900
It took about an hour and a half.

1039
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:01,900
And I am thinking about doing it in Orlando because they offered me 50 bucks.

1040
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:07,900
And again that's we can milk two hours out of that.

1041
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:08,900
Yeah sure.

1042
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:09,900
On an episode.

1043
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:11,900
So yeah I do remember this.

1044
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,900
I don't think I ever went in here.

1045
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:14,900
I don't think we ever went in this.

1046
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:15,900
I think we should.

1047
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:25,900
How could you not have to not only miss time share presentations but also miss a performance from a character.

1048
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:29,900
I think we may have found the most obscure least liked Disney character of all time.

1049
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:36,900
This is a character called DVC a female character.

1050
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,900
She's got red hair.

1051
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:48,900
She's the DV DEVYC and DVC if you don't know stands for Disney Vacation Club.

1052
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:53,900
So they turn it into the very like you know typical human name DVC.

1053
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:57,900
And they would do this in like they would take you away from the little time.

1054
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:01,900
Sure place and then fill up the the improv at the Woodfield Muggers.

1055
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:05,900
There's an improv comedy theater where guess who's playing soon Jim.

1056
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:17,900
Next week Jim Belushi and the board of comedy which obviously we all know what that phrase means again.

1057
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,900
I hope they have a lot of thoughts about the PC.

1058
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:28,900
Yeah this weekend you can see Godfrey and you could probably catch the late show tonight if you get a move on.

1059
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:29,900
Oh yeah yeah go check it out.

1060
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:32,900
If you want to leave early to catch Godfrey go now.

1061
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:33,900
We understand.

1062
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,900
We're really screwing the action boys by saying that.

1063
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,900
Action boys coming up after us.

1064
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:39,900
Oh yeah sure.

1065
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:41,900
Anybody staying around for action boys.

1066
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:42,900
Hey all right.

1067
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,900
But so DVC yeah okay.

1068
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:46,900
So Disney character.

1069
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:50,900
Yeah but that being said if they sold the DVC toy I will buy it.

1070
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:58,900
Yeah I was like I did not know DVC existed until 12 hours ago 24 hours ago.

1071
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:04,900
I would pay up to 50 50 75 dollars for the TV.

1072
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:07,900
A timeshare worth the more obscure character the better.

1073
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:12,900
We are still waiting for them to make at least a hundred dollar Michael Eisner doll.

1074
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:13,900
Yeah.

1075
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:14,900
Oh yeah.

1076
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:15,900
We would all purchase that.

1077
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:22,900
They have not written back to our certified letters to Michael Eisner's home saying can we make a doll of you sir.

1078
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:24,900
That didn't go over well.

1079
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:25,900
I don't know why.

1080
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:27,900
I don't know why.

1081
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:28,900
I don't know why.

1082
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:29,900
I don't know why.

1083
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:30,900
I don't know why.

1084
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:31,900
I don't know why.

1085
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:32,900
That didn't go over well.

1086
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:33,900
I don't know why.

1087
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:35,900
I know.

1088
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,900
I won't say how I know where his office is though.

1089
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,900
In Beverly Hills that's not that is not a threat.

1090
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:48,900
I'm just I'm just saying I know the exact location where he works.

1091
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:56,900
Also you could figure that out with like three websites like you can all right you can find it.

1092
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:58,900
What might be proud of his sleuthing.

1093
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:00,900
Yeah I was I was trying to be.

1094
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:01,900
I mean you were there you were there.

1095
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:02,900
It's better you were there.

1096
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:03,900
I'm sad now.

1097
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:04,900
All right.

1098
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:07,900
But think of cradling an Eisner doll.

1099
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:08,900
Oh I'm happy.

1100
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:09,900
It would make you.

1101
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,900
Feed him a little bottle.

1102
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:13,900
Yeah.

1103
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,900
Wait a minute is he going to have ties for him.

1104
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:19,900
Is it like those Disney dolls where it's like baby poo.

1105
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:20,900
Yeah.

1106
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:21,900
It's like baby Eisner.

1107
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:22,900
Yeah.

1108
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,900
That's another toy I would buy.

1109
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,900
I would spend more money for baby Eisner.

1110
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:35,900
With like a weird like like feed him like bottle and he would like poop in a diaper.

1111
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:40,900
Dear sir we would love to make a doll baby version of you.

1112
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:44,900
I know where he works.

1113
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:46,900
I'll do it.

1114
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:47,900
I'll hand deliver the letter.

1115
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:51,900
And 70 drawings of what this would look like.

1116
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,900
And the pooping doll prototype.

1117
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:57,900
Throw it through his window.

1118
01:04:58,900 --> 01:04:59,900
Wrapped up with a rock.

1119
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:00,900
All right.

1120
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:03,900
I think we should start getting to the place that we spent most of our time.

1121
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,900
Currently vibrant themed entertainment experience.

1122
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,900
Let me really quickly name check a couple of things that they used to have.

1123
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:11,900
Guys through Phil through the throw in others.

1124
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:15,900
Before there was Cinnabon Woodfield Mall at a place called T.J. Cinnamons.

1125
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,900
Also another character I would want a doll of.

1126
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:23,900
I don't know what he looks like but I love him.

1127
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,900
He poops cinnamon poops.

1128
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:27,900
Yeah.

1129
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:31,900
That place was said to be a favorite of Senator Bob Dole.

1130
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:39,900
There was a restaurant called Tiffany's Bakery where you could get something called the Cookie Credit Card Club.

1131
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,900
You could I guess enroll in the Cookie Credit Card Club.

1132
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:46,900
That caused the financial crash in 2008.

1133
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:50,900
They're buying houses with cookies.

1134
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:51,900
What's going on.

1135
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:52,900
What's going on.

1136
01:05:54,900 --> 01:06:01,900
And with my last they have a place called Hot Sam's where you could get a giant pretzel covered with ham and cheese.

1137
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:04,900
What's the verdict on that Jason?

1138
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:08,900
Yeah Jason what do you think of pretzel covered in hot ham and cheese.

1139
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:10,900
I'd have to really see.

1140
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,900
I'd have to see the quality of the ham.

1141
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,900
I bet if it's from Chicago it's good.

1142
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:18,900
Yeah.

1143
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:20,900
I love these cheap.

1144
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:22,900
Why are you reaching for these cheap pops.

1145
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:24,900
Authentic Chicago ham.

1146
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:34,900
I think the thing that struck me I find found out about Woodfield that I thought was very interesting and you guys were like what who cares.

1147
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,900
Let's let the audience decide.

1148
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:46,900
At one point Woodfield was sold to CalPERS which is the California Public Employees Retirement Savings.

1149
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:59,900
So they managed the pension and health care plans for 1.6 million public employees in California and they just owned a giant mall in Illinois.

1150
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:03,900
So that probably went well.

1151
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:05,900
That's weird. What is the name.

1152
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:07,900
CalPERS.

1153
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:08,900
How do you spell that.

1154
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,900
C-A-L-P-E-R-S.

1155
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:16,900
I thought he was he said CalPERS which is the name of a gland in the male reproductive system.

1156
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:18,900
Oh yeah.

1157
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:19,900
The CalPERS gland.

1158
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:20,900
We know it.

1159
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,900
Your mom is here.

1160
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,900
That's not as dirty of a gland.

1161
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:29,900
It's a more functional gland.

1162
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,900
But I think I think with all that.

1163
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:38,900
Oh they also have to used to have a little girl makeover place called Club Libby Lou.

1164
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:39,900
Yes.

1165
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:47,900
And for our thoughts on that get ready for the downtown Disney ordeal coming as soon as we're done with our little tour.

1166
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:49,900
Lots of Club Libby Lou.

1167
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:55,900
Get your asses ready for little girl makeover places.

1168
01:07:56,900 --> 01:08:05,900
We spend a lot of time on Club Libby Lou and then a much more religious competitor of it which I can't think of the name of off the top of my head.

1169
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:06,900
But they were mad.

1170
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,900
They thought Club Libby Lou was like sinful.

1171
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:11,900
So anyway that's just a tease for the.

1172
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,900
Tease. Get ready.

1173
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:18,900
But let's let's take you to the main place that we've left a couple out and including one that people guessed.

1174
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:22,900
But I don't think the place that we spent most of our time is the one that a lot of people guessed.

1175
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:23,900
At least not the people I heard.

1176
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:25,900
Should we reveal this.

1177
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:28,900
This picture is of the old logo so I apologize.

1178
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:29,900
Oh right right right.

1179
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,900
Back when it had a different confusing name.

1180
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,900
Here is what it looks like.

1181
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,900
It is to say yeah.

1182
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:42,900
Two five seven doesn't really tell you what it is but look real close at that five.

1183
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:43,900
That's it.

1184
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:45,900
It's angled weird but it's not an ordinary five.

1185
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,900
That's a Pac Man.

1186
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:51,900
Because now they have a thing called Pac Man Entertainment.

1187
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:56,900
It's like a Dave and Buster's in a restaurant but called Pac Man Entertainment.

1188
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,900
And it is as possible.

1189
01:08:58,900 --> 01:08:59,900
It is massive.

1190
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:00,900
Yeah.

1191
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:01,900
Yeah.

1192
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:03,900
Man who has been to Pac Man Entertainment.

1193
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:06,900
That's a smattering.

1194
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:07,900
Mm hmm.

1195
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:08,900
Working great.

1196
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:09,900
So it's working great.

1197
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:12,900
There is a like fancy ish look in bowling alley.

1198
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:19,900
There is a full restaurant that has walls to prevent you from like access it like.

1199
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:27,900
Yeah they're almost like like shields from the gaming like you're eating in a little box.

1200
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:33,900
And it's got a much more like drab color scheme and then like naked mannequin women who welcome you into it.

1201
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:35,900
Even though it's a Pac Man place.

1202
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:36,900
Yes.

1203
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:39,900
People seem like more horrified by this place so far.

1204
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:40,900
Yeah.

1205
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:42,900
It ended up being fun.

1206
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:46,900
I can tell you there's a connect four thing where you shoot basketballs and that's part of the connect four.

1207
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:47,900
That's pretty cool.

1208
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:48,900
Yeah.

1209
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:51,900
And then a restaurant right in the middle that looks like the bar from The Shining.

1210
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:55,900
Wow.

1211
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:56,900
Yeah.

1212
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:57,900
It does look like there's a lot of gay.

1213
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:58,900
Yeah.

1214
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:09,900
Part of it's Dave and Buster is part of its bowling alley part of it's shining and like it's it's the Dave and Buster's has a lot of different games and it's all you can win tickets.

1215
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:13,900
And it is we we play games.

1216
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:23,900
There was one game where you have to like throw ping pong balls to change like squares colors all within 30 seconds which I did and it's the greatest moment of my life.

1217
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:24,900
I got it.

1218
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:27,900
I won the game and I think I squealed.

1219
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:29,900
Yeah.

1220
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:32,900
I walked over and you were like I really like this.

1221
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,900
We put it on the letterman jacket.

1222
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:36,900
We were very excited.

1223
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,900
Ping pong game.

1224
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:42,900
Before we have before we wrap that up you got to hear about our meal right.

1225
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:43,900
Yes.

1226
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:44,900
You got it.

1227
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:45,900
Sure.

1228
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:46,900
At the top of the show.

1229
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:47,900
OK.

1230
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:56,900
So they we we sat down and we asked what is your Pac Man themed stuff because I thought they had a lot of Pac Man themed stuff and they did drinks wise.

1231
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:59,900
They had a drink for every ghost.

1232
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:03,900
But all of those drinks had like eight ingredients.

1233
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,900
So those were not for me.

1234
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:07,900
Mike I don't think you even part took.

1235
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:09,900
I had a headache last night.

1236
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:10,900
All right.

1237
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,900
So I had a drink that I hadn't eaten very much.

1238
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:18,900
So I instead waited till we got to Bahama Breeze and ordered a what is it called Mark.

1239
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:19,900
What is it.

1240
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:20,900
It was not a margarita.

1241
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,900
It was a it was like a margarita or something.

1242
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:25,900
It was very fun and it was a frozen drink.

1243
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,900
So I waited till then.

1244
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:30,900
So even I did not have my usual multicolor drink there.

1245
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:31,900
I'm sorry.

1246
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:33,900
I have let everyone down.

1247
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:34,900
Yeah.

1248
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:36,900
A reason to come back.

1249
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:39,900
I want to get every ghost drink and then we'll be downstairs.

1250
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,900
We also stopped in briefly at the rain far.

1251
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,900
We walked around the rain forest cafe.

1252
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:44,900
We did.

1253
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:45,900
We didn't leave it.

1254
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:50,900
We saw like at the owner of the rain forest cafe.

1255
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:56,900
Of course part of the Landry family is a scary looking man.

1256
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:58,900
He owns the Houston Rockets as well.

1257
01:11:58,900 --> 01:11:59,900
And do you have a picture of this.

1258
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,900
I forgot to put it on here.

1259
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:02,900
I have the name.

1260
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:05,900
The book is called like Shut Up and Listen.

1261
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:07,900
Oh, it is called Shut Up and Listen.

1262
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:08,900
Yeah.

1263
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:12,900
And he looks like he is going to kick your ass.

1264
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:23,900
And we spent a few minutes imagining scenarios of like a guy who works at FYE like just kind of rudderless and like they're not closing down but they're not doing well.

1265
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:31,900
So he's just drinking at the rain forest cafe because he gets a discount and then he buys that book to turn his life around.

1266
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:34,900
And he's like trying to sketch other ideas for I got to have another idea for a restaurant.

1267
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,900
OK. What about Arctic animals?

1268
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:37,900
Oh, yeah.

1269
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:38,900
The Arctic Cafe.

1270
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:42,900
Honey, honey, what do you think about polar bear while you eat?

1271
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,900
Tundra Cafe.

1272
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:51,900
I just want Tillman Fertitta to head of Landry's Tillman Fertitta to respect me.

1273
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:52,900
And we add another name.

1274
01:12:52,900 --> 01:13:00,900
We will be dealing fully with Rainforest Cafe in the downtown Disney.

1275
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:15,900
But that Rainforest Cafe in Schomburg had a clearance nook that had a dragonfly skeleton facing away from you that appeared to be walking up a set of stairs to go die.

1276
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:20,900
But you just saw the tail pointed at you and he was at the foot of a set of stairs.

1277
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:24,900
So I don't know what sort of like riddle that was.

1278
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:32,900
Yeah. And also in the clearance section, there were a line of toys that were like finger puppets and the name of the toys are fingerlings.

1279
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:35,900
And that's the noise we all made.

1280
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:40,900
When we first looked at it, we missed a letter.

1281
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,900
What does that say?

1282
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:43,900
They're like squints.

1283
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:44,900
So weird, weird, right.

1284
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,900
But you'll get our full Rainforest Cafe thought soon.

1285
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:47,900
But we got to talk about this food really fast.

1286
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:52,900
We asked the waitress, is there food that is themed to Pac-Man?

1287
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,900
She said, not a lot.

1288
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:59,900
She went, like she was so could not have been more caught off guard by that question.

1289
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:05,900
Yes, has rarely come up, especially with a bunch of adults.

1290
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:20,900
Luckily, there was one item that had just within it, one single Pac-Man themed ingredient that is that the hummus plate included included pack humbers pack humbers.

1291
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:26,900
And what that basically means is that you're getting cucumbers with like a sixth taken out of it.

1292
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:29,900
So you're getting it looks like a Pac-Man face.

1293
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,900
You're getting less cucumber.

1294
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,900
So it's not a good deal.

1295
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:35,900
No, not at all.

1296
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:39,900
So we were disappointed by all of this.

1297
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,900
But I had seen it on Yelp or something.

1298
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:44,900
I thought there was a little more waiting for us.

1299
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:47,900
And I asked I asked the waitress about it.

1300
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:52,900
And she said, I mean, yeah, I mean, it's it's from the kids menu, but sure.

1301
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:58,900
And and when and she brought this out and we all squeals with delight.

1302
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:00,900
Yeah. So she told us what it was.

1303
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,900
And then she we asked her about like having it because it was a dessert.

1304
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:06,900
And she said, sure, I'll bring you some out.

1305
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,900
And she placed on our table.

1306
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:14,900
Eight Pac-Man cookies.

1307
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:22,900
And we the collective four of us all went, whoa.

1308
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:29,900
And I I believe this was her reaction.

1309
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:30,900
She placed it down.

1310
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:34,900
She heard that noise and went home.

1311
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:41,900
She was like taken aback and confused and then like amused.

1312
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:48,900
We were all like our our barbecue pork nachos and buffalo chicken wrap and hummus.

1313
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:51,900
We were all like, well, fine, serviceable.

1314
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:54,900
But then we were like, oh, the cookies.

1315
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:57,900
Yes, we acted everything and they were good cookies.

1316
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:59,900
They were good as basic sugar.

1317
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:01,900
Everybody's got to go.

1318
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:03,900
Go get these sugar cookies.

1319
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:05,900
You use that 75 cents.

1320
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:07,900
You'll have a great time.

1321
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:10,900
Don't order anything on the main menu because it's fine.

1322
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:14,900
Yeah, go in and order the cookies off the kids menu.

1323
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:19,900
See if you can get your waiter or waitress to recoil from surprise.

1324
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,900
It's such a ruckus.

1325
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:24,900
But, you know, we had some complaints about Pac-Man entertainment.

1326
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:29,900
But with that, we that truly had us thinking we got it all.

1327
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:33,900
That's right.

1328
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:36,900
And with that, we're getting to the end.

1329
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:38,900
There's one more little thing.

1330
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,900
There's a lot of people.

1331
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:42,900
You listen to the podcast, you know the deal.

1332
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:47,900
And you've you know that we've also, in addition to theme parks,

1333
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:55,900
spent a lot of time talking about parking garages either next to theme parks or just, you know,

1334
01:16:55,900 --> 01:17:00,900
or, you know, next to slightly themed malls.

1335
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:01,900
And that's the thing that we would like to do.

1336
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:05,900
And we'd love to talk about the Woodfield Mall parking garage.

1337
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:09,900
The issue is we sort of have a running theme where there's really only one person

1338
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:15,900
who we've deputized to do that, to talk, who we feel has the authority to talk about parking garages

1339
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:18,900
next to slightly themed things.

1340
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:25,900
And we are happy to say because we flew him out on our own dime at great expense to us.

1341
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:28,900
He came out just for this.

1342
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:29,900
Do I hear the holy shit?

1343
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:31,900
Somebody said holy shit.

1344
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:35,900
Ladies and gentlemen, from Doughboys, Nick Weiger.

1345
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:52,900
Wow.

1346
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:54,900
Geez.

1347
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:57,900
Wow. Thanks, guys. That's very nice.

1348
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:00,900
I, you know, you guys know this.

1349
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:02,900
I'm not sure if everyone out there knows this.

1350
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:03,900
This is my favorite podcast.

1351
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:04,900
I'm very excited to be a part of this.

1352
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:06,900
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1353
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:07,900
Thank you.

1354
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:11,900
Honestly, being up here with you guys, I'm a little nervous.

1355
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:14,900
So I'm just going to.

1356
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:17,900
Just going to.

1357
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:18,900
OK.

1358

1361
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:29,900

01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:30,900
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1363

I went on my own to the parking garage.

1366
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:39,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just solo trip.

1367
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:44,900
So that being said, Nick Weiger, what did you think of the Woodfield Mall parking garage?

1368
