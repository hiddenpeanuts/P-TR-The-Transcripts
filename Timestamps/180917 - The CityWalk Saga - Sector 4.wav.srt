1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Forever, dog.

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Podcast The Ride presents The City Walk Saga, a daily 19 part, extremely necessary series exploring the stores, restaurants and wonderful magic that make up universal city walk Hollywood.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The City Walk Saga, Sector 4. Now, look, we've been doing this for, this will be the fourth episode. How are we feeling about this? Because I'll be honest with you guys. Wait a minute, I didn't even intro you. That's crazy.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That's fine. Look, all bets are off. These episodes are different. And I feel like already I'm feeling a little punchy and like we don't have to, we don't have to introduce Jason Sheridan or Scott Garadier. Certainly not.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm Mike Carlson. I think it's because I literally just came from City Walk. I just spent hours there. Lucky man. Doing it. And I don't dislike it yet. I still like it, but I am a little, the sun was out today, it was hot.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes, I was up there, but I was up there at 1130 this morning. You weren't, you both separately went. We both separately went. I guess we could have coordinated. And I've been solo as well. I have some reasons to dislike things, but I'll save that for whatever sector Dong Po Kitchen is in.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Do you want me to check what Dong Po is? We'll know soon enough. Dong Po is sector nine. Okay. All right. So I'll have to keep that anger up for five more days. I thought about coordinating with Mike, but I didn't know what his day was like and I was also hungry in the morning and I figured I'd head up there.

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah. And I think it's better that we also have, look, we're going to have a couple experiences together at certain maybe restaurants or nightlife activities, but I think it's good. It's good for friends to not always be together. They have to have their own lives, their own experiences.

9
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh, I loved, yeah, I love riding solo. You know, I just wandered in and out. Like I wondered the whole second floor, like the whole patio that goes from like Margaritaville all the way to hell at the moon. Like you're talking city loft. Yeah. Talking city loft. I guess that yeah, city loft because city food is, you know, the best food options.

10
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Well, okay. So city food is sort of part of, I'm not sure if city loft is just in that center courtyard or further down by the Bucatubepo is considered still part of city loft. Again, if we, not again, I've never said this, we sort of reached out to Universal maybe for a little bit of help and clarity and maybe like a list of what restaurants and stores used to be there.

11
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Fallen soldiers. Yeah, yes. In the war to to entertain all of Los Angeles. To separate people from their money.

12
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah, we don't need the maps and everything because we have the sector keeper, but I still, having some actual attention from them would help us clear up issues like is the part down by Margaritaville considered part of city loft, but we may never know.

13
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We may never know. I sent an email. I said, Hey, is there any information on what used to be here? Any of the history? And it was like, no, not really. Like it doesn't seem like there's many good records being kept in the library of CityWalk.

14
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Very little. And you know, we'll get into it in this episode, but this is what I ended up doing with my short time on planet Earth. I spent a little bit of time looking up restaurants that used to be there, but I couldn't tell what storefronts they were in or what sectors they were in.

15
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So I was looking at like window compositions above the signs. Like is this one a double window or is this one have like a column or is this one have kind of a rounded window?

16
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And that did let me know what used to be in one of these spaces. So, but in other words that we could have just gotten a list, you feel like. But instead I'm comparing Google street views that people took and posted voluntarily compared to old photos off of people's like angel fire sites.

17
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I was going to say, I bet Flickr would be great for this. If people tagged the photos at least.

18
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Sure. Okay. Yeah. And maybe they can people can help us. If you have a CityWalk photo that you're proud of, maybe you can do hashtag PTR CityWalk saga. I don't know if it's hashtags on Flickr.

19
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You should know you're a hip guy. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know that. I don't know that that's the hippest website. I guess it's very utilitarian to me. It's like Yahoo bought them a few years ago. You know, well, just posted on anything.

20
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I know every place has a post on a photo poster basically. You're right. Flickr photos, put them on Twitter like a current 2018 person.

21
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Or just send us a hyperlink on Twitter. Just add us instead as a hyperlink. If you want to keep it on the Flickr sub site. Yes. Okay.

22
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Should we throw to the keeper? Yes.

23
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He's not in our presence right now, but let us summon the keeper and please tell us what our sector consists of today. Boys, boys. Today's sector is sector four. Hot topic.

24
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Guess Ben and Jerry's Element and Mini Monster. Good luck, boys.

25
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay, I feel ready. I can do this. We have Mini Monster. That's a new one of the newest kids on the block and Hot Topic, which is not original, but it's been there. It's been there long. It's a stalwart.

26
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So I guess we I guess we go in order. Yes. Kick it off with Hot Topic. Yes, Hot Topic. First of all, let me say this. I love Hot Topic. Oh, boy. And I am not joking. I'm not being facetious.

27
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I have a strong affection for Hot Topic. Now, it seems like both of you are looking at me with a face that says what's wrong with you. Yeah.

28
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Well, because I have an equally strong take, which is young Jason was scared of Hot Topic.

29
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm not going to disagree with that because Hot Topic.

30
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Scary fonts. Hot Topic has gone through a transformation.

31
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It definitely started out as like your place where you go get an anthrax shirt, the band Anthrax.

32
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And like when I was young as well, I was afraid of Scott Ian and Anthrax for sure. I was a photo of them.

33
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh, yeah. He has weird hair. Oh, my gosh. I love the 2000s. You were I love the 80s at that time. I would cover my eyes when he would comment on chin strips.

34
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah. So I agree with you that when I was maybe little, it seemed like an intimidating, scary place. Yeah.

35
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It was a lot more. I feel like loud music and goth shit.

36
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Although by the time I got to high school, I remember giving someone a Simpsons t-shirt that I bought there. Yes.

37
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah. So it slowly evolves from just like like, yeah, like Anthrax, I think, and like punk bands.

38
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Then it evolves into like Evanescence. Then we get into like the early 2000s and it's very much like new metal shit, like weird other shitty bands.

39
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And that kind of like not quite goth, not quite metal. Right.

40
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Mainstream enough for the Daredevil soundtrack. Yes. That's a good point.

41
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The band, the other guy who sang with the Nickelback guy on Spider-Man 2. Oh, shit. What's that guy's name?

42
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He was Josie Scott from I want to say Tinder. I don't think it's Tinder.

43
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Tether? Teeth? Seether? I think it's Seether.

44
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Could be Seether. I think it's Seether.

45
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You're all looking up while you keep justifying this choice of yours.

46
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Who would have thought this sector would have set us down a long dark night of the soul to our youth?

47
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Maybe that hero. Yeah. So so they would have Disturbed was another band that would be featured there.

48
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So then slowly, I think around this time is when they start putting some comic book or cartoon stuff as well.

49
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
G.I. Joe t-shirt. Twisted stuff like, you know, Transformer stuff. Bung Bob and all that stuff.

50
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So now we get to get to a hot topic that in 2018 has a very pretty wide variety of stuff.

51
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You mean of Riverdale stuff, a wide variety of Riverdale stuff as I experienced today.

52
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yes, a wide variety of Riverdale stuff. Now, let me tell you this. Who's the star of Hot Topic?

53
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Let me ask you a question. Give me his name. Rick and or Mourning. Pickle Rick. Pickle Rick.

54
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's they're definitely like big parts of Hot Topic right now. But number one, I think Nick Jackson, the Young Bucks.

55
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
No, they have a nice presence there and I'm very happy for all the machine gun Kelly. No, not machine gun Kelly.

56
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm talking about a guy who's very irreverent. He wears a mask. He's very hyper violent and he loves Jimmy Chong.

57
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh, you talking the ball. I'm talking Deadpool. You guys, there are so there's so much Deadpool merch.

58
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And I think Deadpool right now is surpassed the last most popular Hot Topic character, Harley Quinn.

59
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Oh, Harley Quinn must have really ruled that place. Yes.

60
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So like if you wanted anything with Harley Quinn on it, you could get it. And now it's the same thing with Deadpool.

61
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
There's so much Deadpool merch. And I guess right now I realize now that I'm saying this, I'm not making the best case for why I love Hot Topic.

62
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But I like look, look around my apartment. There's a lot of toys. There's a lot of comic book shit.

63
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm wearing a Mickey Mouse shirt. I have a lot of shirts with characters on it.

64
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, they're more in that avenue than they is no longer goth and silky sleeves and torn up jackets.

65
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
There's a little of that. But yes, it's mostly not that fans. It's a place for fans to connect with their own fandom. Yes.

66
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Funko is it's a place of Funko is there is a I saw today I almost bought it.

67
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
They have a power line Funko pop now from Goofy Movie. I was like, this is good. I like Hot Topic.

68
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I do think Hot Topic is still stuck sort of in their old aesthetic. But it's very dark.

69
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
They could get rid of it. It's like crowded. I could see it's a little bit of an uncomfortable experience because the aisles are just so they like so.

70
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yeah, you got a jam. So they probably have more like items per square foot than any other store.

71
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes, that worries me when like a comic store or even some Barnes and Nobles where it's just like there's so much stock in here.

72
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Like I can't even you can't even look or like browse to impulse buy because there's so much shit everywhere.

73
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yes, there's so much shit like I was walking around today and I was like I would have to spend like five hours in here to figure out everything that's actually in here.

74
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Now, for the specific Hot Topic at City Walk, what I like is there's always a robust sales section.

75
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
There's always an area where there's a lot of discounted merchandise.

76
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And now, gentlemen, did I buy us all presents from Hot Topic? Oh, of course I did.

77
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Now, did I pick something that we'd all be very excited about that as an element of surprise?

78
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You will tell me. Mystery Mini Ready Player One Keychains.

79
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
They are blind bags, which means that we don't know which character from the movie we will be getting.

80
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
How exciting place your bets now.

81
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I have four of them. I don't know if we should wait in next episode. Give the Sector Keeper this as a token.

82
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That might be nice.

83
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
All right, we'll do that then. So let's see.

84
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm going to list all the characters we can get.

85
00:11:49,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Of course, Parzival, Artemis, Shodo, Dido, Ek, the Iron Giant, which seems to me to be like that's the number one, right?

86
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Iron Giant, Irock, 101 Avatar Soldier.

87
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You can get the Jade Key or there are two exclusives that they don't even show on the back.

88
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I feel like you can go through a box of these blind bags.

89
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You're going to know if you're getting the Jade Key.

90
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You would think, yes, unless they sort of pad the Jade Key out.

91
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Are we opening these now?

92
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah, we've got to open them on here, of course.

93
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
All the crinkling is driving the dog crazy, I feel.

94
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You know what, you're probably right. He thinks this is a treat.

95
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Edwin the show dog is coming over here and trying to...

96
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Edwin, you're in trouble if you eat pack.

97
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
This apparently has no tear here option.

98
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I have noticed that the bags are very hard to open.

99
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But if you'll notice that these were each three dollars and then buy two get two free.

100
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So I spent six dollars on four of them.

101
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
All right, Scott is open first.

102
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It needs to be checked on the back of the bag.

103
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What are you? It's Irock.

104
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh, Irock, of course.

105
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'll cherish you forever, Irock.

106
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm going to open now.

107
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, I got 101 Avatar Soldier.

108
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Sixer in parentheses.

109
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Now, I'll be honest with you guys, I saw the movie.

110
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't know who this is.

111
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't know who that is.

112
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I know Parvizel and I know Artemis because they're the two main characters.

113
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Oh, Jason, it's flown out of his.

114
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Did you get Shodo?

115
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I got Shodo, yeah.

116
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Jason Sheridan has Shodo.

117
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So it seems that none of us got the Iron Giant, which is, of course, the one to get or the Jade Key.

118
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
We still have one to open.

119
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So we'll give you guys a teaser.

120
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Next episode, we're going to give the last blind bag to the Sector Keeper to find out which Ready Player One Mystery Mini Keychain he gets.

121
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
These are our Avatar. These are our talismans.

122
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,000
If we believe enough in this series, if we have enough power, these will become tulpas and take life.

123
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That is an idea or a fictional thing that becomes a living creature.

124
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
When we go back to the Void, we will be these avatars is what I hope happens.

125
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Next time there's a Void experience.

126
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Well, I'd love to give these avatars to them and say, scan this and make me that.

127
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I am IROK.

128
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And I am 101 Avatar Soldier.

129
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And of course, Jason Sheridan is Shodo.

130
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Who can forget Shodo?

131
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Jason Shodotan.

132
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So I like Hot Topic. I like that this is there.

133
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's a little small for me.

134
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Honestly, we could knock down maybe guests and make the Hot Topic bigger.

135
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I think so.

136
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Now, I breeze through guests pretty quickly because they some guests stores have a men's section.

137
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This one did not appear to.

138
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yeah.

139
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Well, here's the thing.

140
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm going to tell you that I did not step foot in the guests.

141
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I did not.

142
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And there's a reason that I didn't step foot in the guests.

143
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But it's going to involve the last store in the.

144
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Oh, OK.

145
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Save.

146
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Save that for a little bit.

147
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah, I don't have anything about guests, but it was the store Adobe Road, which was a Native American accessories and clothing store.

148
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
But like the Native Americans themselves, they were driven from their location.

149
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
They were driven from City Walk.

150
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That is just depressing.

151
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

152
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
They did the the Trail of Tears down the hill to Lancashire and shop elsewhere.

153
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Jesus Christ.

154
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The terrible scourge of guests forced them out.

155
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So I say I say, fuck, yes.

156
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Get out of your guests.

157
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
How dare you?

158
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
How about Ben and Jerry's, though?

159
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Anyone hit up Ben and Jerry's while they've been up?

160
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I have been to Ben. I did.

161
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I went into Ben and Jerry's.

162
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I've been to that Ben and Jerry's a couple of times.

163
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I did not have a treat in there for, again, a reason I will reveal in one second.

164
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I went up.

165
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So what do you got, Jason?

166
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Well, I didn't get anything this time because I got something that pertains to another sector that I don't want to allude to.

167
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Well, can I ask you a question?

168
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You're doing others.

169
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
We're supposed to devote one sector per trip.

170
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
OK, so I think you're if you're going to go do it.

171
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I was banging out a bunch at once.

172
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I don't know that I agree to that.

173
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm going to bring this up to the sector keeper when he's back on the next step.

174
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
All right, that's allowed.

175
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:35,000
In Jason's defense, you have to except for the sectors on the end, you have to pass by other sectors to get to most of the sectors.

176
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yes.

177
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So now, if you specifically chose to go into any of these shops and Ben Perus items and buy treats, then I think you're at fault.

178
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:55,000
If you accidentally fell into, you know, the Sparkies, if you tripped and fell into Sparkies on the way to Ben and Jerry's, I will allow it.

179
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But if it was anything but an accident, I think you're breaking the sector rules.

180
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yeah, I think you're.

181
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And look, I'm not going to judge you, but the sector keeper might.

182
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Only God and the sector keeper can judge me.

183
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
All right, fair.

184
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'll say this about Ben and Jerry's.

185
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Ben and Jerry's the ice cream, not that it's a fancy ice cream, but as you know, it's a little more expensive than your average ice cream dryers.

186
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Or what have you.

187
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
But I think it's worth it.

188
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I think it's worth it as well.

189
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I will say that I don't think that the store, the Ben and Jerry's store, whether it's the one that's literally five minutes from walking distance from here or the one at CityWalk, makes me feel like Ben and Jerry's is a higher quality.

190
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I don't think the store itself is nice enough.

191
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Does that make sense?

192
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I thought the one at CityWalk had some very nice woodwork, like painted woodwork in it.

193
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yeah, I don't think so.

194
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I think it looks cheap.

195
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You didn't like that?

196
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I think it looks a little cheap.

197
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I think it looks like rustic, like a farm in Vermont.

198
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I know what they're going for, but it looks kind of cardboardy to me.

199
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It looks almost like a children's show.

200
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And I think Ben and Jerry's, I do think it's got to be a little, it's fun.

201
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Of course, these are hippie men.

202
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But I think, you know, you have to go, you have to do something that's a little more upscale because I think of, and maybe that's just because I'm a guy from a working class background, you know.

203
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You mean like an Emac and Bolio's at the Hard Rock Hotel in Orlando.

204
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Maybe, maybe that's what all the working men love.

205
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I just think, I want to see the value in the store a little more.

206
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I think it's very spare in there.

207
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I just think that you need the environment to be more.

208
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But compared to like the local Burbank one, that one is barely.

209
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yes.

210
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
That barely has anything going on.

211
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yes, that one is worse.

212
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I agree with you.

213
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Guys, the value is exploding out of the store, for there is an upside down pink Cadillac that was driven terribly by a cow wearing light up, not sunglasses,

214
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
but glasses.

215
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You're going to dock at points for not liking the wood grain.

216
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You got some exciting Cadillac action right in your face.

217
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Scott makes an outstanding point.

218
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's a very good point.

219
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
This is on the exterior.

220
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
This is the eye grabbing stuff when you're walking.

221
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm talking about when you get inside.

222
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I want a little more theming.

223
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
This is City Walk, god damn it.

224
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Okay.

225
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I want just a little more fun.

226
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I tell them that there is theming.

227
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's mild though.

228
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's very mild.

229
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It doesn't draw you in at all.

230
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It seems like they're moving stuff around.

231
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
There's no tables in there.

232
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But if you compare it to other Ben and Jerry stores, it's a step up.

233
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It doesn't draw you in.

234
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The outside draws you in.

235
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But once, okay, fair enough.

236
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
The outside draws you in.

237
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You get up to the door and then you go, well, nothing's drawing me in here.

238
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Nothing's drawing me to stay.

239
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Nothing is drawing me in to stay.

240
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
If you walked out, it'd be extremely awkward between you and the clerk.

241
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Two words, my friend, fish food.

242
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Possibly the best flavor of ice cream.

243
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yes, fish food is good.

244
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I also think the fake ice cream smell is too strong.

245
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Oh, yeah.

246
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I agree with you on that.

247
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's like playing across theme park world.

248
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's cranked up so high, unless it's not fake, but it smells fake to me.

249
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It smells like that Disney, not that it's a good smell, but it smells like that

250
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Main Street ice cream smell, which is they're just pumping in smell to make your

251
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
mouth water.

252
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I think it's too strong.

253
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
A little too much.

254
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I also, to pay, I feel like I'm the one carrying the banner of City Walk history

255
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
and when this place opened.

256
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And here's where maybe you do duck points because the Cadillac, I don't believe,

257
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
was installed by Ben and Jerry's.

258
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I think they may have put the cow in there in the front seat, but I think the

259
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
car exploding out was due to the original tenant Hollywood Freezeway, and the

260
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Z was capital within the otherwise regular word freeway.

261
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yeah, I think that's fair.

262
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I mean, if you notice the crash spaceship in the studio store, which used to be

263
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
that end of the studio store, used to be things from another world, which moved

264
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
further down into a different sector.

265
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
That spaceship is still sticking out.

266
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's nice of the tenants to leave the protruding crashed vehicles.

267
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That there is, how many other, look, either way, we could parse over this

268
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
wood grain all day.

269
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What other street are you ever going to be on where two vehicles have crash

270
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
landed into walls?

271
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Yeah.

272
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yeah, that is a popular theme thing for these type of places is that a vehicle

273
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
has crashed.

274
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I think a lot of Planet Hollywood's featured that as well.

275
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And the Fry's, there's a Fry's electronic store that's very close to here in

276
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Burbank that has a crashed UFO.

277
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And I think there might be other vehicles, I don't know if they've crashed,

278
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
that are inside.

279
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Like there's a fun, I don't know why that is, I don't know why it's not just a

280
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
UFO has landed on top of the, it's crashed.

281
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's always crashed.

282
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I don't know.

283
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Yeah.

284
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I feel bad for any establishment where a vehicle drives in and demolishes the

285
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
front of the establishment instead of sticking perfectly halfway in, halfway

286
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
out.

287
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
How many cars have been driven into stores by drunk people, by old people

288
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
whose licenses should be revoked?

289
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And all it caused was a mess and not a fun piece of decoration.

290
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So good job, whoever drove that pink Cadillac.

291
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Though I hope you didn't get hurt during the upside down flip.

292
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I mean, I do think those are very funny and fail compilation videos of like

293
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
when someone drives a car into a storefront and no one's hurt.

294
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
They just drove a car into a store just out of anger.

295
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Are you watching compilation videos of cars driving into stores?

296
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I feel like they're mixed in with like Russian dash cam footage videos, you

297
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
know?

298
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I guess I know.

299
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I mean, I've seen like, I guess like on America's funniest home video type

300
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
thing.

301
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I also used to be an editor on shows where like guys would get hit in the

302
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
balls and stuff.

303
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So like accidents, like videos.

304
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
That was called dinkle doinks.

305
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Is that right?

306
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It was called accident time.

307
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
No, no, it's not called.

308
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It was called whacked out videos.

309
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So it's that which one of those names is the silliest huge in the United Arab

310
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Emirates, the most popular American TV.

311
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Wacked out videos, whacked out videos used to beat Jay Leno sometimes in its

312
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
time slot.

313
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's syndicated time slot.

314
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It was so popular.

315
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The version it was, there's a version called whacked out sports that was more

316
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
popular.

317
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So maybe it was that, but yeah, it was always the little brother, but I'm always

318
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
aiming to, to beat the big dog.

319
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah.

320
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yeah.

321
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And it was, they were both the ho the, the narrator of both were, was the guy

322
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
who did the, you don't know Jack voice.

323
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I don't remember this guy.

324
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Hey, how are you?

325
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Like he's not currently TMZ is he?

326
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
No, but it's that that guy sounds like he's doing an impression of this guy.

327
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I don't think.

328
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Okay.

329
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Maybe it's the same guy.

330
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Huh? Huh?

331
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Well, it's looking at that.

332
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Oh, Hey, here's, here's something I do know.

333
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Jack.

334
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I got to say when I got the info earlier, Josie Scott is from the band saliva.

335
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Hmm.

336
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Way off.

337
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
There we go.

338
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
No dither, no tither.

339
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
No zither.

340
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Saliva.

341
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Still an unpleasant sounding band name.

342
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Extremely.

343
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It's unbelievably unpleasant.

344
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm trying to think of a worse one and I don't, I can't.

345
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Butthole surfers?

346
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
No, that's fun though.

347
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It is fun.

348
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
That suggests like an irreverency.

349
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I guess it's not a band.

350
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's not a band name, but around the same time you have chocolate covered starfish flavor

351
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
water.

352
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
What was, did I get that right?

353
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Yes.

354
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Covered.

355
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
No, it wasn't chocolate starfish flavored water.

356
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
This is about buttholes.

357
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Yeah.

358
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And sweaty buttholes.

359
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Can you buy little miniature buttholes promoting that?

360
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
They were also drawn by topic.

361
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Let's talk Elements.

362
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Do you guys go into Elements at all?

363
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I did.

364
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And, and Element is a skate shop.

365
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Very kind of similar to Billabong.

366
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Owned by Billabong.

367
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Yeah.

368
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Really?

369
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yeah, it is.

370
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It's one of the brands that Billabong owns.

371
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Billabong is the parent company.

372
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,240
And when I was inside, I saw a bunch of the RVCA brand, which is another, which is a Billabong

373
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,240
house brand.

374
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,680
And I was like, wait, is Billabong owned this too?

375
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,040
This is not the first case of one parent company owning two stores in the current day City

376
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,040
Walk.

377
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
Right.

378
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,040
And we'll get to those later.

379
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,560
That's another tease to keep you guys listening to this riveting City Walk saga.

380
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,760
Some multiple brand ownership.

381
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:26,680
Some great shoe sales going on, but they don't stock my size seven and a half very often.

382
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,680
I have to really un-for seven and a half.

383
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,680
Seven and a half.

384
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,680
Yeah.

385
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:37,760
Are people on Twitter now going to be disappointed with your shoe size?

386
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,680
Seven and a half, but wide.

387
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,680
Oh, no.

388
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,200
Oh, gross.

389
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Oh, God.

390
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,880
Can you believe this show dough?

391
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,640
What your bigger avatar is saying this bill?

392
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,640
Show dough.

393
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,520
Oh, Jason, he's whispering in my ear.

394
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,280
Oh, he's into it.

395
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,280
Show dough.

396
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,760
He was just, he could be that wide.

397
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,560
I was looking through Element and there was some stuff in there that I, because I like

398
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,560
clothes.

399
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,560
I like shopping for clothes.

400
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,560
Oh, sure.

401
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:11,040
But I felt like this is for skaters and not for me.

402
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,200
I felt like there were logos on there that if somebody, not that people know exactly

403
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,120
what the Element brand looks like, but I felt like this is for skate, not for Michael, there's

404
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,480
for other people that like have a deck.

405
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,480
Right.

406
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
That's what you call a skate, like a deck.

407
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
Yeah.

408
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,480
That's what you call the wood.

409
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
Yeah.

410
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,400
So there was stuff in there that I kind of liked.

411
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,800
There was a child's red child's jacket that was not in my size, but if it wasn't my size,

412
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,200
I would have thought about getting it.

413
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,200
Yeah.

414
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,000
So that's all I have to say about Element.

415
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,680
It did make me feel like looking around the store of like, I don't know that I've ever

416
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,000
felt this young.

417
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,160
Like even when I was young, I was like, I don't know that I've ever felt like I could

418
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,400
see, I was like, I, I'm, I belong here.

419
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,160
I belong in the cool, the skate shop store.

420
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
You're out of your Element.

421
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,160
Yeah.

422
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,320
I mean, they had like some, you know, a couple of rooms.

423
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,760
Little racks of like vans or converse too.

424
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,200
So that's, that's fine.

425
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,440
This, this block though is making me think, but then I keep looking ahead to other sectors

426
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,560
and I'm wondering if I will go back on this.

427
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:16,880
Is this the most mall heavy sector of like traditional mall stores?

428
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,760
Guess Hot Topic, Ben & Jerry's, Element, Mini Monster is a curve ball.

429
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,960
Hey, yeah.

430
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
Yeah.

431
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,400
That's the one that's a little odd.

432
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,760
Totally a reinvention of the wheel.

433
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,760
Uh, to say, I guess it's, it is specific to, it's, I think it's somewhere else in Anaheim,

434
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,200
but it's also in Korea town.

435
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,800
Mike and I tried to go to the original snow monster.

436
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Yes.

437
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Oh, that's right.

438
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,120
Snow monster and mini monster related brands.

439
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,280
And the line was so long.

440
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,400
We went to another fun Korea town ice cream shop.

441
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,000
I gotta say Korea town, Los Angeles, full of fun ice cream shops.

442
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Yes.

443
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,320
We went to one where they served it with fresh honey on top.

444
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,240
We went to a different one where they started with a little cotton candy poofs on top.

445
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
Yes.

446
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,040
So we've, we've, we've gotten a couple different fun ice cream treats.

447
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,440
So many monster, you guys did not eat a mini monster.

448
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
Is that right?

449
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,680
I poked around it and it didn't seem up my alley.

450
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,320
I'm not really a boba guy.

451
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,480
It's they, they, so there's a big cotton candy they put on top.

452
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
Also not my thing.

453
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,280
So I, yeah, I skipped it like, like roller coasters when you know you're out.

454
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:25,240
The Korea town one has a lot more like ice cream sandwiches, these kinds of things.

455
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,600
Mini monster is seems to be, I don't know, exclusively beverages.

456
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,720
Would you say it's, I would say that because I had something from mini monster because

457
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,640
I am a theme park journalist.

458
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,260
So I need to put myself in there and experience all of it.

459
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:48,280
So today, and the story is that you barfed on items in each of the other stores.

460
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:53,480
Anyway, and Gellhorn over here are going to the heart of the war, huh?

461
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,640
So I looked at the menu and it's got like just mostly drinks.

462
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,400
There's like teas and boba and I've had boba once or twice and like Scott, I, it's not

463
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,260
my thing really, but okay.

464
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:09,440
So I go and I go, I want, I want the silliest thing that I can get.

465
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,480
What's the silliest thing here?

466
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,900
And they have what you were saying, monster cloud.

467
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:18,560
It is a drink with cotton candy on top and then fruity pebbles on top of that.

468
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,000
Now I'm a big fruity pebbles fan.

469
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,240
As some listeners might know, it's my favorite cereal.

470
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,760
I could finish a box in like a day.

471
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,340
I've done it before.

472
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,760
So I ordered a monster cloud with the, uh, hold on.

473
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,200
Let me find it here.

474
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,800
Uh, it was a strawberry black tea and they added boba to it.

475
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,840
And I was not prepared for the size of this.

476
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,920
Let me show you guys a photo of this.

477
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,280
Did you get the light bulb glass?

478
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,880
No, I did not.

479
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
Look at this.

480
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,080
This, you, this photo does not even.

481
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,880
I can barely see the glass because the cotton candy.

482
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,880
Let me hold, let me hold.

483
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,960
This is how big it is.

484
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:04,200
And I carry it away and three women, I sit down next to them and they start laughing

485
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,920
and they're like, no, that's true.

486
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,080
And that won't be the last.

487
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,480
I just sit next to him.

488
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,920
Well, I should have run out of there, like hiding it, trying to hide it.

489
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
Oh, it's in the store.

490
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,800
You didn't go out to a bench and no white eventually do.

491
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,880
I eventually leave the store with it.

492
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:26,280
So I immediately regret doing this because I can't eat a full cotton candy.

493
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,280
I can't.

494
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,360
I'm not going to sit here and eat a giant full cotton.

495
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,920
Jason's looking at me crazy.

496
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,600
He's shaking your whole now.

497
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
Why?

498
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,960
Once again, we're being asked to hear about your eyes are too big for your stomach.

499
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,640
You bought, you bought too much delicious food.

500
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,360
I thought that it was a smaller poof of cotton candy and it was not.

501
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,280
It was like a full size cotton candy on top of this plastic container.

502
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,160
So I'm eating this, like what feels like flavorless cotton candy.

503
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,880
It's why it may have had a flavor.

504
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,880
I'm eating it anytime.

505
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,600
There's a piece of like the fruity pebble on it.

506
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,040
It would give me a little flavor and then that would be fine.

507
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,480
But I'm eating this going, what the hell did I do?

508
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
I can't.

509
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,360
So I eat like probably 10% of it and I've got to get rid of this.

510
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:15,480
So I walk out into the city, into city walk and maybe it's my, me being self conscious,

511
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,640
but everyone's staring at me.

512
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,720
I have a giant thing.

513
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,720
People are wondering what it is.

514
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:25,200
It's also like peak time when people are leaving the park and droves of people just going by

515
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,200
me and I'm like trying to figure out like what's going on.

516
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,760
And I'm like, I needed to go into guests, but I can't go into guests with this.

517
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,760
This is too much.

518
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,760
I'm so embarrassed now.

519
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,560
So they're invented pro.

520
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,560
Were you stoned?

521
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,560
Were you super?

522
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
No, no, no.

523
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,400
I just, everyone was looking at me.

524
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,560
This is actually was a little stoned when I went up there and I survived incident free.

525
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,400
Well, no, I would never do that.

526
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,480
I would never desecrate city walk with a altered state of mind.

527
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,800
So then I, so then I have to also, here's my thing with 30.

528
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800
I go, I got to get rid of this cotton candy.

529
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,940
I can't, but I don't want to throw it away in front of the store because I don't want

530
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:05,720
them to see that I've thrown away what they've just worked so hard to make.

531
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,600
I can think of like many avenues and alleys to duck in.

532
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
So that's what I did.

533
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,360
Oh, so I, so yeah.

534
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,000
So I go, I go to a garbage can near that's nearby and I just rip the cotton candy off

535
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,480
the top and just throw it away.

536
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,480
And I go, okay, that's fine.

537
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,400
So now I start drinking the drink.

538
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
The drink is disgusting.

539
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,240
The drink is like, I was, it was raspberry tea or blackberry black tea.

540
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,680
I was drinking it and I'm like, first of all, you can't drink it with a straw because the

541
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,600
fucking Boba gets stuck in the straw.

542
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,680
The Boba is this insanely sweet kind of like cherry taste.

543
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,520
And I'm like, I keep having to open the lid and suck out the bottom of it.

544
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,520
Well, did you have a big Boba straw?

545
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,520
No, I should have gone back and gotten a big Boba straw.

546
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:59,360
You get into these, you get into these paradoxes and paradox, you get into these impossible

547
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,480
scenarios, these stress nightmares.

548
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,520
And I'm like, this sucks.

549
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,200
So now I'm trying to figure out, you gotta have a Boba straw when you're drinking a Boba

550
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,200
drink, baby.

551
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,240
I needed to, I was on a time crunch too.

552
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,240
So I needed to leave.

553
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,360
This was much like the, the Disney world situation where I had a limited amount of time.

554
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,440
So now I go, this drink is disgusting.

555
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,080
I don't need the calories from the Boba.

556
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,480
I got to dump this.

557
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
So now I try to go to the bathroom.

558
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,440
You know, the bathroom right by the hot topic with the, by the lockers.

559
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,280
Which we determined is the worst.

560
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,280
Yeah.

561
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:32,080
Like, like a bus station level, people passed out in the hallways.

562
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,080
Yes.

563
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,080
So I go to that bag.

564
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,080
Okay, fine.

565
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,880
I'm just going to go in there and dump the drink out and throw it away.

566
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,680
It's called the bathroom is closed.

567
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,920
It just says it's closed trash cans along the way.

568
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,200
I don't want to put a full liquid into the trash can because I find that's rude.

569
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,840
I feel like when a person's pulling out the trash, it'll spill everywhere.

570
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,400
So I'm just like, I'm going to dump it out and then think it or then put the plastic

571
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
in.

572
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,320
So I have to, I go out all the way into the parking lot in front of universal until like

573
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,120
the bushes and I dump everything out there.

574
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,880
It's like Boba everywhere, a big piece of orange and then I like run away and throw

575
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
the plastic.

576
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,800
It was very satisfying to me because I feel like often you make me play the fool, but

577
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,600
in this story, you sir are clearly the fool.

578
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,640
Fair enough.

579
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:21,360
I'll take this problems building in your head as if you would ever be the rudest person

580
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,560
to the custodial staff of city walk and entire day.

581
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,160
But if there was a full like large like cup full of liquid and you're pulling the bag

582
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:35,280
out, whatever's a hole, it gets all over this poor city walk workers like shoes.

583
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,120
And then like, I won't know it.

584
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,120
You're right.

585
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,920
I won't know that I've ruined this man's night.

586
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:46,120
But on the other end, what if a squirrel or feral cat had gone by and gotten sick off

587
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:50,360
the Boba or choked on a fruity pebble that was foreign to its system?

588
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:55,520
There could be multiple dead animals passing out around that universal fountain as we speak.

589
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,320
This is just like the chaos theory discussion in the film, Jurassic park, a fine universal

590
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,880
release from 1993.

591
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,440
If you, yes, Jeff Goldblum, when he says, if you dump a monster or a monster cloud

592
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:15,840
of drink in the universal parking lot, there's a typhoon in Japan.

593
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,720
So that was my, so I hated it.

594
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,640
I hated the mini monster there and there and thereby sector four, I guess is one of the

595
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,520
least pleasant.

596
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,520
We started with something I really like, which is hot topic.

597
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,400
And we ended with mini monster, which is a place I was excited about going, you know,

598
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,040
Jason and I were texting for months about monster in this stupid place.

599
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,040
Yeah.

600
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,800
I still have never gone to the, I think the full one has a lot more ice cream options

601
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,760
and Sundays and stuff, probably fair better, but it is hugely popular.

602
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,120
And in an area like Korea town might be the worst area to park in, in LA, there's so many

603
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,280
cars, but there's so much cool stuff there.

604
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,800
That's probably an additional part of it.

605
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,240
There's so little room to park and there's so much cool stuff there.

606
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
Right.

607
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,880
How many sectors worth of cool stuff?

608
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,640
I don't even know that you could count.

609
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,800
I'll have to talk to the Korea town sector keeper, which is a different sector keeper.

610
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,800
Yeah.

611
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,800
Our sector keeper will have to summon him.

612
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:17,480
You know, before we wrap up this sector, a couple more fallen soldiers real fast element

613
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:23,360
based on my window checking discovered elements was used to be something called choco latte

614
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,360
loco.

615
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,360
Oh, I love that store.

616
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,440
Aztec themed.

617
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,280
That sounded very good.

618
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,920
Like original Aztec hot chocolate choco Lattell.

619
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,920
You could get there.

620
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,920
That sounds very good.

621
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,920
They had chocolate scorpions.

622
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,440
They had chocolate cigars.

623
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,920
They had chocolate band-aids.

624
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,920
Why that?

625
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,680
I don't know.

626
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,480
But all of everything on this list, perhaps better than your fruity pebble.

627
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,480
Yeah.

628
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,480
Candy nightmare.

629
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,160
I believe that.

630
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,880
And then, and also, so also something called Dappy, which I was looking forward to talking

631
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,760
about, but I couldn't find a lot about Dappy.

632
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,640
It was a Spencer's Gifts offshoot.

633
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:06,520
I can't even tell really what demarcates it from other such places.

634
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:12,840
It's full of like places with, you know, old fifties tins and we'll get into Sparky's.

635
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,360
Dappy seems like a piece of trash we would obsess about.

636
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,440
Like the sequel to Delgo.

637
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,200
It's like, oh, they made Delgo and Dappy back to back.

638
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,320
Jason Sheridan is Dappy.

639
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,600
Oh man.

640
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,920
I would kill to be in the Dappy remake.

641
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,320
You kidding me?

642
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,600
We're very excited about the Dappy property.

643
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,120
This was really could be the next Lego movie, we think.

644
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:39,480
This reminds me of another problem with Mini Monster that I almost forgot about.

645
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:46,800
They have these light bulb shaped glass drinking containers and they look like an upside down

646
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
light bulb.

647
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
They're not exclusive to Mini Monster.

648
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,480
I've seen them other places, but they're glass and there's signs everywhere saying, if you

649
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,120
buy this, you cannot take it into the park.

650
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,080
So it's like an impossible situation because you want people, because then if you buy the

651
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,800
glass thing, I think you get a little more and they tack an extra six or seven dollars

652
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,800
on.

653
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,800
Yes.

654
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,800
That's what they told me.

655
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,800
That's crazy.

656
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,840
And then I found, I have found other stores in CityWalk that sell glass drinks and it's

657
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,160
like drink it now or take it home, but fuck you.

658
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,720
You can't bring glass into the park, which is a good call.

659
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,720
Of course.

660
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,720
It's an odd conundrum.

661
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,720
Right.

662
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,480
They'd have to hold the glass for you and you could pick it up on the way out, but that's,

663
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,480
that would be so much of a pain in the ass.

664
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,240
Oh, well you would need glass lockers.

665
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,240
You would need plane tickets.

666
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,240
Check in booth, a concierge.

667
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
Oh boy.

668
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:40,560
We're finding a lot of complaints and I just found one too.

669
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,200
I looked up who IROC was to see if I could say one of IROC's famous catchphrases at the

670
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,680
end of the, it's the TJ Miller.

671
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,680
I got the TJ Miller.

672
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,440
Sector four is cursed.

673
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,280
Oh no, who's Shodo?

674
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,160
I'm not sure about Shodo.

675
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,160
Jason is Shodo.

676
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,160
I think it might be IOI.

677
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,160
No, it is 101 Avatar.

678
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,640
He seems to be like one of many of like a group of soldiers.

679
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,240
So I think you got no actor on yours.

680
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,240
Yeah.

681
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,240
What do we know about Shodo?

682
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,440
Shodo, let me see if this is.

683
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,440
Oh my God.

684
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,320
Young Shodo was voiced by Brian Singer and old Shodo was voiced by Chris Hardwick.

685
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,320
What the fuck?

686
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,200
The curse of sector four.

687
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,000
Miss points.

688
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,560
All right.

689
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,240
Well, any other closing thoughts on this cursed sector?

690
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,240
Oh boy.

691
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,520
The last cursed sector, the first cursed sector or the only cursed sector?

692
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,520
Probably not the only one.

693
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,520
Oh God, I hope.

694
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:41,080
Well, but we've covered it and here now is the stone for sector four.

695
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:48,240
It is shaped like a stray fruity pebble, but much bigger.

696
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,280
Thank you, sector keeper.

697
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,440
We will add this to the group of 19 once we've collected them all like a Funko.

698
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,440
Yes.

699
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,400
Follow any info about Shodo?

700
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,400
We're waiting for you.

701
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
Sorry, sorry.

702
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,400
Yes.

703
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,960
Shodo is Toshiro Yoshiaki and he's a Japanese Gunter.

704
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,960
Is that right?

705
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,800
G-U-N-T-E-R who attempts to win Halliday's Easter egg hunt.

706
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,240
Oh, and he's a fierce warrior.

707
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,240
No complaints there.

708
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,240
No complaints.

709
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,560
Shodo will lift us out of the curse.

710
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,840
And stay tuned next episode when we find out what the sector keeper gets.

711
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,840
All right.

712
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,840
See you tomorrow.

713
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,680
See you tomorrow.
