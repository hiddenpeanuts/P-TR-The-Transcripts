1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,360
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,440
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,440
Gather around fairies and sprites for Jason Sheridan is joining me today.

4
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,840
As always, I'm Mike Carlson, of course.

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,840
Oh, man.

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,840
Here we go.

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,600
This is how it starts.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,280
Of course, Scott Gardner has also enchanted us with his presence today.

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,280
Punished.

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,320
Scott Gardner, what do you mean?

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,280
My name is Bumbleweb.

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,920
Bumbleweb, of course.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,040
I apologize.

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,080
I didn't recognize you.

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:02,120
It was not my name until Pixie, until Pixie does hit my nose.

16
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,280
Oh, but I thought it was Jason Sheridan.

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,280
It indeed was not.

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,000
It was Skeetal Branch.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,480
Ah, Skeetal Branch, hello.

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:19,160
Gonna write a big do not resuscitate on my chest for this one.

21
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,120
Your wit has no bounds, Skeetal Branch.

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,120
Okay, all right.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,320
Of course, there's me.

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,800
I am not Mike Carlson.

25
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,360
Who am I?

26
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,480
Jason, you know.

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,640
Oh, yes, Jason, say his name.

28
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,320
Hopping Frog.

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,120
Oh, OK, all right.

30
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,720
That's right. It sure is.

31
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,320
It is me, Hopping Frog.

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,440
Hello.

33
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,680
All right. Are these?

34
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,840
Did you guys look up?

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,680
Are these actual?

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,240
Are you pulling from your notes or this orthodome?

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,960
I sincerely do not know.

38
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,680
I'll get out a little lie.

39
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,320
I consulted a list of fairy names, which you better believe will be read

40
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,960
later in the episode.

41
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,600
OK, I had to go to a message board in order to find the full list.

42
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,200
I found a partial list and that wasn't going to do it for me.

43
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,080
I did find the name of every Pixie in this

44
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,480
relatively obscure disliked parade.

45
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,400
Um, mine was off the dome.

46
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,440
OK, got it. Great.

47
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,840
Yeah, but I have seen the names.

48
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840
I have seen the names.

49
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,760
You have seen the names.

50
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,480
You've seen that now.

51
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,400
Now you have seen the names.

52
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,400
This is very similar in the hearing.

53
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,960
Does Glitterwing or does Glitterwing not know the secrets of the Pixie Magic?

54
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,400
I appreciate it.

55
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,960
I appreciate that, Scott.

56
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,400
You were doing the running for president

57
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,480
a thumb in index finger kind of for a second there that you just say,

58
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,240
yeah, we're deploying webcams at the moment.

59
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,880
Yes, you saw me do a,

60
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,480
you know, the Bill Clinton impression, the tiny thumb.

61
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,320
Yeah. Mm hmm.

62
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,480
Thanks. Thanks for noticing.

63
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,480
You got to physicalize even in the audio medium.

64
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,840
What the hell is this bullshit?

65
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
What are we talking about today?

66
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,840
This is

67
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,440
light magic, light magic.

68
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,760
But also a spectacular journey.

69
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,160
Yes, correct.

70
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,320
That's right.

71
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,520
That's the tagline, a spectacular journey.

72
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,760
That was the tagline on the sign.

73
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,520
Give it magic, a spectacular journey, which we all know and love

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,440
as the replacement for the Main Street Electrical Parade

75
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,440
and as Disney said in a press release,

76
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,240
it achieved what they hoped it would be,

77
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,760
which is the longest running show in the history of show business.

78
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,840
It, of course, is that today.

79
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,560
Oh, wait, I'm confused.

80
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,040
It ran for a summer and was chased out of town like Frankenstein's monster.

81
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,760
Well, surely a few months, a few months.

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,560
Surely they only spent checks notes, 20 million dollars

83
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,320
to replace a thing made out of light bulbs and chicken

84
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,440
wire in 1972.

85
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,960
How much could the electrical parade have cost?

86
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,320
I mean, like, I don't think it cost one million dollars.

87
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,520
It probably cost like 10 grand.

88
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,640
At the time, I think it might have was just somebody's dad

89
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,960
banging it together.

90
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,480
I'll take care of it.

91
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,320
I like to quote the I was going to quote the Los Angeles Times real quick

92
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,360
from 1997, light magic or light tragic?

93
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,280
Question mark.

94
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,760
Uh huh.

95
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,120
A 20 million, the 20 million dollar dud, the L.A.

96
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,400
Times also said.

97
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,240
It's finally gone.

98
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,320
The Orange County Register, it failed to attract much of a following.

99
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:19,120
But, you know, why do we let the fake news journalists

100
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,160
have the word about this parade?

101
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,840
We should let Disney speak for it.

102
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,960
And in fact, our king, our hero, Michael Eisner, if you're

103
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,960
if you're currently confused as to what this parade was, what it consisted of.

104
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,000
Michael Eisner can help explain in Michael Eisner's words,

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,120
it is a parade and a show that features the magic of light and the magic of night.

106
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,000
So there you go. Got it.

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,920
OK, OK. Pretty good.

108
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,960
Rarely combined.

109
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,040
I mean, magic of light sort of siloed its own thing and magic of night separate.

110
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,160
But to mix them, that's that Disney bold spirit.

111
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,440
Yeah, well, I mean, look, we're all over the place already a little bit,

112
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,400
but I like the fact that it says in the actual soundtrack of the raw of the

113
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,640
excuse me, the parade, the Disney characters discover the power of starlight

114
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,760
and magic and pixie dust can make their dreams come true.

115
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,520
So that's also like how I like to think of it.

116
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,200
This is before the like big like all in on like pixie me,

117
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,840
like the direct to DVD pixie hollow stuff.

118
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,760
I should say. Yeah, yes.

119
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,960
This is this is the late 90s.

120
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,680
I also looked up.

121
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,040
I was very curious because I was like, what movie?

122
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,200
I was trying to think of an indie movie that you could make with 20 million dollars.

123
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,760
And the first thing that came to mind was Little Miss Sunshine.

124
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,080
So I looked that up.

125
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,880
The budget for that was eight million dollars.

126
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,560
So you can make three and a quarter

127
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,040
little sunshine for the cost of this six month parade.

128
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,280
Also, this was 96 or 97.

129
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,680
So with inflation, that's even crazy.

130
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,160
Maybe three, maybe three Little Miss Sunshine, three completed

131
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,960
Little Miss Sunshine's dear God.

132
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,320
What a what a bizarre waste.

133
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,360
If you so if you don't know this story at all.

134
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,400
And I've realized that a lot of people don't because you guys didn't.

135
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,640
I was kind of surprised.

136
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,360
No, you guys were not previously familiar with light magic.

137
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,080
To me, it looms very large because I grew up in

138
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,440
in California and really and love Disneyland and love the Main Street

139
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,600
Electrical Parade and was highly anticipating the the replacement,

140
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,320
the like the the enhancement over the dirty old

141
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,680
Main Street Electrical Parade that was going to come.

142
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,720
Another thing about me is that what I was probably, I think I was like

143
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:56,080
12 at the time, I used to go on Disney message boards and news groups.

144
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,160
So I, which is a very cool thing for a 12 year old to be doing.

145
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,000
Great way to be spending time.

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,680
Don't play sports. Don't go outside.

147
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,080
Go on all that Disney Disneyland.

148
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,800
And I got to watch it grow from.

149
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,680
Oh, wow. So they're almost ready with the replacement.

150
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,000
Huh? I'm not hearing very good things.

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,920
Oh, my God is the worst thing that's ever happened.

152
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,760
So the biggest disappointment in park history,

153
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,760
which is and it dovetail, it went.

154
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:30,560
This is 97, 98 was rocket rods and Tomorrowland 2001 was new

155
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,240
California adventure and superstar limo and all.

156
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,720
This was such a dark period, a very, very dark period to be a Disneyland fan.

157
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,600
Yeah. Yeah.

158
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,840
I mean, what was going on?

159
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,200
Like we didn't back in Disney.

160
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,600
Like, I feel like all eyes were on Disney World in the 90s, you know.

161
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,880
And if stuff didn't quite go as planned, it still was like

162
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,320
rolled with like Disney Quest or whatever, or Disney's America.

163
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,280
I don't think at my age, I was really like picking up on Disney's America.

164
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,400
I yeah, I was not even I was not so plugged in to the to the info

165
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,440
and the rumors and to the chatter online like I was to other things

166
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,120
I liked at that point, like when the Internet started,

167
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,640
I was very much into the comics and I was into video games and stuff.

168
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,360
I mean, for sure, honestly, it didn't even cross my mind

169
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,640
that you could go and do the same thing for the theme parks.

170
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,600
I think that's exactly.

171
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,640
Yeah, I didn't have a ton of like or any theme park friends.

172
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,800
People go occasionally, but I thought it was just a thing my family liked,

173
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,680
which is crazy because millions and millions of people go every year.

174
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,040
Let me ask, when did you guys have the Internet in your home?

175
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,760
Oh, good question.

176
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,680
Not long before that, probably like early 96.

177
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,520
So I want to say, oh, my God, I think that late or six.

178
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,280
No, that's early.

179
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,720
I we didn't have it.

180
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,160
I started using it in the library, I think, in like the later 90s.

181
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,080
I don't think we had an Internet connected computer until like.

182
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,640
Fall of 2000, like I was a sophomore in high school.

183
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,320
I think 97 or 98, maybe.

184
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,000
Huh, is well, because we had all day, it was AOL

185
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,720
and it would like slow load on the different AOL pages.

186
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,640
And I mean, yeah, like the worldwide web was.

187
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,680
I just knew that like you'd go to DC Comics is AOL page.

188
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,920
And I don't know, you could look at a picture of Batman or something.

189
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,400
I don't you couldn't really do much over six bit maps.

190
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,880
We'd like slowly load a picture of Batman.

191
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,880
I'd be like, oh, awesome.

192
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,080
And then that would be it, I think. OK.

193
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,200
Yeah. Now everybody.

194
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,120
Now everybody say when you lost your virginity.

195
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,800
Go. OK. No, that's all right.

196
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,680
Well, I remember years out 20, 2019.

197
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,400
Congratulations.

198
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,280
Thanks. Finally.

199
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,000
I mean, so I mean, this thing really is like

200
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,920
it I think it is considered one of the first times

201
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,040
there was a fan revolts that genuinely impacted

202
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,040
the release of of of a Disney attraction or product, because they

203
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,000
they really revolted.

204
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,440
And I think I was trying to think how to organize thoughts here.

205
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,040
And I think just to get people acquainted with what the show is,

206
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,000
maybe we should talk about what the show is.

207
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,560
And then I can go backwards and we can detail the history.

208
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,720
I don't know how much of the history you guys looked into.

209
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,640
But I think it's like I think it's sort of important to like know

210
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,600
like what it is and then then ask, how did it come to this?

211
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,240
How did this possibly become what they spent 20 million dollars on

212
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,320
and replaced the electrical parade with?

213
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,040
Yeah, I looked into some of it, but

214
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,760
I read the Yesterland roundup and I watched.

215
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,120
There's a pretty decent quality copy of it on YouTube.

216
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,520
You can watch it and get the pretty good gist of it.

217
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,120
So, of course, there's a great special that is online.

218
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,520
Yes. Yes.

219
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,480
Said by I'm sure Scott knows this Alex Trebek and Tony Little.

220
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,680
Oh, man. A oddly like not.

221
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,960
It isn't this like big budget ABC kind of special.

222
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,880
It's UPN. It was like it was for local affiliate KCOP 13.

223
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,560
Alex Trebek hosted it.

224
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,640
Seemingly at gunpoint, Alex Trebek.

225
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,760
I've never seen him look so miserable.

226
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,880
It's it's really so you watched the you watched that special.

227
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,120
I watched I mean, I didn't I didn't like study it,

228
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,440
but like I zoomed through and saw clips and then went to the parade.

229
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,120
It's it's a special that feels like it's

230
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,560
killing time and trying to not show you the parade.

231
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,880
Yes, because it's just a lot of history.

232
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,720
Yeah. Oh, they're just they're pulling out all the stops.

233
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,200
It's all and then Walton is Daddy's Day.

234
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,680
I went to the park and merry go round.

235
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,000
If there's a place for dads and kids to play together and is Disney.

236
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,480
Now, trains started by a mouse.

237
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,280
And yeah, they do all the shit that we all step through so many times.

238
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,920
It's just like how much time can we kill? And

239
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,600
and then there's a lot of buildup of the pixies.

240
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,880
That's it's like teases of the pixies.

241
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,720
Alex Trebek says the word pixie like 20 times

242
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,640
credit to our friend Doug Jones in his Disney mashup.

243
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,920
I believe the Golden Girls return to Space Mountain.

244
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,360
He did a like a mashup of every mention of pixies in this thing

245
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,560
and just increasingly miserable Alex Trebek pixie magic pixie dust.

246
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,160
Then the pixies will arrive and they will teach us how to use the pixie dust.

247
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,160
He's just like,

248
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,280
it gets worse and worse.

249
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,560
I yeah, I don't.

250
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,280
And which so to explain what this parade or whatever it is,

251
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,160
I can you even how do you would you guys explain your

252
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,800
perception of what it is, because it's not quite a parade?

253
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,320
Yeah, it's

254
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,760
it's and it's not street.

255
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,120
Misfier, there's a term they use, isn't there?

256
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,720
Street, tackler, street tackler.

257
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,720
Thank you.

258
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,960
You see, I, I, I appreciate you so much for telling me.

259
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,560
It's a street tackler that combines the magic of light and the magic of night.

260
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,320
I mean, I don't want to go immediately to the Craven interpretation,

261
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,880
but Michael Flatley and Riverdance were very big in the 90s.

262
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,040
Yes. And I mean, I think

263
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,680
it's a straight line from that to this. Right.

264
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,960
Like, I'm not crazy.

265
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,000
It's like when Disney like two or three years after the fact is like,

266
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
hey, check out our cronuts.

267
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,240
Like they get around to it eventually.

268
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,720
Well, it's like, you know, they were like a little bit after the fact

269
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,760
they they put Cirque du Soleil in Disney World.

270
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,200
And then a little bit after the fact, they embraced

271
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,560
yeah, Lord of the Dance and Riverdance.

272
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,800
And I I can tell you why they embrace those things.

273
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,880
Do you know where that idea came from?

274
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,120
So for Disney to do their own version of Riverdance?

275
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,400
Is that an Eisner?

276
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,440
That's straight from Eisner.

277
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,840
Is it? Yes. You got it.

278
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,760
Yes. Hello. Hello.

279
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,040
I have to say. Let's dance. Let's dance.

280
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,880
Cirque du Soleil was not on my radar until until that.

281
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,160
I guess it was probably in maybe in those Vegas specials.

282
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,640
I'm sure it was arriving in Vegas.

283
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,640
But the Disney World's

284
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,240
Lanuba was the first.

285
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,680
We'll get around to Lanuba.

286
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,200
Of course. Yeah.

287
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,400
Just in case there's a listener that doesn't know what Riverdance

288
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,360
or Lord of the Dance is, there was a gentleman named Michael Flatley,

289
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,640
who was very popular in the 90s, and he was in a group called Riverdance.

290
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,800
As far like that was the first big explosion.

291
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,760
And it was essentially like clog dancing.

292
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,080
How would you call it?

293
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,560
It's Irish step dancing.

294
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,840
Not clog. Yeah, right.

295
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,000
Irish step dancing. Thank you. Yeah.

296
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,800
And it's like a lot of high stepping where your knees would go up

297
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,000
to like your stomach and like you were prancing, prance dancing.

298
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,360
And it swept the nation.

299
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,760
And then Michael Flatley had a falling out with Riverdance

300
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,120
and started his own show called Lord of the Dance.

301
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,360
Oh, I didn't know any of this.

302
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,120
I didn't know he was part of Riverdance first.

303
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,760
Yes, there was a controversy.

304
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,840
And he left and started Lord of the Dance.

305
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,040
I see.

306
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,200
Which I'm sure we'll do an episode about.

307
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,280
Celtic Celtic music, right?

308
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,720
Celtic Celtic Celtic.

309
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,040
Yeah, I I knew I had that wrong.

310
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,720
There's laughter from the other room because I messed that up

311
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,560
the other day, too, in conversation.

312
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,400
The same thing.

313
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,680
I was trying to describe what this was.

314
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,000
Oh, Joe was and I messed it up then, too.

315
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,600
And then you were talking about Larry Bird and the Boston Celtics.

316
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,400
That's true.

317
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,640
That's probably what I get slipped up on.

318
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,360
Yeah, it is confusing.

319
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,320
Yes, they I mean, I'll go backwards in the history.

320
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,520
But like by the time they at some point had that they wanted to do

321
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,440
a show that involved Pixies and Eisner was shown

322
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,560
some of the early concept art of it and saying he said fairies are Irish, right?

323
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,600
Maybe you guys should make this show like Riverdance,

324
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,440
throwing some step dancing and tin whistles and stuff.

325
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,960
To even whistle tin whistles.

326
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
What does that mean?

327
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,800
Lord of the Tin Whistle.

328
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,200
So and I definitely one of the things that is the most unpleasant

329
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,760
about light magic is the the veneer of this music.

330
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:24,640
I don't look I don't want to like insult an entire culture or something.

331
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,800
But like this particular just what this is like

332
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,960
like 90s Yamaha

333
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,560
version of pan flutes.

334
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,080
Yeah, yes.

335
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,720
Synthesizer pan flutes is not my favorite genre of music I've ever heard.

336
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,400
Hmm. I don't know who I'm thinking is going to be mad at me.

337
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,240
I know that Michael Flatley is going to show up at my house

338
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,560
and stomp all over my face.

339
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,320
Can I kick you with his feet?

340
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,440
He's going to kick you with his feet of flames.

341
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,520
His hit show from 1999.

342
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,920
Feet of flames.

343
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Feet of flame.

344
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,560
Wait, wait, feet of flames.

345
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,920
The victory tour.

346
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,800
Yeah.

347
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,280
After the Jacksons, he just did the victory tour again.

348
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,400
Yes. And he performed it in 2000 and 2001.

349
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,600
Yeah. Victory against what?

350
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,480
Normal stepping.

351
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,160
Feet. Yes.

352
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,840
No, no, not of flames.

353
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,240
He overcame normal walking.

354
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,360
Scott, you get excited because you hear synthesizer.

355
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,840
Mm hmm.

356
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,400
And then you hear a pan flute and then you like a real life Simpsons gag.

357
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,880
It's what I was saying.

358
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,880
It's what I was saying in Electrical Parade.

359
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,520
An electrical parade episode is I love I love how the old mohgs

360
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,760
don't try to sound like anything.

361
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,000
They're just their own weird computer objects.

362
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,520
And then in the 90s, everything starts trying to sound like shit.

363
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,960
Synthesizer strings, synthesizer horns, the worst.

364
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,240
Mike, you can agree we've seen McCartney live a couple of times,

365
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,040
and it's wonderful.

366
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,160
And the only bad element is he'll do got to get you into my life or something.

367
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,680
And then like the most like it sounds like this.

368
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,720
It sounds like light magic. It's.

369
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
You know what? I was shocked the last time we saw him,

370
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,360
which was last summer at Dodger Stadium, he had actual horns.

371
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,080
Yes. Good.

372
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,440
He's he's a notoriously cheap.

373
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,280
Is that why? Is that why the synthesizer?

374
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,160
That's the rumor.

375
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,840
Because like, you know, I've seen we've all, you know,

376
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,280
we've seen concert, I've seen Bruce Springsteen at a certain point.

377
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,360
He was touring off of that that album High Hopes.

378
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,680
He had like 30 people in the band, a choir horn section.

379
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,480
McCartney has like six people.

380
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,960
And you're like, well, why wouldn't he?

381
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,680
He has all these different he has all these different songs

382
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,360
that have like orchestration and horn parts and strings and stuff.

383
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,920
And that's that's the rumor.

384
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,680
I mean, I've heard also that he's just very cheap.

385
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,680
I heard he had a cash bar at one of his weddings.

386
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,280
I mean, that's the funniest thing I've ever heard.

387
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,080
Much respect, much respect.

388
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,920
OK, well, so to explain what the show actually is, you know,

389
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,760
and I could we could take 10 minutes to explain the pseudo plot.

390
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,920
Really, really what it is is a bunch of pixie bullshit.

391
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,600
That's that's the main thing.

392
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,240
It's a bunch of pixie step dancing or clog dancing or whatever it is.

393
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,920
And I guess an important thing to note is that, OK,

394
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,560
we never we didn't really explain what street tackler means.

395
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:34,280
It's not a constantly moving parade like the Main Street Electrical Parade.

396
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,920
It's these four big floats, these big barges of floats

397
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,280
that kind of look like like little miniature forests, these big trees

398
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,680
kind of as the bases of them.

399
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,080
And they roll out onto Main Street between the four.

400
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,960
They pretty much fill up the length of Main Street and they stop.

401
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,600
And a show is performed.

402
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,640
And then when the show is over, they keep rolling and go backstage.

403
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,800
And then they, you know, they do it again on the other side of the park.

404
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,520
So it's way more of a way more of a dance show in the middle of Main Street.

405
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,320
Yes, yes, that's what I didn't know either.

406
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,600
And then I basically one of the first things I read was this

407
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,840
Los Angeles Times article, just trashing it.

408
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,200
And basically, like people are just like, what we want more floats.

409
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,440
There should be floats if it's a parade.

410
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,440
They really overshot, they really, they really overshot,

411
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,480
over thought what anyone wanted, especially in the wake of the Main Street

412
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,640
Electrical Parade, an important word that was probably why a lot of people liked that thing.

413
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,200
I think part of what this came out of is that they done this this Lion King

414
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,840
parade called the Lion King Celebration, which stopped.

415
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,880
And there were there was sort of a show elements like

416
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:55,320
element like, you know, a couple songs were performed and then it kept moving.

417
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,160
But even that it was like floats with a lot of variety.

418
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,400
Here's Simba up on the rock and here's wherever Timon and Pumbaa are hanging out.

419
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:07,320
And with all that, I remember seeing that parade when I was a kid and thinking,

420
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,960
I hate this parade.

421
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,520
I hate that it stops and there is a show.

422
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,200
I either want to see a parade or I want to see a show.

423
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,880
The middle does nothing for me, especially because I can't see shit.

424
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,120
I'm small. I can't like I like

425
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:29,520
and I don't want to spend two hours of my day camping out a spot to see this show.

426
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,560
I hated it.

427
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,560
It seems like I was I was looking at a mice chat message board just now, too.

428
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,320
And one like most people are saying they did not like this.

429
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,880
But one person was saying, well, I kind of like it, but I knew where to sit.

430
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,080
So it's like, oh, the parade was it was dependent on like you having an optimum

431
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,880
position, like you needed to be exactly in the right spot to be able to enjoy anything.

432
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,000
Like seeing gravity in IMAX, like, well, no, you really got to.

433
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,960
If your third row center, it's going to be amazing.

434
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,680
It's going to look like shit anywhere else.

435
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,600
But you'll seizure if you're up in the corner. Yeah.

436
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,040
You'll lean against the wall by the Main Street Cinema

437
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,920
and make sure you bring like a little bit of an apple, like an apple box

438
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,160
and stand on the apple box by the Main Street Cinema.

439
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,000
And like, that's the perfect way to see it.

440
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,040
Oh, I wish Disney rented apple boxes by the like hour or the day, because that would I mean,

441
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,080
I even now, I don't have a great vantage point like.

442
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:38,400
I either need to be really far back or really in the mix at concerts, let alone theme parks.

443
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,480
Maybe that's like a new kind of a thing.

444
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,800
People could bring their own apple box and you can direct like you can call

445
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,000
or you can like decorate it however you want.

446
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,320
And like everyone will bring their own like apple box and it'll be sort of a thing.

447
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,520
You'll compare them.

448
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,920
Somebody will make a figment apple box.

449
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,600
Like it'll be very like a cool new fan culture thing.

450
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,400
That's a good idea. That's kind of like glamping.

451
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,120
It's like like glamping, but like like heightening.

452
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,560
You're it's like it's glite glightening.

453
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,160
Yeah, yes.

454
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,360
That word will take off.

455
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,280
That's as catchy as as streetacular.

456
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,840
I think that's really going to take off.

457
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,360
Yeah, I agree.

458
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:24,960
I do. I do want to say no shade to the dancers are all very talented Irish step dancers.

459
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,480
No shade there.

460
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:34,080
You know, and and of course, Disney and most part kind of infamous for underpaying their talent.

461
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,560
So impressive technically.

462
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,960
I'm not arguing that, but just overall, what a mess.

463
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,400
No, they're yeah, they're all fine.

464
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,920
And I like I said, there's probably the the 10 minute version

465
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,840
like Disney's version of what the story is, but let me just try to do it.

466
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,280
And feel free to stop me and add things, but let me try to do it from from my memory of what it is.

467
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:05,160
Four tree barges roll into Main Street.

468
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:14,920
If you're if you're 12 year old Scott, the barges stop with a tree perfectly blocking your view of most of it.

469
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,560
You're you're stranded in between the middle of two barges.

470
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:29,240
And then then out of the tree barges come a lot of pixies and they look around and, you know,

471
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,640
put their hand up on their face as if to see what is far away.

472
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,360
And then they dance and dance more.

473
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,760
And then the Disney characters come out,

474
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,840
seemingly, according to Disney, disturbed by the sounds of the pixies.

475
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,960
Like, what's all that racket?

476
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,000
And because they were keeping they were all sleeping.

477
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,880
So the characters all come out in pajamas and robes.

478
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,120
So out walks.

479
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,240
Sorry, sleeping, sleeping.

480
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,640
That's yes, that's the plot of this.

481
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:15,480
OK, yeah, I don't I think the video I watched was so grainy.

482
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,760
I did not pick up that the characters being woken up was extremely literal.

483
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,280
That's exactly what it is.

484
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,440
It's 7 p.m. and that's OK.

485
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,600
Bedtime. Got it.

486
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,240
Yeah, that's when Miko goes to bed.

487
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,200
That's when that's the head.

488
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,040
That's Donald's bedtime is seven.

489
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,800
So he's yeah, he's fast asleep.

490
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:47,520
So now we got Clarabel Cow and a nightgown and Timon robe.

491
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,920
And they're rubbing their eyes like, why the hell is all this?

492
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:57,120
And then they see that it was pixies and they go, OK, that's fine then.

493
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:04,400
And the pixies say hi and show them that they are pixies and they agree.

494
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,720
And then they hand all of the Disney characters

495
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,800
pixie dust and show them how to use the dust.

496
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,120
This, again, I've only only through the benefit of Cliff notes

497
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,440
do I understand that this is the story is pixies teaching our friends

498
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,520
like, you know, Eeyore and Sebastian the crab.

499
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,000
How how do you use pixie dust?

500
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,240
Right. Can I add that the pixies look like slightly less scary versions

501
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,440
of the Whoville people?

502
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,720
Slightly, slightly, slightly.

503
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,320
Good point. I think it is more.

504
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,600
I think you guys a picture.

505
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,040
I think we can all agree if you need to condense the criticism down,

506
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,400
just the aesthetics are all off like Jesus Christ.

507
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,840
Oh, this is horrible.

508
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,880
What you said. Which dwarf is this?

509
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,920
Is this like happy to me?

510
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,280
I think so. I'm not happy.

511
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,720
I don't know that he is either.

512
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,040
Happy is wearing a striped.

513
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,920
It looks like he's wearing a 1920s bathing suit.

514
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,640
Yeah. Full body striped for a larger gentleman bathing suit.

515
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,560
And he's next to a girl in like

516
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,680
you know, like pink leggings and a sparkle skirt.

517
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,920
She was she's it's like a an ice dancing costume that's three times too big.

518
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,680
It's like for like Mrs. Claus's outfit,

519
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,880
but it's like doesn't fit her and she has wings,

520
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,080
but she also looks like a Whoville person.

521
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,200
Yeah, she's got like very light, like Twilight's own

522
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,520
Eye of the Beholder makeup on

523
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,520
not full Eye of the Beholder, just partial.

524
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,160
Yeah, I mean, it's very like ventriloquist dummy.

525
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,600
It's like if you were if you were playing a ventriloquist dummy

526
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,920
in a in a film or for Halloween.

527
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,880
Or like, I don't know if there if anyone's I don't know why this is in my head,

528
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,600
but like people playing Raggedy Ann or Raggedy Andy.

529
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,320
Like the worst, if you've ever seen that, that's exactly how they all move.

530
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:22,880
Like with their like wobbly, like cloth, like doll arms or puppet arms

531
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,480
should never be done. Yeah.

532
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,680
I hate adults as like cloth dolls with yarn hair.

533
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,400
I always hate it.

534
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,240
I hate like big like rouge circles on cheeks.

535
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,720
I it creeps the hell out of me.

536
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,360
Do you remember the show?

537
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,480
I guess he wasn't a puppet.

538
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,240
He was a mannequin.

539
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,120
But the show today's special on Nickelodeon.

540
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,880
Yes, yes, I do.

541
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,160
But I don't I don't know where you're going with this.

542
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,720
Well, there was a mannequin that came to life that was like

543
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,560
he would move in a similar way to like what I'm describing.

544
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,600
And I was wondering if you had a feeling about him.

545
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:02,880
I'm sure it would be bad if I mean, I'm looking at photos.

546
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,840
Oh, that's right.

547
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,920
He would. Oh, he came to life.

548
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,520
That's OK. I mean, that's this is better to me than like.

549
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,920
Yeah, I don't know what you just described.

550
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,400
Adult Raggedy Ann, I is that's horrible to me.

551
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,680
But like I have the opening here and he is certainly a lot better than a dull

552
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,280
Raggedy Ann, but he's got the big when adults like would put their like

553
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:30,360
stretch their arms is like far out as they could and like wobble around.

554
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,360
As a child, I never liked that.

555
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,040
Let me find adult Raggedy Ann.

556
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,000
I didn't I didn't like that.

557
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,960
I didn't like a lot of segments on Weinerville.

558
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,600
I mean, I liked when you remember.

559
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,320
Oh, yeah, I was disturbed.

560
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,120
I was disturbed.

561
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,720
Yeah, I was really upset when they would transform people into puppets

562
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,040
because I was just like, I got to know that they turned the back.

563
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,880
How do they turn them?

564
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,160
Like, wasn't I?

565
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,400
Were you like 12 at that point?

566
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,280
I don't know.

567
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,600
No, that was in that was still like early 90s.

568
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,840
Was it early? Sorry, I can't remember.

569
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,480
I don't know, because I think they would just make such a show about puppetizing,

570
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,600
like turning people into puppets.

571
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,360
And logically, I must have known they were just sticking their head through something.

572
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,760
But then they would get so excited about committing to like the games and stuff

573
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,840
as puppets, I'd be like, I don't want to get turned into a puppet.

574
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,760
You hate the word puppetizing.

575
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,480
You give me a chill with that term.

576
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,840
That's what all of this is.

577
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,120
It's horrible.

578
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,320
I honestly, Mike, I have no memory of today's special.

579
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,920
I'm looking at pictures of this and I really don't remember this at all.

580
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,560
Like it it says a Canadian show.

581
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,560
It's listed as 1981.

582
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,600
Wow. It ran until 87, though.

583
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,160
So I just don't think I ever got this.

584
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,120
Wienerville was 93.

585
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:57,080
OK, so I would have been nine, nine or nine, eight or nine.

586
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:03,800
Yeah, not a good age to get puppetized, but no good age is a good age to get puppetized.

587
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,880
I mean, in terms of light magic, I was like thinking I was looking through

588
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,040
like stuff I put in my notes.

589
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,520
The only thing that I like is like, I kind of like that.

590
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:19,640
I kind of like the light magic sign that they hung over the like

591
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,800
entrance to Main Street.

592
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,360
The purple yellow. I completely agree.

593
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,360
Yes, that is a good sign that implies a cool parade.

594
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,000
That it is a good sign.

595
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,320
But once I stared at it for a second longer, I was like,

596
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,760
that said, there are four different fonts on this single sign.

597
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,080
And I was like, well, I it is a little too much.

598
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,240
I do like it.

599
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,040
Like, I think maybe it's just the color scheme of it.

600
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,040
I like the main to the words light magic.

601
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,160
I like and then, yeah, they could probably eliminate from there.

602
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:02,560
So the yeah, scary girls with like gumdrop hats and frightening angular masks.

603
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,560
They also you know what they all look like.

604
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,160
Who's the to Mr.

605
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,880
Rogers puppet with sort of like severe features?

606
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,000
It's so it's a female character.

607
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
You know, Lady Elaine Fairchild.

608
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,240
Yes. Yeah.

609
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,680
Imagine like if you were if you were an adult who wore a mask of that

610
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,520
only on half of your face, that's what it's like.

611
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,280
Lady Elaine, who I like that you're talking about.

612
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,080
She had the red cheeks and the red nose and she was mean.

613
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,920
Yes. Yeah.

614
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,800
It's like 40 lady lanes walk out

615
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,120
it's a hang out with Pumba in slippers.

616
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,560
And they teach the characters about pixie dust.

617
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,600
And then there is a long projected sequence.

618
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,720
They're just a movie plays.

619
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,560
Then that's why the floats are so long, because then a screen comes down

620
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,120
and they just show you a movie.

621
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,880
Yes, it is.

622
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,400
And it is something.

623
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,000
It but that's true.

624
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,800
But also it is nothing because.

625
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,160
All right.

626
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,040
It's a movie that's true, like it's about it.

627
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,560
So it's one of these.

628
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,040
I think this is maybe the beginning of Disney just going into like

629
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:21,840
wishes are dreaming and the power of magic inspires you to wish your dreams.

630
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,160
It's just like it's not there's nothing going on in this.

631
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,680
It's like it's a video.

632
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,880
The pixies come out and point with wonder.

633
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,080
And then they show you a video of children pointing with wonder.

634
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,120
It is. Yeah, I mean,

635
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,880
I don't want to say like these other parades have substance

636
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,000
because maybe they don't have substance, but.

637
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,920
There's I there's an aesthetic that's pleasing at the very least.

638
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,760
Yeah, there's a there's a beat and you can dance to it, you know.

639
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,840
By virtue of stopping.

640
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,760
That requires there to be substance.

641
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,240
Like if if a parade is going to keep moving past you,

642
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,720
it just has to be a bunch of nice shapes.

643
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,360
But if the parade is going to stop and say, hey, over here, look at this,

644
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,080
it's then they have to show you something that matters.

645
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,800
Yes. But this is my question is and I don't know.

646
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,840
I don't know if anyone would ever go on the record.

647
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,320
Was there someone when they were planning this that was think like

648
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,640
this actually meant anything to them, like where they were

649
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,160
without they were making some sort of big artistic statement or some like

650
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,640
inspirational thing that would inspire all the guests who saw it.

651
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,800
Like just did someone think that or it was just like,

652
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,120
these are the words that are approved.

653
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,440
These are the characters that are approved.

654
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,280
Michael Eisner wants his own Lord of the Dance and he loves pixies.

655
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,240
All right. What do we do?

656
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,600
Um, I in Doug's video,

657
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,360
Tony Little, he includes a clip of Tony Little talking to a guy

658
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,600
who was like one of the behind the scenes people, and I don't remember the quote,

659
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,600
but it is something like he does say like,

660
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,560
and that's when all the characters come out and the characters show them

661
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,520
the power of pixie dust and of wishing and and and Tony Little goes,

662
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,160
oh, I can't wait. And he says, I can't either.

663
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,480
This may be the guy.

664
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,320
This may be whatever whoever this guy is might be the guy who cares.

665
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,000
Can I ask, can someone just give me the short answer?

666
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,640
Who is Tony Little?

667
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,200
I'm not sure that I know.

668
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,720
So I looked her up.

669
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,880
She was like she did.

670
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,280
I think she did like L.A.

671
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,360
news and stuff, and I think she might have been this America pageant.

672
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,840
Right. Because I see the special was the UPN LA affiliate.

673
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,560
This is it's a weird time because the 1999,

674
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,920
like a Millennium special was also a different affiliate, like

675
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,400
or at least the version I watched was produced.

676
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,240
So I forget when the ABC deal closed and when they're like,

677
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,400
no, let's just show all this stuff nationally.

678
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,680
Well, that was 97. So that was after that.

679
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,720
So I don't know why this is.

680
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,040
Yeah. Yeah.

681
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,600
I mean, they just didn't think it was like prime time worthy,

682
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,960
like back when prime time really meant something.

683
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,680
It was only in L.A.

684
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,480
And she looks like she was a UPN anchor.

685
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,200
And it also looks like she was Miss America in 1976

686
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,360
and that she was married to John Schneider from Dukes of Hazard.

687
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,240
Wow. Got it. Got it.

688
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:33,320
Who is who has been a musical guest on Huckabee, Mike Huckabee's

689
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,720
talk show filmed live in Nashville, but that's neither here nor there.

690
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,320
That you do watch that every week, though.

691
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,960
Oh, yeah. I have to have to have it special or they send me discs

692
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,000
because there's no way to stream it from from my home.

693
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,360
I was wondering when you'd get around the Huckabee.

694
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,120
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

695
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,000
I it's amazing. I haven't brought it up yet.

696
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,960
It's it's wonderful.

697
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,720
I've been highlighting it on my Instagram.

698
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,360
It's my favorite talk show now.

699
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,600
Sorry, Trevor Noah. Take a seat.

700
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,960
I'm a Huckabee man.

701
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,160
But I I don't want to get on a Huckabee tear.

702
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,040
The where were we?

703
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,920
The yeah, it's a bunch of fluff.

704
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,800
And and by the way, the movie's just full of clips of like

705
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,440
the unprecedented use in a Disney Parks montage of, you know,

706
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,080
Beauty and the Beast dancing or Aladdin and Jasmine on the carpet.

707
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,080
Like, come on.

708
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,000
How many more times do we have to see?

709
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,120
Yes, there's Simba getting held up.

710
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,560
OK, yes. Great.

711
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,120
Like no more. No more of this, please.

712
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,360
We've all seen them.

713
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,960
We'll get the subscriptions.

714
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,760
Don't worry. Stop bothering me.

715
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,840
Yeah, I I'm trying to think if I would have liked this as a kid.

716
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,880
My guess is I had seen I mean, the answer is no.

717
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,160
But my guess is if I had I would not remember it if I had seen it,

718
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,440
you would have said light magic and I would have said, huh?

719
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,000
And then it'd be like, well, you know, you saw it.

720
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,880
I'd be like, oh, I don't remember that.

721
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,880
Because like it looks it feels like nothing.

722
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,480
It feels like also like nothing.

723
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,080
I feel like most people, unless they're like insane like we are,

724
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,080
this probably went right in and out of their brain.

725
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,200
I feel like I would have been impressed by the projection screen between the trees.

726
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,960
I would have been unhappy to say, I mean, I don't

727
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,800
I don't want to ruin anyone's fun if you guys like this.

728
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,360
But the shot of real boy Pinocchio, I'm not crazy about.

729
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:44,760
I I much more prefer wooden Pinocchio with Pinocchio is real boy.

730
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,200
I am not wild about that.

731
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,880
Well, in the main street electrical parade episode,

732
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,200
you objected to our strip club idea.

733
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,440
Real boys.

734
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,360
So maybe it's I guess there's that's the connection, maybe.

735
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,800
But just the way they drew like he's extra apple cheeked.

736
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,120
Do you know what I'm talking about? Like, no, he's creepy.

737
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,480
I know exactly what you're saying. Yeah, he is.

738
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,440
But I because I find him so endearing for the rest of the movie.

739
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,640
And then at the very end, he gets upsetting.

740
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,280
Well, that's like the beast.

741
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:21,400
And then the weird like Michael Bolton man who the beast becomes.

742
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,280
Yeah, yeah.

743
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,240
It's like when Bart and Lisa, when Homer sees them as real, like looking humans

744
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,640
and they look very odd and you have any affection for them anymore.

745
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,200
You know what I want to what I want to say is that they're still using the poo bear

746
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,600
that has like the five o'clock shadow snout.

747
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,480
Like Homer, like a scratchy face.

748
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,760
Yes. Yes. His snout.

749
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,000
Like I don't that poo has always bothered me because it doesn't look right.

750
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,640
And his snout is like looks like it's it's got like two days of growth on it.

751
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,640
Well, that makes sense because he he just woke up.

752
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,080
He woke up in the middle of the night for him.

753
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,480
Who goes to sleep at four p.m.

754
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:06,000
They woke him up at seven and he's got a five o'clock shadow and bags under his eyes.

755
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,080
Yeah, this is getting too relatable.

756
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,480
This is getting too

757
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,960
too close to life.

758
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,480
I slept in the other day and then around five o'clock, I'm like, I could do with a nap.

759
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,800
You slept in and a five o'clock nap.

760
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,080
Well, I didn't know I'm taking it.

761
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,040
Oh, sorry.

762
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,800
I ended up no, I ended up working on other show stuff.

763
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,240
I have to say, I made these notes a few weeks ago and I kind of

764
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,680
reread them real quick today.

765
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,400
I forgot about the the narrator.

766
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,000
I think at some point says the dreams of today are the magic of tomorrow.

767
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,720
Did anyone else catch that?

768
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,240
I wrote that down as well.

769
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,440
What the what?

770
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,360
What are you talking about?

771
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,600
What does that who could possibly be moved by this?

772
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,200
That is some Mayor Pete soundbites.

773
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,720
He should narrate one of these parades.

774
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,280
He should know he should write it.

775
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,520
He should be the guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

776
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,120
Well, he's in the Disney family now because he hosted Kimmel.

777
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,200
Oh, yeah, that's true.

778
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,360
The first quarantine audience free episode was hosted by Mayor Pete.

779
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,280
He got a range is thing.

780
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,920
He played a lot of practice at his events.

781
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,160
Wow. You got a good bird in there.

782
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,760
Yeah, he played like he played a Star Trek talk show

783
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,200
game with Patrick Stewart and LeVar Burton.

784
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,600
What do you mean a talk show game with they were the guests on that episode?

785
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,640
Yes. Well, it was a it was trivia between Mayor

786
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,280
Pete and Patrick Stewart and LeVar Burton hosted it.

787
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,240
Huh? Yeah. Terrible.

788
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,720
Well, he got like Pinocchio.

789
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,520
He got his wish to be a real boy, to be a real celebrity boy.

790
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,560
Man, Jason does.

791
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,080
I got to say, Jason doesn't like his apple cheeks.

792
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,160
That's really what this is about.

793
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,400
Listen, buddy. I have the apple cheeks.

794
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,360
No one else. OK.

795
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,720
You're jealous.

796
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,720
No, I'm a repeat.

797
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,080
Here's another. Well, I also wrote down this note.

798
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,920
I don't care for the running children projection.

799
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,080
There's just a right.

800
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:24,720
There's like a copyright free shot, like a stock film shot of

801
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,600
just running children in between the trees.

802
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,800
This is sorry to get into a bad territory,

803
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,160
but this is like all of Michael Jackson's music videos post 1992.

804
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,840
Oh, yeah. They were all just full of arbitrary children

805
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,680
doing nothing like gone were cool styles and shoes

806
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,160
and light up floors and replaced by running children.

807
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,160
Well, and also like wishes and dreams also.

808
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,280
Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

809
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,520
Like these generic platitudes.

810
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,040
It the worst the moment where I should have bailed on Michael Jackson

811
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,280
was when I was shown the music, the video for the song Childhood,

812
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,560
which is a big short soaring shot where he's dressed as Peter Pan

813
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,960
and he sings the lyric adventurous dreams.

814
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,760
All right.

815
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,120
The worst to the worst thing filmed by a camera.

816
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,840
Well, I also want to keep up.

817
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,000
I want to keep up. Remember, the email address is Scott is pan at Gmail dot com.

818
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,600
No, no, no. Everyone forgot.

819
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

820
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,360
They didn't. This is canceled.

821
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,040
Pan is canceled. Running children are canceled.

822
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,720
Make sure to register that, Mike, if you haven't already.

823
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,800
Jason, please, do you think I do you don't think I registered

824
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,000
at the day we recorded the episode?

825
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,440
Well, it's easy to forget when you've been talking for 90 minutes.

826
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,840
I forgot that was definitely forgot. That was important.

827
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,320
I was happy to forget.

828
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,480
I've oceans the email to sign up for like a duplicate

829
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,720
free trial for certain streaming services.

830
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,800
It's where we're all getting our quibi from.

831
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,360
Yeah, that's right. Scott is pan at Gmail dot com.

832
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,920
I have to. I have a new DC Universe subscription

833
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,800
for free for a week so I can watch Batman Returns for free.

834
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,760
Well, that's worth it.

835
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,880
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

836
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,840
Um, OK.

837
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,440
So, I mean, the only other note I have about what's in the show

838
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,120
is that goofy plays a big flower horn. Yes.

839
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,600
The only characters start picking up like like little

840
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,480
like lily pad instruments or whatever and like,

841
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,560
who would like this?

842
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,000
This is for no one.

843
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,400
And then really adding insult to injury, you know, it's been like

844
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,800
there's been sort of like Celtic versions of Disney classics,

845
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,720
and then they all step dance to a Celtic version of Baroque.

846
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,960
The mainstreetological parade song.

847
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,840
This is such a slap in the face.

848
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,040
It still makes me angry today.

849
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,240
I'm sure they were thinking, oh, what a nice way to show you

850
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,320
what was here before. No way.

851
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,360
Sucks shit is sucks.

852
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,520
Don't ruin that wonderful melody with

853
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,520
the only way.

854
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,800
The only way it could be worse is if there was like a new metal

855
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,480
or like Limp Bizkit version of Baroque down.

856
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,360
Like I was trying to think of a different genre that would be more unpleasant

857
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,640
for the Baroque, like such a step down.

858
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,240
If Alien Ant Farm had done it.

859
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,160
You know what? I think Alien Ant Farm would be OK.

860
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,240
Yeah, they're a little better than they're a little better.

861
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,800
I'd rather hear smooth criminal than Limp Bizkit Faith.

862
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,320
Yeah, that's sort of where I'm going.

863
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,440
Yeah. Or yeah.

864
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:45,560
So like West, if it was a West Borland, well, if it was just West doing it,

865
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,680
maybe he was trying to tribute it. Maybe that'd be OK.

866
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,320
I would I was going to say Buckethead probably does a version of this.

867
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,680
We've talked about Buckethead before.

868
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,360
Famous guitarist that wears a KFC bucket on his head

869
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,600
that played with Guns N' Roses for a while that loves Disney

870
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,680
and does a lot of Disney versions.

871
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,560
So we should look and see if Buckethead has a Baroque hoedown.

872
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,960
He's got to let me look.

873
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,160
The yeah, that seems like the kind of thing.

874
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,240
Yeah, like super shredding it really fast.

875
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,800
Yeah, I know that all sounds better to me than this.

876
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,080
I think they found the worst genre of music.

877
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,840
And I just what I remember is that like this

878
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,960
this it just like blasted when the parade began.

879
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,440
I was just fondly recalling on the other one that opening drum

880
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,000
that opening hit on Burlko down is so fantastic.

881
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:31,640
You light up.

882
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,560
And then this one, I just remember starting like

883
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,120
like these awful horns like I

884
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,240
and they cranked it so fucking loud.

885
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,360
And apparently on the opening night, the first time they rolled it out,

886
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,320
there was a problem and the music got stuck.

887
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,480
And it was just the opening fanfare.

888
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,320
Blaringly loud for like seven minutes.

889
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,600
Seven minutes.

890
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,320
I think so.

891
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,280
So the so the annual pass holders are mad right away.

892
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,440
Like this is how you butter us up to like this with the screechingly loud.

893
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,880
The in that in that old newspaper article I found from 97,

894
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,200
it mentions the term annual are pass holes.

895
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,720
Talking about the annual pass holders, I have found us.

896
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:22,360
I have found a clip, a medley of Bucketheads from 2009

897
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,280
where he plays William Tell Overture Pirates Life for Me,

898
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,720
the Main Street Electrical Parade and Beat It.

899
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,200
What? What? Yeah. Oh, shit.

900
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,960
Yeah. You know, recession still going.

901
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,560
We needed that from Buckethead.

902
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,800
And once once he's going to have to get us out of this recession as well.

903
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,760
Oh, yeah.

904
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,880
Again, though, I have another press quote.

905
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:49,000
Long Beach Press Telegram 1997.

906
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,800
Disney's Disneyland's Light Magic Street Show was unveiled

907
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,600
Friday night to overflow crowds and a lukewarm reception.

908
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,600
Oh, I mean, when does this happen?

909
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,160
Like like something is so poorly reviewed out at the gate.

910
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,160
And you know, there was a weird trickle in of people being disappointed

911
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,800
by Galaxy's Edge before Rise of the Resistance.

912
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,800
There was, you know, that sort of builds a little bit and it's kind of gone away.

913
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,600
This is pretty unprecedented that just we hate this instantly.

914
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:22,680
It's like I think the big it feels to me like

915
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:28,040
because of the beloved parade that that came before it,

916
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,320
people came with certain expectations

917
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,960
and that did not do this show any favors.

918
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:40,080
For sure. Like this, it just rolled out at Disneyland, Paris arbitrarily.

919
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,760
It would pretty it might still be there.

920
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,240
I don't know. Yeah.

921
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,040
But it would have just been like, oh, yeah, fine.

922
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,560
That's OK. Like maybe no one loves it, but like no one's like pelting it

923
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:54,120
with garbage or anything versus like this, which seemed like

924
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,600
everyone showed like showed up.

925
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,840
And annual pass, everyone was like, oh, my goodness,

926
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:04,000
they're going to replace the greatest parade of all time with an even better parade.

927
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:08,920
And there's just not a single element of the parade that's better than the original.

928
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,520
Well, in the element.

929
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,000
No, not at all.

930
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,680
Now, what about Mickey dancing to a Celtic version of Step in Time?

931
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,960
No one's mentioned that.

932
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,520
No one has mentioned that you're right.

933
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,760
It's something I like that.

934
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,120
And he's in a in a in a Christmas robe.

935
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,080
He's in a robe your dad would wear on Christmas Eve.

936
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,400
Yeah, this also Celtic music does.

937
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,000
I don't know this. At least this does.

938
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,320
It all feels very Christmasy to me.

939
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,840
Hmm. Sure. Maybe that's there's a there's an element of like, yeah,

940
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,800
I think it has to do with a lot of the pajamas as well.

941
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,640
That feels like Christmas Eve type thing.

942
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,200
Which I mean, that look, that's one of that's down the list of issues I have with it.

943
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,440
Yes, to Christmas scene, not on Christmas.

944
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,400
But that's it. It gives you a laundry list.

945
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,360
There's a there's a ton to be mad about.

946
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:11,120
Well, you know, now I feel like I'm going to try to rush it.

947
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,520
But here's the point where I tell you that everything we just talked about

948
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,320
was page one of my notes and I have like five more.

949
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,800
Here we go. I don't want to go.

950
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,400
I all right. All right.

951
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,240
You warned us. He did warn us. Yeah.

952
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,200
Yeah, because we tried to do it in a shorter amount of time.

953
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,640
And I was like, there's a lot here.

954
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,920
And and, you know, I'll try to, you know, breeze through it

955
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,720
and not just repeat material because credit to one, Mr.

956
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,360
Jim Hill, Disney podcaster, theme park podcaster, who

957
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,080
this might have been where I found Jim Hill initially a long time ago,

958
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:48,040
was he did this great article in like 10 parts breaking down

959
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,800
what happened to this show.

960
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,160
And it was with some hindsight.

961
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,040
I think he did it a couple of years later.

962
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,880
So he was able to like really collect what the hell the story was here

963
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,000
and how it got us to this point.

964
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,720
So so thank you, Jim Hill.

965
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,800
And, you know, at some point, you know, just to look up his article,

966
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,520
I'll try to not just, you know, recite it all or anything.

967
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,960
But you guys did not read this article.

968
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,680
I did not read this article.

969
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,160
I did not read the 10 part Jim Hill article.

970
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,680
No, I'm sorry.

971
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,360
I read it so long ago.

972
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,760
I loved it years ago and I love it today.

973
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,800
It's so wonderful.

974
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,760
So he explains everything pretty wonderfully and concisely.

975
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,680
As we sort of alluded to in the electrical parade episode,

976
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,440
they it was always kind of a weird stepchild

977
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,560
for some reason to the Disneyland Entertainment Group,

978
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,200
the Main Street Electrical Parade,

979
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,800
because it was janky and they rushed out and this was one guy

980
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,160
who doesn't even work here anymore, kind of threw it together.

981
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,920
And yeah, do people really care about this?

982
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,160
I think we could top it.

983
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,920
And by the time they got Fantasmic going,

984
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,360
that was such a shot in the arm for Disneyland Entertainment

985
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,880
that they thought, well, now you got to give us money

986
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:59,960
and let us do like the real nighttime street parade.

987
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,160
So they were super confident from that, super confident

988
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,720
from that Lion King parade that I mentioned.

989
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,320
And we can finally get rid of this thing.

990
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,520
Weird, right?

991
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,920
Like who, like what a disconnect with their own audience

992
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,560
to not understand.

993
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,320
It's interesting because it's kind of what I was saying

994
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,520
in the other one where I was like,

995
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,480
I bet they kind of felt weird about it.

996
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,960
I was saying maybe it was more of the people who made it, though.

997
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,400
But I'm always surprised.

998
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,000
It's Disneyland.

999
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,880
It's like the the 90s entertainment people didn't like this hokey,

1000
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,640
stupid 70s parade.

1001
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,800
I'm always surprised by stuff like that,

1002
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,160
because I think that's more common than we think.

1003
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:41,640
Things that you think are beloved or for the most part are beloved by fans.

1004
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,400
Oftentimes, the people that are in the company

1005
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:49,320
have a different feeling about it, whether it's ends up being

1006
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:53,200
like some weird personal thing or like they have an idea to top it.

1007
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,440
Like, yeah, I feel like I come across that a lot when I'm reading about,

1008
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:03,520
you know, long, like long lasting companies with whether it's like movies

1009
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,240
or characters or, yeah, rides and parades and stuff.

1010
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:11,240
Yeah, it's almost as if, you know, it's it's a little similar to like

1011
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:15,440
if there's, you know, old movies from the 70s and 80s

1012
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,200
that are sort of like a little bit janky.

1013
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,240
But that's that's sort of why you love them, because they have spirit.

1014
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,480
And then they get remade the real way today.

1015
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,000
Right. So much money, all the money.

1016
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,720
We're finally going to do it right.

1017
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,840
And then there is zero heart in the thing.

1018
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,040
It's almost like that.

1019
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,240
If you can think of any examples of that.

1020
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,800
No, I do nothing.

1021
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,000
Nothing comes to mind.

1022
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,320
Let's never happen in movies, mainly parades.

1023
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,560
Let's keep moving.

1024
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,840
So anyway, you know, they kind of had nothing going after.

1025
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,320
OK, so Indiana Jones is ninety five, ninety six, ninety seven.

1026
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,480
They don't really have anything lined up.

1027
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,920
So they go, oh, my God, in 96, we will get rid of the electrical parade.

1028
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,200
That'll be a big event.

1029
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,280
People come see that and say goodbye.

1030
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,600
And in 97, we can introduce the new thing.

1031
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,960
So now there's a ticking clock

1032
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,800
and we just have to figure out what the new thing is.

1033
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,880
And what they thought it was going to be for a while

1034
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,240
or what the anchor of it was going to be was something involving Tinkerbell.

1035
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,920
We should say Tinkerbell is not in light magic, maybe in the movie,

1036
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,720
I think, at some point, but not really prominently featured.

1037
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,680
Even though these are pixies, it would make sense for Tinkerbell to be there.

1038
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,880
She is not. And here is why. Because

1039
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,400
Disney was also never happy with the woman flying down the wire

1040
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,120
as Tinkerbell during the fireworks show.

1041
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,600
They were like, yeah, that's not really like the ultimate way

1042
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,440
we could have Tinkerbell in the park.

1043
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,480
And they were trying to figure out, is there a way to like

1044
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,760
have a Tinkerbell that flies around?

1045
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,920
And Tony Baxter, King,

1046
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:50,080
cooked up an idea, which is basically a drone before drones.

1047
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:54,320
Wow. Took a radio controlled helicopter

1048
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:58,280
and attached it to a stray Alice in Wonderland

1049
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:03,280
audio animatronic figure that was from the redone 83

1050
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,640
Alice in Wonderland ride.

1051
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:10,080
She he put a propeller on Alice, lit it from the inside

1052
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,960
and flew it around Disneyland when it was closed one night.

1053
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,760
Oh, my God. Yeah.

1054
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,320
And people said it was cool as hell.

1055
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,560
And it like went for a shockingly long time.

1056
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,360
It was a little precision. It could fly right up to people.

1057
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:28,400
They got it to like skim the moat in front of the castle.

1058
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,360
This was a huge success of an experiment.

1059
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,120
And they were like, well, let's this is so much better than the stunt woman.

1060
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,640
This is the way we'll feature Tinkerbell in the parks.

1061
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:41,200
We got to do this. Then the lawyers found out and they said,

1062
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,440
well, what if the thing goes awry?

1063
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,800
What if it flies off its path and like goes right into a kid's face?

1064
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:52,080
This would be PR nightmare lawsuit city.

1065
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,760
We can't do that.

1066
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,800
So, well, what if all right, we can't like fly it over the audience's head.

1067
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:02,120
So what if we all right, did it on the parade route?

1068
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,480
So everybody's like lying.

1069
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,280
Everybody's created a path.

1070
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,760
So maybe it's part of a parade that at the beginning, Tinkerbell

1071
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,920
does a straight line on a guide wire right through the middle of Main Street.

1072
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,600
OK, that's cool.

1073
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,600
Maybe we can do something with that.

1074
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:22,800
Um, in the meantime, this is where I'm sorry I didn't get to all this sooner.

1075
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:27,000
Have you guys ever in the history of learning about Disney things,

1076
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,400
ever heard the phrase the light keepers?

1077
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,000
I don't think so.

1078
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,920
Shockingly, no.

1079
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,560
This was all new to me.

1080
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:44,960
Bizarrely, the light keepers are an idea that was part of Tomorrowland 2055.

1081
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,200
Oh, I'm sure you guys have heard of this.

1082
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,680
We've talked about this a tiny bit.

1083
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:52,600
This never created the other version of Tomorrowland

1084
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,880
that was going to have something called Plecto's Intergalactic Review.

1085
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:00,880
And like it was going to kind of build out this whole world of alien mythology

1086
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,440
that Alien Encounter was part of.

1087
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,800
And they're to like promote all this and tell everybody,

1088
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,240
go to the amazing world over in Tomorrowland.

1089
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,000
There was this they had this idea called the light keepers.

1090
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,280
And this is what I alluded to in our in the Main Street Parade episode.

1091
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,960
Mike, you had an idea about like

1092
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,000
beings powered by light or something and light is their blood.

1093
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,400
Oh, right. Jason said that, I think.

1094
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,720
OK, that's what the light keepers are.

1095
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,600
They were a race of godlike creatures that created light.

1096
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,640
It's sort of in a Prometheus manner. Yeah.

1097
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,720
And there was going to be a big UFO that landed backstage.

1098
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:45,080
You'd watch it land and then the light keepers would start crawling around

1099
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:48,040
and a parade would kind of form behind them.

1100
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:52,240
And then they would like leave on a comet

1101
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,440
from back behind the small world area.

1102
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,360
We were all having a lot of fun in the 90s.

1103
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,720
Well, we were all watching the X-Files.

1104
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,200
What we heard. Oh, man.

1105
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:10,240
The X-Files River dance, Zima.

1106
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,840
All of the heights of culture.

1107
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,960
And then and then sorry, I'm confused here.

1108
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,280
The light keepers went away because Tomorrowland 2050 happened.

1109
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,360
So then they thought of a new thing called the lumens.

1110
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,920
And the lumens were the keepers of the light.

1111
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,960
And they traveled on a vehicle that was a cross between a sailing ship

1112
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,280
and a gypsy wagon.

1113
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,680
The lumens. So there's light keepers and there's lumens.

1114
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:42,000
They're gods who created light.

1115
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,240
I don't. This is all madness to me.

1116
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:51,120
This is funny, because this is like like Marvel Comics,

1117
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:55,440
like shit, the way they justify like, well, here's how superpowers exist.

1118
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,280
There was a group called the Eternals.

1119
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,720
And then the high evolutionary comes along.

1120
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,120
So it is kind of fitting that Disney would go along to buy Marvel,

1121
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,440
like 10 years later or so.

1122
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,760
Well, Kumail, Kumail and Salma Hayek are eternals.

1123
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,280
Yeah, I mean, they're going to be the light keepers, you know. Yes.

1124
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,240
Oh, that's right.

1125
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:20,080
And the light keepers also would have been super jacked. Super jacked.

1126
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:24,720
Everyone, the light keepers were been just rippling.

1127
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,640
Breathtaking. Yeah.

1128
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,640
Look, the light keepers would have presented us both with fire

1129
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:35,280
and mylar confetti, specifically mylar confetti.

1130
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,880
I like like fun.

1131
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,080
I'm glad. I mean, I know it was sort of over, but like the second

1132
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,920
I'm glad we are we are in the keeper mythology, though,

1133
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,200
because there's a lot of Disney keeper mythology.

1134
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,320
And now we got this to it. Yeah.

1135
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:52,840
Whoa.

1136
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,000
A lot of we should ask. Yeah.

1137
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,720
The next time we talk to him, we should ask if he knows the light keepers.

1138
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,000
We really. Yeah. Whenever.

1139
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,280
I don't know when we'll see him again.

1140
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,840
I don't know. Oh, boy.

1141
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,760
We have a boy, you know, it's been we got to start.

1142
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,320
We start shipping away at all of those missions that we got sent on.

1143
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,680
But, you know, with this damn lockdown,

1144
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,240
I just don't know when we're going to get to it.

1145
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,080
It's a good point.

1146
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:20,040
We may have to push doing all of those.

1147
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,480
Yeah, like push, maybe to never do them.

1148
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,440
We don't have to push and not ever do that.

1149
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,920
Unfortunately, I want to say, look, here's the thing.

1150
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:32,960
If we wish that we can do them, though, our dreams will become magic

1151
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,680
and we will be able to.

1152
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:38,200
So I don't want to I don't want to stop wishing that we'll be able to do it.

1153
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:42,200
I want to keep wishing so that our dreams do become real and magic.

1154
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:46,440
Yeah, Scott, don't forget the dreams of today are the magic of tomorrow.

1155
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,160
So something to keep in mind.

1156
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,840
It is something to keep it. Jason's right.

1157
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,400
It's something to keep in mind.

1158
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,200
Something to keep in mind.

1159
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,680
I'm I'm frightened by all this.

1160
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:04,840
This is this is not a mantra I like.

1161
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:09,560
Anyway, the whole so basically what I'm saying all that for is like

1162
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:13,000
none of those ideas anyone likes, but Disney merchandising was like,

1163
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,600
oh, my God, great.

1164
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,080
We can have all of this.

1165
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,760
The Electrical Parade didn't have characters.

1166
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,960
If we do something with characters, then we can sell merch and dolls

1167
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,960
of all of the characters.

1168
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:27,320
And that is why the idea of the lumens and the light keepers

1169
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,640
ended up becoming the pixies.

1170
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,520
We if we come up with all these pixie characters

1171
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,240
and everyone to love the pixies, we can sell dolls of all the pixies.

1172
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,000
And that brought us to where this thing was called Tinkerbell's Night Magic.

1173
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,760
And her name was in the title.

1174
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:44,240
Like the point of it was you're going to see Tinkerbell do a flyby

1175
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,840
and they're going to meet all the pixies. Right.

1176
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:52,800
This might be a good time to talk about the pixies who do did end it.

1177
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1178
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:59,120
Yeah, yeah. Although before you start, did they think they wouldn't make money

1179
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,480
on stuff like turtles with a cute hat on

1180
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,760
or like stuffed light up like neon snails?

1181
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,320
Like, what the hell?

1182
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,040
Yeah, why aren't they doing that already?

1183
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,240
Why aren't there? Why isn't there that now?

1184
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,360
I would buy that immediately.

1185
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,800
A stuffed stuffed characters of a bunch of the electrical parade.

1186
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,280
Yeah, that's great.

1187
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,240
Get it done, guys.

1188
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,840
Instagram ready.

1189
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,800
Yes, yes, absolutely.

1190
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,920
Much more so than gods of light.

1191
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:34,560
I feel that anyway, they didn't do gods of light.

1192
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,840
They settled on the pixies.

1193
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:41,160
And I had to go into a a message board containing a press release

1194
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:45,080
to find the full list of the pixies.

1195
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,600
Are we ready for? Yes.

1196
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,200
Let us know. Yeah, yeah.

1197
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,880
I am curious.

1198
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:55,880
Will you giggle with delight or will you groan?

1199
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,920
The thickest groan ever grown.

1200
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,120
Here they are. Let's meet the pixies.

1201
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,840
Do drop glitter wing.

1202
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,840
Penny whistle.

1203
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,040
Mary Bella.

1204
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,000
Tumble web.

1205
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,080
Huckle web.

1206
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,480
Cool. Yeah, there you go.

1207
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,880
That's the that's the that's the first mouth vomit.

1208
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,440
Bumble drop tickle top.

1209
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:29,400
Well, now now you've got me back.

1210
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,800
No, see, I I think I departed at tickle top.

1211
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,960
The guy's name is tickle.

1212
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,160
It's different strokes.

1213
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:43,160
I don't want to go a guy of character whose life is about tickling.

1214
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,720
I.

1215
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,000
Perry twinkle.

1216
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:53,920
Why now I'm struggling with whippersnap

1217
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,560
pepper pop.

1218
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,560
Katie did wiggle wink

1219
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,080
pedal skipper.

1220
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,400
Then we go down to one name.

1221
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,480
I don't know why.

1222
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,720
Cricket Piper.

1223
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,640
And finally, snuggle bud.

1224
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,280
Snuggle bud.

1225
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,080
Huh? I'm trying to think.

1226
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,600
I think I like wiggle wink the best.

1227
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:22,040
I think my favorite is to see if that even was one

1228
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,120
wiggle wink.

1229
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,320
I like my favorite.

1230
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:30,640
My two favorites are wiggle wink and skeetal branch.

1231
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,840
Those are my two favorites.

1232
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,120
What was the huckle one again?

1233
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,840
Huckle web huckle web

1234
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,520
huckle like huckle berries and then a web.

1235
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,120
So it's like a writer's web.

1236
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,560
It's a web that has a bunch of berries in it.

1237
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:52,560
Hmm. And there were this two webs is huckle web and tumble web.

1238
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,120
I'm not sure if they're related to Jack Webb from Dragnet.

1239
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,720
Probably probably different web.

1240
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,280
Oh, I forgot to note that snuggle bud.

1241
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,560
For some reason, it says snuggle bud or sniggle bud.

1242
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,880
What is two names?

1243
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,200
Yes, two names.

1244
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,400
Important thing about snuggle bud is he is also sniggle bud.

1245
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,920
Huh? Snuggle bud bud is also sniggle bud.

1246
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:17,840
Got it.

1247
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:22,400
With recreational marijuana legalization in California,

1248
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,120
the California Firefighters Association

1249
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:30,640
does not recommend snuggle bud because you could doze off

1250
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,640
with a kind roach in your bed.

1251
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,880
So very easy to light fires.

1252
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,200
So careful on that snuggle bud, folks.

1253
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:44,280
Jay, I wouldn't be very surprised if you would use

1254
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:48,600
the term snuggle bud in relation to smoking weed and sleeping.

1255
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,720
I would not be shocked.

1256
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:53,400
I know. I'm too sensitive to smell.

1257
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,280
I couldn't. I couldn't swing that.

1258
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,160
I'm too sensitive to time to become a snuggle bud,

1259
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:03,960
to snuggle, to snuggle in the covers with a little joint of marijuana.

1260
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:10,080
Too harsh on the lungs and too dangerous for fire safety.

1261
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:13,400
What if it was like a long kind of elfin like pipe,

1262
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:17,840
like a long pipe with a little like the some of the hobbits might smoke?

1263
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,560
Well, the theatricality.

1264
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,360
Now you have me back on board.

1265
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:26,600
Would you use a long pipe if I bought it for you for your birthday?

1266
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,760
Would you buy it for me?

1267
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,480
If it's at a reasonable price.

1268
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,440
OK, fair enough.

1269
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:39,680
The long pipe, though, then your hand is really far away from where you light it.

1270
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,360
Yeah, that's true.

1271
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:43,680
Yeah, that's true.

1272
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,440
But is there something with the long pipe?

1273
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,360
Do you have to continuously light the long pipe just like a normal pipe?

1274
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,720
Or is it a norm? Is it?

1275
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,920
Is there some other mechanism in there?

1276
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,040
You do occasionally have to.

1277
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:57,000
My dad smoked a pipe for many years and you do have to occasionally tamp down

1278
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:00,400
whatever is in there and relight sometimes.

1279
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,480
Yeah. Hmm. OK.

1280
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,040
Well, we'll investigate.

1281
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,960
Maybe there's new types of long hobbit pipes.

1282
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,160
Sure. Oh, I forgot to say that.

1283
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,400
Yeah. Wait, there's one more hobbit pipe.

1284
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,480
That was that was number seven.

1285
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,440
Sure. Mm hmm.

1286
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:20,520
I think actually all of these are probably weed varietals, right?

1287
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,400
Oh, yeah.

1288
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,440
I got a little is is bumble drop

1289
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:29,200
harsh like I get a little or like it would make me paranoid

1290
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,640
Am I better off going with the the pepper pop?

1291
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,920
Katie pepper, pepper pop is a sativa.

1292
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,400
So you definitely want the first one.

1293
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:46,240
Now, we do have a pedal skipper tumble web blend.

1294
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,200
If that sounds up your.

1295
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,240
Oh, yeah. Go with that.

1296
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:50,360
That'll mellow you out.

1297
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:54,400
Hydroponic experimentation with the strains. Sure.

1298
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:58,360
Yeah. I by the way, I said that as if that those words

1299
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,560
actually meant anything to me.

1300
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,560
So I hope that was close.

1301
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,080
It works. Yeah. All right.

1302
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,280
I bought it. Yeah, I don't know.

1303
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,520
Um, well, that is it.

1304
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,360
I am I'm drained from saying that list.

1305
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,040
Why did they make this list?

1306
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,080
No one's ever now.

1307
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:18,120
People might know that that's like the most anyone's ever thought about.

1308
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,040
These names is decades later.

1309
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:24,240
I yeah, this is it. Look, this is a thing where I don't I don't hate all those names,

1310
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:27,080
but I've seen the characters.

1311
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:31,080
So like, again, I would love and what I love on the show,

1312
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:35,920
when I declare I love characters, I just were made aware was made aware of.

1313
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:39,200
Yeah, I consistently love that.

1314
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:44,320
But much like Fuzzbucket, I don't like these characters.

1315
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,560
I can't get into them.

1316
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,720
No, it's hard.

1317
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,200
I think I love baby Grinch.

1318
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:57,000
I love Shrek's children, Fergal, Farkas and what's the third one?

1319
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,880
Felicia. Thank you.

1320
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:04,000
But I cannot in good conscious conscious,

1321
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,760
conscious, you know what I'm saying?

1322
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,440
Get behind these fairies and their names.

1323
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,200
They well, don't forget.

1324
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,360
Also, they look extremely scary.

1325
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,160
That's why I think that's the number one.

1326
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:20,760
I think that there's a there's a world where humble bud or whatever.

1327
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:25,600
I like him a lot because I like I can like and I like the elf characters.

1328
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,200
I like hobbits. I like all of that type of thing.

1329
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,360
But I think it's their nightmarish appearance.

1330
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,680
That is putting them off.

1331
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,120
And that's why we haven't heard about them in 20 years.

1332
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,800
That's why there's no nostalgia.

1333
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,080
There's no retro T-shirts with any of these characters on them

1334
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,320
that you can count as does it count as nostalgia?

1335
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:49,760
If you were scarred as a child by meeting one of these characters

1336
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:54,280
and you think about it nightly, I mean, that's like a little nostalgia

1337
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,880
implies that it's a nice feeling.

1338
01:11:55,880 --> 01:12:00,840
Yeah. If you're haunted by the because I should say that

1339
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,800
there is a part in this where children were chosen by the Pixies

1340
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,600
to come up and dance with them and with the characters.

1341
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,360
And so if you were five years old

1342
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:16,640
and you're still getting a grasp on reality and then a character

1343
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,520
in a strawberry hat and a big pointy

1344
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:23,400
like a very, very sharp nose walks up to you and says,

1345
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,800
I'm tickled top.

1346
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,720
Want to dance?

1347
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,040
I would. Would the character know name?

1348
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,160
I don't know that I'm adding that.

1349
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:37,360
I assume they would, but I just wanted to see if that was actually confirmed.

1350
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:41,080
Mm hmm. That is like in Mission Impossible,

1351
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:45,800
where Tom Cruise is just running at top speed and just going like, no, no, no, no, no.

1352
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:49,600
Like that is I don't like any of that.

1353
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:54,520
I think the the other thing that's kind of rubbing me the wrong way

1354
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:59,040
is that, you know, this parade did sample Baroque down

1355
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:04,280
like every nighttime parade is sampled Baroque down because they know who the king is.

1356
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:07,000
But then some of the other songs like

1357
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:11,760
be our guest step in time when you wish upon a star

1358
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,520
a dream is a wish your heart makes part of your world beauty and the like.

1359
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:19,280
It's the big it's so it's it's just too

1360
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,440
I don't know. It's too much of the hits.

1361
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,480
Do you know what I'm saying?

1362
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:27,320
Like it's all done in this unpleasant manner in this unpleasant manner.

1363
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:31,720
It's too like not condescending is too strong of a word.

1364
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,640
But like, I don't know.

1365
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,000
It's just rubbing me the wrong way.

1366
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,040
It's like desperate. So many great.

1367
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:40,400
It is. Yeah, it's desperate of like, you like all this stuff.

1368
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,000
You like this, right?

1369
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,160
Like you like this dance. Yeah.

1370
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:47,680
Some of it like that's that's a criticism I would have in general

1371
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:52,960
with like parades and shows like they do rely a lot on the big hits.

1372
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:57,200
Like when the when Disneyland had their 60th anniversary,

1373
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:02,840
the fireworks show had a lot of like these songs as opposed to the

1374
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:06,200
I forget the name of it, the Disneyland Fireworks Show that has like

1375
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,600
more like park space songs.

1376
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:14,160
But I was like, why are these movie songs and this show,

1377
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:16,800
which is supposed to be celebrating the history of the park?

1378
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:19,600
So I feel like they I feel like they like I feel like they get it

1379
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:25,000
like a little bit like people your average like vacationer won't be as engaged

1380
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,680
if we don't give them like part of your world or we don't give them

1381
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,600
the hits from the 90s.

1382
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:38,000
Well, don't discount that there was an original song within Light Magic.

1383
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:41,840
I will. I will discount that.

1384
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:42,880
No, you can't.

1385
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,080
You can't because we've been saying all these inspiring lyrics.

1386
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,840
And here I don't have a clip cued up, so I have to do it for memory,

1387
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,160
which I think I can.

1388
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:55,200
And we can dream our dreams together.

1389
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:58,400
Dream our dreams forever.

1390
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:03,440
Open your heart and keep the dream alive.

1391
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,960
Very profound.

1392
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,920
Very profound.

1393
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:14,600
A song that some for some reason has also not stood the test of time

1394
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:18,120
in the fan community.

1395
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,560
Yeah, I could be wrong.

1396
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,920
We're going to get yelled at because some people are going to be really like

1397
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,480
they're going to be like, well, like Magic Song was good.

1398
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,520
I don't think so.

1399
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:31,880
It's serviceable like it does its job.

1400
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:36,840
But like, again, trying to replace the Electrical Parade, it is it's bizarre.

1401
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:43,400
Yeah, it's just it's a very it's it's very paint by the numbers.

1402
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:49,080
Generic last 30 years, Disney type of song like the like Tokyo,

1403
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,880
Disney has a couple of different songs in the last couple of years

1404
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:57,240
that are very much in this vein, but much better song, like much better songs.

1405
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:02,040
Like the song they had when we were there for the for our trip

1406
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:06,720
a couple of years ago is just as sort of generic, but it's just like

1407
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,480
incredibly moving for some reason.

1408
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:14,080
Maybe it's because we were so enchanted by going to Japan,

1409
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:17,400
but this is like the the low end of that.

1410
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:21,880
The the parade that debuted right before the parks

1411
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:25,320
shut down for months and months and months,

1412
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,520
because I was there, you know, a little bit before that.

1413
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:32,960
And I don't remember the name of the parade, but I caught the song in passing

1414
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,000
and kind of a banger.

1415
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,320
They sort of figured out like a current pop song

1416
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,560
that was pretty good.

1417
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:44,640
I don't know if it's by Todrick Hall, who I'm not completely clear

1418
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,080
on what Todrick Hall has done, but I don't know.

1419
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:51,800
Look up this. If anybody caught it before the parks closed, and definitely

1420
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,040
pretty good. They like tried a different thing.

1421
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,760
And I think they got it.

1422
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:00,920
Um, they they have I we haven't talked about it yet.

1423
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:04,640
Mickey's mix magic, which they were doing,

1424
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:06,960
which is that everybody get your ears on.

1425
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,360
Remember this? Remember this song?

1426
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,600
Yeah, I like that song.

1427
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,320
Well, I like that song, too.

1428
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:16,680
When we were there, when we were in Florida in the fall of twenty nineteen,

1429
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:19,040
they were doing the parade.

1430
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:23,680
Was it called Shake It, Dance, Shake It, Mouse Could Dance It?

1431
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:28,080
Like Mouse Could Dance It was like really grim.

1432
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:31,840
Like I was like, I don't know, guys, I don't know what you're doing here.

1433
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:36,520
Move it, shake it, Mouse Could Dance it, shake it, Mouse Could Dance it.

1434
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,280
Like I did not like that.

1435
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:41,240
Don't know. I don't know about that made up word.

1436
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,240
Yeah, so there's been ups and downs.

1437
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,480
Check out the I don't remember the what is the parade called?

1438
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:51,160
Magic Happens is the parade.

1439
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,040
Yes, the Magic Happens song is good.

1440
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:58,560
And it's a bummer they had to close so fast because I had a good feeling about it.

1441
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,720
I actually haven't heard the song.

1442
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:03,080
I actually had just not gotten around to listening to it.

1443
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:06,040
I guess I wanted to be like fresh for the parade.

1444
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,840
Mm hmm. But who knows?

1445
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,280
Will magic happen?

1446
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,040
When will the I don't know.

1447
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:15,440
All I know is that the dreams of today are the magic of tomorrow.

1448
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:18,760
Oh, yeah. So that implies the magical happen tomorrow.

1449
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:21,080
Now you're getting it.

1450
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,760
I'm hearing a little bit of it.

1451
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,480
And I'm worried it's oh, it's like it's got a good beat.

1452
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:28,080
Yes. Yeah.

1453
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,160
Oh, yeah.

1454
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:33,760
Like they figured out current music in a not embarrassing way.

1455
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:38,080
I'm catching I think Todrick Hall is like a famous person.

1456
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,240
Yes, I believe so.

1457
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,880
Well, it's like that.

1458
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,440
It's like it almost sounds like that Descendants song that I like.

1459
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,960
Oh, you remember, I said this to you a while ago.

1460
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,600
It's this show, the Disney show, The Descendants, which is like a Disney

1461
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,800
channel show about the kids of the Disney villains.

1462
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,600
And I've never seen the show, but there's a couple songs I've heard, especially one.

1463
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,240
And I'm looking for the title of it that they were playing at a Disneyland.

1464
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:04,240
And I went, what is this song?

1465
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:08,600
Oh, this is this is like almost there's like a little bit of a couple

1466
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,400
cheesy parts in it, but I was like, this is pretty good.

1467
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,480
And it sounds a little bit like that to me.

1468
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:16,440
Are we is Disney music making a comeback?

1469
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:17,840
Are they figuring it out again?

1470
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,240
Yeah, maybe.

1471
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:23,080
I believe that's a series of movies.

1472
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:24,240
I don't think it's a show.

1473
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,360
Oh, is that right?

1474
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,600
I could be. I think so. Maybe you're showing.

1475
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,040
We're sounding a million years old.

1476
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,360
Extremely. Yeah.

1477
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:36,320
If we hang on, if we knew everything about The Descendants, I think we

1478
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:39,600
that would be more that would be more upsetting.

1479
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:39,880
Yes.

1480
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:42,840
And we're creepier than we're creepier than Wiggle Wink.

1481
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:47,880
Here's the full here's the full roster of Hollywood records, everyone.

1482
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:50,560
Jason is correct.

1483
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,080
It is movie.

1484
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,200
There are movies.

1485
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:56,280
The first one directed by Kenny Ortega.

1486
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,320
Oh, yeah. Well, he's the guy.

1487
01:19:58,520 --> 01:19:59,600
High School Musical.

1488
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,280
He's the guy.

1489
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,480
So all right.

1490
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:06,880
All all of that.

1491
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:11,840
OK, so we have ended up with this bizarre mix of it's a show.

1492
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,640
OK, like it's I think it's all the departments are essentially,

1493
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,640
you know, like adding idea.

1494
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:20,040
OK, so it's got to be there's going to be characters so we can do merch.

1495
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:21,320
It's going to be a show.

1496
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:24,000
Fantasmic has this part with a movie and people like that a lot.

1497
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:26,000
There should be like a surprise movie.

1498
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,360
And then Tinkerbell is going to go by in the middle.

1499
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:33,040
And so it's like it's all of these things and nothing all at the same time.

1500
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,000
It's just it's it's too many cooks.

1501
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,840
And meanwhile, the whole point of this whole thing, the Tinkerbell is going to fly by.

1502
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,280
They did a test of it and Tinkerbell crashed and burned,

1503
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,120
just like shattered in the ground.

1504
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:46,160
So like, we're not doing that legal.

1505
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:47,280
Like, forget it out.

1506
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,680
Take Tinkerbell's name out of the thing.

1507
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:49,640
We're not doing this.

1508
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:53,920
So it goes from somewhere in that from night magic to light magic.

1509
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:59,360
But with all of the sort of making it too many things at once

1510
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:02,920
and they're really rushing the company that's building all of the floats

1511
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:06,200
and, you know, we're baggots, exactly what happened in the 70s.

1512
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,880
Except they're at Disney's completely at fault in this case.

1513
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,360
And they cannot change the date.

1514
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:14,360
They've announced it.

1515
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:18,720
And they realize like, oh, we made so much money off those APs, you know,

1516
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:22,040
having having them say goodbye to Electrical Parade, we can do a big event.

1517
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:26,680
So they book an annual passholder event for twenty five dollars,

1518
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:30,840
which now seems like a real steal of a deal considering how much they charge

1519
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:31,680
for these very good.

1520
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,080
I was. Yeah, yeah.

1521
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,480
But this was this was new at the time.

1522
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:36,960
But so people are paying extra.

1523
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:41,040
And for that, they get to see the parade before anybody else sees the parade.

1524
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,120
But it becomes clear as they're barreling towards this night

1525
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:47,040
is not going to work, is not going to be ready in time.

1526
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:51,480
So they send out Paul Pressler, who is possibly the reason why the park's

1527
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,440
got so shitty for a long time.

1528
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:57,680
It's a long story, but he's you know, he was way more merch than he was caring

1529
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,080
about shows and stuff.

1530
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,440
He comes out and gives a confusing speech where he says,

1531
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:06,240
so what you get to see, what you've paid to see

1532
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:11,240
is a rare peek at a rehearsal, the very first rehearsal

1533
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:13,600
of our new parade, isn't that cool?

1534
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,920
And he says rehearsal over and over and everybody starts grumbling like, what?

1535
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:20,760
Why? I never saw the word rehearsal until now.

1536
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,000
So something is amiss.

1537
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,920
And and then and what I'm trying to do, I'm looking at what else they had fucked up.

1538
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,840
They're also like selling

1539
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,760
three hundred dollar light magic letterman jackets with

1540
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,840
more optics on the inside.

1541
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Well, let me find that on eBay.

1542
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,440
That rocks. Yeah. Yeah.

1543
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,040
That's pretty cool.

1544
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:45,760
And then like, what am I missing?

1545
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,840
This is this whole like

1546
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:52,120
they cut from the budget, this whole thing where

1547
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:55,840
cast members before the parade started, we're going to walk up

1548
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:59,560
and down the parade route and say, hey, have you guys seen any pixies

1549
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:00,880
around here lately?

1550
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:06,640
OK, because I hear that I was looking at these charts and it's the the,

1551
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:10,160
you know, the astrology is showing me that the stars are aligning,

1552
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:13,040
which means we could be in prime time for a pixie visit.

1553
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,960
So keep on the lookout, everyone.

1554
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:16,560
What?

1555
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:19,440
I this is the thing that Jim Hill claims like would have helped everyone

1556
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,120
understand what the story is and why there are pixies.

1557
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:25,080
But that seems so confusing to me.

1558
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,560
And oh, and that dialogue included this.

1559
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,680
These characters were called pixie hunters.

1560
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:33,560
What? Yes.

1561
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:34,760
Yeah. Wait, wait. Sorry.

1562
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,560
I flat past that hunters. Hunters.

1563
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:40,880
The stars are aligning.

1564
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,000
We could be due for a pixie visit anyway.

1565
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,760
That'll put me in prime spots and nail one right in the head.

1566
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:50,120
Here, I got I got a I got a loaded gun.

1567
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,600
I'm on the lookout for pixies.

1568
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,320
I'm going to nail me five pixie hides tonight.

1569
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:01,920
Look, we be on the lookout for these beauties or X-Men or whatever you call them.

1570
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:07,080
Hey, kid, take my knife in case you see a pixie, stab one of them.

1571
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:09,640
It'll slow them down so I can catch them.

1572
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:12,200
They'll try to trick you.

1573
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:14,360
They'll try to trick you.

1574
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,160
I'm taking them to the pixie flesh fair.

1575
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,800
We can all take out our anger on pixies together.

1576
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:23,120
Shoot them out of cannons.

1577
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:27,600
Finding a lot of light magic denim jackets.

1578
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,360
Yes, I see a lot of denim denim light magic jackets.

1579
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:33,600
One hundred and twenty dollars.

1580
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,240
Hey, would you buy one of those for me?

1581
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:38,720
Fiber optics lights on logo.

1582
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:43,520
Well, $90, a $20 shipping.

1583
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:45,840
Damn. Make an offer.

1584
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:46,840
How much?

1585
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,600
Forty five, thirty five.

1586
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:54,480
Maybe I maybe I maybe I will.

1587
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:57,880
Hopefully we'll all forget it and then I'll try to buy it for Jason for his birthday.

1588
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:02,480
Oh, OK. I was going to say, though, next live show, if we all come out,

1589
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,920
if we don't like to break even.

1590
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:11,920
Matching matching light magic denim jacket denim jacket.

1591
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:18,320
I think like somehow that would awaken that would awaken the spirits

1592
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:22,720
of middle school bullies who didn't have the chance to beat us up then.

1593
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:24,120
No way.

1594
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:26,080
Into the theater and find us.

1595
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:30,080
If I got a light magic logo on the back and a universal

1596
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:35,200
escape logo on the T-shirt, like a beat up universal

1597
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:38,800
escape for the one round of merchandise, they did with those logos.

1598
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,480
I think I'm the coolest kid in school.

1599
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:45,200
Coolest kid. Yeah. Coolest kid in the city.

1600
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,840
I am seeing a Disney denim embroidered.

1601
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,600
Is this what you found? Light magic.

1602
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,640
Premier Party jacket.

1603
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:56,120
Oh, that's got to be from this May 1997.

1604
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:59,040
It says, but unlike the other, the other ones don't say Premier Party.

1605
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,200
This one says Premier Party.

1606
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:05,760
How much is going for this one is one hundred and twenty to fifteen dollars shipping.

1607
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:10,320
But it's all if they bought it for three hundred on the night of this is kind of

1608
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:11,880
still a little bit of a steal.

1609
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,880
Yes, really? Yeah, I would agree.

1610
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:16,200
Yeah. Ninety or seventy five.

1611
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:18,760
I feel like seventy five.

1612
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:21,080
I'm seeing at least starting bid.

1613
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:23,480
Hmm. Hmm. Give it a shot.

1614
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:27,480
If we could do it. The problem is when you search light magic jacket,

1615
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:31,400
you get some industrial light and magic crew gifts,

1616
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,840
which would also be a funny thing to walk out wearing.

1617
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,160
Yeah, matching.

1618
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,760
I'll let him.

1619
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:45,800
Yeah, for red tails, matching red tails, crew gifts.

1620
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:51,400
Oh, boy.

1621
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:56,440
Um, anyway, I the Pixie hunters hurry off

1622
01:26:56,440 --> 01:27:00,960
and they say we've got to go warn Mickey about this cosmic occurrence.

1623
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:05,200
You know, those tunes, they hit the hay right after the sun sets.

1624
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:10,080
If we don't wake them up in time, they'll probably sleep through the whole thing.

1625
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,360
So so the Pixie, here's what you need to know.

1626
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:19,760
The Pixie hunters need to wake up Mickey from his famously early bedtime

1627
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:22,840
or else he'll miss the parade.

1628
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:27,360
Where are we? What are we?

1629
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,520
What is the logic like?

1630
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:33,600
Is he like when people he's in his out his suit, like after dark,

1631
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,720
it's happened plenty of times where you can go get a photo with Mickey

1632
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:40,840
after the sun goes down all the time, constantly.

1633
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:45,040
He's always yeah, he's he is clad in bowtie at midnight.

1634
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:46,800
What is this new thing?

1635
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:50,200
You know, those tunes, they hit the hay.

1636
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:55,040
If it's daylight savings, the tunes are going to bed at about, you know, 455.

1637
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:59,720
Right. It's like the tunes are like Jason's sleep schedule.

1638
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:01,680
Yeah.

1639
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:08,000
Are they just trying to justify why Toontown closes before the rest of the park?

1640
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,360
I think that's still going on.

1641
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:13,240
That still strikes me as weird.

1642
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:14,080
That is a good point.

1643
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:17,000
I wonder if that's that is part of it.

1644
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,520
It's very it's it's very clear.

1645
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:22,200
Hey, what's up, folks? I'm a Pixie hunter.

1646
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,280
I've been checking the charts and the Pixies are coming,

1647
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:25,840
so I got to go wake up the tunes.

1648
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:26,840
They live in Toontown.

1649
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:30,120
They close up shop at six because tunes go to sleep early.

1650
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:31,960
And that's why the gate is always closed early.

1651
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:33,080
So I have to go.

1652
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:38,080
This is part of this like newer trend of like, and I know they didn't do this,

1653
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:42,920
but like where we need to explain, it's like no one needed the backstory

1654
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:45,040
of the Main Street Electrical Parade.

1655
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:48,160
No one needed to know.

1656
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:56,040
I like that Imagineering has stories for everything, but every now and then

1657
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:58,560
I'm like, all right, guys, that's enough.

1658
01:28:58,560 --> 01:28:59,560
Come on now.

1659
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:05,640
I like this with this magic magnification slash

1660
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:08,560
luminescence machine.

1661
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:13,760
We've taken an ordinary snail and made it giant and glowing.

1662
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:14,760
Yeah.

1663
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:18,120
Everyone get out of its way or it'll infect you.

1664
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,040
Stand behind the yellow lines.

1665
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,360
The seven dwarves are going through a midlife crisis,

1666
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,880
and they've decided to dress a little bit differently from now on.

1667
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,640
They want to see more hip and with it.

1668
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:31,320
They want to be like their favorite rock and roll icons.

1669
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:38,240
So be prepared when they're wearing your shiny pants or leather pants.

1670
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:44,760
Hey, if Dopey's got his kids with them, they're on a visitation.

1671
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:46,400
So try not to bother Dopey.

1672
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,920
Get your picture with the six other dwarves.

1673
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:52,800
Don't take pictures of Dopey Jr.

1674
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,360
Dopey's the dumbest.

1675
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:00,400
Dopey's the dumbest, so he didn't practice safe sex.

1676
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:03,040
So he had too many children, too young.

1677
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,400
Yeah. Yeah.

1678
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,920
He had like 25 kids when he was 10.

1679
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:14,120
And to have to pay for all of them using gems.

1680
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,200
Well, those are very valuable, though.

1681
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:17,560
So that's true.

1682
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:22,240
But he's got to he's got to get like 200 a day just to make ends meet.

1683
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:23,040
That's a good point.

1684
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,520
That is why I get to them before the other dwarves.

1685
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,560
You know what I was thinking?

1686
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:31,000
There is a character that we came upon on a second gate episode

1687
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,560
that really would be perfect for the light magic parade,

1688
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:36,560
and they could have just plugged him in easily and no one would have.

1689
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:39,320
Everyone would have been like, this is this character is perfect here.

1690
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,520
Do we know who I'm talking about?

1691
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,600
No. Leonardo Columbus.

1692
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:49,920
Oh, it does me well to hear that name again. Yeah.

1693
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:54,320
Famous Epcot character from Tapestry of Dreams

1694
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,760
later in the Tapestry of Dreams.

1695
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,440
Leonardo Columbus.

1696
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:03,000
Who Leonardo Columbus from Tapestry of Dreams would have been right at home

1697
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,320
in light magic, the parade that teaches you that the dreams of today

1698
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:09,720
are the magic of tomorrow. Yes. Yes.

1699
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:14,680
Exactly. So you put he would just be like hanging out in

1700
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:17,480
in one of these different floats.

1701
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:18,800
And it would have been great.

1702
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:23,200
I mean, they would have gotten breathe new life into a classic character.

1703
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:26,920
Banging on a giant gumdrop. Yeah.

1704
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,760
Wow. There goes Leonardo.

1705
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:33,200
You wouldn't think that Glitterwing and Petalskipper

1706
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:37,360
would be good friends with Leonardo Columbus, but they're best buds.

1707
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,840
Yeah, he's as his bumble bud.

1708
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,960
Maybe he's like a pixie keeper or something.

1709
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:48,360
There's now there's more story we have to more extra story.

1710
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:51,480
Every millennium, the gates of time open up

1711
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:54,440
and through it steps a pixie keeper.

1712
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:57,280
He keeps them safe from the pixie hunters.

1713
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:02,640
The pixie hunter, the pixie keeper.

1714
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:08,360
OK, just so you're clear, the pixie keeper is different than the pixie hunter.

1715
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,960
The pixie keeper is good.

1716
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:14,160
The pixie hunters are bad.

1717
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:18,840
But they also though they are bad, they're also the ones who go

1718
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:22,960
and wake up the characters who go to bed at early bird times,

1719
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,640
which is not necessarily bad.

1720
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:28,160
Not so not everything they do is bad.

1721
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:31,720
It's a symbiotic relationship, a symbiote.

1722
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:35,800
OK, we use you can't get rid of the pixie hunters.

1723
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,800
You need the pixie hunters and the pixie keepers.

1724
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:43,200
They balance each other out.

1725
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,680
Don't be scared.

1726
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:45,640
Do it.

1727
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,480
Whip or snap will be fine, as long as there are both pixie keepers

1728
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:53,680
and pixie hunters.

1729
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:57,720
My brain is so tired right now.

1730
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:04,160
I know. We have to we have to end this soon or I'm like my chest is hurting,

1731
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:06,200
as is my brain.

1732
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,800
I don't need to.

1733
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:09,680
Oh, wait, so wait, one more thing.

1734
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:11,160
I'll say. Yeah.

1735
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:12,360
On man.

1736
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:15,320
OK, in addition to all this, we're talking about the gate of time

1737
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:18,680
opening once a millennium in this on extra special nights,

1738
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:22,520
a magical doorway opens between our world and the fairy realm.

1739
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:27,040
And if we're lucky, the pixies might appear and teach us the secret

1740
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:29,440
of making our dreams come true.

1741
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:32,160
Wow. Oh, fuck.

1742
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:36,200
They teach us the secret to the tapestry of our dreams.

1743
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:42,280
Which and the tapestry includes both the magic of light and the magic of night.

1744
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:45,480
Magic of light, magic of night.

1745
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:47,200
Oh, God.

1746
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:49,560
Oh, God. Brain rotting shit.

1747
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:54,800
So long story short, this parade, which even when it's operating,

1748
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:58,440
operated at its best, was disliked on its first night

1749
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:03,560
when it was a sudden rehearsal that people paid to see operated very terribly.

1750
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:08,880
As I said, the opening, you know, very jarring Celtic horns

1751
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,040
just blared in a loop for seven straight minutes.

1752
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:14,040
One of the floats was missing.

1753
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:16,680
All kinds of shit went wrong.

1754
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:21,800
And pass holders all there was a line out the door of City Hall.

1755
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,400
People demanding their money back.

1756
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,760
Does my God PR nightmare.

1757
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:31,360
And one of the people in that line and in the audience is a name that you will know.

1758
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:34,200
And that name is Al Lutz. Wow.

1759
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:37,000
Oh, yeah. Yep. Yep.

1760
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,160
Bizarre figure who keeps coming up on the show at that time

1761
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:42,800
was a major figure in all Disney,

1762
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,840
not Disneyland, a real big like fan complainer, real pass

1763
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:51,520
hole, as you might say, and he got his review up ASAP.

1764
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,800
He actually said, I'm sorry if this wasn't thorough enough.

1765
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,800
I stayed up all night to write it. And it's six a.m. now.

1766
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:00,000
He like drove home.

1767
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,360
Let me please details.

1768
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,480
And it was a gigantic write up.

1769
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:06,320
He did the highlight of which is the beginning where he says,

1770
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:09,480
I'm very sorry to have to say that as a show and concept,

1771
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:12,680
it is a complete and total abject failure, folks.

1772
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:16,760
Until last night, I had never seen an audience start to boo a show

1773
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:20,720
at the park before ever.

1774
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:23,920
He he also described it as Yanni meets the chieftains,

1775
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:27,880
which is pretty damning in and of itself.

1776
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,800
And he like he's he does.

1777
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:33,320
It's a very like it's like a Twitter thread before there were Twitter threads.

1778
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:37,520
He says, stop all caps ads for everywhere for light magic.

1779
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:40,880
Now there are serious problems with how it runs and how it is stage.

1780
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:42,720
It is not ready for prime time.

1781
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:46,880
Cut the running time of the show in half now that there is too much dancing.

1782
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:48,880
The choreography is limited.

1783
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,920
It will not sustain interest.

1784
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:53,320
It is a screed that this guy posts.

1785
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:54,920
And then that's quoted in the L.A.

1786
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:58,880
Times legitimately outlets helped kill this show right out of the gate.

1787
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,600
Wow. That rules that rock so much.

1788
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:06,520
Right. He stayed up all night like a real journalist.

1789
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,960
This is a real the post scenario.

1790
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:15,080
He got it out this time and the Disney scandal of the summer.

1791
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:17,360
They never recovered from it.

1792
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,800
A horrible PR right out of the gate.

1793
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:22,720
And yeah, one of the biggest failures in Disneyland history.

1794
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:29,080
I have a few quick things, and I am only saying these because Yesterland,

1795
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:31,720
which is a great resource to kill a few hours.

1796
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:36,520
I mean, it's very thorough about like long gone Disneyland and Disney World stuff

1797
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:40,920
emphasize these points to the point where I was like,

1798
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:45,400
this is kind of unusual for this website to like emphasize these things.

1799
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:48,360
So I thought I'd call them out.

1800
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:49,960
I mentioned this earlier.

1801
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:53,320
One, the confetti they fired off was mylar,

1802
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:57,160
which is a very like thin kind of plastic.

1803
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:00,000
I thought you were I thought you were making a joke.

1804
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:03,080
Oh, no, they fired off mylar confetti,

1805
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:06,040
which was apparently very difficult to clean up.

1806
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:10,760
You know, confetti, normally little bits of paper where if you don't get it all,

1807
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:13,560
it doesn't matter because it biodegrades pretty quickly.

1808
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:17,080
No, no, this was sheets of plastic.

1809
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,000
I have something about.

1810
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,040
OK, so in that Los Angeles Times article I keep bringing up here,

1811
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:24,080
I'm just going to read these two sentences.

1812
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:26,360
Pixies tossing about silver confetti,

1813
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:30,560
pixie dust and larger confetti storms had most children squealing in delight.

1814
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:32,440
But there were exceptions.

1815
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:35,520
Look what she did to our food, exclaimed one little girl

1816
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:38,160
after a dusting left her meal inedible.

1817
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:39,800
Oh, my God.

1818
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:43,880
Oh, my God.

1819
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:49,120
They blasted mylar into somebody's food.

1820
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,640
So that is the pixie dust.

1821
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:58,960
The pixie dust is mylar confetti is mylar confetti.

1822
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:02,200
They make balloons out flammable.

1823
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:04,160
Yeah, that's right.

1824
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:08,440
Um, the other thing is that so the long

1825
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:12,360
the stuff you can still see from light magic,

1826
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:18,800
those big light rigs over by small world sort of in the small world style

1827
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:23,000
were originally set up for light magic.

1828
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:27,160
And there's still that infrastructure improvement is still there.

1829
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:30,840
So that's you can thank light magic for that.

1830
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:33,560
You have to credit the and they they also tiered it.

1831
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:37,360
They made it so like, you know, you could, you know, here's like increasing steps

1832
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:40,040
so more people could have a view of the parade.

1833
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:44,480
So, yes, there were infrastructural accomplishments that came out of this thing.

1834
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:49,440
Yeah. So it wasn't all bad.

1835
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,920
It wasn't all bad.

1836
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,760
That there was still was more bad, such as that the five

1837
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:02,560
Lazarus, the fiber optic company that they hired to put in all the for that.

1838
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:03,880
I guess that's we missed that.

1839
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:07,480
There was a lot of fiber optics in this and they've used that throughout to to.

1840
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:10,840
They've used fiber optics to good effect in the fantasy land rides.

1841
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:13,920
And so you can also credit it with like, oh, they got to experiment with fiber

1842
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:16,280
optics. But anyway, the company they hired

1843
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:20,040
sued Disney for hurting their reputation, for claiming it was all their faults.

1844
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:22,840
The floats weren't ready and that event was a disaster.

1845
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:27,360
They also Lazarus apparently was also owed half a million dollars

1846
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,640
in unpaid labor by Disney.

1847
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:31,960
Oh, my God. I forget how that played out.

1848
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:37,000
Yep. But they got very hardcore sued by a fiber optics company. Wow.

1849
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:41,680
Do you do you guys know the final fuck you of this parade?

1850
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:44,840
Maybe not. I don't know.

1851
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:49,280
When they retired it, they said it will return in the year

1852
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:55,720
2000, which they said in the fall of 1997,

1853
01:39:55,720 --> 01:40:00,360
if an attraction goes down for three years,

1854
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:05,040
that means the entire track is being gutted and redone.

1855
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:10,720
If a parade is being retired for three years, it's dead.

1856
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:12,600
Like that's such a fuck you.

1857
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:17,720
That's so wild that they're like, it'll be back in the year 2000.

1858
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:20,640
That is that is interesting that they would say that because like

1859
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,000
they famously like kind of don't like to announce when something is done.

1860
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:27,120
It's kind of just a quiet.

1861
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:30,120
It's a quiet disappearing, unless it's some big famous thing.

1862
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:34,400
Yeah, like, yeah, it's sort of like they don't want to like acknowledge it.

1863
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:37,280
So like, yeah, were they thinking like, well, I'll just say it like

1864
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:40,280
everyone's going to forget in three years.

1865
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:43,800
Yeah, very similarly, they said the rocket rods would be back

1866
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,520
and they did not return.

1867
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:47,240
I mean, we got to hit rocket rods soon.

1868
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:49,720
I know. Wow.

1869
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:51,520
Yeah, that's a whole other.

1870
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:55,120
It's all kind of like the at the end of Mac and me

1871
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:59,320
where one of the aliens blows a big bubble gum bubble

1872
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:01,600
and the bubble says, we'll be back.

1873
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:04,800
Oh, it's like a threat.

1874
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:08,080
It's more of a lesser sequel implication and more of a threat.

1875
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:11,120
Yeah, she's kind of like this.

1876
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:16,960
I think I find the Mac and me aliens cuter than Snigglewig and all these fucks.

1877
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:18,480
We need I agree.

1878
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:21,520
We need like we need inside inside

1879
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:25,800
inside sources that would let us go on and talk about stuff like

1880
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:28,280
was there a fight to keep it?

1881
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:30,520
Was there actually like they're like, yes, we will.

1882
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:34,000
We will actually make this vision a reality in 2000.

1883
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,600
And then other people were like, let's just cut our losses here.

1884
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:39,760
I want to know all that stuff.

1885
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,800
It was that guy.

1886
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:42,720
It might have been that guy.

1887
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:45,040
We cannot kill the dreams of tomorrow.

1888
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:46,160
The magic of tomorrow.

1889
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:48,160
They must. The dreams must live on.

1890
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:52,400
Huh? You can you can slash the it's up there.

1891
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:54,280
It's easy for you up there in your ivory tower.

1892
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:56,480
You can just delete an item in a spreadsheet.

1893
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:59,960
But how am I going to break this to the to the people who matter

1894
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:04,920
to tumble web to to pepper pop to wiggle wink

1895
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:07,480
and not not little huckle web?

1896
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:10,040
Please don't make me fire little huckle web.

1897
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:12,440
Come on, man.

1898
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:15,200
Bitty bottom just had a fucking kid.

1899
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:16,880
Come on.

1900
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,360
Huckle web like going like a slow,

1901
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:23,760
sad movie scene of huckle web going home and telling his wife he got laid off.

1902
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:32,680
Rubble, rubble, snug, rubble, snug, just bought a house.

1903
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,440
He thought he was going to be here for years.

1904
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:42,160
Giggle bottom wasn't just liked, he was well liked.

1905
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:44,960
OK, we're going to have to move

1906
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:48,440
back to the enchanted forest.

1907
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:52,000
Cheaper than really Loman was a pixie.

1908
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:55,240
It's a pixie among pixies.

1909
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:02,040
What a topic.

1910
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:07,080
I how can you do this to ripple, but

1911
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:10,160
ripple, ripple, but is sick.

1912
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:13,200
You just got diagnosed.

1913
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:15,440
This is not the time.

1914
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:18,640
After all, ripple, but is done for you.

1915
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:20,600
We should do a challenge

1916
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:25,080
for the social media where we give we give ourselves like two minutes

1917
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:27,360
and we just come up with as many names.

1918
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:32,720
As we can in those two minutes.

1919
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:35,280
And then like, we'll post them or we'll post a video of it.

1920
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:38,000
Hopefully, we'll remember to do this.

1921
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,360
All right, we got to Hickle Dick.

1922
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:44,560
Tummy, tummy toodles.

1923
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:51,200
Toofy spooder.

1924
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:56,760
Well, now, now you're making money if you're talking to spooders.

1925
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:01,000
Toofy spooder is a good proven merchandise commodity. Yes. Yeah.

1926
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:05,720
I think there's one more thing I could say that really that

1927
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:09,000
sums up the spirit of light magic, and it's a moment

1928
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:12,080
involving our friend, Tony Little,

1929
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:17,520
who is interviewing a soap opera star who I've never seen before in my life,

1930
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:21,960
who is one of the one of the only celebrities available for this event.

1931
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:27,920
And Tony is interviewing this guy and his wife and his two little children.

1932
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,640
You know, really young boys.

1933
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:34,320
And, you know, she wants to get them involved.

1934
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:39,040
So she leans in and like, well, boy, this is a pretty spectacular night, huh?

1935
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:40,880
A new street, tackler.

1936
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:43,320
Is there anything you're especially looking forward to tonight?

1937
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:47,640
And the kid kid kind of like goes inward and says,

1938
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,880
Oh, I guess not.

1939
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:56,920
And then stops talking and kind of like goes like hugs his dad's leg.

1940
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:59,200
Like, don't make me talk anymore.

1941
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:01,480
And they let that in.

1942
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:03,680
Well, it was live. Oh, no.

1943
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:07,000
I don't know. Oh, no.

1944
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,240
That's not.

1945
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:13,440
That's the reason now that all these newer specials are so like polished

1946
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:17,520
is because of like Regis saying weird stuff to the audience and like kids

1947
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,760
saying that they're not excited about any of this crap.

1948
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:24,680
They are making damn sure that Doug Jones can't do any of his mixes.

1949
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:29,040
They're like the mixes he makes a bizarre moments in these specials are impossible.

1950
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:32,560
There are they're designed to have no moments like that.

1951
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:33,840
Yeah, it's a shame.

1952
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:36,840
It's a real shame. No father.

1953
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:42,440
I but that kid starting to tear up, mumbling, I guess not.

1954
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:45,440
And then hugging his father.

1955
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:49,720
That's that's sort of how light magic makes you feel at the end of the day.

1956
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:53,120
Makes you want to call your dad, give him a hug.

1957
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:56,320
Think about anything else.

1958
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:59,200
Just try to hide from the world.

1959
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:02,480
That's that's right.

1960
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:07,080
You want to you want to you want to hug your dad, not see a huggle dad.

1961
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:17,760
All that said, we would we would 100 percent by huggle dad merch.

1962
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:19,520
I would buy a T-shirt.

1963
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:23,640
I would buy a T-shirt if they did a throwback shirt with the light magic logo

1964
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:27,320
with the logo they had on the giant sign

1965
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:32,160
by the the kind of overpay the underpasses that lead to Main Street.

1966
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:35,600
I know where you can get a denim jacket, Jason.

1967
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,560
I think this needs to be done.

1968
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:42,880
This needs to be, you know, let's make let's make some offers.

1969
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:46,400
How long do fiber optics last?

1970
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:47,960
Twenty.

1971
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:50,040
Twenty three years.

1972
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:50,880
Do they still work?

1973
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:55,480
Twenty three years later, we should sue the fiber optics company if they don't work.

1974
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:59,800
Sam, right. Oh, hell, you're us.

1975
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:06,200
I well, let's order this item and then we'll ask how long before it comes?

1976
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:08,320
When is the how long is the shipping take?

1977
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:12,280
And and I bet their answer will be, well, all we can say is the dreams

1978
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:14,400
of today are the magic of tomorrow.

1979
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:17,920
Shipping twenty five dollars.

1980
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:19,080
Fair enough.

1981
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:22,880
I guess with that, what did we settle on again?

1982
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:26,520
You you listened to podcast, the right you pay up with.

1983
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:29,560
I think I said you put out you put up you put up with podcast, the right.

1984
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:32,920
It would very true in this case.

1985
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:34,960
Dear God, we really boy.

1986
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:36,160
And we recorded these in the same day.

1987
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:40,840
So we really we really ran the gamut from a parade of delights

1988
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:43,080
to a parade of fright.

1989
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:47,960
And the lights like the lights in this room are going down.

1990
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:52,760
I feel like I've I feel like I've lived the whole three months at the parade existed.

1991
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:55,360
Yeah.

1992
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:59,480
I also dear Lord, I want to quick say that the song I was talking about

1993
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:03,200
is called Chillin Like a Villain from the Descendants Two.

1994
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:06,800
That's the song I like.

1995
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:07,640
Right.

1996
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:12,720
Um, well, sounds sounds better than dream your dreams together.

1997
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:14,880
It is a lot better.

1998
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:18,320
But I would encourage everyone listening to open your hearts

1999
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:21,920
and keep your dreams alive.

2000
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:28,040
And if you don't open your hearts, then, you know, Snickleweb

2001
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:30,160
be in your bedroom.

2002
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:34,800
We should I'll just do not say Snickleweb three times into a mirror.

2003
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:36,960
Whatever you do.

2004
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:42,680
I should just put in like random sideshow Bob getting hit with the rake noises.

2005
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,760
This episode is like this very it's like the sentiment of most of it,

2006
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,760
of what we're reacting to for sure.

2007
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,920
Well, then you're right before you're right before we go.

2008
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:59,720
Let me just remind of one more glitter wing.

01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:03,280
Do it now, do it.

2010
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:04,240
Somebody's got to do it here.

2011
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:05,640
Glitter wing.

2012
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:09,360
Oh, that about says it.

2013
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:11,960
All right, folks, thanks for listening.

2014
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:14,240
Thanks for tolerating.

2015
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:16,480
Bye bye. Bye.
