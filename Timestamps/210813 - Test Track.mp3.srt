1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,160
Warning, the following podcast contains three stereotypical men with high automotive IQs

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,320
talking about engines that go vroom vroom, horns that go beep beep, and bumpers that are

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,840
also mouths that say ka-chow.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,040
All this plus examining what's under the hood of Epcot's first thrill ride.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,040
It's Test Track on today's podcast, The Ride.

8
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,120
Hi everybody, welcome to the Test Track episode.

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
My name is Scott McKim.

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,040
I'm up here in the podcast, The Ride Center.

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,920
In just a couple of minutes, you're going to be out there in that podcast, but let's

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,280
first put together the episode schedule.

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,360
Okay, we're going to start you off on an accelerated riff climb.

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,000
This is designed to test the integrity of the comedians.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's put up a few co-hosts.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
How about Mike and Jason?

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,880
Hello, Mike is here.

18
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,440
This is me.

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,880
Checking in, setting up the podcast safety cones.

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,880
Fantastic.

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,040
We're going to weave in and out those riffs with facts and non-sequiturs and long tangents

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,920
that really have nothing to do with the attraction today.

23
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,320
That's right, and we're going to weave in and out first, not using the anti-lock brakes,

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,160
and then we'll do it again just to show how they work.

25
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,880
Now if this whole routine feels a bit indulgent, you're absolutely right, but that's what a

26
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,880
podcast is all about.

27
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,720
Hey, I'll see you out there in that topic.

28
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
Yeah.

29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,440
I should, you know what, in retrospect during the bit I should have said, and we're going

30
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,320
to be experiencing some tangents about the bad boys of Boston.

31
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,920
I'm of course talking about Aerosmith.

32
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,920
But I didn't.

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
No, you were right the first time.

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,400
I'll edit it in after the fact.

35
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
Oh no, it's what it is.

36
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
So it seems seamless.

37
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,920
To edit out the one you just said.

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
All right, fine.

39
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,480
Hey guys, it's Test Track.

40
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:08,720
What I just did is from, that was kind of an appropriated excerpt from Test Track 1.0.

41
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,400
Which I think I know more about, I would say.

42
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:20,360
Part of doing this episode, like doing Test Track now, I knew I was going to Epcot specifically

43
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,520
in a few weeks, and like, oh maybe that's a fun one, and I wondered if I would go because

44
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,560
I haven't gotten to see 2.0, the Tronified remake of Test Track.

45
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,120
I haven't, I didn't get to do it.

46
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,400
I was wondering if I would, I remain just intrigued, and you guys are going to have

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,040
to fill me in on that.

48
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,040
Yeah, so real quick, I mean, Test Track, we'll go off to a hot start here.

49
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,440
Test Track, if you don't know what we're talking about, is basically a ride where you are in

50
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,580
the car while they test a car.

51
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,320
That's the gist of it.

52
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
Yes.

53
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:57,000
Notably, Kevin Rafferty, the Imagineer, refers to it in his book as Epcot's first e-ticket

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,560
thrill ride.

55
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
Okay.

56
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
That's accurate.

57
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
That is accurate.

58
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,080
So yeah, so they've done some changes to it over the years.

59
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,840
Now it's neon.

60
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,560
Now it looks like a Cosmic Bowling night, essentially.

61
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,520
It looks like that, Circus Circus, I think is doing, is it Circus Circus doing like a

62
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,720
neon amusement park?

63
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,800
I feel like a lot of times there's gimmicks for places where it just goes, it's neon now.

64
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,400
You can go see it in its neon lights.

65
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
By the way, that works on me.

66
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,720
Oh, I was going to say, that works on me too.

67
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
Always.

68
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,080
Golf, whatever it is.

69
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
Yes, great.

70
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,080
A glowing blue and green neon, I think, is always in style.

71
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,080
And watching both versions of the test track back to back today to refresh myself, I was

72
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,840
like, oh, that second version is pretty slick and dynamic, even though it's from 20, nearly

73
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,240
10 years ago at this point.

74
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
Yeah.

75
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,080
What I'm calling the new one, yes, is pretty old still at this point.

76
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
Right.

77
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,600
So I'm already getting into my feelings on test track and they're very mixed.

78
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,080
And I apologize if this is controversial.

79
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
I'm sure.

80
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,080
No, no, no.

81
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,080
The neon is not...

82
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,480
There's one of the cars now.

83
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,600
The neon does not do a ton.

84
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,960
It's not such a big deal.

85
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,440
Because I was like, oh, wow, they Tronified it.

86
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,200
Because Tron had come out in the Shanghai Disney and I was like, oh, maybe this is really

87
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,080
going to give this thing some juice.

88
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:22,120
Because at the time I had gone on it before, I was a little let down.

89
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,520
Because when I was a kid, it was like, yeah, this is going to be awesome.

90
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,920
We love that 60 miles per hour, whatever, 45.

91
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
What is it?

92
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,920
It goes up to specifically 64.9 miles an hour at top speed.

93
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,800
I apologize.

94
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,520
But I was like, do I?

95
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,740
This is fine.

96
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,360
This ride is fine now.

97
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,240
And maybe because there's sort of a...

98
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,240
Is there maybe an upkeep issue with it?

99
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,760
Like it maybe has not been the most finely tuned.

100
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,340
I feel like it came out of the gate hot.

101
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,960
And I remember feeling similar in the in the mid 2000s.

102
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,040
Well, yeah.

103
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,120
And let's not forget it.

104
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,760
They were plugging it.

105
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,880
They were promoting it for so long.

106
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,640
And it had so many production issues that it opened much later than it was supposed to.

107
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,400
So I feel like it was coming soon forever.

108
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,360
Because the former attraction in the space, World of Motion, closed in 96.

109
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:20,720
And then this test track, the first version, doesn't open until officially March 1999.

110
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,440
But it did soft opening starting in December 1998.

111
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,920
So like months of soft opening while they fine tuned it.

112
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,600
Pretty long.

113
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,240
Yeah. And it took forever to build.

114
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
I remember a lot of build up, a lot of hype.

115
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,280
Yeah.

116
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,400
I think what I would say is I bet I would have given this like an A plus when I went on it as a kid.

117
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,920
And now it's like C plus.

118
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,440
Huh?

119
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,280
Maybe.

120
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,000
Maybe this is...

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,800
I'm coming in hot.

122
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,640
I apologize.

123
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,200
But I'm a little like, I don't need to go on it again.

124
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,720
Well, that's what, you know, I was weighing that being there recently.

125
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Like is that worth...

126
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,280
You're looking at that line number.

127
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,320
You're really weighing the line number.

128
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,640
I think I was looking at 80.

129
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,920
And I don't know.

130
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,160
Was that worth an 80?

131
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,440
Like corralling the big group.

132
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,040
That's a lot of beer missed if we hit that 80.

133
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,760
Yeah. Yeah.

134
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,440
No, 80 minute.

135
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:14,760
Yeah.

136
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,520
There's no fast pass.

137
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,680
If it's a fast pass, okay.

138
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,160
Yeah.

139
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,520
Knowing that if you're...

140
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:28,680
If you're, you know, a bunch of Californians rolling in, I know that the reaction to that might be it was cool,

141
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,960
but it's not as good as Radiator Springs racers.

142
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,360
Yes.

143
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,840
That's right.

144
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,920
Again, we're jumping all around.

145
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,560
I'm sorry.

146
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,360
It's my fault.

147
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,840
Weave the story of it more.

148
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,160
Yeah.

149
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,480
But isn't that what you might...

150
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,840
And I like, now I don't feel like super negative about it.

151
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,520
No, I don't want to...

152
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,880
I don't want to like, you know, start things on a bummer note, but I think you do view this,

153
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,760
you have to view it at this point as the building block to other tracks.

154
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Yes, I agree.

155
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,680
Which it's a crucial building block.

156
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:05,640
It unlocked a lot of, you know, great technologies and this entire ride mechanism that I think just has been topped by the other things that used it.

157
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:11,920
When we were down altogether in the fall of 2019, I think I was the only one who went off and did it.

158
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,040
And I don't know if we...

159
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:20,560
If you guys had left the park or I was there another day and just hopped on it in the single rider line.

160
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:28,600
You found time between like testing various boats and the wait time on boats and how long a tram took to get to the boat.

161
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,800
Let's see how they apply to urban planning, you know?

162
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,680
And you had different insoles in your shoes and you wanted to see how the different insoles reacted to the different pavements in Epcot.

163
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,080
Yeah.

164
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,320
You just wanted to test those as well.

165
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:47,960
How long does it take to get from the Raclette cheese station to like the French cream puff station at the Boudinouan?

166
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,360
And how do your Achilles tendons feel after you've walked there?

167
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,000
As the current history has shown me, not well.

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That's true. That's a good point. I'm sorry. I didn't want to bring that up.

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,480
But I'm working on it.

170
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,560
So I did go on it and the ride itself, I did like it.

171
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:10,240
It was feeling very rough and I think it recently closed for like a month or so for refurbishment.

172
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:20,560
That said, the first impression after I, of course, designed my Sim car that will ride on the Sim track and we'll get to that rigmarole.

173
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:29,760
They put us in the car, we put our seatbelt on and we moved maybe three feet and then someone slammed the emergency stop button on the console because someone's seatbelt was loose.

174
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,120
And it felt like I had just gotten like clothes lined across the chest.

175
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,360
And it was like, oh my God, this isn't a great first start.

176
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,760
And I've ridden some rickety rides, but I was like, oh, that was a shock to the system.

177
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,320
So you got like you were in a car and it was tested on you.

178
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,400
Like the system worked, honestly.

179
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,480
I got an extra little test.

180
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,800
Worked both practically and storyline wise.

181
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,480
Yeah.

182
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,360
Luckily, luckily you had those seatbelts there.

183
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,320
Imagine if you didn't.

184
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,640
They worked as they should have.

185
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,080
Yeah, that's right.

186
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,760
You would have flown out of the car like the Ralph Wiggum Jif.

187
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,520
The first four feet of the ride and I like splattered across the job, peeling myself off the track.

188
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,000
Now let's try it without the seatbelts.

189
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,560
Moaning, full car of people, children.

190
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,200
Did the person that didn't have their seatbelt on, wouldn't that have thrown them out of the vehicle?

191
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,240
No, it was like in, but it was like, I think a little loose or something.

192
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,520
But we're like, they didn't do they did first checks, but they didn't do double.

193
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,920
You got to tug on the dirty yellow straps.

194
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,880
Yeah, maybe they didn't tug on the dirty yellow straps.

195
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,760
Very important.

196
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:46,080
Yeah, I may be bringing some personal baggage into it too, because the last time that I went on it,

197
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,400
I was like, was I taking a picture?

198
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,000
That must have been what it was.

199
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:58,080
And like we were we just gotten off the ride and then I'm probably either I'm just dilly dallying

200
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,680
or like fixing something that was loose or like, where's my sunglasses?

201
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,280
For some reason, I'm like in the unload area, essentially.

202
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:13,600
And then a car arrives so loud and with such squealing that everybody in the room,

203
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,920
everybody waiting to get on, other people, the employees, everybody like turns to look.

204
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,760
It's like so jarring.

205
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,720
And then in a true nightmare scenario, an employee turns to me and says,

206
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,920
you know why that happened?

207
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,520
Because of you.

208
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,920
You need to keep moving.

209
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,200
You need to walk out of this area.

210
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,840
You're too close to the car.

211
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,200
So it applied the emergency and that you did that.

212
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,680
Wow, that's insane.

213
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,800
That's so shitty.

214
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,840
Wait, how was I to know?

215
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,680
I don't know the ins and outs.

216
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,160
I'm not hosting a theme park podcast yet.

217
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,920
I don't know what sensors trigger what.

218
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,880
Wow.

219
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,800
Yeah, when was that? I don't know.

220
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,720
Probably like 2010 or something pre 2.0.

221
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,200
I may have shared this story on the podcast before, but I built you may have been with me.

222
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,760
You may not have.

223
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,560
It was the opening coincidentally of Radiator Springs Racer.

224
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:11,280
And there was somebody running like kind of the area, the queue area that was screaming at everyone.

225
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,960
They were it was crazy.

226
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,680
I've never seen any employee at Disney like screaming at everyone.

227
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:25,040
And we went to I don't remember if we were like we weren't going to go tell on them when we were telling on them for some like fast pass reason, we were going to go like talk to a different supervisor somewhere.

228
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,720
And we explained what was happening and they were like, oh, yeah, that person's from Florida.

229
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:40,760
It's a different thing over and like they were all like alluding to like people who were at Walt Disney World scream more or they're more intense.

230
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:47,680
Like almost a stereotypical New Yorkian like they'll tell you what they think and they got added.

231
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,280
Uh huh. So I was we were like, whoa, really?

232
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,840
Well, because it was management, right?

233
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,120
It was someone in like like slacks and a dress shirt or.

234
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,600
Well, it was somebody in a definitely in an authoritative position.

235
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,920
Yeah. As far as because it was opening weekend and they must have gotten some reinforcements because it was such a big deal.

236
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,080
And it was yeah, because it was the whole Cars Land opening, the whole land had opened and somebody was really intense.

237
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,000
And then somebody from California who worked there was just like a person from Florida.

238
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,800
Yeah, I wasn't with you during the incident, but I met up with you, I think, right after that.

239
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:25,920
And you just had a stack of make good like however many in your party fast passes.

240
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,560
And that seems right. Yeah. My memory of the whole thing is money.

241
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,920
I just remember a California person selling all of Disney World out.

242
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,720
Oh, now this is a talking point.

243
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:41,200
These are fighting words, I think, because we certainly have listeners who work in the world.

244
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,400
And I'm curious, like, do you think are you all look, are you all yelling at each other?

245
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,960
That's right. I'm wondering. And the guests.

246
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,080
I haven't found that when we go to Disney World.

247
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,360
No, not besides this one incident.

248
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
No. Right. And this was in California.

249
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,320
So it only if you're working on a slot car attraction.

250
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:06,840
Yeah, like you get like you're saying about being a Floridian slot car attraction operator.

251
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:13,920
Yeah. It gets you like almost like being a like a New York taxi cab dispatcher like Louie De Palma.

252
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,560
Yeah, exactly. Taxi.

253
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,600
Yeah, possibly. Would it be funny was the same person who yelled at you?

254
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,240
They yelled at us. It's possible.

255
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,400
Maybe it wasn't that far after.

256
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,520
Yeah. Couple of years later, they had to go out to California.

257
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,880
I don't know. It could be. Who knows?

258
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,040
It was maybe somebody listening like no work for that person.

259
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,360
It's possible. Do you remember a yeller or they still work there?

260
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,680
They still work a test track. Who knows?

261
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,200
Maybe. I think it could be.

262
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,520
I don't know. This feels like the kind of thing where we might get the person.

263
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,440
I guess I don't know exactly what you're talking about.

264
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,840
We also if anybody's listening that worked like opening of Cars Land at Disneyland,

265
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,200
then there was a yeller from Florida.

266
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,440
They probably remember them.

267
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,920
If you were staying at a hotel across the street, you probably remember that person.

268
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,400
They were yelling. Sure.

269
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,880
Yeah. And if you live in California and you know who this is

270
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,640
and you work in the parks division, congratulations on meeting them again

271
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,120
at Lake Nona, your new office. Oh, and you're

272
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,600
you're talking about everybody being forced to move to Florida.

273
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,120
Yeah. The two jobs, they're moving to an office park next to the Orlando Airport

274
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,280
runway. Oh, man.

275
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,440
You know how you love living and working in Southern California,

276
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,920
one of the coolest places in the country, if not the world.

277
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,920
Well, now you live in Florida, which is about to have a Southern

278
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,920
California style housing crisis. So enjoy that.

279
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,520
Wow. Jason, really?

280
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,440
You really I think you may be able to feel much worse about it.

281
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,480
I think they're hanging their heads in shame now.

282
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,720
I mean, I think if I was working in like Burbank,

283
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,680
like living in the San Fernando Valley and everything and like they're like,

284
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,920
you have to go live in Florida if you want to keep your job.

285
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,560
It's like, oh, uh, hmm.

286
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Well, look, believe me, I've in the last couple of months, I still I've been like,

287
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,080
maybe just move to Orlando. I still think that's fine.

288
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,000
Like, yeah, you're saying like, who would ever move from Burbank to Orlando?

289
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,480
I'm like, we got one. Yeah, I would do it.

290
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,680
And you would do it, too. Don't act like you're above that.

291
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,480
I'm upset, by the way.

292
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,080
I feel for people because Disney is forcing them to do it.

293
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,240
Believe me. But as far as moving to Orlando, I don't know.

294
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,200
But they've done this before.

295
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,680
They moved like half the animation division to the back a few years later.

296
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,040
This just goes back and forth.

297
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,920
We're like budgets and like tax breaks and they're like, well, we could save

298
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,320
twenty five million dollars if we move everyone over here and they have to

299
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,960
uproot their whole life. And then. Yeah.

300
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,480
And then a couple of years later, it's like, never mind.

301
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,000
Let's you can work here again.

302
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,200
Yeah. No, this is a rich history of doing this.

303
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,320
Well, and has pointed out to Epic Universe about to open in a few years at Universal.

304
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,040
So like an arms race will probably start in Florida with Disney having to respond

305
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,320
to like a whole new park.

306
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,480
Oh, sure. Yeah.

307
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,560
And that's when maybe when Epic Universe opens is when we decide

308
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,360
to finally move. That's when we actually put the proximity.

309
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,120
I mean, it's just the airfare is going to get expensive.

310
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,560
So why? Yeah, because we have to go there a lot to cover all this stuff

311
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,160
because it's going to be yeah, we're going to have to do

312
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,440
there'll be a city walk saga for whatever that like Esplanade thing is there.

313
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,840
Because that's universe.

314
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,880
That's going to be a new.

315
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,280
By the way, I'm just having this realization for the first time.

316
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,120
That's going to be like their new high end city walk.

317
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,800
Basically, I don't know if it'll be called City Walk, but it's truly

318
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,160
I'm realizing it'll be shops and restaurants, maybe a ride,

319
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,480
maybe other experiences.

320
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,560
And that's going to be like some sort of like ultra high end

321
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,840
fancy city walk that we'll have to like put on a suit and tie

322
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,000
and go and experience all of it.

323
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,520
And then there'll probably be some sort of a wacky adventure.

324
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,000
Well, right, because it's like an Esplanade Main Street

325
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,160
ticketless combo, supposedly. Right.

326
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,040
But I will be called what would be Diamond City Walk or something?

327
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,800
Like, what would you call?

328
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,920
What you call the luxurious version of City Walk?

329
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,880
Not it's not for the common man is what I'm assuming.

330
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,480
The common man.

331
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,000
It's got to be some what they call things like the, you know, the Rick Caruso.

332
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,720
It's got to be called like a splendia or something.

333
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,520
It's like some fake Italian.

334
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,040
But I wish City Walk was the luxury on a satay satay walk.

335
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,800
City, why you just put a couple random.

336
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,080
I mean, also, I think we're going to want to be down there because,

337
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,840
like, according to my search, the Lake Nona region is a trendy

338
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,400
planned community with sleek family homes and leafy gated communities.

339
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,280
Yeah, family focused Nona Adventure Park has a floating obstacle course

340
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,160
and wakeboarding into the south hip boxy park features food

341
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,640
food truck style eateries, live music and volleyball courts.

342
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,120
Jason, what's the problem with Lake Nona?

343
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,400
I think we should all move to all.

344
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,880
Moving to Lake Nona.

345
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,360
What was that leafy? It said it was leafy somewhere.

346
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,800
Leafy gated communities.

347
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,560
We put your drafts.

348
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,600
You get to munch on well, but we could raise some.

349
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,520
Oh, yeah. You could buy a couple like black market

350
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,960
giraffes from Animal Kingdom with my and with.

351
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,440
I think so. Yeah.

352
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,280
And that zoning is different down there.

353
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,480
They're going to want to attract people.

354
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,600
So, yeah, they're going to zone it for giraffes to be running around.

355
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,680
Yeah. So we'll be down there to do the satay walk.

356
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,760
Yeah, we'll see.

357
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,920
We'll see everybody in Lake Nona soon enough.

358
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,400
Yeah, we'll be there.

359
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,080
Jason's glued his computer.

360
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,040
He's looking for something.

361
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,800
All right. What's the downside of Lake Nona?

362
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,280
I'm looking up weed laws in Florida and they're not great.

363
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,080
That's the other thing.

364
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,960
You're moving a bunch of people who design theme park rides to Florida

365
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,960
to like a state with you saying you're saying that you oftentimes

366
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,840
you're going to ride and you're like, what were these Imagineers smoking?

367
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,880
Is that what you're thinking?

368
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,480
Because of the recent, you know, old school Imagineers talking

369
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,120
in the news recently about drinking and smoking while deciding these.

370
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,040
Right. Like Roli in that single one.

371
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,680
Roli Crump, the only one.

372
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,080
Oh, yeah, it was that only one.

373
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,360
None of them, none of the other ones imbibed.

374
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,480
What other articles have been about Imagineers?

375
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,600
No, it is Roli. I just couldn't pull his name off the top of my head.

376
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,160
Yeah, Tony Baxter's never like, and then I got high before I came up with Figment.

377
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,440
Look, Lake Nona is, Lake Nona sounds sick to me.

378
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,000
I think they're going to look the other way.

379
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,480
Maybe Florida's been weird with weed laws before.

380
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,960
Oh, it sounds like a fucking glossy shithole.

381
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,880
Like, it sounds like a fucking nightmare.

382
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,640
This is you're coming in hot and strong and sharp, Jason.

383
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,080
It sounds like it sounds like the bad version at living at the Americana.

384
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,000
Like living on top of a mall.

385
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,840
There could never be a bad version of that, I don't think.

386
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,720
Yeah, the Americana is a magical place.

387
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,240
I was just there today, in fact.

388
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,000
Dreaming of living there.

389
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,360
Well, as I've said many times, Lindsay and I thought about doing it eight years ago.

390
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,120
We thought it would be funny, but then was like a little too expensive.

391
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,360
But you're kind of the look in your face is kind of like there's a lot of like

392
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,640
you're going to be telling that in 30 years.

393
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,880
I thought about doing it 38 years ago.

394
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,960
Yeah, I know.

395
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,960
Thought it was too expensive.

396
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,480
I wasn't willing to invest in my own future and live in a place with a trolley

397
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,280
and above a Tesla indoor store.

398
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,880
The one there's a store where there's just a Tesla sitting inside

399
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,200
of one Tesla and you like go and read about it.

400
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,120
And I guess you tell them, like, I would like one, please.

401
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,080
And they tell you where to go, I guess.

402
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,720
I don't know. I'm not sure what the deal is.

403
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,040
Well, eventually, our code there were.

404
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,320
I think this is probably like the calls for this have died down.

405
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,840
But for like maybe eight or nine years ago was maybe the strong was like

406
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,720
Tesla should do test.

407
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,520
Tesla should do Autopia and boy, do not dodge the bullet.

408
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,800
Very few people want that anymore.

409
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,120
Because that would be I mean, it's funny to pitch on as far as a comedic premise.

410
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,960
Certainly, isn't it?

411
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,680
The car catches on fire.

412
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,400
Elon Musk is waving at you while he's,

413
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,080
I don't know, on Mescaline on Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan,

414
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,720
animatronic with Elon Musk and they're on Mescaline and talking about HGH.

415
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,560
But the car stops and you learn about Dogecoin for a good 25 minutes.

416
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,680
You know, you come out of it like I don't think I know any better

417
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,400
what it is and when this started.

418
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,640
It's it's him.

419
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,280
Recapping Rick and Morty episodes, but he half remembers them.

420
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,840
So there's a lot of stuff that's wrong.

421
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,200
From an old Will and Grace.

422
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,440
I don't know how that got in there.

423
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,600
But no, that didn't that didn't happen, I assume.

424
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,080
Yeah, well, that will not happen now

425
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,160
as far as a revamp of test track.

426
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,200
And I will say test track.

427
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,000
I think what I'm saying is not so wild because of what we're like.

428
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,360
They've tried multiple things to give it a little extra something like they've

429
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,320
they've felt the same kind of lackingness as time is going on,

430
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,800
because it's like, I don't know, put neon lights on it or put a little computer

431
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,160
where you can make like Homer's car from the first season of The Simpsons,

432
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,080
like make a crazy colorful car contraption.

433
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,400
But some people, I think, think that that did it.

434
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,680
I think and they're probably people listening who and I don't know.

435
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,240
I haven't got to do it. But like, probably like I think that opinion is out there.

436
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,440
Like, well, they did add stuff and I like the stuff.

437
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,640
I'm not saying I don't.

438
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,400
It's something.

439
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,280
It's certainly something.

440
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,120
I think I like it better than what was there before.

441
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,320
But I guess all I'm saying is like, I don't think what I'm saying is so wild

442
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,840
because I think the Imagineers felt it too.

443
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,400
It wasn't like, well, this is a perfect thing.

444
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,960
And now we're adding a like is some people thought the Guardians was a useless overlay

445
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,680
because that was a perfectly fine experience before.

446
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,560
But I feel like before you'd be like,

447
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,600
test track does feel like it's got it needs a little something extra now.

448
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,360
Yeah, that's a little more slickness and color.

449
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,240
The overlay and stuff, because you watch watching the first one.

450
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,640
I was like, oh, I like, you know, I always like John Michael Higgins.

451
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,920
I love when he shows up and stuff.

452
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,640
But a lot of this, these set pieces are easily acquired

453
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,840
traffic cones and construction barriers.

454
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,880
And like, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's definitely true.

455
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,160
And even before you do kind of the big launch at the end,

456
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,720
you're passing by like a bunch of toolboxes.

457
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,240
Yeah. And it's and I feel like I'm seeing so negative.

458
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,320
I'm really sorry. I don't want to be so negative.

459
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,200
The first like the first version of it is almost like the driest ride

460
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,040
it can possibly be.

461
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,240
You know what I mean?

462
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,040
It's lacking any sort of whimsy or magic.

463
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,800
And now with the neon, at least it's like it's like it feels a little cooler.

464
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,840
It's yeah.

465
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,560
I watched a clip from some weird special

466
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,920
that had a lot this seemed to be like they follow a group of people

467
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,320
through a bunch of thrill attractions from Disney World.

468
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,800
And then they have like a neurologist

469
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,840
watch the video of the people on the rides.

470
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,120
Now, this guy, this the gentleman in the back is looking a little fearful.

471
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,600
You can tell there's anticipation about.

472
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,080
But right now, I think they're just, you know, hoping to have a good test

473
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,920
track experience. OK, now the adrenaline is ramping up.

474
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,160
This is a bunch of time wasting nonsense.

475
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,720
I don't know what the hell this was.

476
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,760
Neurologist felt like someone they do, like the body language expert

477
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,880
on Fox News where they're. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

478
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,520
People like, what is it?

479
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,520
They're like, yes, I see Barack Obama.

480
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,160
He is he's like clenching his fist, which means that he is lying

481
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,440
about this policy agreement, like agreement.

482
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,840
And then they're like, oh, like Sean Hannity or Bill O'Reilly.

483
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,560
We're like, yes, very good.

484
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,360
Like, thank you for your analysis.

485
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,280
They do that stuff on CNN. They do that stuff.

486
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,440
Oh, yeah, they do. I know.

487
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,120
Bernie's hunched here. Yeah, yeah.

488
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,400
I should just back. You can't trust the back.

489
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,360
That's a pretty of a gun. That's

490
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,440
a fake thing. They do a lot of places.

491
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,640
Let me apologize to Fox News. Yeah.

492
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,920
I want to say I'm so sorry, Fox News.

493
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,360
They're a fine organization.

494
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,520
Yeah, CNN and MSN suck, too. Yeah.

495
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,840
Yeah, that one's to be mad at.

496
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,920
Well, you know, like,

497
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,360
wait, what was I saying with that that special?

498
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,960
Oh, it was like a talking point in this special

499
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,680
that unlike a lot of other attractions, this is not about fantasy.

500
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:54,040
It is it is a real world experience and recreating a place

501
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,040
that does exist. Right.

502
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:01,160
And then with that revamp, they did distinctly take it into the realm of fantasy.

503
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,400
So so hopefully you would, you know, it's still all based in how this company

504
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,200
tests the road, tests their cars. Yeah.

505
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,960
But if you were feeling that real world thing, maybe the fantastical

506
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,760
Tron ish element did it for you in the second. Yeah, it's I mean, it is better.

507
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,680
But but I your feeling of like, it's not worth it.

508
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,800
And my feeling of like if I go down there and it's a fast pass,

509
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,160
I'll go on, but I'm not it's not 80 minutes.

510
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,520
I'll wait 80 minutes for the bad boys of Boston and Rock and Rollercoaster.

511
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,360
I wait eight minutes for Tower of Terror.

512
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,880
You're right. I don't I didn't blink at either of those.

513
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,520
You aren't sure of the reaction you're going to get

514
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,880
like from a group as I was with like, yeah, is this the right

515
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,320
like curation to do here? Yeah.

516
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,200
You're not I don't know.

517
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,680
I don't know what that that reaction.

518
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,360
My dad reminded me a big point about this ride is that the wait line is long.

519
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,280
You really want to risk it because it is prone to breaking down.

520
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,880
Yeah, even the more modern version.

521
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,520
Radar Springs racers, they say is the third generation of this technology.

522
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,080
That breaks down pretty regularly, too, because it's just a lot of moving pieces.

523
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,080
It's very complicated, really complicated mechanism and everything.

524
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,640
Well, let's let's go backwards.

525
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,480
Let's tell the story of this thing a little more and maybe get excited about like

526
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,440
what it could have been, what it promised.

527
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,120
Yes, yes. In 1999.

528
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,560
And what I think it did deliver on when it opened.

529
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,200
Yeah. So this is just a it's a very blatantly General Motors

530
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,720
sponsored attraction that was replacing another

531
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,080
a original Epcot attraction, World of Motion,

532
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,560
which was a slow moving.

533
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,080
Despite being about transportation, it was very slow.

534
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,040
Move. This was the opposite of a thrill ride.

535
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,280
Was it an Omni mover?

536
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,320
Feel like it was an Omni mover or something similar.

537
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,600
You know, little cars that zip around.

538
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,520
I know that it was about the history of transportation.

539
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,800
And we will do an episode about it someday, obviously.

540
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,720
But I just want to throw this out, just as we're saying, the thing that it replaced.

541
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,280
Does anyone do you remember like a scene of World of Motion?

542
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,400
Yes. No, no, not at all.

543
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,680
No. Jason. Iconic.

544
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,360
An iconic scene. What's that?

545
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,200
The horse, the like overturned cart.

546
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,760
And there's a horse and a car.

547
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,840
OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.

548
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,600
The old old for chaos, the old form of transit meets the new form of transit.

549
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,080
Sort of. Yeah, yeah.

550
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,800
That's I remember that.

551
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,160
That's the one that's in my head.

552
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,800
And I don't think I remember any others.

553
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,000
I don't remember that from.

554
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,120
I remember that from seeing a picture of it in the last so many years.

555
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,560
I don't actually have a memory of it from being a kid going on.

556
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,760
The pictures used a lot in stuff or like a clip of going by that section is used a lot.

557
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,880
So that makes sense.

558
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,200
That's how it was represented.

559
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,600
Kind of. I only know from watching some test track materials

560
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,840
that the what now is the like where you launch,

561
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,000
like where they send you out of the building when it was all enclosed.

562
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,960
That's the exact spot where there was a scene where like a bunch of,

563
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,920
you know, well-meaning kooks in the year

564
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,960
200 B.C. are all trying or probably further than that

565
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,360
are all like trying to figure out the wheel.

566
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,000
Do you remember that? There's like a scene where like,

567
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,480
oh, somebody's got a triangle, you knucklehead.

568
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,440
That's never going to end.

569
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,400
There may be one as the wheel.

570
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,560
Like, well, we'll see.

571
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,280
We'll test all the options and we'll like I.

572
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,640
Once I saw that, I kind of remembered.

573
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,560
But again, as we said, as I've said, like a lot of these up cut dark ride scenes do

574
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,320
blend together. They're all concept, big concept album, as we've said before.

575
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,640
But this was I think people liked this.

576
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,520
I remember liking that attraction a ton.

577
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,680
But it was they were General Motors.

578
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,120
Sponsorship was winding down, I believe.

579
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,160
And they had a poor year like things were.

580
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,560
What year would this have been?

581
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,880
Like sometime in the mid 90s, they had a really terrible year.

582
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,560
There were some economic downturns, some hiccups.

583
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,240
So they were weighing.

584
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,600
Should we spend money on a sponsorship?

585
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,160
Yes. And I think around this time.

586
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,680
So Disney's weighing, well, yeah, what do we do here?

587
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,040
And I saw it somewhere that they may have floated.

588
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:11,680
Well, look, if you come back, we want you to pay for something new.

589
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,160
It's got to be something new.

590
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,240
And if you don't do it, somebody else will probably.

591
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,440
We're going to get another we're going to get one of your competitors to do it.

592
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,880
So maybe think about doing it.

593
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,240
So it's a little bit of like a little bit of a threat in a way.

594
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,480
Being dangled by Disney.

595
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,680
And they took it seriously and they did consider it for a year.

596
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,400
And then they and in that year, they had a better year.

597
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,800
So it was more and congratulations to General Motors.

598
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,600
I mean, a good year.

599
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,120
Did anyone else do what I did and look at like, OK,

600
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,080
so General Motors was the first sponsor.

601
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,560
Oh, Chevron took over the sponsorship.

602
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,760
And then I like double clicked on the Chevron website.

603
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,520
And I was like, oh, a division of General Motors. Yes, of course.

604
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,640
Are you mean Chevrolet or Chevrolet?

605
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,840
Sorry, Chevron. I always do this.

606
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,960
So, yeah, that makes sense.

607
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,480
And it's the same story.

608
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,480
Yes. Yeah, I don't know what brands go with what I think.

609
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,480
I'm not a car. Is anybody remote?

610
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,960
Who's the biggest car guy of the three?

611
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,840
What a question is there?

612
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,080
Because I don't know what parts are.

613
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,640
I would fail a car parts test.

614
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,480
I don't even know the names of the cars that the Transformers are.

615
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,280
I don't even know that.

616
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,880
So that would I was trying to think of like the closest thing.

617
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,280
I know like the Ninja Turtle vehicles I had as a kid.

618
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,640
I know the toilet taxi.

619
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,960
I know the I don't know.

620
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,400
I don't know who made Donatello made that one.

621
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,400
The party wagon, the turtle van.

622
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,800
I don't know which car company made that, but I know Donatello made the party wagon.

623
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,320
So I know which turtle made vehicles, but I don't necessarily know.

624
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,160
Maybe actually by these low standards, maybe you're the biggest car guy.

625
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,120
I think maybe. Yes.

626
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,680
I know the Batmobile.

627
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,280
I don't know which company made them, but I know Batman and Alfred made them.

628
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,400
So I know the makers of that.

629
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,160
Great. Jason, any competition?

630
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,160
Nope. Yeah, no, I don't know.

631
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,600
Or care. And sorry if you're, you know, if you're expecting a real top gear kind of episode.

632
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,440
I guess Lucius Fox helped make a lot of that stuff, too.

633
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,560
Especially, I mean, in certain certain comic stories.

634
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,400
And then, of course, the Nolan movies and Batman's handyman Harold.

635
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,400
Do you remember him from the 80s and 90s?

636
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,640
Yes, vaguely.

637
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,440
He would kind of I think he lived in the Batcave and did maintenance.

638
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,320
How did he know who Batman was?

639
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,120
I forget. I forget his whole story.

640
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,840
I don't think really, really represented too much outside the car.

641
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,680
A lot of stories were just Alfred would be like have like grease on his face with a wrench

642
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,960
and he would be doing stuff.

643
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,560
But then they figured out a different guy.

644
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,400
They should really.

645
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,200
You know, I bring Harold back in the movies.

646
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,960
Enough car talk, guys.

647
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,560
You're such car nuts. I can't even keep up.

648
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,960
Yeah, Mike.

649
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,320
When I walked into the dealership and I was like, well,

650
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,800
so what's the base level Honda Civic, please?

651
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,920
Oh, my God, I loved when I got my last car.

652
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,560
I actually now like negotiating.

653
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,280
Oh, I did like negotiating.

654
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,040
I did bad, though.

655
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,040
I could have gotten like another couple of thousand down, I think.

656
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,920
I could be I'm really next time I get a car.

657
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,680
I'm going to be so good at negotiating.

658
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,000
I left the table, too.

659
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,200
I did a whole power move and then they brought in a second guy.

660
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,880
Geez. I did the thing where I like made an offer.

661
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,920
He said no.

662
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,360
He came up with another offer.

663
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,480
I said, let me go think about it.

664
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,920
I got it from the table, walked away.

665
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,600
I came back. There's a different guy.

666
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,720
They brought in like the heavy hitter negotiator.

667
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,160
I left for a week and came back.

668
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,200
Well, that's good, too. I like that.

669
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,000
But then I said I want I said I made like a power move

670
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,680
because he goes, we're not getting any lower than this.

671
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,320
This number you want no lower.

672
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,120
And I go, well, knock 2000 off that and I'm in.

673
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,720
And he was like, are you sure we shake on it?

674
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,600
I go, OK, you just said it was no lower.

675
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,520
And then he he went and got it done.

676
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,920
But then I was like, I could have hold out more.

677
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,720
I was mad at myself because I could have done more.

678
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,440
I have a question about the Jason leaving for a week.

679
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,000
Was that you hearing the base price, not liking the base price,

680
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,320
returning a week later and accepting the base price?

681
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,680
No, no. In fact, in that week, I found I think Mike sent me this triple

682
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:23,000
a tool and it did knock like a couple of thousand off.

683
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,640
And they they tried to pull a fast one on me.

684
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,480
They're like, oh, that one that one credit.

685
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,400
That's not a rebate for you.

686
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,880
That's a rebate for us.

687
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,480
The dealership you don't get.

688
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,160
And I was like, get the hell out of here.

689
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,960
What do you mean? Why would it show me your rebate?

690
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,520
Like, come on, man.

691
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,720
I came in with a coupon for you.

692
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,320
Yeah. He went into another room.

693
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,160
It came out. It went, OK, we will give you that.

694
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,040
I went and was scolded about that maneuver.

695
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,440
Yeah, I love it.

696
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,440
OK, so General Motors does agree to re up.

697
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,520
We want to do something more exciting.

698
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:07,240
Everybody agrees that a more thrilling attraction might be the way to go.

699
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,960
They're not being these in Epcot necessarily, as Jason said.

700
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:19,000
So they go back in time to something that was proposed in the 70s.

701
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,600
Like the world, the motion pavilion was supposed to be this sprawling dark ride,

702
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,840
but then also this bigger attraction that simulates the tests

703
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,760
that a car goes through.

704
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:37,520
And this was based on an Imagineer trip to the Milford Proving Ground.

705
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,600
Great. I got it right before I saw it in the notes.

706
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,520
Milford, Milford. Yeah.

707
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,600
Proving that's then that's what we're all we're all.

708
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,400
If you're listening to this episode, you're excited about the Milford Proving Ground.

709
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,360
This is where GM tests their cars.

710
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,200
This is where now is in Michigan.

711
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,240
It's in Michigan. Yeah, I believe the

712
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,240
one of the GM guys. Yeah.

713
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,640
You can see this from space like it's such a big facility,

714
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,480
facility and patch of black asphalt.

715
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:14,160
Yeah, I got curious about because I'm looking it up on a map like that is pretty big.

716
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,560
I wonder if that's like bigger than the theme parks.

717
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:23,200
It's bigger than you could fit all four of the Disney World parks

718
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,000
and the water parks into the Milford Proving Ground.

719
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,720
Wow. Still have plenty of room.

720
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,360
Epcot is 300 acres.

721
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:38,200
Milford Proving Ground is 4000 acres in miles and miles of track.

722
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,080
And that's just for speed stuff.

723
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,520
There's also the I also looked in the Kevin Rafferty book.

724
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,920
The Black Lake is a part of it.

725
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,320
Like the most sinister sounding like.

726
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,960
Yeah, but then it turns out pretty it does turn out pretty cool in that book.

727
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,760
Like he gets to do some crazy stunt driving and stuff.

728
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,720
Yeah, this is like a place to, you know, whip your car around.

729
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,920
It's stuff seems like seems like a lot of fun.

730
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,800
But that's as big as 59 football fields put together. Wow.

731
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,200
That's massive.

732
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,480
And you and in the queue, people might remember you see the overhead views

733
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,720
of this place and yeah, it's pretty it's pretty jaw dropping. Yeah.

734
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,600
And this is on top of like the global headquarters of GM.

735
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,320
I believe is a series of skyscrapers in downtown Detroit.

736
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,880
Like it's like a ton of yeah, it's like a ton of interconnected things,

737
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,680
including maybe oh, God, I'm going to get this wrong.

738
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,120
I think it's a Marriott that is the largest like hotel

739
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,240
in the world that is specifically just a hotel.

740
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,800
Like it's some insane like factoid.

741
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,320
Wow. Wow. So they own Michigan, a massive facility.

742
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,920
The Imaginers took a trip to this place in the 70s

743
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,880
and thought it would be a good basis for a ride because it is rides like you're

744
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,920
testing cars out and you are running through these tests

745
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,720
that are what ended up in the in test track.

746
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,120
You know, it's it's high speed stuff, but then checking brakes

747
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,880
and that's thrilling and you're whipping around and you're checking heat

748
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,600
and you're checking cold and bumps and all of that stuff.

749
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,120
So it's a pretty like the keen observation from then.

750
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,400
That's a that's a pretty interesting holdover idea.

751
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:25,880
They isolated it correctly and then it's years for everything to catch up to it.

752
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,280
Yeah. And it makes sense.

753
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,720
I mean, there's obvious like I totally like I could see where you go.

754
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,000
This is a cool idea because, yeah, as you're saying, it's all rides.

755
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,160
It's all just like, well, let's see what happens if you just crank it up to 60

756
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,080
and hit the brakes really hard.

757
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,640
That is as long as you don't crash.

758
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,920
That's a fun, crazy thing to do.

759
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,800
I mean, they tell stories in the Kevin Rafferty

760
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,280
tells stories of going up to, you know, it's like 120, 130.

761
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,360
Like, yeah, yeah. Super cranking.

762
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,240
Well, I did. I now I'm thinking about it.

763
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,120
I am the car guy because I went to a bachelor party and race cars around a track.

764
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,800
Yeah, yeah, you did this.

765
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,320
I did that once and we were up to like you go to like 100 miles an hour.

766
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,880
And it's it's and that's you in control, too.

767
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,400
That's me. Well, maybe I told them real quick that they give you a couple.

768
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,760
They they have somebody drive you on the track before you do the track.

769
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,280
And that person is driving like a little tiny.

770
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,000
It's not an SUV, but it's a bigger like Jeep ish car.

771
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,160
And that person gets up to 120 miles an hour.

772
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,600
And their job is to completely panic you because you're in the backseat

773
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,960
and you've never gone that fast in your life.

774
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,280
And everyone in the car felt like they were going to like we all look at each

775
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,160
other like we're going to die. We're about to die.

776
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,840
Your body is not ready to feel that. Yeah.

777
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,360
And that's like 100.

778
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,440
I think it was 120 maybe in the car.

779
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,800
And then I don't think I ever hit that because I was my body is still like

780
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,800
you shouldn't be going this fast in a car.

781
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,920
Sure. When I'm driving and you shifting gears to or was it on?

782
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,880
No, they have a guy there with you.

783
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,400
Oh, OK. They have a guy next to you.

784
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,280
Thank God that does some of that for you while you're doing it.

785
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,920
Basically, you're just your goal is to.

786
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,120
And I remember how you like accelerate into a turn

787
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,200
and then like turn the wheel hard to try to make the little turn like.

788
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,520
And then the guy will signal to people because you're on the track with other

789
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,560
racers, which is the craziest thing.

790
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,000
I thought we were going to be alone.

791
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,040
But you have to literally like wait for a break.

792
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,440
And then the guy goes, all right, go.

793
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,440
And he just shouts at you and tells you what to do basically the whole time.

794
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,040
Because all you have to keep telling yourself when you're racing like this is

795
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,920
I don't know what I'm doing and I'm terrified.

796
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,960
They have to have people like this all day. Right.

797
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,960
That like this can't be I can't be the worst driver here.

798
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,120
They must have people.

799
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,400
So you go around the track like five or six times and then they show you.

800
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,480
And I have a video somewhere of like how fast you go.

801
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,000
And yeah, they let you do 100, 110, like if you want.

802
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,080
Like the guy was yelling me faster, he was just a guy yelling at you faster

803
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,160
while you're going 100 miles an hour,

804
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,120
while there are other cars going 100 miles an hour on the track as well.

805
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,280
A bunch of people who have never done this before.

806
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,760
Yeah, a track full of for everybody, a track full of people who.

807
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,920
Yeah, have never done this before.

808
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,360
So what's that facility that's in Vegas?

809
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,840
It's not in Vegas. It's sort of in the desert.

810
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,440
And I don't want the name of the facility.

811
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,040
But I do. I will say you.

812
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,520
Your adrenaline has never been that high.

813
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,040
You get out of it feeling like primal.

814
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,120
You get out of it feeling like and not in a bad way.

815
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,960
Like I was like, I could do this again.

816
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,560
Like you use a train as a whole transformation that happens when you're in there

817
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,560
because your body just shifts into this different mode.

818
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:42,160
Where it's so heightened that like you have this extra sensory like experience.

819
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,320
Because if because if you didn't, you would crash the car and it would blow up.

820
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,960
Your body is no option but to go into like,

821
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,240
oh, I'm being attacked by saber tooth tigers,

822
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,680
which I don't think it lasted were around when humans were.

823
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,480
But if they were, your body is like in some bizarre primal experience

824
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,960
where it's like, I need to kill to survive.

825
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,520
It's like punching seven saber tooth tigers. Yeah.

826
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,280
Making a big pile of them.

827
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,440
Standing on top of it.

828
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,200
Yeah, that's all I felt after going on a trek five times.

829
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,080
By the way, three of us should go do this sometime.

830
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:22,720
I think I I drove to Vegas recently and I think I saw that speedway when I drove by.

831
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,560
Also, that drive between Los Angeles and Las Vegas,

832
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,560
the speed limit for most of the way is 70 miles an hour.

833
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:33,000
Sure. And you're often like there's no one else around for long stretching.

834
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,680
It's so easy to.

835
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,920
Oh, yeah, you go 110.

836
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,480
I'm not 7580.

837
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,640
And that's already like a little nerve wracking.

838
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,240
I keep distracted from the topic real quick, though, like when you started

839
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,360
to drive, when both of you started to drive, I'll explain what my experience was.

840
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,760
I was I did not get my license right when I started when I was 16.

841
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,760
It took me a little more like after maybe closer to 17.

842
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,640
And I would get made fun of by my friends for how slow I drove.

843
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,040
Same. Yeah. Oh, 100 percent.

844
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,680
Same, same.

845
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,040
I would get mocked.

846
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,000
And then, of course, my one friend who would mock me the most

847
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,240
got into a horrible car wreck.

848
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,720
So there we go.

849
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,320
Well, good family car.

850
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,000
Yes, he's I think he's fine.

851
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Yeah. But yes, no, I got ripped, ripped.

852
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,520
If I was driving my friends somewhere because of how slow I would often go.

853
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,200
I remember one friend was like, well, I think the optimal speed

854
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,880
to drive on any road is 45 miles an hour.

855
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,400
And it's like the speed limit in our town on most streets is 30 miles an hour.

856
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,720
A lot of neighborhoods don't have sidewalks.

857
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,360
People are walking on the shoulder between and it's like,

858
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,920
why are you zipping around?

859
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,560
First of all, why are you cramming seven people, seven teenagers

860
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,880
into a five person car?

861
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,480
And then you're flooring it through like fucking Mayberry.

862
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,080
So if you're wondering what Jason's wild teen years were like,

863
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,920
people always wanted to go like, we can all fit, we can all fit.

864
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,800
It's like there's people in this sedan.

865
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,800
Yeah, that happened to me once or twice.

866
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,160
I think that's a common like, oh, yeah, we can just sit on somebody's lap

867
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,000
over there. Yeah.

868
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,400
And it'd be like, and I'd be like, are you sure we can?

869
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,840
Three in the morning.

870
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,560
I know a provisional license.

871
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,520
You were supposed to be off the road four hours ago. The first

872
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,760
the first day since your friend is like having a third parent around.

873
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,600
That's right. I mean, I was close.

874
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,960
I went close. Some of those instances, it was just a bunch of theater dorks.

875
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,320
And they're like, yeah, he's got a point.

876
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,000
We should get home. I.

877
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,480
You know, the first voice of reason, the first car

878
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,840
I ever rode in that was not driven by an adult was like a cooler,

879
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,080
like athlete kid that I knew.

880
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,720
And I was in the backseat and I felt like I was doing something so illegal.

881
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,920
I don't even think I maybe told my parents I was doing it.

882
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,200
But my memory is just sitting in the back.

883
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,440
And he was blasting Bob Dylan's The Hurricane.

884
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,320
I don't know why he was just Bob Dylan's Hurricane blasting

885
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,960
as we're like driving down Schomburg Road too fast.

886
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,400
I knew it was too fast, but it was also like thrilling.

887
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,560
Like I felt alive for the first time in my life.

888
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,160
Well, right. That's a happy song.

889
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,400
It's not a happy song.

890
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,920
It is a it is not a happy song.

891
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,760
But yeah, for whatever reason, that was the song he was playing.

892
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,680
And that is my memory of that.

893
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:17,200
So wild times, wild times from three wild car guys.

894
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,760
Where were we in this in the slow tail of test track test track?

895
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:28,480
So the imagineers of various times got to go and do the drive facility.

896
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,720
Yeah, it's a millford.

897
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,880
They had Milford.

898
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,920
They had the true driving experience at Milford.

899
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,920
And it makes yes, as we were saying, it makes sense that they were like,

900
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,480
yeah, there's a ride. Yeah.

901
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,760
And I think that all went that all went pretty smoothly.

902
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,960
And everybody agreed that's a great attraction.

903
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,880
And it really is. It's very epic.

904
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,760
Cotty and that it is it's like maybe as exciting as an educational attraction

905
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,640
can be. It is teaching you about a place and about the rigorous efforts

906
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,120
that a car company puts into making sure that you're safe

907
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,440
before the car goes on the road.

908
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,160
But then crazy things happen to you, too.

909
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,000
But right. Like I don't think I think to get more exciting than that in Epcot,

910
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,640
you just have to bail on education entirely.

911
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,080
See Guardians. Right.

912
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,360
There has to be no.

913
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,400
I mean, I was trying to think about this, like because obviously we've talked

914
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,040
about some of the drier things in Epcot, but it's like

915
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:29,000
they didn't go with like a car mascot or any sort of they really just

916
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,640
because the other stuff that was like educational would have a little more

917
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,360
whimsy in it.

918
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,920
And it feels like is this the is this of all the Epcot things,

919
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,160
does this have like the least whimsy about it?

920
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,640
Because all those original world of motion, there was still some of the magic.

921
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,200
They're like kind of feeling of like, oh, and look at this.

922
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,080
Isn't this like a special thing?

923
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,360
And this is very dry.

924
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,640
This is very much like.

925
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,280
I might say that the boat ride

926
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,640
where you look at hydroponic plants is the driest.

927
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,320
But there's magic on.

928
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,960
Maybe I'm out of my mind.

929
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,560
I'm not saying it's not dry, but there's a magic on living.

930
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,000
Tentreg is drier than the boat ride.

931
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,360
100 percent. Living with the land has more magic.

932
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,560
Jason, back me up here.

933
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,120
You don't have to agree with me.

934
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,840
I hadn't really ever.

935
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,880
There's some like very much.

936
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,840
There's some dark ride elements of living with the land, and there's some

937
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,840
ambiance and dark.

938
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,120
Like it's like, you know, like the dusty, dusty house.

939
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,520
Two scenes and then.

940
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,000
Well, but that's more than the dryness of test track.

941
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,120
I'm not saying it's the most special.

942
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:34,400
But I would also say that going 65 miles an hour is not dry.

943
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,840
OK, well, I'm saying dry.

944
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,360
Exciting. I'm sorry.

945
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,560
I'm sorry. No living with the land is scripture now.

946
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,640
I mean, it is.

947
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,920
I was a moderate about living with that.

948
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,240
I'm just saying that there's some of that like a little whimsy and specialness.

949
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,160
I'm not saying exciting.

950
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,160
Of course, the 64 miles an hour is not exciting.

951
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,720
Plants that are growing in the air or plants, you know, there's stuff

952
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,880
that you don't see every day.

953
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,560
The fish tanks, you know.

954
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,440
But there's a cozy, there's a Disney, especially old Epcot.

955
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,200
There's a cozy little feeling you get on these rides, and that's missing from test.

956
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,800
That's what I'm saying. I'm not saying exciting.

957
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,000
I'm not even saying better.

958
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,760
I'm just saying test track to me feels like it's the it's the it's the bare bones.

959
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,080
It doesn't have like it doesn't have like especially the first version

960
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,760
doesn't have like a and then there was a car and the car was tested.

961
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,960
Like there's not that little like we're going to tell you a little story now.

962
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,920
It's very much like what you did at the start of the show.

963
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,440
Living Seas is pretty dry, I would say.

964
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,040
Now it's but the early Living Seas was was much more like

965
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,920
I think that's an extremely functional.

966
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,640
I think like it is like it is facts and placards.

967
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,920
And here's how we take care of it.

968
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,120
Well, there used to be the whole fictional like, you know, Seabase Alpha.

969
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,720
They did take away some of that.

970
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,960
But I guess, yeah, I look, I wanted to feel there's a little warmness

971
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,080
in your little in your little belly when you go on and you see all those old Epcot things.

972
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,160
And I just think it's missing from especially that first version of test track.

973
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,520
It's very bare bone. Here you go.

974
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,120
This is how we do it. Here we go.

975
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,680
Isn't this fun? Oh, no. Look at this thing.

976
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,160
Like it's just that's straight ahead. I'm not saying it's even bad.

977
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,440
I'm just saying that test track kind of of its time.

978
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,240
The first version or back me up.

979
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,360
Maybe I'm crazy on this one.

980
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:18,280
But like I feel like the 90s and I think they start in the 80s.

981
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:23,880
But I feel like there was a big trend in both car commercials

982
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:29,120
and car culture and certainly those crash test dummy PSA.

983
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,600
There was a lot of cars being crashed to show they were safe.

984
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,760
And the crash test dummies had PSAs and cartoons and yes, that's true.

985
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,960
And that color, that aesthetic, the orange and yellow and the like

986
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,280
all of that, I feel like is very prevalent in the first version of test track.

987
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,160
And it was also very prevalent on a lot of like advertising and TV.

988
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,920
There was something in the air like this. That's true.

989
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,280
It was a little like the little the circles divided into the four,

990
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,640
the little like, yeah, whatever those yellow and black. Yeah. Yeah.

991
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:06,160
It is bizarre now that you're saying this, because like, why was there a cartoon

992
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:11,400
based on the dummies that would test to make sure cars wouldn't kill people?

993
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,080
It is weird. Yeah, I don't know.

994
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,320
And yeah, and there was that's the back to the future line video.

995
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,080
Also, that's the safety video. Yes. Yes. Crash test.

996
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,080
Yeah. Why was this in the culture?

997
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,640
That's really weird. I think about it. I mean, I remember all that stuff.

998
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,000
I mean, every now and then there's like an advertising thing

999
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,040
that kind of breaks through, like becomes more than the advertising,

1000
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,960
like California raisins or the Geico cavemen.

1001
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,960
Yeah, we were all we were all thinking it. Huh?

1002
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,440
Yeah. I and I kind of like those crash test dummies characters.

1003
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,320
I recall liking all that. Yeah, I do. I like them.

1004
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,880
But I mean, the toys were fun.

1005
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,680
I don't think I had a lot of them, but I would play with them.

1006
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,960
Oh, you had some toys.

1007
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,200
I think I had one or two, but I definitely remember playing with them.

1008
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,080
You get the car, right? Yeah.

1009
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,280
The bit was you just put them in the car and you'd throw it along.

1010
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,800
And then they would pop apart. Like, yeah.

1011
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,600
Man, that is strange that I have not even thought about that.

1012
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,920
And since it happened, I don't think you guys are both scolding the dummies, too.

1013
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,280
Like, if you know, if you go more than 30, this thing's going to crash.

1014
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,240
Yeah. Oh, yeah. You're likely to lose a hand.

1015
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,480
Jason never made him crash, probably.

1016
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,800
He just had them on a nice 25 miles an hour,

1017
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,360
and then they would get to their destination safely.

1018
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:25,880
Well, if I did, I would then like lay like a commemorative

1019
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,200
like who would make a wreath and lay it

1020
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,360
like on the Ottoman that they crashed into.

1021
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,960
There is everywhere in the house. Yeah.

1022
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,600
Make a little family for them.

1023
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,440
A little crash test baby that morning at the funeral.

1024
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,520
Yeah. The baby on board.

1025
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:47,000
I put a baby on board like window hanger and it was a little crash test dummy baby.

1026
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,680
Oh, where? Oh, where?

1027
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,920
I was terrible at drawing.

1028
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,040
Can my baby be our leader of the pack?

1029
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,640
This does bring up a question.

1030
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,880
Why wasn't there more like, hey, I'm Brian, the test dummy.

1031
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,560
Like, good to see you.

1032
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,720
Like, why wasn't why don't we get a little of that?

1033
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:06,200
Yeah, there's one or two jokes in here that are a little like

1034
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,440
almost universal.

1035
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,720
Like you go by the corrosion robots and he goes like, hey,

1036
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,680
do we remember to turn those robots off?

1037
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,480
Like that feels like a little, you know, some of that.

1038
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,920
Yeah, some of that real body.

1039
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,600
It's really that's not a body.

1040
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,480
I'm going to apply to everything.

1041
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,000
But it's the word is done the tip of my tongue at every moment.

1042
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,920
I know this is jumping around.

1043
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,960
However, if you've been if you've never been on test track,

1044
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,560
we have been on Radiator Springs.

1045
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:38,880
It's similar where there's a big thrilling finale, but you go through little rooms

1046
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,600
at first and kind of the equivalent in Radiator Springs racer.

1047
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,960
You know, like you there's the fork in the road and you either get the car

1048
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,160
painted or you get the new tires.

1049
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,200
And that felt very like a very similar beat to what happens in test track,

1050
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,320
where you go through these little smaller rooms and one is extreme heat.

1051
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,520
The car is being tested for extreme heat.

1052
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,240
One is extreme cold.

1053
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,440
And then after there is the corrosion

1054
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,000
center and let me be real here.

1055
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:12,280
I until doing this episode, I had no idea what that is about.

1056
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,360
What's that supposed to be? What is the corrosion?

1057
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,040
What's happening there?

1058
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,360
You mean, what are they simulating testing? Yes.

1059
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,920
Oh, it's coming up because then there's these two robots.

1060
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,760
As Jason said, like, hey, did we remember to turn those robots off

1061
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,360
and they're spraying something at you? What?

1062
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,840
Oh, good question.

1063
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,800
Like what?

1064
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,880
Like caustic stuff that would hit.

1065
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:38,440
So I think like hard water, saltwater,

1066
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,840
you know, stuff that would cause the outside of a car to corrode, to corrode

1067
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,440
or like, I don't know what it's supposed to be.

1068
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:44,880
Definitely.

1069
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,480
Myochemical like whatever would be regularly splashing on a car

1070
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,080
and could cause corrosion.

1071
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,320
I mean, like cars wear a lot different

1072
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,800
in a warmer climate than they do, like on the East Coast.

1073
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,520
You know, all that salt can really eat away at stuff.

1074
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,680
I don't actually know.

1075
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,920
They don't say like, oh, we're spraying them with like

1076
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,120
disinfecting bug spray or something, or we're spraying.

1077
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:06,960
It doesn't say.

1078
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,520
There's not a very clear what it is.

1079
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,720
Poison gas. Like we're spraying them with poison gas.

1080
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,720
And it's yeah. And it's kind of a lute.

1081
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,760
I get I almost missed it as even being a problem.

1082
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,240
You bring it in bringing it up.

1083
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,040
I just kind of like accepted, oh, they're testing it so it doesn't get.

1084
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,200
The metal doesn't get corroded.

1085
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,000
But I never thought about what it is.

1086
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,960
There's because that's also the payoff of the thing in the pre-ride video

1087
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:35,320
where he pulls up the different like, let's try a double up to five and nine.

1088
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,480
And she says nine with a little bit of trepidation.

1089
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,840
He's nine with a slight smile.

1090
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,600
And I like I remember that scaring me when I was in the line.

1091
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,680
Like, what is nine? What is that going to be?

1092
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:52,080
And until thinking about this ride for a while, like in the last couple of days,

1093
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,440
I'm like, what was that?

1094
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,960
What was I supposed to be scared of?

1095
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,240
And nine. And is it that you're getting sprayed at with

1096
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,600
salt water?

1097
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,200
Well, I mean, if they obviously so there's numbers,

1098
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,120
then there's different types of things they're spraying and they never say

1099
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,840
what, yeah.

1100
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,160
Well, I think, too, if you look at what's coming up as as those are pulled up

1101
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:17,440
on a computer, you know, two is cold and five is heat and nine is like the wild card.

1102
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,960
And then what that ends up being is robots spraying a mist at you

1103
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,000
that I'm still confused why it's a problem.

1104
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,880
I think I didn't hone in on that because.

1105
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:32,400
I I clocked the robot spraying the mist and I went,

1106
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,880
oh, that gag is in Radio Springs Racers in the paint.

1107
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,640
And and so is the the Mack truck is also

1108
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,960
reused in Radio Springs Racers in a different way.

1109
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,080
But yeah, but it must be.

1110
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,520
Yeah. What what would it what would be the worst thing you could spray?

1111
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,800
What would it be the worst thing they're spraying at people

1112
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,280
like on a test track, an actual in Milford?

1113
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,240
What are they spraying on these cars?

1114
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,400
Like it would be some like chemical warfare.

1115
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,000
Oh, acid rain.

1116
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,720
Yeah, acid rain. That's not bad.

1117
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,120
Test is something. Yeah.

1118
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,200
I think you got to be a little more clear about it.

1119
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,520
Yeah. Doesn't that help you?

1120
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,440
Because then, yeah, then it gave a little extra danger.

1121
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,280
Obviously, there's misting you with water and you're smelling one of their,

1122
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,720
you know, smell canisters.

1123
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:16,320
Or if it's like ahead of you and then wait, stop the acid rain test right now.

1124
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,440
And then it parts and then you go through.

1125
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,680
Stop the biological warfare gas.

1126
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,600
Like, yeah, then then you're more like scared.

1127
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,800
The car germs, the car germs from attacking the car.

1128
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,120
Stop them like nanobytes particles

1129
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,680
that are supposed to infect people's brains or something.

1130
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:35,680
I don't know. Yeah.

1131
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:40,480
A little more of a threat and a little more clarity, I think.

1132
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,400
I agree.

1133
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:48,120
Um, I I'm so lost in terms of where we where we are with the story.

1134
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:54,920
Um, I mean, like we land on they land on this attraction idea.

1135
00:55:54,920 --> 00:56:00,200
I liked the story in the Kevin Rafferty book about how they always called it test

1136
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:05,720
track. And then GM was like, ah, we have a process for this.

1137
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,760
And they flew a bunch of geniuses, quote unquote, to a fancy

1138
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,280
L.A. hotel conference room, all to like throw out names the way they do on cars.

1139
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:22,120
And some like like some woman who he compared to like Devil Wears Prada is like,

1140
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,800
all right, I want animals that invoke speed.

1141
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,840
And people are yelling, Gazelle. Yes.

1142
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:31,280
Good, Gazelle. And they're building a list of like a hundred thousand words.

1143
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,400
And it's all and Kevin and it's all people in like slick suits.

1144
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,520
And then it's like dopey imagineer, Kevin Rafferty and Hawaiian shirt

1145
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:42,600
listening to all this and like, I don't know, I've named a lot of things

1146
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,880
in this in these parks.

1147
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,640
I think probably just want to call it test track.

1148
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,840
And then I don't he doesn't even really follow up on what happened because it is

1149
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,440
called test track. Yeah, they had an extremely clear name.

1150
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,720
That's just a funny window into like corporate overthink.

1151
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,080
Yeah, I yeah, that was that was really great.

1152
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:04,680
And the the the comparison he makes is when they're like, hey, we need a name

1153
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,920
for a lunch shack at Blizzard Beach.

1154
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,120
And it goes avalanche. And they're like, great.

1155
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,840
Thank you. You can't even get up from his chair.

1156
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,040
You didn't break his man out of turned around.

1157
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,920
That rules. Have a lunch.

1158
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,840
Yeah. Sometimes you just go by your gut.

1159
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:23,320
But like, yeah, I like all these slick like mad men guys in suits,

1160
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,040
like screaming about Jaguar Cheetah.

1161
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,400
Well, did he? Yeah. Did he have like was going to be like Cheetah Racers?

1162
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,000
Like, what do they think?

1163
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,600
Like he has a joke about about like what word soup it was possibly going to be.

1164
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:40,680
Yeah. But yeah, I mean, and also you you do just, you know,

1165
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,960
you have to sort of explain what the attraction is with these titles.

1166
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,400
And be clear.

1167
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,680
So, yeah, they start building this thing.

1168
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:56,880
World of Motion is evicted officially early 97.

1169
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,960
I think they start building it.

1170
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,200
I think I forgot that it's the same building.

1171
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,880
It's a pretty cavernous building where the dark ride was.

1172
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,960
And they just got it and used it in that industrial warehouse

1173
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,880
kind of where it's a it's a huge open space.

1174
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:15,120
Now there's space to do a climb and go, you know, up three stories to start the thing.

1175
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:20,840
And I guess that's where you start getting into, like, well,

1176
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,680
well, the ride vehicle itself, because this is, as we've said, kind of the big

1177
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,680
headline. What came out of Test Track is this great ride mechanism

1178
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,200
that became Radiator Springs, among other things.

1179
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:38,400
I think also interesting in the Rafferty book is when he explains

1180
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:43,440
their like they brought GM people out to the Indiana Jones adventure.

1181
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,080
You got to check this out.

1182
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,000
Look, we're able to do with a vehicle at this point.

1183
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,760
They said that's great.

1184
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,120
However, is there a way to make it make it a little more practical

1185
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,440
and like have it actually be more of a real car?

1186
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,760
And that's sort of like they clearly cracked something really interesting

1187
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,160
with electric vehicles simulating a lot with Indy.

1188
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,440
But with this, they wanted it to be real in terms of surfaces,

1189
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,320
that it is real tires and they are going over bumps

1190
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,160
and that things really are happening to you as opposed to Indy,

1191
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,240
where it's entirely simulated for the most part. Right.

1192
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:20,880
Yeah, it's crazy because the Indiana Jones feels so real

1193
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,560
when you're on it. But really, if you really are conscious,

1194
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,440
conscious while you're like on that ride, you're like, oh, yeah,

1195
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,720
this actually feels like we're bouncing.

1196
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,080
Yeah. Going over a bridge is not real at all.

1197
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:35,640
That's entirely something that like a Star Tours type vehicle could do.

1198
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,440
In theory, right as well.

1199
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,320
But when you go on a bunch of,

1200
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:45,760
you know, stones or bricks on a ride like this, you really are.

1201
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,160
Yeah, you feel that like bump. Yeah.

1202
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,440
And you know, that's what the what a bump actually feels like.

1203
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:56,120
Do you guys have a grasp of on how these work?

1204
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,960
Exactly. We've established the level of car people that we are.

1205
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:02,120
So we might be flailing here.

1206
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,440
But like the fact that they call it a slot car and it's like those toys,

1207
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,880
they're like real cars and real tires.

1208
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,640
But it's electricity powered.

1209
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:18,120
So that that the imaginary springs or this like that big open part

1210
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:23,040
of the track in the middle, that is feeding electricity and signals

1211
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,400
into the car.

1212
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,600
Is there like a stick almost attached to the car?

1213
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,200
I think about. Yeah.

1214
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:34,240
You mean like similar to like the ultimate extension of a bumper car

1215
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:38,600
where it has it has the stick on top and it's getting the electric sparks

1216
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,000
from the roof.

1217
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,240
Is it like the opposite version of that?

1218
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,000
That's what our is coming from below.

1219
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,080
That's the way I understand it.

1220
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,480
But now that you're saying it, I'm like in some stupid if that's wrong.

1221
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:52,120
I think it because the Spider-Man vehicles, like there's a

1222
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:55,200
there's a thingy underneath isn't there.

1223
01:00:55,200 --> 01:01:00,160
And that that's how they, you know, move it in multiple directions.

1224
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,120
Yes. Is it not on a track?

1225
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,240
Spider-Man, you're talking about? Yeah.

1226
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,800
Well, it's got to be a track of track.

1227
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,840
Yeah, it has to be a track.

1228
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,160
But that's my understanding was like a slot because the slot car,

1229
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:15,000
if you've not done that, it's like a old I guess kids are still doing it,

1230
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,280
but it's an old school kind of toy where it was like the car is not

1231
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,960
the car doesn't have a motor itself, but the car is on a thing

1232
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:25,520
that's connected to basically like the track as what we're saying is like

1233
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,240
just like a line, what would you call?

1234
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,320
I don't know. Not like a line.

1235
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:32,040
There's a space for

1236
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,280
something to I can't look at it.

1237
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,200
I'm like a fucking idiot. We're screwed here.

1238
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:39,000
Well, and this is I know I can picture in my mind's eye

1239
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:44,640
the production and creation of this ride, like the tires kept like going haywire.

1240
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,920
And their tires wouldn't make it through a day.

1241
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,920
They'd blow tires every day.

1242
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:53,080
And like for optimal, like X number of riders per hour,

1243
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,760
it's like we need 20 plus cars running at any time.

1244
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,000
And the ride is tapping out in the single digits.

1245
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,720
They had to totally redo the software.

1246
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:05,800
Yes, they were using an outside group for the software that powered all these cars.

1247
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,560
There are like three on board computers on all of them.

1248
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,760
And they had to scrap it and just make something from scratch.

1249
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:15,560
I think it was around the time that they were putting in sort of a similar

1250
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,480
experimental.

1251
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,080
We've never done this kind of thing before.

1252
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:23,840
The rocket rods, one of the biggest ride disasters ever at Disneyland.

1253
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,080
And that was flailing in the entire production of it.

1254
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:30,000
It opened and it just truly did not work.

1255
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,160
Like there's I think a very short history of attractions that did not work at all.

1256
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,240
Right. They never made came out fixed it.

1257
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,480
Really? Yeah. It just sort of destroyed the track.

1258
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:43,800
Just like really it sputtered for a few years and then they bailed on the whole thing.

1259
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,520
And that was that.

1260
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,520
So they did not like this cannot happen.

1261
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:53,040
Like they're watching the worst case scenario play out in reality, in an open park,

1262
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,760
in Disneyland. This cannot happen.

1263
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,280
So they keep kicking it down the grid.

1264
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,920
There's a big mural that they put up outside of the facility that says

1265
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:04,680
coming 98 and then they bail on it and just says coming soon.

1266
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,360
They're not committing to a time.

1267
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:09,040
And that's what I think I went to Disney World in this era.

1268
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:13,080
I don't know if you guys did, too, where you go and admire that building

1269
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,480
and the scope of it. And boy, that looks exciting.

1270
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:18,200
But is this ever going to open? Right. Exactly.

1271
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,400
I just thought here's a better way to say what a slot car is.

1272
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,160
There's a mechanism under the track that the car connects into.

1273
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,840
And the mechanism under the track is the thing that's propelling the car,

1274
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,920
not internally in the little car. Wow. I sound so much smarter now.

1275
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:29,960
Yeah, that's good.

1276
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,360
Yeah. Before I sounded like I was about to have like a stroke and pass out.

1277
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:34,680
My brain was working.

1278
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:35,760
All of us were saying thing.

1279
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,240
My brain was working so hard and it sounded dumb.

1280
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,800
It's it's not it's not not our area of.

1281
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:45,200
Certainly not. Again, I know how Donatello made the turtle blimp.

1282
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:48,960
But it's an interesting like it's an interesting ride mechanism.

1283
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,280
And the combination of it is a real car.

1284
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:55,440
There are things that it can do and they have to be tuned up like a real car.

1285
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,440
I think one of those Disney plus behind the scenes at the parks kind of feature

1286
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:04,200
it's is about the garage at Radiator Springs and how complicated that is.

1287
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,680
And that's like every bit as complicated as Alfred with the

1288
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,560
with all the oil on his face and Harold.

1289
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,800
Harold Harold Allnut.

1290
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,320
Was that his name? Yes. Harold Allnut.

1291
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,200
Yes, he he was.

1292
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,560
I think he was a henchman that Batman rescued.

1293
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,960
Oh, he's like he sort of rehabbed him.

1294
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,440
Yeah. Wow. That's nice of Batman.

1295
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,880
He usually just beats his shit out of guys and throws him in jail.

1296
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,720
This guy, he liked one case.

1297
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,200
It's like, yeah, that's nice.

1298
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,600
He does rehab and one out of 100 or 100,000 maybe.

1299
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,400
Yeah, interesting.

1300
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,040
Yeah. So it's just really prickly.

1301
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,000
This this thing gets delayed forever.

1302
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,400
I didn't realize that there was a preview center outside of it.

1303
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,160
They pulled a bunch of cars up.

1304
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,840
They were playing videos.

1305
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:54,480
One thing I like about all this, I think you feel the late 90s

1306
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:59,160
of that original test track, and I can't tell if I like it or I don't like it.

1307
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:02,080
Let me play an ad that they they put out.

1308
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,440
I don't know if this was a television ad,

1309
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,320
but this is this is certainly the vibe.

1310
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:12,760
And you can tell that, you know, maybe they know that Universal's

1311
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,760
getting a little more extreme down the road.

1312
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,400
The soon they're going to have Hulk open and Dr.

1313
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,360
Doom and all that stuff.

1314
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:23,000
And we got to start saying, well, we got thrills at Disney World 2.

1315
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,480
So you end up with this ad here.

1316
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,920
Compared to other activities, riding test track leads to a decidedly prominent

1317
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:34,040
increase in endorphin manufacture in the basal ganglia.

1318
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:39,200
In other words, test track rocks.

1319
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,680
Brace yourself. I mean,

1320
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:45,640
that's the 90s and then the most like

1321
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:46,880
test track.

1322
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:51,080
Yeah, that cute sort of like poor man's ravey,

1323
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:56,000
the kind of font where there's one font, but then a ghostly version of the same

1324
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,960
word shoots through into the back, like haunting the word.

1325
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,440
Test track rocks.

1326
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,360
That is not that is not a dopey up cut science.

1327
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,200
No, that's like a tone of that ride either.

1328
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,840
No, ultimately not. No, there's nothing in it.

1329
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,960
Yes, that was rock and roller coaster, which is another car.

1330
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,960
It is a car vehicle. That fine. OK. Yeah.

1331
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:20,480
That's a that's a very in your face type of ride.

1332
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,880
But yeah, no, test track is not.

1333
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:26,120
No, the thing is extremely dry and you have to you're right about the dryness.

1334
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:30,920
And I guess when I because like the opposite of that is what you get

1335
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:35,720
in the pre ride video, which I was alluding to at the beginning.

1336
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:39,800
Right. Right. Which is you're just like in a you're in a facility

1337
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:43,240
with a guy in a polo shirt and a headset,

1338
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,760
like spouting all of this lingo.

1339
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,920
And that he does not John Michael Higgins does not break

1340
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:54,960
and go like, all right, so we're going to check the suspension in the chassis

1341
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,400
and then and I don't know, in other words, it rocks.

1342
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,960
There's no. Yeah. Shift in that way.

1343
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,720
Exactly. Also doesn't slip into his

1344
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,160
late shift David Letterman impression either.

1345
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,520
No, he does not.

1346
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,080
What am I going to do with the rest of my life?

1347
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,280
Yeah. OK. John Michael Higgins, the great John Michael Higgins.

1348
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,440
Well, you know, we've talked about late shift ad nauseum episode coming soon, I think.

1349
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:27,360
Sure. This is probably the first he was on people's radar was the was the late shift.

1350
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:31,240
This I think admirable performance as David Letterman.

1351
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,280
Like, what a tall order.

1352
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:37,440
Oh, yeah. Impossible thing to do to like a guy who's on TV all the time

1353
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:42,640
then and play him like not as a caricature in a movie

1354
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:46,680
that has characters. Yes. Almost everyone else is.

1355
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,880
So how do you play dramatic scenes as David Letterman?

1356
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:52,120
I mean, it's insane. How would you? Yeah.

1357
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,080
He manages to do it.

1358
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,960
I remember thinking about John Michael Higgins.

1359
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,280
Well, this guy is like a novelty impressionist guy.

1360
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,320
He's like Rich Little.

1361
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,240
Rich Little's in the late shift in the late shift.

1362
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,720
So then when he starts appearing in other things,

1363
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:09,680
probably most prominently best in show is what really blew up the career.

1364
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,840
Seemingly, I was like him.

1365
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,920
They're letting the Letterman guy.

1366
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,360
And then you watch the movie of course, and they're like, oh, he's great.

1367
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,640
He's so good. He's so good.

1368
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,920
A mighty wind. He said the rest of development.

1369
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:21,440
So good and everything.

1370
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,120
I'm very fond of the guy because I got to work with him on this this pretty long

1371
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:30,000
shoot, this thing, Tween Fest for Funny or Die with past guests.

1372
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
And now tonight show all stars, Brad Evans and Nick Cerelli.

1373
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,240
He was the star of the thing, like top of call sheet.

1374
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,520
So nervous to work with the guy.

1375
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,200
And oh, my God, the greatest guy.

1376
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,600
I'm so happy to say, like the nicest, coolest guy,

1377
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:49,040
like imparting lessons all the time and not like a preachy way.

1378
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:53,080
Just like the way that a star of something needs to behave,

1379
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,200
invested, making everything better.

1380
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,400
This guy's so great.

1381
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,200
He's also on the set doing the thing that you want the most,

1382
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:02,440
which is telling stories from his storied career.

1383
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,840
There was a day where he

1384
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:08,880
was extremely tense, like running out of light, the worst like

1385
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,000
like I need to be focused.

1386
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,600
And then I hear him start to talk about like, like, well, you know,

1387
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:18,000
I was in this Letterman movie and I'm like, oh, man, what do I do?

1388
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:23,320
Like I have like it took till day 13 for him to I want to.

1389
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,080
I think I like bounced back and forth.

1390
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:28,920
I got to hear some of it. But we got into test track.

1391
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,240
You had to get into test track.

1392
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:33,800
And he told a story about making this video.

1393
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:37,280
And I like at first I was like, am I telling this story out of school?

1394
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,440
But he did tell it on this other podcast.

1395
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:43,000
We've cited this thing, the Tierra podcast.

1396
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,680
Something weird like Cal David, his voice of sunny eclipse.

1397
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,760
The voice of sunny eclipse is on it.

1398
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,360
John Michael Higgins is on it.

1399
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,560
So he told this story. So that means I'm allowed to tell it.

1400
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:56,640
If you think about what that video is like,

1401
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:02,960
you're sort of watching a live feed in this laboratory space.

1402
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,080
What are they? They're in the control.

1403
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:05,960
So we're in the control center.

1404
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:09,080
Bill McKim is, of course, the iconic character, Bill McKim.

1405
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:15,440
And it's sort of a big you might not even realize this while watching it,

1406
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:18,200
but it's sort of a big unbroken take.

1407
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,880
Yes, as a lot of things are.

1408
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,800
I mean, it's not dissimilar from the Avatar.

1409
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,000
Move your arms around.

1410
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,720
Like, it's definitely in that world where like we're not watching a pre-produced video.

1411
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:33,120
There's a live feed here and this guy's talking to you.

1412
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:38,120
So he gets this job, he's excited to do it,

1413
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:41,560
and he's reading through the thing and thinking, well, there's a lot of this is

1414
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:44,960
nothing but car jargon and he also not a car person.

1415
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,280
I don't believe so he's trying to decipher like,

1416
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,720
well, how am I going to fit all this in?

1417
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:55,440
And and and he I think he starts talking to the director like,

1418
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:56,840
so what are the cut points here?

1419
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,520
Like, where how much do I have to have?

1420
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:03,680
And he's the director's like, the there are no, you got to do it all.

1421
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,320
You have to do all of it.

1422
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:10,160
And if you watch a video of this on YouTube, it is like four minutes long.

1423
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:14,080
And it's a it's not a four minutes where there's like a long part

1424
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,040
where you just emote and there is not memorization to do.

1425
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,480
It is full memorization.

1426
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,960
I don't think cards were an option for some reason.

1427
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,680
He had to have all this.

1428
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:26,600
And if you like, watch the video and know that this guy had to memorize this,

1429
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:27,560
it's insane.

1430
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,880
It's like one of the greatest acting challenges.

1431
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:30,840
Yeah, I can imagine.

1432
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:33,240
Yeah, kind of par for the course.

1433
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:39,240
If you're doing a play unusual, if you're doing something in front of the cameras,

1434
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:43,680
that's like a thing that it's like, all right, everyone get on your game.

1435
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,440
This is a four minute unbroken take.

1436
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,600
Yes. Yeah.

1437
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,440
Which like so he I mean, he is like a

1438
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:57,440
a super theater trained actor, which is maybe why they asked him to do it.

1439
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:01,040
And that he leaned on that to get it done.

1440
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,960
Like, I do have those powers of memorization.

1441
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,440
However, he walked also a play.

1442
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,280
You would know that and prepare for that.

1443
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,480
I think he walked onto the set and was not aware of the approach.

1444
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:15,360
And I think it was going there has to be something right even within this format.

1445
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:16,800
And they were very firm.

1446
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,440
No, no, no, it's got to be this.

1447
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,920
And if also if you watch the video like beyond, he has to go do all that stuff.

1448
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,240
But then also like go mill around in the back.

1449
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,880
And when it's over, he leaves and goes and talks to gestures

1450
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:31,000
that a map to somebody and then comes back and he forgot his clipboard.

1451
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
And so there's all this there's a ton of silent business.

1452
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,160
Yeah. He had to repeat every time.

1453
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:39,520
Basically, this seemed like the craziest day of shooting ever,

1454
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:42,920
where it has to be perfect 100 percent.

1455
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:46,080
So he'll make it 80 percent of the way through and then miss one little thing.

1456
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,520
And they'll go cut stop.

1457
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,880
And they does not even like time to recover.

1458
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,160
It's just not keep going.

1459
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:53,280
No, sorry, I got to hit it again.

1460
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,800
But it's also maybe you're getting here and I'm cutting.

1461
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,160
I apologize if I'm cutting you off.

1462
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,800
But like it also feels like they

1463
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:05,280
the people putting it together maybe weren't like the most like well thought out

1464
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:10,520
in some aspects of it, too, because with a ride video with a pre ride video,

1465
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:14,800
it's like if there's a cut or two, there's not a single dad in line

1466
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,320
who's like, what the hell? That's not an unbroken take.

1467
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,920
Like no one cares.

1468
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:20,760
It's not like a throw up a graphic.

1469
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:24,800
It's not a Paul Thomas Anderson movie or something where it's like one single shot

1470
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,920
and it's an important monologue and you got to get it all.

1471
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,240
And what like that's not what it is.

1472
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,560
Obviously, you can put you could put several edits.

1473
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,160
It almost feels like people maybe that didn't

1474
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:38,080
weren't thinking about all the practical things when they were shooting that day.

1475
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,160
Yeah, is it people who are not filmmaking minded?

1476
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:44,640
Even like because you imagine they would hire people who are.

1477
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:45,800
But you never know.

1478
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,760
Like we think of these things as the grandest.

1479
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,400
Oh, my God, if I could be part of a ride video.

1480
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:54,080
But I think they're oddly there, their afterthought,

1481
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:58,120
they're one component of this massive multimedia project.

1482
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,280
Oh, look, there was a funny or die commercial.

1483
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,280
I've told the story I think before on the show where I was like,

1484
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:07,040
it was a page monologue and I was like, everyone, if this is 30 seconds,

1485
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,240
I'm not getting all this out.

1486
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,680
It's not it's going to get cut down.

1487
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:12,280
And they're like, no, no, no, we learn all of it.

1488
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,080
So I learned this entire monologue.

1489
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:17,600
And then we got there and they were like, this isn't 30 seconds.

1490
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:21,160
So we want to cut out this line and then four lines down this line

1491
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:22,560
and then two lines down this line.

1492
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:25,480
And I was like, oh, shit, I learned the whole thing.

1493
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:28,080
Yeah, that's not really how it works.

1494
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,000
And that's your life. I was awful.

1495
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,080
So sometimes even even the best intentions are people.

1496
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:35,560
They're like, oh, you know what? Never.

1497
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:38,200
Well, and there's the assumption that actors or maybe I don't know.

1498
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:41,280
Is it like at its base is the assumption that acting is easy?

1499
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,520
Sure. Like they'll be able to do that. No problem.

1500
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:47,000
Like there's no adjustment and there's no amount of like throwing people.

1501
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:51,080
There's a lot that's easy, but not necessarily like taking like

1502
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:55,320
16 lines and then taking out three strategic lines

1503
01:14:55,560 --> 01:15:00,520
with oral words here and there and then having it perfect after that.

1504
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:01,960
Like that's a different skill.

1505
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:04,440
I mean, I've shown up to sets and they've been like,

1506
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:07,000
we're we're going to walk you to set.

1507
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,800
Here's your lines, by the way.

1508
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:12,240
And that's because it's two lines.

1509
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:15,800
It's like, oh, this is 10 to 15 seconds long.

1510
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:20,360
This shot or like the whole commercial or short or whatever.

1511
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:23,840
And it's like, yeah, occasionally they forget like, oh, yeah,

1512
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:26,400
I guess we do need to tell you what your lines are.

1513
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:30,480
But it's like for 20 seconds, you can learn that real quick.

1514
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,560
You know, you can learn like, you know, for commercials,

1515
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:35,400
leave Spider-Man alone.

1516
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:39,080
You know, I wish I got to be at least by that.

1517
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:40,960
You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us.

1518
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,360
I could know that on the day.

1519
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:45,160
You could tell me that's with New York City, pal. You know? Yeah.

1520
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,560
We would know we would have been perfect as those New Yorkers.

1521
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,800
I hope, by the way, I hope with this new Spider-Man,

1522
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,760
they bring the New Yorkers back if they're bringing all the old Spider-Man back.

1523
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,320
Oh, from the train? Yeah. Yeah.

1524
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,240
Oh, no, from the bridge from the first spider.

1525
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,720
Oh, the first one. Oh, yeah.

1526
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,840
I thought you meant where they're like, they're in trash at the Green Goblin.

1527
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,560
And they go, you mess with one of us, you mess with all of us.

1528
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,080
I want those guys. New Yorkers.

1529
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,600
Is that what they're saying? Yes. Yeah.

1530
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,600
So, yeah, they go. It's powerful.

1531
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,520
So I hope those they're back when the when we have this live action

1532
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,320
Spider-Verse.

1533
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,320
But yeah, like this is I have the script in front of me and he has to remember

1534
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,320
this is like, you know, two minutes in.

1535
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,200
Not such a good feeling.

1536
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,480
But hang in there, because we're going to do the test one more time this time

1537
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,800
with the ABS or anti-lock brakes.

1538
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:30,360
Like how are you like after a bunch of environmental tests?

1539
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,760
Put up two, five and seven and corrosive condition.

1540
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,040
Like it's all such it's massive blocks.

1541
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,640
It's such a jargon.

1542
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:41,600
But he's getting through it like it's just all they need to do is get it once.

1543
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,560
But it takes all day to do that.

1544
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,320
And they get slot all day to do it.

1545
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:48,760
But at the end, he feels like a champion, like a true champion.

1546
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:52,760
Like that is one of the greatest acting challenges I've ever faced.

1547
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,720
And we did it and we pulled it off.

1548
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,720
And I, you know, a Disney, that's cool.

1549
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:58,880
I want Disney to be happy.

1550
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:04,840
About a year goes by and he gets a call from his agent saying, hey,

1551
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:10,400
so the Disney job, they need you to go in and plug in a couple of parts of this.

1552
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:16,280
And lately do some ADR additional dialogue recording.

1553
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:20,440
And he says, OK, so just like we're just going to pick up a couple of lines.

1554
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,360
Yeah, that sounds fine.

1555
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:26,560
And he goes into a studio and he sits down with the script and he asks him,

1556
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,520
like, all right, so what are we picking up here?

1557
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,400
And they're like, all of it.

1558
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:34,360
I'm sorry, all of it.

1559
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:37,400
Yeah, there was a sound problem when we were recording.

1560
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:40,680
So we need to redo the entire thing.

1561
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:46,360
So now he is at a completely different juncture of difficult acting.

1562
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:51,280
Again, what you said about picking up a couple of lines or two, or you can fake it.

1563
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,200
ADR is tough.

1564
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,920
It's like, you know, because you're watching and trying to dub over yourself

1565
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,000
and hit the right timing.

1566
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,680
And it's got to be exactly that amount of time.

1567
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:01,960
But imagine doing that with paragraph after paragraph of car jargon.

1568
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:06,040
Like that's one of the most complex ADR jobs that has ever existed.

1569
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:10,720
So again, he's got a long, exhaustive day ironing through it, ironing through it.

1570
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,280
Damn it. Shit. Start again.

1571
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:14,840
That's why I that's why I said because I knew that part was coming.

1572
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:18,880
And that's why I was like, maybe it wasn't like the most professional crew.

1573
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,600
I mean, that's crazy.

1574
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:26,920
There's no usable audio from the set of something that is entirely a guy talking.

1575
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:29,120
Yeah, exactly.

1576
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:32,240
So it does seem like this attraction was a little cursed

1577
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:35,520
with how much went wrong building the first version.

1578
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,000
I guess so. Yes.

1579
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,920
You would think the only like we would be enough for experimental ride vehicles

1580
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,200
to have major.

1581
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,560
But the boom mic was too much.

1582
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:49,680
Apparently, in the direction of this, you know, with the General Motors Corporation,

1583
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:55,400
I know for sure has shelves and shelves of footage of stock

1584
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:02,000
stock footage of car parts working like anti-lock brakes, like braking,

1585
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,520
you know, cars screeching to a stop.

1586
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:10,080
Yeah, I'm saying like, yeah, you can easily like fix that.

1587
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:14,040
Like I this is how I would fix it if I was like editing or directing.

1588
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,600
It's like, OK, we'll use the best stuff.

1589
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,080
Because again, that is insane.

1590
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:23,720
Like it's it's already hard enough to go like, OK, we're going to play you

1591
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:28,840
what you said, try to say it in the cadence, in the time you said it.

1592
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:32,760
So we can try to sync it with your mouth so it looks a little natural.

1593
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:35,720
Four minutes of that is that's wild.

1594
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:38,280
How would that be the plan to begin with?

1595
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,720
You may as well just reshoot it.

1596
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,280
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I know.

1597
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:43,080
Like, why not?

1598
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,520
Well, how are they ever going to get like an office going again?

1599
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:48,440
Five polo shirts. Yeah, that's impossible.

1600
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,320
How would it happen?

1601
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:55,080
So, I mean, I always liked this video and I liked him in it.

1602
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:57,480
I was always a fan of him even before meeting him.

1603
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,960
I've met him and he's such a great guy.

1604
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,440
I like truly like if you watch a video of this, go back and realize

1605
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,240
it was a long unbroken takes and dubbed over.

1606
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:11,280
This is an act, a true acting feat by John Michael Higgins,

1607
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,520
topped only by his appearance in the late shift.

1608
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,360
Great performer.

1609
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:21,400
And yeah, I yeah, it's a lot of levels to appreciate it.

1610
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:22,720
That is so stressful.

1611
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:26,000
Oh, and also, oh, also, like this is before we're doing the podcast.

1612
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,760
But I, you know, I like

1613
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,800
theme park obsessive, obviously.

1614
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:33,520
So I do remember telling him, like, yeah, I've watched that thing.

1615
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:35,720
There's cuts like they do still do cut.

1616
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:38,000
They cut to like people getting into the car.

1617
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,440
It's deep into it.

1618
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:41,640
But I was like, I hate to tell you this.

1619
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,400
They for sure still did cuts.

1620
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,320
And he said, I wouldn't know. I've never been.

1621
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,240
He never made it.

1622
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:50,160
So and this thing retired on this podcast.

1623
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,200
They told him, oh, it's not you anymore.

1624
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,960
And he was like, oh, really? He didn't know.

1625
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:59,640
There is still a presence of him, weirdly, in the parks, though,

1626
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:02,320
and in a similar ride, because I didn't realize.

1627
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,560
I don't think I've ever thought about who this is.

1628
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:10,400
When you're heading to Radiator Springs Racers, there's a statue of an old car.

1629
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:14,120
And that is apparently the founder of Radiator Springs.

1630
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,920
Stanley Stanley. Yeah.

1631
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:19,720
And that character is voiced in one short by John Michael.

1632
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,920
Wow. Interesting. Yeah.

1633
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,760
And did he know? Does he know that?

1634
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,320
Well, I learned that from hearing him say that on this.

1635
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,080
OK, so he does know that he does.

1636
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:29,840
And he's been on that. Maybe.

1637
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,160
Maybe not. Maybe.

1638
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:34,200
Could be no. I love and I don't mean I don't say this facetiously.

1639
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:38,120
I like when anyone does something for like a nerdy thing.

1640
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:41,120
I like and has no like love for it.

1641
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:42,720
I like that. Investment.

1642
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:45,440
And I know it's cool. It's really it is like a cool move.

1643
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,800
And I don't mean that I'm not being facetious, like an actor is in a superhero

1644
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,960
movie or comic book movie.

1645
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:51,520
And they're just like, yeah, I don't know what.

1646
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,720
And like they don't know answers to questions about the character.

1647
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:56,440
I showed up. I whatever. I like it.

1648
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:57,280
I don't know why.

1649
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:01,080
I remember hearing an interview once with the guy who did the music.

1650
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,760
This is much more specific and in our realm.

1651
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:06,680
He did the music for Marvel Superhero Island.

1652
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:07,840
Oh, yeah. You talk about this.

1653
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,440
90s Marvel music.

1654
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,760
I think the podcast I'm not.

1655
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:15,760
I think it's the unofficial Universal Orlando podcast.

1656
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:20,400
I'm not sure if they're still going, but they had an interview with him

1657
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:24,560
and he was explaining, you know, how complicated it was at the time.

1658
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,960
It was like all this stuff on mini discs and all.

1659
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,360
And he was like, I'm glad people like it.

1660
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,840
I really should get down there sometimes.

1661
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,920
My kids are getting older. Yeah, I think they'd like that park.

1662
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,280
I think they'd like I really should get down there and see it.

1663
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:40,960
And I just thought that was so funny because I'm like, man, you're me.

1664
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,280
Yeah, it's everywhere.

1665
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:45,760
The music, the rock, it's everywhere in that part of the park.

1666
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:49,760
Yeah. Well, and God knows if I was ever part of a theme park attraction,

1667
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,640
I would be down there so desperately.

1668
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:55,200
I would be outside telling people about it.

1669
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,800
I would be like, you know, it's me in there.

1670
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,200
Like it would be the smallest role.

1671
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,480
It wouldn't matter. And I would be yes, I would be so embarrassing,

1672
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:05,720
shamelessly telling people that I have something to do with it.

1673
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:06,800
Yeah, for sure.

1674
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:11,320
If I was at the, you know, like if I got to be,

1675
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:16,560
I don't know, an astronaut in the last two days of an electronic store

1676
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:21,120
being open, I would probably go in there in a costume,

1677
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:24,080
make a bunch of people come to and clap for me.

1678
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:26,320
That is probably what I would how I would.

1679
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,160
Sure. Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

1680
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:34,400
So anyway, so that that means maybe some of my fondness for this

1681
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,400
attraction is that video.

1682
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,680
I do remember that being part of a really good cluster where they were using

1683
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:43,160
really great character actors like Wallace Langham and Dinosaur.

1684
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:44,720
I like John Michael Higgins in this.

1685
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:47,760
And of course, Patrick Warburton in Soren.

1686
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:51,480
There's just like a neat quality to those things at that time,

1687
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,640
even if they were kind of like aesthetic free.

1688
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:56,000
And this and I do like the video.

1689
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,080
I like the part that I said where, you know, there's the sly nod about that test,

1690
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:03,120
even though it doesn't pay off the way you want it to. Right.

1691
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,520
And I like when she gets he also gives her a little, you know, is his assistant.

1692
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:13,560
You know, she gets a little free rein to pick a test and then she pulls one up

1693
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:16,680
and he keeps talking and then a big crash happens.

1694
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,800
And that and then they don't even acknowledge it.

1695
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,920
Like we're going to give we're going to give you a test that might

1696
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,800
crash you like a crash test dummy.

1697
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,920
And and and that gets a big laugh.

1698
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:30,600
I remember like, yeah, I watched videos where that that part gets.

1699
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:35,760
I'm you're right. I am discounting that 90s intro videoness of it.

1700
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:39,800
That is yes, there's the there's that specific era.

1701
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:43,040
Whimsy, it's not what I'm I'm talking about that like.

1702
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:46,080
Or I was talking about before, like it being like that, like

1703
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,840
there's a coziness to what we're doing.

1704
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,480
That's John Denver ask.

1705
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:53,000
Listen to the land. Sure. Yeah, sure, sure.

1706
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,280
But this is a different. Yeah.

1707
01:24:54,280 --> 01:25:00,120
So there is some fun 90s nostalgia of just that vibe of wonder.

1708
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,680
If that's what you're describing.

1709
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:02,840
Yes, there you go.

1710
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:03,880
There's nothing that I think.

1711
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:08,240
But that's been that's gone from like all media, I think,

1712
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:12,520
by this time and replaced by just like rocks like that.

1713
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:15,640
Sure is the that is what happened in the late 90s.

1714
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:19,760
Yeah. I mean, obviously, like Tower of Terror has like some spooky wonder.

1715
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:25,400
And then, yeah, rock and roller coaster is not doesn't have any wonder in it.

1716
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:28,680
But yeah, it's extremely industrial.

1717
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:32,520
And while I like that video section, I remember thinking that the line is

1718
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:35,920
unpleasant, I have a recollection of like because in that queue

1719
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,720
you're with a bunch of test gear and there's like

1720
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:43,720
not sirens going off, but I guess sirens, not audibly, but like,

1721
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:48,120
you know, lights flashing and and a bunch of tape everywhere.

1722
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:49,560
I realize the vibe of it.

1723
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:51,480
That queue is like a Home Depot.

1724
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:57,440
You're in just a big open like it's not you're not there for aesthetics.

1725
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,720
It's you go there to get stuff done.

1726
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,800
And a lot of it is orange.

1727
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,240
A lot of it is orange. Yeah.

1728
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:04,960
No, that's yeah, you're completely right.

1729
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,280
That line is a Home Depot.

1730
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:09,280
And I also remember a part I remember getting stuck in the line.

1731
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:12,320
Maybe there was a breakdown that I had to wait through the first time I did it.

1732
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:17,560
And I remember there was some test dummy or something that just kept getting

1733
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:22,200
hit over and over again by a giant weight or a giant cinder block.

1734
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,440
Yeah, I remember that. OK, so I'm not making that up.

1735
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:29,040
And if you're stuck there for a while, boy, oh, boy, is that a grating

1736
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:31,080
sound to hear over and over again.

1737
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,440
Somebody getting pummeled, dummy getting pummeled. Yeah.

1738
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:37,800
Well, I'll tell you, I talking about getting stuck at places.

1739
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,400
I was always definitely afraid

1740
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:45,480
here and at Hershey's Chocolate World at the Chocolate World ride.

1741
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:48,880
There is like an oven.

1742
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:53,600
There's a heating section of that and there's a heat lamp section of test track ride.

1743
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:58,240
And I think maybe like an aunt or an uncle told a story about, oh,

1744
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:02,880
we broke down the heat and I was just like, oh, thank God you survived.

1745
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,720
And like, I was just so scared of getting stuck there.

1746
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:10,160
Fake heat lamp. You thought people get stuck there and melt, get cooked. Yeah.

1747
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,120
That's fine.

1748
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:13,920
Even in Chocolate World, though, you were worried about that.

1749
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:18,560
I mean, I think you get mildly uncomfortable.

1750
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,800
Yeah. Yeah.

1751
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:23,600
That works. You get mildly uncomfortable.

1752
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:29,120
But like every now and then is like a kid like too smart for his own good.

1753
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:33,240
I would like work myself into like, oh God, what if we get stuck here?

1754
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:36,040
We're screwed. We're fucked. The red lights.

1755
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,280
The red lights, the gentle red lights.

1756
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:41,080
I mean, if you were stuck for eight hours, yeah, maybe.

1757
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:44,040
Yeah, that would be too much. Yeah. Yeah. You might have cast members

1758
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:46,640
just standing out. We're so we're sorry.

1759
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:49,280
There's nothing we can do.

1760
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:51,760
This is the one spot we can't evacuate.

1761
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,240
Track. You knew what you were getting into.

1762
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,160
Oh, man. Yeah.

1763
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:02,760
So the ride itself, let's talk about a little bit.

1764
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,920
You go through various tests.

1765
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,960
We have a favorite test.

1766
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,360
Oh, that's a good question.

1767
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:10,560
Then you thought they pulled off well.

1768
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:13,920
I mean, as a kid, I like that braking test.

1769
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:16,800
Mm hmm. Because it's fast.

1770
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:18,680
I mean, it scared me, though.

1771
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:19,560
It definitely. Yeah.

1772
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,960
The ride is a kid I was a little scared of until the.

1773
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:24,120
I mean, yeah, I hate.

1774
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:27,840
I mean, there's nothing worse than swerving in a car or like fish tailing in a car.

1775
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:31,080
So like to be able to do it in a controlled environment is a little

1776
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:32,960
sure. Or do that.

1777
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:33,960
Drift. Yeah, yeah.

1778
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,880
That's that's an interesting little simulation.

1779
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,440
It feels pretty crazy.

1780
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:41,040
Like and again, that educational part, it's pretty dry.

1781
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,480
And I read the point that

1782
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:48,120
anti-lock brakes became not like an uncommon feature.

1783
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:51,280
So why are we pointing this out all day every day? Right.

1784
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,960
This is just what cars have now.

1785
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,560
But I guess I didn't realize that they didn't have them.

1786
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:59,160
And truly, if that's what would happen to you in a skidding situation,

1787
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:00,800
it's sort of an interesting.

1788
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,160
It is interesting in hindsight, but as yes, as I did not know

1789
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:06,560
what the difference in brakes were.

1790
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:09,640
I mean, can I what the explanation when?

1791
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,840
OK, here, let's sound stupid again.

1792
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:15,320
Anti-lock brakes are. Oh, you know.

1793
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:19,520
So I do know this because when I did drivers ed in high school

1794
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:22,560
and again, I was like Mike, I was late getting my license.

1795
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:24,960
So there was the driving portion of drivers ed.

1796
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,640
And then there was like the classroom portion of drivers ed.

1797
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:32,040
And the videos and handouts still a little out of date.

1798
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:36,560
And so all of the handouts were like, don't slam on your brakes.

1799
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:38,760
They will lock up and not work.

1800
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:44,760
Doesn't apply in the year 2002, 2003, if you were driving a car made

1801
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:48,400
within the last 10 years of that, because, yeah, anti-lock brakes

1802
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:51,120
became standard and you can slam on the brakes.

1803
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:54,640
And so but but before you would have to pump the brakes,

1804
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,440
you didn't want to slam on the brakes.

1805
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:59,280
Right. The difference is you have to like, yes, as you're saying, pump

1806
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:04,200
to get it to stop versus just, yes, one big movement would be to just slam.

1807
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,440
Right. Yeah, that would be bad.

1808
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:08,640
The same the same class.

1809
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:10,040
We had the final exam.

1810
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:13,240
We're like, hey, there's like 10 questions about car insurance.

1811
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,720
And we didn't have a car insurance sector chapter.

1812
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:18,000
And they're like, oh, yeah, just leave that blank.

1813
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,440
I want to know what the car insurance is.

1814
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:20,960
Oh, yeah, just leave that blank.

1815
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,360
I'll make sure to cross it out.

1816
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:24,760
And I was like, why are we why are we doing that?

1817
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,440
What is this? What are we doing here?

1818
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:33,400
I think one of the driest things, admittedly, in any attraction is

1819
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:37,080
the John Michael Higgins technician, Bill McKim approving

1820
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:40,400
going through what kind of blocks that you want to use.

1821
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:43,240
Let's go with the German and the Belgian.

1822
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:46,440
And I thought, what is that about?

1823
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:49,720
And I guess what it is is that I guess Belgian blocks,

1824
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:54,080
this is a real test that they did that, however, the streets were paved

1825
01:30:54,960 --> 01:31:00,320
in Belgium in World War two, tore up the tank treads

1826
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:04,680
so hard that they got the reputation for being the worst

1827
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:08,320
blocks, the worst blocks you build a street with.

1828
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:12,920
So this was a test that they ran at this facility in the 70s.

1829
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:15,560
And the but like, what a boy, that's a leap.

1830
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:18,600
Who who's in there knowing about Belgian block?

1831
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:22,800
I think cut to like one grandfather who lay, I'll never forget the Belgian blocks.

1832
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:26,280
They blew out my treads. I was captured.

1833
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:28,960
That was a little something.

1834
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:29,920
That guy is a prisoner.

1835
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:34,000
Just come off the beaches at Normandy and little something for Grandpa.

1836
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:36,760
Although that might have been like he would have might have been like

1837
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,280
not like that because it reminded him.

1838
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:39,680
No, no, no. Yeah, yeah.

1839
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:41,640
It was bad. He gets off the ride screaming.

1840
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:43,680
This is also like car culture.

1841
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:46,440
I mean, car magazines fixing up like.

1842
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:52,600
That could be a just a term that could be like plus it up.

1843
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,440
That could be an industry term.

1844
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:57,920
And there's like, you know, gearheads listening to this going like,

1845
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:01,320
of course, I know what a goddamn Belgian block is.

1846
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,000
How many cars? Stupid.

1847
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,560
I was going to say, how many car heads are listening to podcasts?

1848
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:07,840
The ride. I bet there's some cross.

1849
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,840
I mean, there has to be some.

1850
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:11,640
I would assume, but maybe I'm wrong.

1851
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:13,320
And well, we've lost them all today.

1852
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:15,000
They're mad, very mad at us.

1853
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,440
Yep. They're out forever.

1854
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:18,960
They might have liked every other episode, but this episode.

1855
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:21,360
Oh, my goodness. Yeah. Yeah.

1856
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:26,000
Boys, these knuckleheads get to talk on a microphone like they know something.

1857
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,480
These dweebs.

1858
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:29,920
They wouldn't be wrong. We've gotten a lot wrong.

1859
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:34,640
You know, then you start going through like the the the painted hills,

1860
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:37,880
the very like plywood, your face.

1861
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:40,200
And this is where, you know, that and the

1862
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:44,960
you're watching a ride through of the original one was.

1863
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:48,600
And we're weaving in and out of like, yeah,

1864
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:52,680
plywood painted green and we're going through these little rooms.

1865
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:54,480
It's a heat test and a cold test.

1866
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:58,000
And you're just going, well, this is like escaping from the tractor,

1867
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,760
but not as good in radiator space.

1868
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:03,560
This is like they go to the paint or the tire room, but not as good.

1869
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,120
And unfortunately, that just is where it's at.

1870
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:10,320
This is like a big example of a ride that got the top.

1871
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:15,320
It just like in it and there wouldn't be radio springs racers without it.

1872
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:19,080
Yeah, we we think this ride, we bless this ride.

1873
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:24,320
But it's like almost impossible at this point to to watch it

1874
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,840
and not just think, well, I'd rather be thinking about the other one.

1875
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:30,360
Well, in the second generation of this technology, which I haven't seen,

1876
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,440
the journey to the center of the earth ride and it is journey

1877
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,280
to the center of the earth.

1878
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:38,320
The my my favorite attraction in Tokyo, Disney Sea.

1879
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:42,240
I mean, like that's another that's applying the same technology

1880
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:44,880
in this unreal, magical. Yeah.

1881
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:47,520
I'd say more thrilling, more beautiful.

1882
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:50,240
For sure. Yeah. Years later, is that still in two?

1883
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:57,560
Right. I believe now you do take this now that that as I do still like test track.

1884
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:01,840
And if you think about this type of attraction, like this slot

1885
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:04,640
car variety and the rides that use it

1886
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:08,200
or radiator springs, journey to the center of the earth and test track, that's

1887
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:11,040
that's a pretty all star group.

1888
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,520
Yeah. Attractions for sure.

1889
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:16,720
And I guess that's really maybe what I was getting at when I was being so negative

1890
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:20,880
at the start, where I was like back in the old days, I would have said, wow,

1891
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:24,240
this is great. But now my interest is weighing so severely.

1892
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:27,720
But I guess it is because there's just a much better version of it.

1893
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:29,280
Yeah. Yeah.

1894
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:33,760
And that includes the the end, the speed run.

1895
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:38,320
It is, yes, I think, undeniably better in radiator springs.

1896
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:39,560
Now, it's not as fast.

1897
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:40,680
I was curious about that.

1898
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:43,760
Radiator Springs only gets up to 40, 40.

1899
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,080
Yeah. And this gets right at the cusp of 65.

1900
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:52,680
So there's more thrill to it in that final run, which is where you're

1901
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:53,840
you're on the outside of that.

1902
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:58,360
You kind of leave the park and go back in the park and right at the end there,

1903
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:00,920
kind of where you're passing by the people getting in line.

1904
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:03,720
It really creates like I remember liking that too.

1905
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,400
You're intimidated getting on it because you walk on.

1906
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:10,080
Oh, yeah. So now it rattles like crazy.

1907
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,520
It feels like that thing's coming apart every time the car goes.

1908
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:15,920
I don't remember if it was rattling back in the old days or that just because it's

1909
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,640
because it's older now.

1910
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:21,840
But yes, now it feels like, oh, there is an effect I like.

1911
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:25,000
And I really notice it in the second version.

1912
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,280
I couldn't can't remember who was in the first version or not.

1913
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:31,400
But as they're like,

1914
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:36,760
uh, you're about to sort of launch like the doors open,

1915
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:41,200
like it seemingly at the very last minute as you're on that speed run.

1916
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:45,480
And in the video I watched, I don't think I've ever tried this, but the the

1917
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:48,640
I think it was Attractions 360 had posted this video.

1918
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:52,680
They were writing it as at like Twilight when the sky is very blue.

1919
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:55,600
And it almost like complements

1920
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:59,800
the inside of like the the neon blue grid.

1921
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:03,960
And then as you are really hitting the speed, like the footage,

1922
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:08,440
the blue and orange lights outside, they all start to blur a little.

1923
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:11,320
And I was like, oh, this looks pretty cool.

1924
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:17,240
Like it it it looks a lot more of a piece of the indoor section

1925
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:21,800
than as if you were riding it at like noon in the Orlando sun.

1926
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:22,760
You know what I mean?

1927
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:24,080
Yeah, that is weird.

1928
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:27,880
Like the test track one point, oh, then you like

1929
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,760
you're in this ride building and that's all industrial.

1930
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:33,280
And then you're like in a parking lot was less weird.

1931
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,640
It's kind of similar. Right.

1932
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:39,080
But now that you're in magical Tron worlds going through laser mountains.

1933
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:41,640
Yeah. Like then you're just in a parking lot.

1934
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:43,200
It is odd. So maybe it is maybe.

1935
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:45,360
Yeah, maybe night or twilight is the optimal.

1936
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:48,400
Yeah, like a gray overcast Orlando afternoon.

1937
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:52,320
It's like not quite the thrilling setting for the finale. Right.

1938
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:56,440
Yeah. In the newer version, there's a lot of like the Easter eggs

1939
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:59,680
that theme park fans like there's a reference to wed.

1940
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,400
There's a nod to cars.

1941
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:05,680
There is a couple of nods to World of Motion.

1942
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:11,280
Oh, really? So the the newer version since the end of 2012.

1943
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:16,040
I mean, how do you guys feel about like the the general aesthetic,

1944
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:19,880
general design, because I think at best it does kind of look like a cool

1945
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:23,320
like, you know, Tron sort of glowing.

1946
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:26,240
And at worst, it kind of looks like a win amp skin.

1947
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,440
Like it looks like a zoom.

1948
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:29,440
You know, you're right.

1949
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:34,120
So when things are flowing, when it's just like, yeah, trippy shapes.

1950
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:35,960
Yeah. Yeah, you're totally right.

1951
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:40,200
But also when I look at modern video games, I'm like, oh, still doing this.

1952
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:45,200
Huh? Still doing this for for like start screens and like all of that.

1953
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:47,560
Sure. Still still sticking with this, huh?

1954
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:51,400
Well, yeah, as I said before, like I like cosmic bowling,

1955
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:52,600
the cosmic bowling aesthetic.

1956
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:55,600
But yeah, it doesn't feel like when you watch those videos of Tron

1957
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:59,560
where it feels like a purpose, like it's neon for a reason.

1958
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:02,040
It feels like it's just like, oh, yeah, it looks connected.

1959
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:05,040
Like, yeah, why do these things go together? Right.

1960
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:08,400
And it's the whole yeah, the whole new narrative with the different rides.

1961
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:11,480
And we'll talk about that with different cars, excuse me, that you can build.

1962
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:16,720
Like, it kind of makes sense, but it doesn't feel so right on the money.

1963
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:20,280
It feels a little bit more like just it's a cooler atmosphere.

1964
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:23,000
But we just kind of slapped some neon here.

1965
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:25,960
The big shift that happened is that in the first version,

1966
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:27,760
you're essentially a crash test dummy.

1967
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:29,400
A test is happening to you.

1968
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:30,680
What's that going to be like?

1969
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:36,560
Now you are designing a car, a same car to go on the same track on the same track.

1970
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:39,360
Now entering the sim track. Yeah.

1971
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:43,160
So you're yeah, you're you're basically like going to do your own test

1972
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:45,600
of an experimental car.

1973
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:49,640
You help design that you help design in a way.

1974
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:51,880
And you tap your magic band or your ticket.

1975
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:55,960
And then it like after you design it and then you tap it when you get in the car

1976
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:58,360
and then you can see your results at the end.

1977
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,960
I think a thing I do like in this.

1978
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:03,680
And there's a few different

1979
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:06,760
like YouTube channels or game channels where they do stuff like this

1980
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:11,880
is you can design some truly horrific cars, like very small body, very big wheels.

1981
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:14,680
The Homer vice versa. Yeah.

1982
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:15,800
Yes, you're right.

1983
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:18,840
You can you can really as a kid, I would have gone nuts for that.

1984
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:22,480
I would have loved this part of it because it is fun to make

1985
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:26,680
the craziest looking car with like different colors and yeah,

1986
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:29,000
something that would not be practical on the road is.

1987
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:31,760
How does this play out in the attraction, though?

1988
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:34,880
Like the car that you design, because you're sharing the car

1989
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:36,080
still with five other people.

1990
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:38,800
Some stats, I think you see different times.

1991
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:40,280
Yeah, but it's it's nothing.

1992
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:42,560
It's look, they had it. I was worried of it. It's nothing.

1993
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:45,680
I mean, as a kid, it would have been like, whoa, you get to design your own car

1994
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:47,920
and then you get to ride in it. And that's not what's happening.

1995
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:49,320
It's the exact same ride.

1996
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:50,520
Nothing changes.

1997
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:53,760
And they obviously like they would have to do a lot to the ride to make it.

1998
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,960
I don't. Yeah. As you're saying, everybody has their own car.

1999
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:59,840
So it would be very hard to do it unless everybody collectively designed a car.

2000
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:02,240
But yeah, you're just learning at the end

2001
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:06,280
how well that car would have done on the track that you just rode on.

2002
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:10,480
So it's like nothing about that affects your actual ride.

2003
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:13,640
It's literally just you do a cool thing at the start

2004
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:16,840
and then at the end, you get like numbers that would have like

2005
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:19,440
how your car would have responded. OK.

2006
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:23,320
So it's it's not again, as a kid, I would have liked it.

2007
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:26,200
But as a kid, when you design your own car and then you get in the car,

2008
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:28,000
you would be like, oh, it's going to do something.

2009
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,280
I affected it somehow.

2010
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:32,400
And I'm sure if they were building it from the ground up, that's what they would do.

2011
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,720
But they were just trying to come up with a cool

2012
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:38,080
a narrative that made sense in like this new cyber world.

2013
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:41,080
And then just trying to come up with another element to it

2014
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:43,240
that makes it seem fun and interactive.

2015
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:47,080
Yeah. In the 2010s and late 2000, late aughts,

2016
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:51,760
you know, I think this is when you started to see more like people

2017
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:55,280
talking about like gamification in theme park rides.

2018
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:57,960
And there's some stuff that where it's like directly in the ride,

2019
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:01,760
like Men in Black or more recently, Web Slingers.

2020
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:06,400
And then there's like, all right, we're going to try to put

2021
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:10,000
game stuff in the queues like we're going to make them interactive.

2022
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,280
And that'll keep people entertained before they wait on the ride

2023
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,400
and stop them from looking at their phones.

2024
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:18,680
And then a shift happened very quickly where they're like,

2025
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:22,200
we're putting in an app, not building anything else in the queue.

2026
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:24,400
Well, look, now we want them to look at their phone.

2027
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:27,800
Look at your phones now, because you're going to have to do that for food

2028
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:31,760
reservations, fast, fast reservations, magic, you know. Yeah.

2029
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:34,200
So that was the other philosophy.

2030
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:38,520
And I think there's probably something to the idea of like,

2031
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:43,080
maybe say you all got around like the whole car gathered around a console

2032
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:47,040
and everybody got to choose an element of the ride or something fun

2033
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:49,080
that it could do or it could spin around or something.

2034
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:52,960
And then you could each sort of influence the actual journey.

2035
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:54,440
I think that would actually feel more.

2036
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:59,000
I don't know exactly how you would do it, but then that would feel like different

2037
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,640
and feel like you actually affected the ride.

2038
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:03,120
And I'm sure they would do that if they were building from the ground up.

2039
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:06,280
But it's sort of. Yeah, they had to just mod out what was.

2040
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:10,120
Yeah, they just had to do a little extra thing because obviously like spaceship

2041
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:13,480
Earth, they added the whole jib jab sequence.

2042
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:16,280
And is that really related to the ride?

2043
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:17,840
Is age better than jib jab?

2044
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:20,840
It certainly has age better than jib jab spaceship Earth.

2045
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:23,440
That's a weird thing, too.

2046
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:25,720
So strange to get into that.

2047
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:31,040
Yes. And especially like it was your floating, like backwards down spaceship

2048
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:33,480
Earth, and it's kind of like peaceful and magical.

2049
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:36,760
And you're like, we would have had like your greeting card,

2050
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:40,840
your greeting card version and yourself living in the Jetsons house.

2051
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:42,680
You're like, what is this?

2052
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:47,600
Looks like like Lisa at the caricature artist off your head horribly.

2053
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:51,280
Yeah. Like I have six black spots in my face.

2054
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:53,000
Oh, yeah. Your forehead is pitch black.

2055
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,560
The other is totally washed out from the flash.

2056
01:42:56,440 --> 01:43:00,120
And it's fun to see the worst photo of you ever taken. Right.

2057
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:02,240
I've never looked worse than this.

2058
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:04,400
Yeah. The future is bright.

2059
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:07,760
They shot it on a Gameboy camera.

2060
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:11,480
Look, this would have been replaced by the spirit of storytelling or whatever.

2061
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:14,160
But unfortunately, COVID. That's right. Yeah.

2062
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:15,440
We've got rid of it.

2063
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:16,640
Saved jib jab.

2064
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:19,720
Yeah. We got like 12 more years of it at least.

2065
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:23,360
Yeah. You know what I like are the way that the mountains are rendered.

2066
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:25,880
I really it's that like vapor wave.

2067
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:28,160
Yeah, no, I agree.

2068
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:31,000
And you see like a lightning strike on those.

2069
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:34,200
And they know and kind of a weird retro future city.

2070
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:35,600
I know I did all that.

2071
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:38,000
I like there's no I think you're right, Jason.

2072
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:38,800
You're correct.

2073
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:42,200
That some of some of it is just trippy lights and it's a little lazy.

2074
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:45,600
But when they get the aesthetic right, it's really cool

2075
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:49,120
and more aesthetically pleasing, obviously, than what was there before,

2076
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:52,280
which was, you know, drawers and desks.

2077
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:56,000
It's like, you see, they're restricted by still.

2078
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:59,240
I think they were still restricted by the mission statement of Epcot

2079
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:02,280
at the time, because if I was pitching on it, I would have been like,

2080
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,320
let's just add some like characters.

2081
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:09,600
Let's let's say like Johnny Neon, who's trying to make the big race at the end.

2082
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:13,080
Like he's trying to win his girl back at the big race or something.

2083
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:14,520
But you can't do that.

2084
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:17,560
It's still got to kind of be like learning, at least at this point.

2085
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:18,720
Now, I guess it doesn't have to be.

2086
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:21,480
Maybe if they were redoing it now, they would they would just

2087
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,200
Cruella is racing through something and it doesn't matter.

2088
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:28,840
Cruella overlay. Yeah. Within the year. Yeah.

2089
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,360
Well, I mean, it's a miracle that GM is stuck with this pavilion

2090
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:35,400
for as long as they have when so many others have like jump ship.

2091
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:37,880
And it has worked

2092
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:40,760
in the way the original like Epcot, you know, it's like, well,

2093
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:43,600
we're going to get sponsors to help cover the cost of these pavilions.

2094
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:46,160
And then they will help us upgrade them every so often.

2095
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:48,360
And GM kind of has.

2096
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:49,840
Well, yeah, it happened.

2097
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:51,120
The thing that never happened.

2098
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:52,880
It happened. They actually put more money in.

2099
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:54,080
That's true.

2100
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:57,360
Mike, you did mention like getting some characters in there.

2101
01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:01,200
And in merchandising, they did get some characters in there.

2102
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:03,760
I'm of course talking about crash test dummy Goofy.

2103
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:07,640
Right. And so this is a more pleasant version of him.

2104
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:10,680
But at one point in time, they were also showing Scott,

2105
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:14,240
because you mentioned it, the eyes

2106
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:18,120
Goofy crash test dummy Goofy with the circular

2107
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:20,160
yellow and black crash test eyes.

2108
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:22,440
Real scary. Really disturbing.

2109
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:25,600
Industrial sticker eyes.

2110
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:26,800
Yeah, is he dead?

2111
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:32,400
He's I did they put those over his eyes because like they were shot out?

2112
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:37,120
This seems like something that came from the twisted mind of Mr. Banksy.

2113
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:40,480
Oh, yeah. Is that from Dismaland?

2114
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:42,160
Is that true?

2115
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:45,760
Theme parks plus like caution tape equals Dismaland.

2116
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,800
Oh, yeah. Wow. Yeah.

2117
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:50,520
That's from the twisted, twisted mind.

2118
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:54,480
I was thinking, Scott, if you had still some of from the Comic-Con installation,

2119
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:58,520
how would you overlay a moonbeam city on to this test?

2120
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:01,680
Oh, boy. Well, that's just I was thinking that's that was my

2121
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:05,080
that was my biggest fuck up with the show is not having a mountain range.

2122
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:06,480
That was like, oh, right.

2123
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:07,560
You leave the city.

2124
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:10,240
It just looks like that just becomes a laser grid.

2125
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:12,960
You could change it to being a cityscape.

2126
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:15,800
Yeah, yeah.

2127
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:17,520
But that cityscape, that's pretty right.

2128
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:21,200
I think I wasn't even aware they were doing this when we were making the show.

2129
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:24,800
Well, we're recording this next to my garage, where I have every element of.

2130
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:26,440
Oh, you saw all of it. Yeah.

2131
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:28,480
OK. I have every every part of it.

2132
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:30,360
No, send that back to me, please.

2133
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:34,800
Thank you. If you don't know what we're talking about at Comic-Con 2014.

2134
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:36,960
There was a Jesus. Yeah.

2135
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:38,200
Yeah. Long time ago.

2136
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:42,960
There was a small laser tag activation of my show, Moonbeam City.

2137
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:47,320
And I got to essentially have a themed experience for two,

2138
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:48,560
wonderful days.

2139
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:51,400
And I have all of it, every bit of black light.

2140
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:54,240
The car we can put it back up.

2141
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:56,640
I what's yeah, no, that's true.

2142
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:59,240
Yeah, we could just do it. Do it for fans.

2143
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:00,280
Well, you know, we talked about it.

2144
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:02,960
I don't know if I'm leaking another idea of mine here, but

2145
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:07,480
eventually doing like some sort of horror, like maze Halloween maze.

2146
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:09,280
But maybe part of it.

2147
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:12,600
You know, this has been a long episode, but there's something I want to say about

2148
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:14,560
that, that element.

2149
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:16,800
I'll bring it in quick at the end here.

2150
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:17,920
Sure, sure.

2151
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:20,040
But yeah, what do you do?

2152
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:21,560
Well, there were, you know, we did have cars.

2153
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:24,320
I forget, you know, dazzled Novak's car.

2154
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:25,720
I forget what it was.

2155
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:31,400
I know that Rad, the Wolf Forte character drove a car called the Girth 150.

2156
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:37,320
So if there was a way it was a car, it was a big hummer that had

2157
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:42,520
I think I was like, it should have not just truck nuts, it's like seven.

2158
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:44,560
And they should be not symmetrical.

2159
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:45,560
They're just like all over.

2160
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:47,120
It's they aren't lined up nicely.

2161
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:50,240
It's kind of like a couple over there and these are too close together.

2162
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:54,800
So, you know, yeah, it'd be a movie city experience if it was a race between

2163
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,840
the Girth 150 and the glitter.

2164
01:47:57,880 --> 01:48:01,400
Is it like the the glitter, the glitter?

2165
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:04,000
I don't even how do I not know this about my own thing?

2166
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:05,600
Glimmer was in it.

2167
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:07,760
God damn, what was it?

2168
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:13,120
But, you know, if it's yeah, you're in Red's Girth 150 and that's great.

2169
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:16,520
That's what could have happened if the show ran for 10 years and was

2170
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:21,440
Disney purchased Viacom, which they would have, I think, to get after that sweet

2171
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:24,400
movie city property so that they could do this overlay.

2172
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,400
Sure. Yeah, would have been a whole other world.

2173
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:28,080
Right. So, wow.

2174
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:34,440
So I do. Yeah. Hey, look, it it has an aesthetic that I really, really love.

2175
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:37,600
And it is a step towards.

2176
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:39,920
It's the thing we talk about with Tomorrowland all the time.

2177
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:41,600
Lasers are always the future.

2178
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:43,280
Neon is always the future.

2179
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:44,440
Don't overthink it.

2180
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:46,800
They figured out with the Tron coaster and with this.

2181
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:50,040
And there's it's kind of a lazy iteration of it in some regards.

2182
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:53,440
But like more aesthetically pleasing than it was.

2183
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:55,200
I do miss Bill McKim.

2184
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:57,640
If there was like a hologram of Bill McKim

2185
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:01,800
or if you had to rescue Bill McKim in a Tron type fashion,

2186
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:03,800
he's stuck in the Sim track.

2187
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:05,560
I would like that.

2188
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:06,800
Yeah, I think there's a way.

2189
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:11,160
I think there's some sort of overlay, actually, that takes this thing to another level.

2190
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:14,200
I do think that I'm I don't I know it's controversial.

2191
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:15,840
Mission space. Bye bye.

2192
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:18,120
As far as I'm concerned, get rid of it.

2193
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:21,240
And I've seen some people really reject that ideally.

2194
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:23,680
But no, I don't don't like it. I do not like it.

2195
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:25,080
But you have a test track.

2196
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:27,200
I feel like there's something to do. You can do something with it.

2197
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:29,040
I think you have one more.

2198
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:29,960
I think there's one more.

2199
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:31,400
There's like a final form.

2200
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:33,320
You make them squeal a little less.

2201
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:36,560
Yeah, maybe it involves some changing of the track outside.

2202
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:38,360
And it's adding some things.

2203
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:39,880
Robo, I don't know, something to outside.

2204
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:42,480
But I bet there's something final form for test track

2205
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:45,080
that could take it to the level I'm looking for.

2206
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:48,520
I'm sure Sean Legacy had been a big hit.

2207
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:50,760
They may have tried like going.

2208
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:51,800
Yeah, maybe.

2209
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:55,280
But they also have the limitation of like, well, GM wants to

2210
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:57,400
Chevrolet wants to show off their nice.

2211
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:59,880
Well, that's true. Maybe you got to kick Chevrolet.

2212
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:00,840
Maybe you got to kick them out.

2213
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:02,040
Maybe you have no sponsor.

2214
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:03,840
Take it purely into the realm of fantasy.

2215
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,960
Can you just put the cars in there? Is that OK?

2216
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:07,440
Maybe put the cars in.

2217
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:08,600
I've got so well.

2218
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:09,800
I don't know.

2219
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:12,840
It's all of their it's like the future of cars world.

2220
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:15,480
It's like all of their Jetsons.

2221
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:17,480
You know, it's Mater 5000.

2222
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:19,760
Oh, yes. But he looks like shit still.

2223
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:23,040
But like chrome that now he's rusty chrome.

2224
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:24,280
OK, that's good. Yeah.

2225
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:27,040
And he's got like some like future sunglasses on.

2226
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:28,480
Mm hmm. Yeah.

2227
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:30,000
Like the cars.

2228
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,320
Lightning McQueen, the 12th.

2229
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:35,320
It's all of their ancestors.

2230
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:37,640
Laser laser McQueen.

2231
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:39,920
Kachil future.

2232
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,400
You would have to say something similar, but like futurey.

2233
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:46,760
Kachowatron. Kachowatron.

2234
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:49,000
Yeah. So that's yes.

2235
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,600
You're right. The cars is the answer.

2236
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:52,720
Yeah. Just put the cars on cars.

2237
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:54,800
Cars 5000 cars.

2238
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:56,960
Five thousand. Like that's oh, that's cool.

2239
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:58,560
It's like kind of the future of cars.

2240
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,760
Wow. That's neat.

2241
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:01,960
Yeah. And it's just it's the exact same track.

2242
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:03,040
You don't even do anything to it.

2243
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:06,680
It's just full of animatronic cars wearing future sunglasses

2244
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:10,480
and like future, like a silver jumpsuit stuff.

2245
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:13,520
Like they're all wearing like all the same models.

2246
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:14,840
Yeah, exactly.

2247
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:18,120
Slow down. You're not cyber racing yet.

2248
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:20,840
Yeah. Perfect. Perfect.

2249
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:22,720
This is easy. This is drag and drop.

2250
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:25,080
That's done in an hour.

2251
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,440
Yeah. And then they're playing tequila when they're souping you up.

2252
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:31,080
But it's like got a beat.

2253
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:34,640
It's like a techno version or what another not playing tequila.

2254
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:35,560
They're playing. What are they playing?

2255
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:36,760
What song am I thinking of?

2256
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:38,200
They're playing the wars.

2257
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:39,160
It's a.

2258
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:44,000
Oh, low rider. Low rider.

2259
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,920
Sorry. Why did I think it was tequila?

2260
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:49,080
Do not. That's too fun.

2261
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:50,440
That's not the right song.

2262
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:52,400
Yeah, it's low rider.

2263
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:53,600
Yeah. Laser rider.

2264
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:58,200
It's it's yeah. Just replace that with pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

2265
01:51:58,200 --> 01:51:59,640
It's laser sounds.

2266
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:00,640
Yeah. Perfect. All right.

2267
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:01,640
Yeah, it's done.

2268
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:04,000
Throw the cars in there. It's the future of the cars.

2269
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:05,880
I think we cracked it.

2270
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:08,160
Yeah, you're right. Survive podcast, the ride is correct.

2271
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:09,880
Test track edition.

2272
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:12,640
And just before the plugs, what you just said about,

2273
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:16,000
I think us doing some sort of themed activation.

2274
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:18,480
I do feel inspired.

2275
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:21,840
I feel like the game has been upped by something that I just came from this weekend.

2276
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:23,360
I came out to keep this quick.

2277
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:25,240
I came from the event Bug Con.

2278
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:29,080
If you know Bug Main, if you know Bugsy, the gangster,

2279
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:33,240
imagine an event where you could swim in the aesthetics of Bug Main

2280
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:38,320
and Bugsy, if you the people out there, however you feel about Bugsy on our show,

2281
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:42,720
imagine just like living in Bugsy for two straight days.

2282
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:43,720
And that's what this is.

2283
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:46,560
There are some listeners, I think, who went to who went to Bug Con

2284
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,120
and who I met at Bug Con.

2285
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:50,520
There was an experience that was there briefly and I tweeted about it.

2286
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:53,520
It was called the Tomorrow War Operation Rescue.

2287
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:58,240
And it this was everything you want out of a themed experience.

2288
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:00,680
It expanded the world of the film.

2289
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:05,880
It imagined a scenario where Cohen, the character played by Mike Mitchell,

2290
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:11,200
has guessed the show, where he his spoiler alert.

2291
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:12,800
Things don't work out so well for Cohen.

2292
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:17,080
But in the attraction Operation Rescue, what if it went a little differently?

2293
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:21,560
And what if after you yourself do battle with the white spikes,

2294
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:24,520
you have to face the white spikes with laser guns

2295
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:30,240
and then you round you round a corner and there is Cowan himself.

2296
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:32,200
And I'm still not even sure how they did this.

2297
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:34,200
Was it an animatronic?

2298
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:36,880
Was it a very realistic wax figure whose mouth moved?

2299
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:42,360
Was it Mitch being made to humiliate himself for three straight hours

2300
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:46,200
and stand and act like a robot over and over again?

2301
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:48,040
As group after group went by?

2302
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:49,280
It's hard to say.

2303
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:50,640
But I feel like I got to it.

2304
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:54,080
I witnessed a very spirited themed attraction.

2305
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:56,680
I couldn't believe how well they pulled it.

2306
01:53:56,680 --> 01:53:58,440
It was like it was so scrabby.

2307
01:53:58,440 --> 01:54:00,880
It didn't even come together in the morning.

2308
01:54:01,120 --> 01:54:03,720
And then and then by two, it was thrilling.

2309
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:07,800
Everyone people were making the jump to the future to 2050 Miami.

2310
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:11,240
And it was the hit of BugCon.

2311
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:14,760
And it made me think maybe there is some PTR themed attraction.

2312
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:17,120
Maybe it's not outside of the realm of possibility.

2313
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:19,480
Yes, I think we could do if they could do it.

2314
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:23,360
I think credit to I believe Jack Allison and Charles Ingram pulled this together.

2315
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:26,640
True imagine aspiring imagineers.

2316
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:29,520
They should send a video to Imagineering, get hired.

2317
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:30,800
But that's great.

2318
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:32,880
This was very quality.

2319
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:34,240
So I'm so amped from that.

2320
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:36,760
And I want to say one more thing, because I have this right here.

2321
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:41,240
I met some listeners to the show and I think I think I'm going to fuck up their names.

2322
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:44,000
I know one is Kyler and the other is is it Emmy?

2323
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,080
Is it Ellie? Is it Effie?

2324
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:47,360
It's a name like that.

2325
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:48,800
And I might not have gotten it still.

2326
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:49,800
And I'm so sorry.

2327
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:55,560
And I owe you better than that because I got the best listener gift that I've ever received.

2328
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:58,440
And this is not anything that I expect from the audience of the show.

2329
01:54:58,440 --> 01:55:00,840
The audience is great. You don't need to bring us things.

2330
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:04,280
But I couldn't not mention it even in a long episode.

2331
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:07,560
Gentlemen, look what is in my possession now.

2332
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:12,960
And I go, wait, this is a by your computer with light lighted up.

2333
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:14,640
Up a little boy. Do you recognize it?

2334
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:17,320
Oh, I do. The Peach Boys.

2335
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:19,360
This is a sign that says the Peach Boys.

2336
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:26,640
And from the aforementioned, the fries experience that I talked about in this episode a long time ago,

2337
01:55:26,640 --> 01:55:33,800
I talked about fries electronics and now they had a smoothie stand with only two themed options for their smoothies.

2338
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:35,960
And one of them is the Peach Boys.

2339
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:40,520
So I have the like the slat from the Sacramento fries.

2340
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:42,000
This was really there.

2341
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,480
This is from fries in Sacramento.

2342
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:48,480
They went to like a liquidation thing and got this.

2343
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:52,880
And I think there was another smoothie that they were fond of and they got their tab.

2344
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:54,400
And then they said, you know what?

2345
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:57,840
We should bring this one, the Peach Boys back to Scott Gardner.

2346
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:59,480
If we ever run into Scott Gardner.

2347
01:55:59,480 --> 01:56:01,680
And they did. They did it at BugCon.

2348
01:56:01,680 --> 01:56:03,480
I was so moved.

2349
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:09,600
And the best part, it is actually a magnet so I can put this up on my fridge as I have.

2350
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:13,600
They also got me a Charlie Chip Pin, the famous mascot of fries electronics.

2351
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:17,760
I mean, this has given me such joy.

2352
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:21,680
Every time I've seen it, I've only been with it for not even 48 hours.

2353
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:27,400
I'm still getting used to being with the Peach Boys, the Sacramento smoothie sign.

2354
01:56:27,400 --> 01:56:28,840
So thank you guys so much.

2355
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:30,800
I'm sorry I fucked up your names.

2356
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:32,200
Yeah, so thrilled.

2357
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:33,360
Thank you guys so much.

2358
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:34,400
That's great.

2359
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:35,960
So all right.

2360
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:37,360
All that is a little postscript.

2361
