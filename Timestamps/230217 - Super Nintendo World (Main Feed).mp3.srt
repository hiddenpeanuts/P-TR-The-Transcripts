1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Forever... dog.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Warning! The following podcast features three shy guys who one-up each other with takes as hot as fire flowers.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
They may tell jokes that ba-bomb and provoke a big boo.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The boys go into battle mode against cacophonous coin sounds, time-sensitive toy orders, and food guards.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's-a-go to Super Nintendo World on Podcast the Ride!

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a podcast hosted by three very good boys who think that all that stuff with Yoshi and

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
his big tongue is a little body.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We don't like that, we don't go in for that.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's-a-me, Scotty-o, joined by Mikey-o, Wa-mikey, I would like to be referred to.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Wa-mikey, I will make the adjustment.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And yes, I want every parent to make sure to put their little finger out and say to their child,

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
no tongues, please, keep those tongues in the mouth, okay?

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Because that's where ideas form.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:45,000
People want to be like their heroes, they start imitate, and suddenly, you know, Universal, I think, has platformed somebody who does tongue antics, and we don't go in on that.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's ask somebody about tongue antics right now.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Well, let me give him his special Mario introduction.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Of course, real life toad Jason Sheridan.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh, yeah.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I was sitting dead still in a chair, and somehow I still walked right into that.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Toad is a beloved character.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah, I know.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I think that's a good thing, too.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh, sure.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah, I love Toad.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He's plucky.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Uh-huh.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You get a sense of him a little bit in the land, in the restaurant.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I don't think I knew much about his personality or his desire to cook.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He loves to cook.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now we've eaten Toad's food.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We get to see another side of him, that of line cook.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We get to see Toad excerpt from the bear.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Oh, well, isn't that the, what's the thing?

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's already been so long.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's Chef.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's the show you want to see is the Toadstool Cafe version.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yeah.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
With all, that's nothing but Toads.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You can only tell them apart by what color spots they have.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes, Chef.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Absolutely, Chef.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So today is, this is a big one.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Hey, look, we're doing nonsense over on the second gate.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's still Dick Tracy and whatever.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But here on the main feed, we are, it's hit after hit.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's big rides.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Runaway Railway one week and now Super Nintendo World.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh, my gosh.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Long awaited, long in the works.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
From a glaring slam to a foul ball, huh, fellas?

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh, wow.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, my God.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That's Super Nintendo.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And you're declaring as a episode of foul ball.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm going to try to be very fair and even handed in the episode.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But before that, just to start, Super Mid-Rail Brothers.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh, wow.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And mid, you've told me about that.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's a young person insult.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's one of those young person insults that he used.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No, it's not that bad, but it sometimes gets that bad.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Well, if Universal is checking just the very top of the podcast to see if we get to still be invited to stuff.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Jason really screwed us here.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's what you wait for 10 minutes in after they have stopped listening.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Four minutes in.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You front load it, Jason.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Front load it.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You say all the good stuff first.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Let's not let Jason record the warning this week because he'll say warning.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We're talking about something mid today.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Someone in super mid.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Gee whiz.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Well, Toad wouldn't have done that.

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't know.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He's pretty sassy.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He is sassy.

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Hey, so I mean, it's a big one.

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This has been building and growing since before the podcast started.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I was trying to remember just the arc of the Nintendo Universal partnership, which they announced in 2015.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's before we were doing this even.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It has been up and running in Universal Studios Japan since late 2020, early 2021.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I think they've been it's been a hurricane of stops and starts due to COVID.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But, you know, pretty heavily hyped up there and people have been liking it there.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's coming to Singapore.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I didn't know that.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Where I don't know a lot about Universal Singapore.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And it doesn't feel that likely that we'll make it there.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So it makes me wonder if we should get in.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
If people want to, if we, you know, we might not go in person, but do you want to hear our takes on that?

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I want to hear our takes on especially I was wondering, now that this ride is gone, I've watched a ride through this.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But this is what's gone due to Nintendo.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
They took out the ride Madagascar, a crate adventure.

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh, wow. Really?

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
A crate. It's a crate adventure.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What kind of a ride was it?

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Well, I mean, a crate adventure, first off.

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But besides that, in terms of the vehicle you're on, is I assume a big crate, unless it's the famous Madagascar animals like King Julian.

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And don't ask me to name any more who are in big crates.

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't know much about it, but maybe we have to do it.

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Sure. Is that the one with the new?

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No, what's the one with the cool Jurassic Park ride?

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Is that China, I think Beijing with the rapids?

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I think it's Beijing. No, no, no.

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah, it's like kind of a transformer vehicle.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But then there's also big animatronics, like there's a crazy giant T-Rex animatronic that chases you.

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah. On the ride that looks insane.

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah, that looks great.

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
There's another one that is kind of a river adventure, but it's not a shoot to shoot.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's a rapids ride.

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Right, right.

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So, sure.

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So, hey, we'll look into that.

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But then, of course, come into Epic Universe as well in 2025.

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,000
This is suddenly a crown jewel of the Universal Empire, beating even Waterworld,

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
beating the Fry's Electronics cars from NOPE, beating the Lucille Ball meet and greet.

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I know. Where is she? Where does she go now?

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
She's been outshined by Princess Peach.

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I haven't seen her.

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's why Jason's upset.

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Well, outshined by Hello Kitty.

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I mean, I've made my peace with Hello Kitty.

126
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
She's a lot of fun.

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
She's got lots of outfits.

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Oh, I like seeing that.

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Got a great attitude.

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
When you walk in, because Hello Kitty's kind of right at the front of the park.

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So that's one of the first things you see.

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, she's got her own area.

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
She's got a nice, like, wrought iron sign.

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Mm-hmm.

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Wrought iron?

136
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's like wrought iron with, like, the logo on top of it.

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I guess it is.

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's funny.

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's such an industrial way to describe it.

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
She's got a chain link fence surrounding her.

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Not like an old fashioned kind of fence.

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I know what you're saying.

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I just haven't heard that term.

144
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
She's in her Sunset Boulevard days.

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
She's aging and paranoid and doesn't know the world doesn't love her anymore.

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Sunset Boulevard with Hello Kitty.

147
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I mean, that's pretty good.

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's pretty funny.

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Mm-hmm.

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
With an audience of one, like me.

151
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You and Donald Trump.

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Me and Donald, yeah.

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
World's biggest Sunset Boulevard fan.

154
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Oh, yes.

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah, that's come out.

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That's documented pretty well.

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Norman Desmond is no longer hot.

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He loves it.

159
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
If he liked the sketch, he just wouldn't like the Hello Kitty.

160
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But he's never seen Hello Kitty in his life.

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yeah.

162
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That's for wimps.

163
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Hello Kitty.

164
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But it just showed up here.

165
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It is newly open.

166
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Is it open to the public as people are hearing this in the Eversole?

167
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah, today it is.

168
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Today it is.

169
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah, today it is officially open, yes.

170
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Wow, wow.

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So the dance of the cold opens and the technical rehearsals and the annual pass holder previews.

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You know, I'm a little upset that we're, I wish that we'd gotten the heads up about this,

173
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
that the big opening ceremony is live streaming.

174
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I saw it in an email essentially on the way here.

175
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's at 8 p.m.

176
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And we're going to be done by then.

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Or we sync right up.

178
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We just patch right into it.

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't know.

180
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Maybe.

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But, you know, I love dumb theme park opening ceremonies.

182
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah.

183
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And we don't get to see this one.

184
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I don't know what the non-charismatic Universal Executive is going to speak.

185
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I don't know what stiff fireworks display will have that weird lag where there's the cue,

186
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
but people can't hear the cue right, so the fireworks are seven seconds late.

187
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I hope Mario's dad, Shigeru Miyamoto, is there.

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's my, like, he's such a fun Stan Lee type personality.

189
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And that would be just him being there.

190
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He doesn't have to say anything.

191
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't know that he speaks English.

192
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't think he does.

193
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But just him being there would be fun, at least, after a speech of somebody who resembles Frank Marshall.

194
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Like, it doesn't have to be a Frank Marshall type, but somebody who looks like him.

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah.

196
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Speaks, says something unmemorable.

197
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Well, that would be different from the last time there was a Frank Marshall event where he did not speak.

198
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Right.

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So that would actually be not in keeping.

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
A little different, yeah.

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So he didn't speak at the premiere of the ride based on the movie he produced, but he is going, or someone like him is going to speak.

202
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I did say someone like him, so yeah.

203
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Marshall-esque.

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes.

205
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Hopefully.

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Fingers crossed.

207
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah.

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But it's open.

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's up and running.

210
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's up and running.

211
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We've been watching the construction, literally watching the construction for some time because you can see it from the starway.

212
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You can't avoid it.

213
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You're descending down into it.

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Unlike Galaxy's Edge Ride forced people to watch the construction of it over many years by going to the top of the Mickey and Friends parking structure, this you can't avoid.

215
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
As long as you're going down those escalators, you're seeing it.

216
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Uh-huh.

217
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And you are to go to Transformers, the finest ride ever made.

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah, I raced to Transformers.

219
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I slide down the banister the whole way down to get to Transformers.

220
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yeah, well after many attempts at asking, can you make the starway speed up?

221
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Is there any, like, this is snail pace.

222
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This is unacceptable.

223
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yeah.

224
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So it's going.

225
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
They cratered the sound stages in order to make this happen.

226
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I was trying to remember the entire procedure.

227
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And this is the only hope we have for New Universal Stuff.

228
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Not the only hope, but it's one of the only moves they have, I feel, is to keep blowing up sound stages.

229
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Oh, yeah.

230
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
They built some on top of what used to be like the Superstore store.

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
They built some on the other end of the lot.

232
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Oh, right.

233
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
They built new stages, which I say crater those already.

234
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Blow them up.

235
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Start expanding the theme park more.

236
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That way? That direction?

237
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah.

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The 2028 Olympics are already going to decimate this city in terms of pleasantness and traffic and guests.

240
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Uh-huh.

241
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The Olympics bring chaos and shit wherever they go.

242
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Uh-huh.

243
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Wait, so you're saying we need more theme park space to make up for that?

244
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Oh, I wasn't even saying that.

245
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I was just saying.

246
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You're just saying something different.

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:39,000
A lot of their mailers and stuff are like, oh, and we're building extra sound stages for coverage for our media and the world's media.

248
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
For those Olympics that it's still questionable whether going to happen.

249
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It feels like there's always another graph news story about some shady LA weirdo.

250
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So you're saying destroy them now?

251
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yeah, destroy them now.

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Stop building those stages.

253
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Start building.

254
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yeah.

255
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Stop building stages.

256
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Don't even put anything there.

257
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Just stop building.

258
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
All right, got it.

259
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yeah, you film all your TV and movies on green screens in the New York streets anyway.

260
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's the stuff you need.

261
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So keep the New York streets, but demolish most sound stages.

262
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Oh, keep the New York streets.

263
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Okay.

264
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah, keep these warehouses.

265
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You are just the controversy that you're starting on this podcast.

266
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I guess so.

267
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
No Olympics coverage.

268
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We don't want you.

269
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Get your crews out of here.

270
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
No jobs no longer available.

271
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
That's what fuels this podcast is healthy debate.

272
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Big definitive viewpoints.

273
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And strong takes every minute or so.

274
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I think sometimes the issue is we'll meander before getting to a tip.

275
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
We should be firing them off.

276
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We need to get in.

277
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's how like 10 years in we'll know when there is a take twice a minute.

278
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah.

279
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's what we got to get to.

280
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Sure.

281
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
We're building to it.

282
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And we renamed the show The Firing Range.

283
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
There needs to be some podcast about theme parks that's more like cable news.

284
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

285
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah.

286
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Well, the first theme park podcast distributed by Fox Nation.

287
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yeah, finally.

288
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Finally.

289
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You know, we have video versions now.

290
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
One is happening currently.

291
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You can watch this one on YouTube.

292
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And we're in our little windows.

293
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And I like that.

294
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But what we don't have is the list.

295
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
There's not like a rundown.

296
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Right.

297
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Which I think would help people, you know, and it would help.

298
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You know, these things go for 90 minutes or more.

299
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
This is the way to get the podcast to seven.

300
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah.

301
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yeah, just like at next Olympics.

302
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Hey, I'm bad.

303
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Mario Land mid next.

304
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Coke Starlight.

305
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Perfect.

306
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Perfect.

307
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
No, no.

308
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Haven't tried the new one.

309
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
There's a third one in the line.

310
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
There's a Pepsi that has Peeps flavor now that I tried.

311
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I think you were.

312
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Were you drinking that on Zoom the other day?

313
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I was on our episode or Dick Tracy Patreon episode.

314
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I knew I was drinking Peeps Pepsi and Jason knew he had a little smile on his face.

315
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And I knew he noticed.

316
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And I know because we had a lot of Dick Tracy to talk about that he was being polite and didn't say it because it would have derailed the whole thing because we had limited amount of time.

317
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But every time I sipped, I tried to sip so the label was off camera on a zoom.

318
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And I would look down and Jason's little box and I would see like a little smile because I knew you were cheating it off.

319
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He knew he knew what was going on.

320
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And he knew because of text or he knew because he recognized the periphery of the Peeps Pepsi.

321
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Well, you bought it.

322
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I sent him a text with minutes later, clearly texted me to show me the label.

323
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah, well, I got the same day.

324
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I think it was the day before I had sent you a picture of the bottle.

325
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And then a day later, I think.

326
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
How is it?

327
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's not as good as Coke Starlight, but I like it.

328
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But don't drink the whole thing.

329
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Split it.

330
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah, it's a little novelty.

331
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
But so to move it to my scale, it's not as good as the thing that is shitty.

332
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You had the zero sugar.

333
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
We got you the zero.

334
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You would like the other one.

335
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But we're zero sugar boys.

336
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You know, I don't.

337
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But what I have?

338
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I don't know.

339
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I mean, I hate this.

340
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I hate the diet.

341
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I hate this.

342
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
This is pertain, whatever.

343
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's true.

344
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm drinking ice tea right now.

345
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You'd be OK with just a yes, I have those all the time.

346
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But there's no I'm sorry.

347
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
There's no comical.

348
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You didn't grind up any Sour Patch Kids into that.

349
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
There's no Sour Patch Kids.

350
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
There's no sprinkles.

351
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You can put a bunch of Starbucks will let you put a bunch of like like thick sugar strawberries

352
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
in any drink.

353
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Have you ever done that?

354
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
No, I knew it was an option in a black coffee.

355
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I believe you can.

356
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Maybe not a black coffee, but almost everything I've seen has the option to put just a bunch

357
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
of sweet strawberries as if they're from a Sunday or something.

358
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Here's a question.

359
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Are you more likely to get your strawberries mixed up into your black coffee if you order

360
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
via the app and then it's just like, well, fill in orders or do you need to do it in

361
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
person and make an emotional plea?

362
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Well, if it's an option, most what mobile ordering has done for me in general with fast

363
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,000
food and with like Starbucks has erased the shame of special ordering things because

364
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
somebody can't scoff at your request, which it might be ridiculous.

365
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So I would almost never do a ridiculous request in person.

366
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah, almost never.

367
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I would probably do here and there, but no, I don't think I would ever ask for strawberries

368
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and black coffee in person, but I will like a coward requested on the app.

369
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm curious.

370
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I can see if it works.

371
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Listener, if you feel like trying it, you know what?

372
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And I think I know the star system is changing right now.

373
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
We're in flux currently.

374
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But if you've got stars, you don't spend money on it.

375
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But if you want to burn stars on seeing if they'll put a bunch of strawberries in your

376
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
black coffee, let us know.

377
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Tag us.

378
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Let us know.

379
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Or maybe we discover a great drink that way.

380
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Oddly, it's what unlocks the full possibilities of Starbucks.

381
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Right.

382
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yeah, we will see.

383
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Trying it right now.

384
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
We keep people Google.

385
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Right.

386
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Wait, are you going to leave and go to a star?

387
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
No, I'm not going to go get it.

388
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Are you going to get delivery?

389
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah, I'll do.

390
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'll have a delivery.

391
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Just go through some doors and then go through other doors.

392
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Ignore the light that says recording right now.

393
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You are welcome in.

394
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You the driver with the strawberry coffee.

395
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
All right, I'll figure it out.

396
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You can add a lot of stuff, though.

397
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
A lot of options.

398
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
OK, so they've been building this forever.

399
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
As far as Universal is concerned, it is a massive footprint.

400
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
They have like they're shifting everything.

401
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Like all their sound stages were over here.

402
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Now they're over here.

403
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
We're changing everything to get Mario in there.

404
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And now it's up and running.

405
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I think right away it was I think a concern that we had.

406
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And I think a little bit confirmed is it is still a little small.

407
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It is still a little small.

408
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Even though they had to blow up a massive chunk of space bar.

409
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So OK, here's what I'll say.

410
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm not I'm not trying to erase this thing of what Jason said.

411
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This is how I feel.

412
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So I think they were going for the like the craziest best realization of a cartoon world in a theme park outside as a land.

413
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I think would you agree that it's by far of any like Toontown or like the Little Mermaid area of Tokyo Disney Sea.

414
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:25,000
There is nothing that beats this as far as taking what's an animated land and showing it to you on a scope and scale you've never seen before.

415
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It looks amazing.

416
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Unbelieveable.

417
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It looks amazing.

418
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Right.

419
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Until you put some people in there.

420
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Well, that's yes.

421
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Hold on.

422
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That's that's certainly we'll get there.

423
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:44,000
But I like when they were deciding how to do it like Galaxy's Edge is so big and obviously it has different parts and there's different moods.

424
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But you can't maintain the level of like detail and something like with Nintendo in that size.

425
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I don't think I think the budget would like quadruple.

426
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It was a much bigger footprint.

427
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yeah.

428
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The energy use alone for like the the camera brother the Goomba bouncing back and forth every day.

429
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Uh huh.

430
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Uh huh.

431
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah.

432
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You would get pretty exhausted if there was five times more of that.

433
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So everywhere.

434
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
That's a very good point.

435
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So yeah.

436
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So it's so yeah.

437
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
As soon as we were there I was like oh this feels like the crazy.

438
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I've never been in a place that more realized my kid dream of being inside the cartoon or the video game.

439
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's never happened.

440
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Like there's never been a time like maybe if I went to Toontown as a kid but Toontown in your mind has shit like planes are crashing and there's silly stuff going on and it can't quite realize.

441
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That's a good point.

442
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It never quite realized running around.

443
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Right.

444
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And if somehow you're listening to this and you haven't seen pictures or video the main I feel like the main thing about it is just every character every villain going back and forth.

445
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
There's coin spinning.

446
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yes.

447
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Thwomps thwomping.

448
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,000
A plus as far as like giving you even the feeling of immediately you have the feeling of the Mario game.

449
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's not a specific Mario game.

450
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's got a lot of elements from different Mario games.

451
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's kind of got the same sort of when then some of the 3D Mario games where you start a level and you look up and there's some sort of big thing you sort of have to climb and finish or complete and it looks like a very daunting task but also fun.

452
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It does all of this is all a plus like there's no better other than maybe Diagon Alley which I don't have an emotional connection to but think it's an amazing looking place.

453
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Sure.

454
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Nothing is nothing can beat this view being there in person.

455
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

456
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Yeah, absolutely.

457
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:47,000
A huge moment I think and a moment I think any listener will have when you when you go in person.

458
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
The moment of going through that pipe, which when you enter the pipe.

459
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's just a little like outdoor lobby right well you're yes as Super Nintendo World and it's still kind of playing and you're still next to like whatever boring restaurant and the Transformers ride photo op.

460
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Yeah, you can do and there's a spot for there to hold your phone you know.

461
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Uh huh.

462
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And then you go through the pipe with like wonderful swirling LED lights of every color.

463
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I love that they had to answer what's in a pipe.

464
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Yes.

465
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I know that was something in Japan and there I think I think it's different types of light.

466
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That's more like white streaks but here it's a multicolored thing and it looks very cool and you go through that pipe and then you land looking up at is it Mount Beanpole.

467
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yes.

468
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And just taking in the whole land in general.

469
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yes.

470
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Can I walk you back?

471
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Yeah, absolutely.

472
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Because you go in and you basically end up in like Princess's Castle from Mario 64.

473
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Which if you've played Mario 64 when you go into the castle there's these big pictures on the wall which is where you go through to different levels.

474
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Oh, okay.

475
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So when you end up outside the pipe you end up in like a little that little like foyer area which is basically like the castle there which is the big photos of like the bomb-ombs and some I forget.

476
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Do they change?

477
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
They change as well.

478
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Yeah, yeah.

479
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So it's like you're already like in the game there and then you leave the castle part.

480
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yes.

481
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And see what you're talking about.

482
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
That's a good point.

483
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I skipped past the yeah yeah.

484
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The little castle zone is very neat.

485
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But just how the how great a job they do at funneling that view and hiding as much as they can.

486
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I know you see it on the escalator down.

487
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yeah.

488
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But being immersed in it that it's pretty much that moment when you step out of the castle and it's huge.

489
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I think the people like the employees there are just going to see awe at that moment.

490
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Yes.

491
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
All day every day.

492
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's I think an instantly great theme park aesthetic moment, a big wow moment that I think will last for first time visitors for us.

493
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And in terms of like I would say visual wow has never been the appeal for Universal Studios.

494
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Right.

495
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
In general.

496
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Until Harry Potter.

497
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Until Harry Potter.

498
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yeah, yeah.

499
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And in Hollywood specifically where there's a lot of fun things but it's usually like sound stages, functional buildings.

500
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
There's not a lot of height.

501
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You know what I mean?

502
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Like maybe Universal wide besides Islands of Adventure.

503
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Universal is wide, not tall.

504
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yeah.

505
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
In general.

506
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
That's a good way to put it.

507
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Now they're tall.

508
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
We're getting tall.

509
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Harry Potter tall.

510
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Castle tall.

511
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Right.

512
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Mount Beanpole tall.

513
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Yeah.

514
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's very exciting.

515
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yes.

516
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Now to both of your points, once you're there it is a little bit like being at like one of those bars where they don't have like tables and seats.

517
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's all high like a high table.

518
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And you're all just like where am I supposed to stand?

519
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's kind of crowded in here.

520
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I just kind of want to stand at the I want to kind of sit down.

521
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Can I sit down?

522
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Oh, okay.

523
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'll lean against this table I guess.

524
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Yeah.

525
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And it's like it's really.

526
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It doesn't feel right.

527
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Like is this okay?

528
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Am I allowed to be here?

529
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Right.

530
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It's like almost like you should it's almost like the land should just be this crazy walkthrough attraction.

531
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You just walk through.

532
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Now we should also say this is these are the first you know so many days of this being open.

533
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah.

534
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's still rehearsals.

535
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It certainly makes it more crowded and people aren't used to it.

536
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Absolutely.

537
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And the crowd flow and.

538
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I think these annual we went to Mike and I went together with Aaron and our friend Andrew Gissam Jason went with Jane a few days prior I believe.

539
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Yeah.

540
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And it was these annual pass holder preview events which I think they had a lot of work to do.

541
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
This isn't this isn't the kind of thing Universal's done a lot.

542
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Disney I think has done a lot.

543
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
And they still end up kind of like crowded and annoying.

544
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Yeah.

545
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I believe the first day of it was so crazy that they like apologized and sent an email to everyone and said come back.

546
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
We'd like to offer you another chance to check which to their credit.

547
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Sure.

548
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Good to do.

549
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yeah.

550
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But it just shows you like because we saw videos I think Julia Prescott it seemed like just Bales didn't go in.

551
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Yeah.

552
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Yeah.

553
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So it seemed crazy.

554
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:11,000
They I know when we were there checking in I think they had already added there was like two slots where you could go in the morning or in the afternoon and they had added a third slot.

555
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
So they basically were like shouting at people like if you want to go to the third one.

556
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Oh yeah.

557
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Oh it was like you could have changed being willing to move to a different.

558
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
That's right.

559
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Yeah.

560
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Yeah.

561
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
They were doing airport maneuver.

562
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
We've overbooked the Mari that Mario land.

563
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
We will give you if anyone's willing to go at a later time we will give you 500 coins if anyone.

564
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Did you guys let me ask when you picked up your wristbands for these previews did you do it in that sort of little park area across from the security entrance or did you do it inside the park.

565
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
No it was outside the park.

566
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It was the weird unthemed grass next to that was the saddle ranch and.

567
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Okay.

568
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And bomb pumpers.

569
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Okay.

570
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I meant to take a picture because I we looked at we went in the first group of the day and after seeing Julia's lines footage I was like what time we get there early and I thought the park open at night it actually open at 10 so we got there at 930 and they're already

571
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:22,000
giving them out and letting people in the park which this all worked out for us because they're like well your time's at 11 but the park opens at 10 and the land opens at 10 so you can just go down there.

572
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Okay.

573
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:42,000
But the the picture like the visual picture of walking in to get the wristbands and there was just like dozens and dozens of metal stanchion like dozens and dozens of like places for like a million wraparound lines totally empty was so weird and haunting a weird music festival like yeah.

574
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Yeah.

575
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Something or yes they fair yes.

576
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Now we were there early enough I didn't have to wait that we walked right up to the tables.

577
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yeah.

578
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
We didn't have to wait.

579
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Yeah.

580
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It was fun to get on that grass.

581
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah.

582
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It was nice to see that you don't get to see that grass very often.

583
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It's wonderful and what a great addition to a theme park than just an open plot of wonderful relaxing grass.

584
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You should have brought your son for the grass and then taking it back.

585
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Maybe you are not good father because you did not take son to see grass.

586
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You should have taken a photo.

587
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
We should go back and take a photo of the grass and then compare it to Disney's grass on Twitter and see what happens.

588
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Well I did ignite a firestorm.

589
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah.

590
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I might not be here.

591
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I think the grass that would have come to my house and burn my house down.

592
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I think the grass that we waited on was real grass.

593
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I think so.

594
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I think so.

595
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You gotta give it using fake.

596
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You gotta give it points for that.

597
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
But the landscaping is not quite there.

598
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I was noting there were just weird like it just turns into dirt.

599
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Dirt pads.

600
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
There were.

601
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Yeah.

602
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
There was for sure dirt.

603
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Yeah.

604
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Why is this there?

605
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Why did they get rid of Saddle Ranch?

606
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
That is my question.

607
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Yes.

608
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I wonder that too.

609
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I was like why is this just sitting here?

610
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I thought that was going to be toothsome.

611
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
That's what the rumor was for many years it was going to be toothsome.

612
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
There is a rumor too of a Nintendo store.

613
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
That was a rumor too.

614
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
There was doodles.

615
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yes.

616
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Concept art.

617
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So they must have at a certain point thought that they were going to put something there but maybe they felt like there's just they're going to need more infrastructure for the whole.

618
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Like entrance way.

619
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I don't know.

620
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,000
When you said there was doodles I thought was there an announcement of like some themed bar called doodles.

621
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Oh man.

622
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
You know we would have been at doodles opening day.

623
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,000
That reminds me of that clip that goes circulates once in a while where Jack Nicholson says they used to hang out at a coffee shop named Poopies.

624
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You ever seen that?

625
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
No.

626
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You've seen that?

627
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I have seen that.

628
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Did you see the excerpt this week?

629
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Someone found an old interview with him where like you know.

630
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I don't know.

631
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:48,000
He was shooting about Schmidt and rented a house I think in Omaha and they're like the media saw you walking around the house naked.

632
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
He was like it was two in the morning.

633
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I was just going down for my slice of pie and they're like does this happen often?

634
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
He's like well sometimes.

635
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Sometimes it's sherbet you know.

636
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And your heart grew two sizes.

637
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Oh yeah.

638
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
For Jack.

639
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I mean look he already won my affection spilling all that chili on a basketball court.

640
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Well and of course the famous hoagie shot.

641
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
The hoagie oh yeah.

642
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
If you want just Google Jack Nicholson hoagie and you'll see the greatest photo ever taken.

643
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
He's in a boat and we've talked about this with an episode with Marissa Strickland I think.

644
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's because once in a while I'll just texture that photo Jack in the boat with a hoagie.

645
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Isn't the chili fake?

646
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I think that's an onion thing.

647
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I think this was gone through.

648
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Is that fake?

649
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
On double thread on fellow.

650
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I might have fallen for it.

651
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Yeah I believe so.

652
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I believe chili.

653
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
In good combat.

654
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Sharpling I think thought the same thing.

655
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And he really beat himself up I think over being fooled by it.

656
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Feel free to beat yourself up.

657
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Oh that's fine.

658
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I do that enough.

659
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
But the hoagie thing is real.

660
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Yeah the hoagie thing is real.

661
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I'll bet everything.

662
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Don't know about hoagie.

663
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
What happened with the hoagie?

664
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Just Jack Nicholson hoagie.

665
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Look it up and he's in a boat.

666
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Oh we've discussed this before.

667
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And there's a great photo too in that.

668
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It's all like paparazzi photos so it's you know not.

669
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
He didn't want those photos probably.

670
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And which though that I'm talking about.

671
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
But you don't have to do it.

672
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
People will Google it.

673
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
There's a great one though where he's in the water with a cigarette.

674
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Which is really great.

675
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Oh yeah I'm looking at it right now.

676
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Yep.

677
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But anyway.

678
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Living his best life.

679
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I would like to see Wario doing all of the same things.

680
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Wario should smoke cigarettes.

681
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
That would be a bold move.

682
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Yes.

683
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Spray it back.

684
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
We are so moralist about this in the Disney universe.

685
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
But I don't know if Universal is weighed in.

686
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
No.

687
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It's time.

688
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Look he's not in the land yet that I saw.

689
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Not prominently.

690
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Maybe there's Easter eggs or something.

691
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
My man is not in the land.

692
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
That is one of my gripes.

693
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
That's my guy Wario.

694
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:00,000
But if you introduce him in the land with a pack of what you could call him like Koopa blues.

695
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Like Camo blues.

696
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You know.

697
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Oh right.

698
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Cigarettes.

699
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And then sell them.

700
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And then sell cigarettes.

701
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And then sell cigarettes.

702
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Look sell cigarettes okay.

703
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You're trying to get one up on Nintendo.

704
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Look it's all about you know we're trying to feed people into these power bands and

705
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
whatever.

706
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You don't even have to check IDs.

707
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
You punch the ID info into this power band you know.

708
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And then all your coins go straight to cigarettes.

709
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
That's right.

710
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Yep.

711
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
The picture is awesome.

712
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I'm not going to do that but that's cool.

713
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Standing out on a sandbar smoking a parliament you know.

714
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
They I've complained before on the show about the toy the Krusty the Clown toy that Disney

715
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
pulled the cigarette from him.

716
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
This one I think is an actual five timer.

717
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I think this I think you are.

718
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I think I did the five times in like two weeks.

719
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Yeah there was an intense run where cigarettes.

720
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
But it's been I haven't said it in three months.

721
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
We've had a break.

722
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Yes it's been a nice break.

723
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,000
But what I'll say this is a Viacom let my Ninja Turtle ace duck have a big cigar which

724
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
is great.

725
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So I but I don't know who was who was asleep at the wheel there because you would think

726
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
that they had any sort of crack team at Viacom is very aware of everything going on in its

727
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
busy empire.

728
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
There's not a cigarette lawyer at Viacom.

729
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I think that's what we've learned here is that there's not a there's just there's a

730
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Disney watchdog.

731
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Cigarette lawyer.

732
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And there's not a Viacom.

733
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I'm not sure Viacom has like presidents for all their networks.

734
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I think that they might there there might be a lot of holes empire possible.

735
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Sumner Redstone was in charge of it I think.

736
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
But he passed away.

737
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So I'm in charge of looking for cigarettes and saying put more in.

738
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Why doesn't the Paw Patrol smoke cigarettes.

739
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Put them in tights.

740
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
The Paw Patrol smoke cigarettes.

741
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Put them in diapers.

742
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I asked that he would not know the name of the Paw Patrol.

743
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Why don't those why don't dumb dogs smoke cigarettes.

744
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Stupid dogs.

745
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Surfing the last time the show is not called Dumb Dogs.

746
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It should be called that.

747
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
God Dumb Smoking Dogs and make them cough.

748
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Oh Sumner.

749
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
There's a new book that showed up at my I've never of I faster ordered a book from the

750
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
writer of the book Disney War.

751
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Really.

752
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Wow.

753
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
We're hitting Viacom.

754
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
We're hitting Sumner.

755
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Maybe we all got to read it.

756
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
We got to do.

757
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
OK.

758
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Sure.

759
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Sumner dive.

760
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
We have to do a full.

761
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
The first chapter is where I knew I was going to click by.

762
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
But then I saw the first chapter is about the electric Barbarellas.

763
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
The band that he made a reality show of with his girlfriend.

764
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Number one.

765
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
That's the first chapter.

766
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
We start with electric Barbarellas.

767
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Oh we got to do it.

768
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
The first reality show that no MTV executive wanted to put on.

769
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Is there any sort of loose theme park framing for the Patreon episode of this or no?

770
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I don't look.

771
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I think it is key that we've developed the guy.

772
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Oh yeah.

773
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Oh good.

774
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Good.

775
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Great.

776
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And we look and we know he dealt with discovery zones in his lifetime.

777
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
There may be.

778
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
If I see the word theme park if I see the word park in it and turns out to be that he parked

779
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
his car somewhere and made somebody rub his toes.

780
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
That counts.

781
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Park is enough.

782
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
We're doing it up.

783
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
We're doing Sumner.

784
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Okay.

785
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So it's a heck of a wow when you go in.

786
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Aesthetically we were saying how and I think we knew the vibe of it already.

787
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I had not spoiled.

788
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You would know what the Mario Kart ride was or anything.

789
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
But I've seen just pictures of the vibe from Japan.

790
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And like you were saying Mike and I've said a little while back there's no way to screw

791
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
up the estate.

792
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I mean there's a way.

793
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But they sure they did not.

794
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
It is a great like combining.

795
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It's like the average of Mario.

796
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Yes.

797
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It is neither one game nor another more than the other.

798
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Right.

799
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It's just like perfectly.

800
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Well that is pretty classic Mario what they figured out.

801
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Yeah.

802
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I mean and then Galaxy's Edge was sort of trying to do that.

803
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
But obviously the iconography of a Mario game is so much more I don't know vibrant vibrant

804
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
and bright and not specific.

805
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:11,000
But yeah it's it's it's so much easier to sort of do a combination of whatever 30 plus

806
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
years of Mario and put it into something that looks right.

807
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
No matter what your era of Mario is it looks right.

808
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Right.

809
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And very consistent kind of a protected guarded intellectual property.

810
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I feel like after that movie in the 90s.

811
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Yes.

812
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Yeah.

813
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
That was the word.

814
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It was like they sort of let a lot of different you know people try their hand at making

815
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Nintendo properties and then the movie showed up.

816
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And then Nintendo was like whoa whoa whoa.

817
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And that's why it's taken this long to have another Mario movie.

818
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Geez.

819
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Is that Dave I think they got very protective.

820
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Yeah because it's such a no brainer such a popular character you would have thought that

821
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
they would have gotten to it at least before Sonic did.

822
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Yeah.

823
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,000
But yeah I think that that that movie delayed our proper Mario movie by decades.

824
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And it got it out of our childhoods.

825
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
This one coming out might be fine but it's not in our childhood where we would have loved

826
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
it no matter what.

827
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Because it's not coming out in our childhood we will probably be judging it no matter what.

828
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Oh I saw the first Mario movie opening weekend for sure with my dad and brother and liked

829
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
it.

830
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
OK.

831
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Wasn't quite sure why everything looked like a Robo cop.

832
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,000
But you know they eventually put the overalls and the colored shirts on and did a little

833
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
jumping at the end.

834
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I didn't.

835
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Close enough.

836
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
They got to it.

837
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Barely.

838
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I would not have said I didn't like it when I saw the movie but I didn't like it.

839
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I made me uncomfortable the whole movie.

840
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Like I just did.

841
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Did you see it in the theater at the time.

842
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It is the first movie I ever saw twice.

843
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Oh wow.

844
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I really liked the Mario.

845
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
That's the weird thing.

846
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And now I recognize that it's insane and it does it doesn't hold up if you believe it.

847
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I have it.

848
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I bought it for three dollars six months ago.

849
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I have not revisited it.

850
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Truly have not given it much thought over the years.

851
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
You know.

852
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
So yeah.

853
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
So do you know how dear you guys aware of the way that and Jason specifically are you

854
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
aware that the Super Mario live action movie destroys the Twin Towers in a way that is

855
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
remarkably similar to 9 11.

856
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Wow.

857
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
There is a frame of that meant to look it up.

858
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Maybe it's probably good to not have it.

859
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Yeah don't don't.

860
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Oh don't.

861
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
There's a.

862
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
That's not a saying do it either.

863
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Don't not pull this up.

864
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
No it's insane.

865
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
It's like at some point you come back to the real world and there's been havoc wreaked

866
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
by whatever is going on in the Mushroom Kingdom and the havoc includes that the Twin Towers

867
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
are on fire.

868
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Those were in the Mario Brothers movie very much like a landmark like the Eiffel Tower

869
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,000
of like oh aliens have attacked a big monster is attacked like that was a it's like all

870
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
right we're either going to blow up the Statue of Liberty or blow up the skyscraper like

871
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Empire State Building or World Trade Center.

872
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's kind of incredible that Independence Day was not it.

873
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Yeah.

874
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Yeah.

875
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And they did I said I've complained about this before they blow Chicago up off camera.

876
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Oh.

877
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
So as a kid living right near Chicago it was like oh we're going to get to Chicago.

878
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
We see Chicago destroyed.

879
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
You assume that the pace of the movie was going to be like and now the next three or

880
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
the next three big cities.

881
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I haven't read Save the Cat yet.

882
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
OK.

883
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I didn't know the three act structure.

884
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I didn't know how to keep the movie going.

885
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I didn't know that we needed to see more emotional arcs.

886
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So yes I thought maybe there's another hour of city destruction.

887
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Oh they're at the St. Louis Arch.

888
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I didn't know.

889
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Yeah I thought maybe this is what's going to happen for the next hour and a half.

890
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And I was fine with it.

891
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm curious if anyone else was jealous that your city was not represented in the

892
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
United States.

893
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I said the rule I always remember is if you think it there's at least one to 50 people

894
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
that also had the same thought.

895
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
That's sort of just how I sometimes when I'm having weird thoughts intrusive thoughts

896
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I go you know what.

897
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
There's other people thinking the same thing and it makes me feel better.

898
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:11,000
So I believe that this applies to somebody who watched Independence Day in Chicago.

899
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
When they were my age and were jealous would have been scared to see very scary destroyed

900
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
but I wish they could have experienced that.

901
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Yes.

902
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Yeah.

903
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And probably there's been another podcaster who has hidden the logo of their peep Pepsi

904
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
in order to keep the episode on track.

905
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I.

906
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
OK wait a minute.

907
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
That's not a thought that's an oh look at that can.

908
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Look at it.

909
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I don't think that I don't think that counts.

910
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I have more it was a bottle.

911
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Now actions different than thoughts.

912
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So what are you arguing.

913
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I don't know.

914
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You can't.

915
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I'm an original my actions are just me.

916
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:55,000
So my I'm very unique when it comes to hiding the peeps branded Pepsi on a zoom about Dick Tracy's Warren

917
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Beatty's Dick Tracy's special to keep the rights.

918
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I'm confused why you wanted to have company in in being jealous of Chicago not being blown up.

919
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
But you want to be alone in hiding peeps Pepsi.

920
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
You're very forceful about it.

921
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
No no no.

922
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
That's what he's ever done.

923
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It was ever.

924
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And if anybody ever does it I guess you got to have there you got to have things that are yours.

925
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Yeah you got to do.

926
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Yes yes you do have to do have things that are yours.

927
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Look sometimes life's a contradiction as well.

928
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
You got to remember that that makes me feel better as well.

929
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'll be the first to cover up this coconut LaCroix so that it just says nut.

930
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And then you're thinking what is this.

931
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
He drinking peanut soda.

932
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
This guy crazy walnut.

933
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I'm not so walnut.

934
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
You're thinking I'm weird for drinking peeps Pepsi and you're well you're drinking walnut LaCroix.

935
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Jason would you eat a would you drink a nut water.

936
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
What kind I guess.

937
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
A peanut water.

938
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Oh maybe.

939
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Walnut water.

940
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Sure.

941
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Yeah.

942
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Cashew water.

943
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I don't know why I asked what kind.

944
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I like all nuts.

945
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Well I like all nuts too but I don't think a water based on nuts.

946
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Or based on nut flavor is necessarily going to be.

947
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Maybe there is such a thing though.

948
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,000
The peanut obviously makes the most sense just because it's like a flavor universally loved and put into many different types of food.

949
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
So but I don't know I'll try it.

950
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Give me a walnut water.

951
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
But they might have it like forever dog has kind of odd flavors I will say.

952
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
So it could be in there right now.

953
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Sure.

954
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
We'll check on the way we'll start recording again if we find walnut LaCroix for real.

955
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
When we do zoom episodes Mike is for sure shirtless like that slamming the Pepsi peeps.

956
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Oh yeah that's right.

957
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Hovering and water.

958
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
You got your waterproof set up with a bag over it.

959
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
That's right.

960
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,000
So so you're in Super Nintendo land and you're like wow this is great.

961
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Is there a place to chill out.

962
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
The answer is no.

963
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
The answer is no.

964
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
No it is not.

965
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It is not a particularly chill place.

966
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And this this presented some challenges just given the state of mind my wife and I have been in it was a nice day out it was a nice escape from what's been going on at home which is potty training.

967
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Yeah it's been fine.

968
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It's had its ups and downs.

969
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
So it's had some downs.

970
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:20,000
But you know basically what it's meant is we're at home more often because you can't go out right as much and being at home more often than this list to do.

971
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:33,000
So there's a lot of claptrap shows on like I just complained about the show Leo the truck Leo the truck is something I cannot wait to get this kid off of Leo your child loves Leo the Leo the truck.

972
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
You can demand these things.

973
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Lifty and scoop these this song.

974
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Dear God I think it's if I'm inarticulate in episodes ever it's because Leo the truck is rotting my brain.

975
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Do you think a Leo the truck land could be good though.

976
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
No.

977
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
No really.

978
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Wow.

979
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Maybe that's just the state of maybe I'll get maybe I'll get a more open frame of mind on Leo the truck.

980
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
All right.

981
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
When potty training is done.

982
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,000
With a take like that we'll see if the Leo the truck people invite us to anything going forward.

983
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
If there were Leo people I might be concerned about that.

984
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Anyway it's been just a lot of like claptrap shows on and we're like oh my God we're out we get to do something else out and then we get into this land which is very packed.

985
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Yeah.

986
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And a big big thing of the land is that as it should be there's coin boxes there's the coin boxes and if you have the band you can light up the coins and play games with them and collect coins.

987
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:41,000
But boy after the week it had been especially for Aaron just like all right now let's go have some fun ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding.

988
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
It was bonkers.

989
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I mean there was a there was a Vegas thing about it.

990
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Yes.

991
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
In terms of like so much stimulus packed into a RIVERIS~)

992
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
small place which is cool.

993
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Yes.

994
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I just might I might say.

995
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Can we turn the volume down of the coins?

996
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Does it have to because you're like you're everywhere trying to like okay so do we have time to make the restaurant reservations at 12-40?

997
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Ding-ding-ding ding-ding-ding like I think we just make it for the people who are collecting the coins because they're the ones who are excited.

998
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I don't mean to say I'm not excited for them they should have all the coins they want.

999
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Yeah.

1000
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I just don't need to be in on the coin gathering process.

1001
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I gotta say I'm not excited for them.

1002
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I you know I was loving it for a second like I was like oh the music the coin it's such a soothing sound.

1003
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And then after you hear it dozens of times in the span of five minutes when you're like oh look there's a little ledge.

1004
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
There's a little ledge on that thing we can sit on.

1005
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Mm-hmm.

1006
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I found something.

1007
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I found an area to seat to be seated.

1008
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Collect ourselves and figure out where we're going and it's very quickly here like where we're going is anywhere else like anywhere.

1009
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:58,000
The way these past or previous have been and I think they will be this way for a little bit it's kind of Galaxy's Edge-esque in that like you'll have your window of time.

1010
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:08,000
It was only two hours that you could experience all the things and then you can't get into the ride or the restaurant or the experiences with your given wristband.

1011
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Right.

1012
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Once the two hours is done.

1013
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
But I would say the two hours was plenty.

1014
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
This might be a place to come and go.

1015
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Well right.

1016
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
When it's possible.

1017
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Right.

1018
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Especially when it's crowded.

1019
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I will say this when I was alone we'll get to why I was alone in a little bit.

1020
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,000
But when I was alone I remembered that there are there's a company I just mentioned Super 7.

1021
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
They have some toys that have just come out that are Ninja Turtles that glow in the dark.

1022
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
These are hard to get because you had to preorder them and I decided I don't think I really want them.

1023
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
They came out.

1024
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I got FOMO as they say fear of missing out.

1025
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I got jealous and I go you know what I'm going to be in San Diego soon.

1026
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I'm going to call the store and the Super 7 store in San Diego.

1027
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:56,000
The guy tells me you know what call on Saturday and we can preorder and I go OK great.

1028
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I forgot to do this.

1029
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I did this in Super Nintendo land.

1030
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Oh I call the phone on the phone.

1031
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I explain what's going on.

1032
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
You may you did personal business.

1033
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I did personal business in the loudest land and I tried I was going all over trying to find a place that was quiet.

1034
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I was unsuccessful.

1035
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I thought I kind of got in a little nook like that was sort of a quieter.

1036
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I explained oh yeah.

1037
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I'm the guy with maybe was the same person I talked to via Instagram.

1038
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
He goes oh yeah.

1039
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
One second.

1040
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
And then there was a couple of like beats and he goes hey you playing Mario bro.

1041
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Is your console breaking.

1042
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
What is going on back there.

1043
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And I go I'm actually inside Mario right now.

1044
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I'm inside the game.

1045
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I'm in the Universal Studios and goes oh it's kind of loud.

1046
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
And I was like trying to cover that because I was very aware of a lot of it.

1047
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I cover the phone.

1048
00:46:49,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Now that's not necessarily the lands fault but that's just to give you a you know that's that's to illustrate the point of this is a very loud land and you can not have the guy who you're calling to preorder your glow in the dark Ninja Turtles know that you are in Super Nintendo World.

1049
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Well I tried to prevent it.

1050
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
But ultimately look this guy's working a Super 7 store.

1051
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Yeah it's one of the people I'd be the least self conscious about explaining where I am on a Saturday.

1052
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Why did it have to happen in that moment.

1053
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Because he said call around noon.

1054
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And I was worried that somebody would buy them all.

1055
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
That's part of FOMO.

1056
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
That's part of the phone.

1057
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I don't know how many they have in store.

1058
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
This is part of being a toy clay.

1059
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
This is the neuroses of being a toy.

1060
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So when he said noon and you've had noon as your scheduled date.

1061
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It took me like an hour.

1062
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I forgot and I called later.

1063
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Geez wow.

1064
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
You forgot.

1065
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
So then you're extra like yes I am going to this is every toy.

1066
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
He's going to say these toys will never be remade.

1067
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You lost your chance.

1068
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Then a prison gate would have slammed on the phone.

1069
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
That's right.

1070
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
That's what happens to those toys.

1071
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
You never know.

1072
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Is this what we're looking at?

1073
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Oh well I think I have that but that's not the one I'm talking about.

1074
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I'm talking about the turtle brothers themselves.

1075
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
What was that?

1076
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
That was a glow in the dark mutagen man.

1077
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Which you can get on a pretty good discount right now.

1078
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
It's a super 7 toy but you can get that for like 20 something 25 bucks.

1079
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
It's great.

1080
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
We'll do it.

1081
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
But after everybody hears this they're going to be gone.

1082
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Well there's going to be a run on the mutagen man I know.

1083
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Pretty soon.

1084
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Okay so it's not a place to do business.

1085
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Not a place to do business.

1086
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
It's a place to collect coins but not a place to make business calls and collect real world coins.

1087
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Collect coins you will not be able to collect yourself.

1088
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
It's a lot and especially the more crowded.

1089
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
And the fact that these power bands aren't the most accurate.

1090
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:53,000
For every time you slam the thing or gently tap the thing.

1091
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I shouldn't say slam.

1092
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Obviously it wouldn't be accurate if I was slamming into it.

1093
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
But you're trying to do the Mario like punch up.

1094
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
If you do it three times you'll hit it.

1095
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
It'll register once.

1096
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
You know.

1097
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I think it's funny that you did like a like a tsk tsk like a skull jester while holding a bright orange band with a flower on it.

1098
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Sometimes.

1099
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Oh yeah.

1100
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
It's a daisy brand.

1101
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Not so good.

1102
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Not so good.

1103
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
And so yeah.

1104
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Also did you guys get one of these?

1105
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
We did not do the bands.

1106
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
And this is a whole here.

1107
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Let me let me put some stuff in bounds and not in bounds.

1108
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Sure.

1109
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,000
If you're wondering if this this pace that we're going for I notice that they are not barreling to the Mario Kart.

1110
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Mario Kart its own episode.

1111
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
We will be doing that as its own thing.

1112
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
The three of us are going back to the land in the near future.

1113
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And when we do that we might collect some other things we can talk about at that time.

1114
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Right.

1115
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
But so yeah Mike and I are not prepared to talk about bands.

1116
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
But you talk makes Jason the band expert for the time being.

1117
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
He has a band with him now.

1118
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
We got one band when we were checking in.

1119
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
You were sharing a band.

1120
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
We were sharing a band.

1121
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Band share.

1122
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Let me ask.

1123
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It's daisy.

1124
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Yeah.

1125
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Let me ask.

1126
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Did you pick it or did Jane pick it?

1127
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Jane picked it.

1128
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Is she a daisy fan or did she like the colors?

1129
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
She liked the colors and she double checked the character and she's like oh I like her vibe.

1130
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I like her thing.

1131
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,000
So these are you know when Disney rolled out the magic bands they they went to great pay

1132
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:28,000
they went to great pains of like oh we spent a lot of money testing these and designing these and stuff.

1133
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Little less money spent on this because it it's a little it's like a snap bracelet with a very heavy middle.

1134
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:44,000
And it has a tendency as you're like you know throwing your arms around and stuff it tends to like curve like this.

1135
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Can I see it?

1136
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Yeah.

1137
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And it doesn't really stay on.

1138
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
For a second there you I swear you went into your Andy Rooney impression just for like a half second.

1139
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
That was what I thought when he was when he was wagging it.

1140
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
That I completely thought it was.

1141
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
It's like a snap.

1142
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I mean at $40 a head you know a $40 a band for like.

1143
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Is it 40?

1144
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I thought it was less than that.

1145
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Is it?

1146
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
It was 40.

1147
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Yeah.

1148
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Really?

1149
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Wow.

1150
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I will say this.

1151
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
No annual pass holder discounts.

1152
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Discounts on the food not on the band.

1153
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Oh there is on the food.

1154
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Yeah.

1155
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Yeah.

1156
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I will say I do like the because the Disney World magic bands are not snap bracelet like

1157
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
with a magnet they're more right am I wrong or maybe the new ones are?

1158
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
It's more like a watch band.

1159
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I do like that.

1160
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I do like this in general.

1161
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
It's kind of fun to wear but it's maybe maybe it curls up a little bit too much.

1162
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Oh it's got a little eyes too.

1163
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Yeah it's got little eyes like it's cute it's just not the most practical.

1164
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I mean as an add on it does it can you can use it as an amiibo which I only partially understand.

1165
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Oh you can?

1166
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Yeah I think you can too.

1167
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
What does that mean?

1168
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Amiibos are like those little toys that sort of can unlock certain things for different

1169
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
games.

1170
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I actually don't have one although I was thinking about getting this out for the new Zelda game

1171
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,000
that comes out in May but they can unlock certain things in the game and they're fun

1172
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
little collectible things.

1173
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Listener you're going to want to be watching this on YouTube to watch me punch in and going

1174
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
up and down.

1175
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Jason were you and Jane.

1176
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I like it.

1177
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I like that there's a little bit of like weight to it.

1178
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Yeah a little heft.

1179
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Jason were you and Jane wearing it together over one or two weeks.

1180
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
No no we were passing it back and forth.

1181
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Like escaped prisoners but in a cute way.

1182
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Yeah yeah.

1183
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Same Shane Gang members.

1184
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Look folks that's just what a relationship is sometimes you're just escaped prisoners

1185
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
wearing, sharing a power up band.

1186
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Daisy power up band.

1187
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Sharing the Daisy power up band.

1188
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Yeah no so I but I saw the ordinary adventures videos about this too.

1189
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Like Peter was testing it out and went flying off his his wrist.

1190
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Wow so it could hit someone in the head.

1191
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Yeah there's like vinyl kind of like a watch band.

1192
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
So they were like oh you can buy these vinyl bands on Amazon and that'll keep it more securely

1193
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
on your wrist.

1194
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Interesting.

1195
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Do you have to buy helper bands?

1196
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Yeah you have to buy aftermarket parts.

1197
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Third party.

1198
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Third party yeah.

1199
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
It's not official universal.

1200
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I'm interested in that.

1201
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
This sets it up an interesting thing where I'm going to get the band.

1202
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I'm going to get a band and I'm going to try.

1203
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
See how I find.

1204
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Yeah we'll do a band next time.

1205
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
So yeah we'll check in on the Mario Kart up.

1206
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
We will check in with the bands.

1207
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Well I'll keep my thoughts to myself until that episode.

1208
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
You could share.

1209
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Well alright I'll say a little band stuff.

1210
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
People are going to want to hear it.

1211
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I mean there's a leaderboard.

1212
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
You can kind of check in on your points and stuff in a few spots.

1213
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,000
There's a lot of M's symbols throughout the land that you can tap stuff and get.

1214
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I think you get you get coins you get power ups you get stamps.

1215
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
What is the reward ultimately of coins?

1216
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Oh it's just graphics in the app.

1217
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
This is all within the Super Nintendo tab on the the universal Hollywood app.

1218
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Jane could not get it to correctly scan on the Mario Kart wheels.

1219
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
So we'll have to see if we can.

1220
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Oh it does something on the wheel in the ride.

1221
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
It adds up your coins on that as well.

1222
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Yeah.

1223
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Oh right.

1224
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
You get coins on the ride.

1225
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:19,000
But a lot of it is for like playing what I have seen called mini games.

1226
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Basically tap games.

1227
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,000
You have to get like three certain coins to do the Bowser Jr. kind of mini game.

1228
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I believe it is keys.

1229
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Oh it's keys.

1230
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Sorry.

1231
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Yes.

1232
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
But they look like coins.

1233
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
They're keys that look like coins.

1234
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
And there's coins.

1235
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Coins are different.

1236
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Coins are different than keys.

1237
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Coins are different than keys.

1238
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Yeah.

1239
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
So we did not do that.

1240
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
We were wandering in and out of rooms like where you could tap stuff.

1241
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Yeah.

1242
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
We went in those rooms.

1243
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
We saw some of those rooms.

1244
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
You can hit the POW blocks.

1245
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
That was fun.

1246
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Yeah.

1247
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
All this stuff again.

1248
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Children would be going crazy for all this.

1249
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Children would be going crazy.

1250
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:14,000
But you can kind of tell people are getting a little a little tired a little overwhelmed with all the crowds and everyone trying to like slap the wall and slap the bricks.

1251
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Yes.

1252
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:27,000
It is a it is a I'm trying to think there's like if all the kids in there are completely stimulated to go nuts and hit all the blocks in addition to the noise in addition to the no ability to sit down.

1253
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
It's like a recipe for just being getting tired.

1254
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Yeah.

1255
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:40,000
And I suppose maybe that for the parents and the adults maybe the cramp crampness in the crowds.

1256
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Maybe that is why there is no alcohol for sale in the land.

1257
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
No alcohol.

1258
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:51,000
But people brought we saw people bring beers from Jurassic Park or whatever that party.

1259
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Yeah.

1260
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
My tie or like a tall boy white cloth.

1261
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
That's maybe already a hack.

1262
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
We already have an early podcast the right hack for mom and dad.

1263
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
You can bring alcohol that is of a different IP.

1264
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Right.

1265
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Bring Jurassic World alcohol right into you can mix IP.

1266
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Yes.

1267
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Yeah.

1268
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Sometimes there are blue moons in Mario world various Mario worlds and you can also carry a blue moon into this world.

1269
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Yeah.

1270
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:30,000
But I do feel disappointed by the lack of Mario alcohol certainly especially because generally aesthetically you were like boy I could use a drink.

1271
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I never before have I needed a drink so bad.

1272
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I mean we can we can we can blue sky what we would want here which I think is a fun fun exercise.

1273
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I mean are you thinking obviously there's going to have to be a nonsense cocktail mixed drink.

1274
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Yeah.

1275
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Yeah.

1276
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I know that's what you're going called the rainbow.

1277
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
You want.

1278
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Oh that's great.

1279
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Yeah.

1280
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Yeah.

1281
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
It has to be one where they put literally every different food coloring.

1282
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Oh just like Mickey's fun.

1283
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Right.

1284
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Yeah.

1285
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Yes exactly.

1286
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Yeah.

1287
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
But you know what.

1288
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Not enough colors.

1289
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I want more colors in the fun wheel.

1290
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Fair enough.

1291
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Double the colors from the fun wheel which already has like five colors.

1292
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Wow.

1293
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
This is going to take forever to.

1294
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Yes.

1295
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
It's going to be the most laborious.

1296
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Thirty five dollars.

1297
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Just for labor they have to.

1298
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Yeah.

1299
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
It takes 15 minutes to make it.

1300
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I think I think like a guaranteed hit drink is like the potion like from.

1301
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Yes.

1302
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Mario 2.

1303
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
The potion that makes a door appear.

1304
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Right.

1305
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I think then you go into that like inverse world.

1306
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Yeah.

1307
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Wouldn't that be great.

1308
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Just like a big test tube and then that's a collectible and that's some bright red or

1309
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
something like sherry forward you know.

1310
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
And you can get with your drink you get a pickled egg like Birdo's egg from Mario 2

1311
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
as well.

1312
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
It should be like a dive bar where you have to reach into.

1313
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Yeah to get one of Birdo's pickled eggs.

1314
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
And Birdo's looking like.

1315
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Yeah.

1316
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Uh uh.

1317
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Birdo is behind the bar.

1318
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Whoa.

1319
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Birdo's bar.

1320
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Birdo's bar.

1321
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Bar Birdo.

1322
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Bar Birdo is good.

1323
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Maybe better.

1324
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
One of my big one of my I think my frustration is no Birdo.

1325
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Yeah.

1326
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Because you're a big Mario 2 guy.

1327
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Is that your favorite from the old ones you think?

1328
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I don't know if I.

1329
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I don't think I would say big.

1330
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,000
But I was thinking before this how like I was walking around like how is there not more.

1331
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Well I know why there's not more Mario 2.

1332
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
It's like it doesn't fit.

1333
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
You know what it's kind of equivalent to is Temple of Doom.

1334
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Oh sure.

1335
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
It's the middle one.

1336
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Well not the middle one anymore but the middle one that counts.

1337
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,000
And then it's like a little bit off from the ones surrounding it which are more of a piece

1338
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
and more classic.

1339
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
But then the weird one is sort of great for being weird.

1340
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Yes.

1341
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I think that's a good description.

1342
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I love frogs and lack of Bowser's and turnips.

1343
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
You mostly I think mainly what there should be.

1344
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
They should be engineering freakishly big turnips.

1345
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Yeah I think that's right.

1346
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,000
They're for eating not for throwing because you could you could break a kid's nose.

1347
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Throw on a giant turnip.

1348
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Don't throw the turnips.

1349
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Yeah Mario 2 is great.

1350
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I guess 3 was probably my favorite but I never had 2 and I was obsessed with 2.

1351
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Mario 2.

1352
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I think I didn't have it growing up so then later I got to find it.

1353
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
It rediscovered it like an old record.

1354
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Of course.

1355
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I played 2 and 2 a lot.

1356
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I don't think it was until I was older that I knew about the Doki Doki Panic.

1357
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
But I liked that it was a little different.

1358
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Sure.

1359
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Yeah.

1360
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
So yeah.

1361
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Drink wise Jason what do you think?

1362
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
What would you want of an alcoholic beverage in there?

1363
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Like Wario would have like some sort of beer I feel like.

1364
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Something a little robust a little challenging.

1365
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Like kind of dark and thick.

1366
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Yeah.

1367
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
What would Waluigi have like a skinny purple like highball kind of thing.

1368
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Okay yeah.

1369
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Maybe with some dry ice or something.

1370
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
That's good.

1371
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Smokey coming out.

1372
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Yeah yeah.

1373
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,000
If you could drink if like Luigi's Mansion was the bar.

1374
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Because it's scary so kids are a little scared so that's where it's adults only.

1375
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Yeah keep them away.

1376
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,000
If you could order like a some sort of like I don't know if it's more medicinal or like

1377
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
a Long Island Ice Tea but something called Dr. Mario.

1378
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Yes.

1379
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Well then you do like with Scott's idea for the Mr. DNA that I'm obsessed with.

1380
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:30,000
You put a little pill as like a kind of sugar version of one of those Dr. Mario pills.

1381
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
A little syrup capsule or something.

1382
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Something like that.

1383
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Yeah.

1384
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I went somewhere in Tokyo that did this.

1385
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
That had a Dr. Mario drink that was like a pill that dissolved.

1386
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I thought it was.

1387
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Gross.

1388
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Insane and bad.

1389
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
But okay.

1390
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
But the idea neat.

1391
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Yeah the idea is good.

1392
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
And a cool little 8-bit Mario kind of kind of bars.

1393
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
And you're a Dr. Mario guy I know that.

1394
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Yes that for a long time was the relaxation.

1395
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Right.

1396
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Dr. Mario and smooth jazz from the 70s and 80s.

1397
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Game on.

1398
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
On mute.

1399
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
And smoother sounds instead.

1400
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I love I'm a big Dr. Mario fan.

1401
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Those are nice times.

1402
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Yeah.

1403
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
So we're talking a lot about food.

1404
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Do you want to talk about the Toadstool Cafe?

1405
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I would love to talk about the Toadstool Cafe.

1406
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
This is where a lot of my observations are given that Mario Kart will be its own thing.

1407
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
You went to Toadstool Cafe?

1408
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I did.

1409
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Yeah.

1410
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
We tried a bunch of stuff.

1411
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Yes.

1412
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Yeah.

1413
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Us too.

1414
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Okay.

1415
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
So basically if you have this two hour window and I don't know if this will be applicable

1416
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:34,000
as a tip but you basically you have to be careful I would say with time management.

1417
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I think that there is no way I don't know how it's going to be when it's open to the

1418
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
public if you have to like grab these reservations but it's a big convoluted.

1419
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Yeah.

1420
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
You have to scan a code when you check in and it takes you to a very non theme parky

1421
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,000
website where you have to rush check grab a time and then the time disappears and you

1422
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,000
got to grab a less convenient time and our time was in the dead center of the reservation.

1423
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:02,000
So it just became clear to me we cannot do the restaurant and the ride.

1424
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
You like it's going to be tough to do both of them.

1425
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
So and you guys you and Andrew were a little bit behind us.

1426
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
So I was like kind of driving it a little like I think we have to go right on this ride

1427
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:18,000
so we can make this reservation that required us to do the single rider line and this made

1428
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
sense to you.

1429
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I think you even suggested it but I felt when I said we're going to do the single rider

1430
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:28,000
line I felt a palpable disappointment that you were not going to be able to do the full

1431
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
line.

1432
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I mean maybe initially but since we were going back I wasn't so upset.

1433
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Yes sure.

1434
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Yeah.

1435
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
We will have our chance and the episode will not occur until.

1436
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Right until because I would not allow it if this were the first of the episode about the

1437
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
ride and we didn't go in the full queue.

1438
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Come on.

1439
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Yeah.

1440
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
What are we sure.

1441
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
What kind of shabby organization is this.

1442
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Jason did you wait in line.

1443
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Did you were able to do that.

1444
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I walked on.

1445
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
We walked on the ride.

1446
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Wow.

1447
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
In the regular.

1448
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Yeah sure.

1449
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And I'll get more into it when we do but after climbing the four flights of stairs seemingly

1450
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
and then a few flights down.

1451
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Are we supposed to be upset for you.

1452
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I have a lot of qualms about accessibility in this land.

1453
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Sure.

1454
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
But do you know there's not is there a there could be a elevator.

1455
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I didn't see any signs for it or else I probably would have taken it.

1456
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:28,000
So because I don't have like the worst ailments but my knee has not been feeling great lately

1457
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
and it felt worse after the ride for sure.

1458
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
After the queue or the ride.

1459
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
The queue.

1460
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
No the ride was fine.

1461
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
The ride was fine.

1462
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Can't do a lot of damage when you're going one mile an hour.

1463
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Spicy day.

1464
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,000
So yeah we did the full queue and it's really well done.

1465
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Sure.

1466
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
It's like pretty beautifully done.

1467
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Sure.

1468
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I have played plenty of Mario Kart but it was never like you were saying the attachments.

1469
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I didn't I don't have the attachment to it that a lot of people do.

1470
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I don't think we ever had a copy.

1471
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I think we either borrowed copies or played a friend's houses and they would be like who

1472
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
do you want to play as.

1473
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I was like Mario Luigi.

1474
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Who's available.

1475
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Who's available like because other people.

1476
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Berto.

1477
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
People are fairly.

1478
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Oh I'd love to play.

1479
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Is Berto a player.

1480
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Did they ever add Berto.

1481
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Can I play as an egg.

1482
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Did they ever add Berto.

1483
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I forget.

1484
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Maybe she is in there.

1485
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I think Berto was a player on like weird Olympics games after or like Mario parties or something.

1486
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,000
I saw a screenshot where it did seem like you could play as Berto in something.

1487
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Yeah.

1488
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I don't think a cart.

1489
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Well yeah so no I was well we'll get to the Mario Kart stuff next episode but yes I was

1490
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
a huge Mario Kart fan.

1491
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
So you guys got on it and got in the cafe.

1492
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Yes we did.

1493
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
We did.

1494
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
We did the ride twice.

1495
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Be a single rider and here's a genuine tip.

1496
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
It's a very effective single rider.

1497
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:59,000
If you need it if you've got a limited time I might be going against the I'm going against

1498
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
the do the queue sensibility but it's a very effective single rider.

1499
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Berto is in Mario Kart Wii.

1500
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Wow.

1501
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Yeah.

1502
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Really.

1503
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I've played that.

1504
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I didn't remember.

1505
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Maybe I didn't drive good enough.

1506
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Yeah you were.

1507
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Damn it.

1508
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Sucked so you didn't get Berto to play.

1509
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I wouldn't have unlocked Berto either.

1510
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
It is hard enough unlocking all those Super Smash Brothers characters you know.

1511
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,000
So anyways if it is a limited time window be careful with it but yeah we had a food

1512
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
reservation smack dab in the middle.

1513
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
We did make it.

1514
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,000
It did all work out but then it's this like boys at this process like I say you scan a

1515
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
code you check in and you get there and you wait in an outdoor line and you get checked

1516
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:47,000
again you wait in an indoor line and then a different indoor line with a counter and

1517
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
then a line before you can get seated.

1518
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
There's a lot going on at the Toadstool Cafe.

1519
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Yeah.

1520
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,000
So okay so Universal doesn't have any of the infrastructure to do like well they have some

1521
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
mobile.

1522
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I don't even know do they have any mobile orders.

1523
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
They don't have like Disney now even though a lot of it's annoying they do have information

1524
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
on the app like to get reservations and you know how to do it.

1525
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,000
It feels like this is a lot like even Uncharted Water for Universal as far as like how to

1526
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
manage a restaurant that's going to be pretty popular.

1527
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Oh it's guaranteed to come out of the gate.

1528
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Yeah because that's that's a other than the Harry Potter again Harry Potter stuff that's

1529
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
a first.

1530
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I don't even think like Moe's had that demand.

1531
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:33,000
We were there pretty early in Moe's life and I don't think there was maybe a line to get

1532
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
in but it wasn't like oh my god we need reservations to get in Moe's or something.

1533
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Yeah and this is wild.

1534
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
They're doing a bad job or anything.

1535
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:48,000
You're just like I'm sorry this is what needs to be done in order to get the cute Instagram

1536
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:54,000
food that will as soon as you see some photos even like the dressed nice photos of it you

1537
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
were like this is food for children.

1538
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
This was not going to be good food.

1539
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,000
It's not a high yeah it's a quick service food.

1540
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Are we going to find disagreement from Jason on this?

1541
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Good question.

1542
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
No I felt really bad a few hours after eating this food.

1543
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I felt kind of bad as I was sitting there digesting the food.

1544
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1545
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I will say in terms of like this this some of this stuff is like the mirror opposite

1546
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,000
of Avengers campus where Avengers campus is not the most stunning visual thing to stand

1547
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:35,000
in the middle of but I kind of like seeing my friend Spider-Man on the ride.

1548
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,000
I like seeing him flip in the air and I like all the food I've tried at Pym's kitchen.

1549
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Yeah.

1550
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I if we go into the Toastable Cafe I think the best thing you got to try the soda.

1551
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
You got to try the beverage.

1552
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
The beverage is my recommendation.

1553
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,000
You mean their specific are you just talking about is that you saying that the only thing

1554
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
you're going to like there is Sprite.

1555
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I know I'm saying the superstar lemon squash the exclusive.

1556
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Oh you had that.

1557
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I had that was none of us did that.

1558
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Okay.

1559
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I'll try to do that next time.

1560
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
I mean we tried the I had the spaghetti and meatballs.

1561
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
We shared the garlic knots.

1562
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Jane got the salad with a bunch of fruit in it.

1563
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:25,000
And then we got the Princess Peach Cupcake and the question mark block tiramisu.

1564
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Okay.

1565
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Yeah.

1566
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
We I think we covered a lot of the same things.

1567
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Do people do anything different.

1568
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Oh well you know what I would I mean I'm standing in this line and it's a real quandary.

1569
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I'm like what do what do I want to have.

1570
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
What is not going to kill me here in the middle of the day.

1571
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I just nothing.

1572
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I do I really want a bunch of spaghetti theme park spaghetti right now.

1573
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And then the determination I made was to go on a little adventure which is the wait oh yes the Mario mini burger adventure set.

1574
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Like wait a minute.

1575
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
The other items do not involve an adventure.

1576
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:15,000
This looks like the ultimate adventure cheeseburger truffle french fries corn on the cob not just sitting on the plate boring standing upright surrounded by hills of broccoli and a yellow box with a coin cooked in a pan.

1577
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:20,000
With a coin cookie and a little Mario up on the top of it.

1578
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
This is all a delight.

1579
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I was so my my whole mood changed as soon as I realized this was the move was to have the children's hamburger.

1580
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Yes.

1581
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,000
And it was kind of delightful when it showed up.

1582
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,000
It's look I can't say that this food was anyone enthusiastic about anything they ate.

1583
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
What did you have.

1584
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I had the Mario.

1585
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
What was it called Mario burger.

1586
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Which it's just a burger with bacon mushroom and cheese.

1587
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Oh there he is.

1588
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Yes.

1589
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Yeah.

1590
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Well and more on this later.

1591
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
There's context to this photo.

1592
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Talk about the food and then we'll talk about the experience.

1593
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Mario burger I thought was fine.

1594
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
I mean it was fine.

1595
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I think it was like it was not as bad as like a Tomorrowland cheeseburger.

1596
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Yes.

1597
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
That's like my baseline for like bad theme park food is like that with Tomorrowland terror.

1598
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
What do they call that.

1599
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Yeah.

1600
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Yeah.

1601
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Like there's like a bad chicken sandwich there and I know you like the sunny eclipse restaurant for some reason.

1602
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
I think that's satisfying.

1603
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I mean the toppings bar is part of the you think that for is better than probably a burger.

1604
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,000
When you load it up with like caramelized onions and mushrooms and stuff.

1605
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
You're crazy.

1606
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
That also they just have like standard chicken tenders.

1607
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I think that's pretty I think that place and I think and maybe it's changed in the last couple of years.

1608
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I think that place in the one in Disneyland Tomorrowland wise that's the worst quick service food in the park.

1609
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Yeah.

1610
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Tomorrow the Tomorrowland what is that window called is tomorrow.

1611
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I mean the terrace right there is pretty brutal.

1612
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I see my expectations for theme park burger and chicken sandwich grilled chicken sandwich especially a rock bottom real.

1613
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Yeah of course.

1614
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:03,000
That's why I was like oh I'll get spaghetti and meatballs and it was it was all right for like theme park spaghetti and meatballs little spicy.

1615
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:11,000
The sauce meatballs are pretty like firmer like kind of stick together like like they're not real flaky you know something to get a fall apart.

1616
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Yeah right.

1617
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:18,000
So I was eating this and I got it out halfway through and I'm like that's enough like that's enough of that.

1618
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Like your plate.

1619
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Well no I didn't know.

1620
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Well first off three meatballs is too many meatballs to eat on your own.

1621
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Wait wait are you a three meat three meatball too much for a plate of spaghetti for a place.

1622
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I think that's a two meatball thing.

1623
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
The size of these were pretty substantial.

1624
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
They're not that big though.

1625
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
They're pretty they're pretty big.

1626
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Yeah you shrunk your hand.

1627
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Well like I think for you sure you shivered on your meatballs on a plate of spaghetti for meatballs in a in a sandwich.

1628
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I'll tell you what my spaghetti philosophy is.

1629
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
What's that.

1630
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
It has to have three meatballs.

1631
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I don't care about the size but if it doesn't feel like I got enough meatballs I'm disappointed.

1632
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
This point is moot because I'm more of a spaghetti and sausage kind of guy.

1633
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
So now we get to the heart.

1634
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Oh yeah.

1635
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Yeah that's fine.

1636
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
You want to base on sausage is seven sausages.

1637
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
You want seven sausages sticking out.

1638
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I mean it could be any you know you never know if it's going to be a full link is going to be sliced up.

1639
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Yeah.

1640
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Just you know quarter links.

1641
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Scott what how many meatballs do you like on a spaghetti and meatballs.

1642
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I mean more sounds better to me.

1643
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Yeah.

1644
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I know I guess I guess too but I think you're right.

1645
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
These did not seem like like baseball size.

1646
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
So well I mean I believe Jason he's saying they're bigger they're bigger balls.

1647
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
They're bigger than you think.

1648
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
And like I said we're eating the garlic knots which weren't great.

1649
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Yeah I see I see that those are big.

1650
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I'm looking at a picture right now.

1651
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
There are bigger balls for sure but I need three of those.

1652
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I think so.

1653
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
For sure.

1654
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I need three of those just because I mean if you're getting it I because I want to make sure I have a little too much meatball like I want a good even distribution with the pasta and the meatball.

1655
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,000
So three will give me a little like I want a little too much too much meatball.

1656
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:05,000
So I for sure am able to get it because the worst thing in the world is running out of meatballs when you're trying to finish your meal you want to try to clean your place.

1657
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
I mean worst thing in the world.

1658
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
That's fair.

1659
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
That's fair.

1660
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
The sauce had mushrooms in it too.

1661
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
So it was like a mushroom area.

1662
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Everything should have mushrooms in it at this point.

1663
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
That's heavy.

1664
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Wait I'm seeing your point now.

1665
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
That's a heavier sauce potentially.

1666
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
That is a little heavier.

1667
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
My burger had mushrooms on it.

1668
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Yeah there was a lot of mushroom going on.

1669
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
That didn't sound good to me.

1670
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
I like it as a theme.

1671
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Supposedly there's there's a soup.

1672
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I thought this is something Andrew was talking about and I'm like you're crazy.

1673
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
There's not mushroom soup.

1674
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
That's the most Japanese.

1675
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
That must be from the Japan menu.

1676
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
But sure enough I checked.

1677
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Apologies to Andrew.

1678
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I just don't think they were serving it yet.

1679
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,000
They also have basically they have this this place is like several.

1680
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
It's quick service.

1681
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Style food but in a sit down environment.

1682
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Yes it's like all the types of restaurants at once.

1683
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:00,000
So confusingly the full menu seems to have like a like a short rib demiglace kind of

1684
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
like a Morse like a twenty eight dollars.

1685
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Right.

1686
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
They were not serving.

1687
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
But then I'm like I mean that sounds good.

1688
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
That's the kind of thing I get at places usually.

1689
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,000
But that was do I want that in a place with a bunch of pipes on the ceiling and a bunch

1690
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
of injections of totes running around.

1691
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
The vibes are very good.

1692
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
The vibes in the cafe were were really relaxing.

1693
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
We didn't know that all the crowds had shown up when we left until we left to a cafe.

1694
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
It seemed like you maybe had a more peaceful experience than we did.

1695
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Well let me tell you.

1696
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,000
So we got in the land like 10 20 10 30.

1697
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
We were there early.

1698
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
There really wasn't a lot of people there.

1699
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
We walked on the ride.

1700
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Then we went right to the cafe.

1701
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
We had like 11 a.m.

1702
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
reservation.

1703
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Probably 11 15 11 20 probably the wrong time to be eating a plate of spaghetti and meatballs.

1704
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Oh did you have like a banana before.

1705
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,000
I think I just had like a granola bar or something.

1706
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
That's a heavy lunch.

1707
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
What.

1708
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
That's a heavy early lunch.

1709
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Oh yeah.

1710
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
It's heavy early lunch.

1711
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
But I want to say.

1712
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Sure I'm not saying you were wrong.

1713
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
I'm just saying like when in Rome certainly.

1714
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
But now I'm getting the clearer picture of.

1715
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Yeah.

1716
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Yeah.

1717
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
I mean I think I'm not saying you were wrong.

1718
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I think I'm just saying that.

1719
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Yeah.

1720
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Yeah.

1721
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I.

1722
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Jane was a little.

1723
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
When.

1724
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
In Rome.

1725
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
When I.

1726
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Rome.

1727
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
A.

1728
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Rome that has a horrible.

1729
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
When.

1730
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
In the fake.

1731
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
When.

1732
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Fake.

1733
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Rome.

1734
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Mario.

1735
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Had to go to.

1736
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Oh he went to Rome and one of those weird CD roms I think.

1737
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Yeah I think so.

1738
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Jane had the Yoshi's favorite fruit and veggie salad.

1739
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
I think she said it was OK.

1740
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
It was really sweet.

1741
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
There were Yoshi eggs on it that were just basically unflavored croutons.

1742
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Like dried bread.

1743
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Yeah.

1744
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Serenade.

1745
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
It's not a lot of like Yoshi eggs but it's just like a hard bread you're cracking up.

1746
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
The idea is you're eating unfertilized Yoshi's in the salad.

1747
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Yeah.

1748
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Wow.

1749
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Yeah.

1750
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
You're diminishing the Yoshi population by eating this salad.

1751
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
If they were unfertilized in the same way that you eat eggs from store.

1752
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Yeah you don't really think about it.

1753
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I guess.

1754
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
It depends how a Yoshi fertilizes an egg.

1755
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
That's really what it is.

1756
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
We have to figure out how inhumane or humane.

1757
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Tongue.

1758
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,000
So one Yoshi deposits the egg and then some other Yoshi comes and tongues it.

1759
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Whatever they reproduce with is on the tongue.

1760
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Reproductive organs are in the tongue.

1761
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
That might make sense.

1762
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Maybe they fertilize bushes.

1763
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Like it's a bird and a bee in a flower situation.

1764
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
And the eggs crack out of.

1765
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
No they lay eggs right?

1766
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Yoshi's lay eggs yeah.

1767
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Yeah you can launch them right?

1768
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Don't you like shoot them at people?

1769
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
It depends what it is.

1770
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
It depends what game it is.

1771
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Because like the first appearance of Yoshi is Mario World.

1772
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And if you collected enough berries.

1773
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Is that right?

1774
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Yeah you would collect enough berries and then Yoshi would like poop out an egg that was like a one up I think.

1775
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Yes.

1776
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I think that's what it was.

1777
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
But then you still find a Yoshi egg once in a while.

1778
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:00,000
If you killed your Yoshi you would find a Yoshi egg somewhere and hatch it.

1779
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
But Yoshi would poop out eggs that would like a one up would come out of.

1780
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
I believe.

1781
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Yeah so when two Yoshis love each other very much they make a one up.

1782
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
You get a second chance at life.

1783
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Then they make life for you.

1784
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
You get the life.

1785
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
That's nice.

1786
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Yeah it seemed like an odd salad.

1787
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
It's all just sitting in.

1788
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:26,000
I might disagree with you Jason on atmosphere and relax.

1789
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Because it was like later in the day certainly.

1790
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
But this is like I mean it's a cafeteria.

1791
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
It's a high school cafeteria that's immensely themed.

1792
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
It looks great and everything.

1793
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
But it was not.

1794
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,000
That's why I think it's weird like the sit down dining of it because I'm like how fast.

1795
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,000
And also you know that they are having to turn over people as fast as possible.

1796
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
What they are making the staff do.

1797
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
And everyone's doing a fine job.

1798
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Oh my god you could just you could feel the stress.

1799
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
We were there at eleven fifteen in the morning.

1800
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:04,000
And so I was happy we didn't have to carry plates of because you wait in a line.

1801
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
That gets you to the line to order and they give you all your drinks.

1802
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
And then you go over to someone who takes you to a table.

1803
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
So it's kind of happy they were going to bring this stuff to us.

1804
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
But it was chill.

1805
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
It was more chill.

1806
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:24,000
We're standing in a big corral holding trays with drinks on them.

1807
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
And everybody just like there's not a line anymore.

1808
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:36,000
How do how can I be the first to grab the attention of the table keeper to get to the host stand was getting a little messy and confusing for sure.

1809
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
But then we got seated.

1810
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
It was kind of we were sort of in our own little back like corner.

1811
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Maybe it was not like fully going at full speed when we were there.

1812
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And that's what I you know I think we looked at we went to the first group on a weekday when it opened a little early everything.

1813
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,000
So it is early I think is the is the listener tip for sure.

1814
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Yeah get your spaghetti and meatballs if you can before 10 a.m.

1815
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
That would be our tip.

1816
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:10,000
You're not going to hear that anywhere else spaghetti and meatballs and ask for an additional ball and see what they say.

1817
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Yeah see if you can add one on the kind of a limited menu.

1818
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,000
If you're there with a vegetarian there's two salads and the garlic knots.

1819
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:24,000
A lot of the other places at Universal at this point will like replace the patty on a burger with Beyond Burger.

1820
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
And I don't think they're there yet.

1821
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
And obviously the soups haven't shown up yet.

1822
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
I'm excited for these soups.

1823
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I'll be honest with you.

1824
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
We someone there told me said like I was anything vegan.

1825
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
They're like not yet but hopefully in the future.

1826
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
I think we're getting tomato soup.

1827
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
And I'm like oh yes.

1828
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
I like California summer a big big old bowl of tomato soup.

1829
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Yeah.

1830
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Is it mushroom and tomato or just tomato?

1831
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I think they're separate.

1832
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Yeah there's the mushroom soup.

1833
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
The mushroom one I think comes in like a toadstool comes in.

1834
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Right.

1835
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
You know.

1836
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I love mushrooms.

1837
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
I don't know if I've talked about this on the show before.

1838
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I'm a big mushroom guy.

1839
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Pizza on burgers anywhere they can put mushrooms.

1840
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
I love it.

1841
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Wow.

1842
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
So there you go.

1843
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
That's something new you learned.

1844
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Yeah.

1845
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
I don't think that's five timers.

1846
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Yeah it is not.

1847
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
No that's a first timer.

1848
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
So listeners bring Mike some mushrooms.

1849
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Hurt all mushrooms at me if we ever do another live show.

1850
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Let me ask you I think it's probably the most calories of the thing on the menu.

1851
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
But Shake Shack has a thing that's a mushroom stuffed with cheese.

1852
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Have I tried it?

1853
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Breaded and deep fried.

1854
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Yes I have tried it.

1855
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
It's delicious.

1856
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,000
And you can also get it on a burger if you're like really having a day.

1857
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Yes you could because yes that will replace a burger basically is a big mushroom that's

1858
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
deep fried.

1859
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
It's a big mushroom deep fried with cheese in it as well.

1860
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
It's really intense.

1861
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
It is very intense.

1862
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
But if you were a mad man you also will put a beef patty on that.

1863
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I've never done that.

1864
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
I've only ever done that.

1865
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I have done it.

1866
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
It was not a customization.

1867
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
It was on post.

1868
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Like it was an option on Postmates.

1869
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
It's a customization but it's not it's not something off menu.

1870
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
No it's not off menu.

1871
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
We all got through lockdown in our own way.

1872
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,000
You didn't have to call like Scott asked at the top of the show which you didn't have to

1873
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
say it in person to somebody.

1874
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
No.

1875
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
It was a prompt.

1876
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
You could click.

1877
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
We're back.

1878
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
We're back in person and we're back to shame.

1879
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
That's right.

1880
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
It's a shame.

1881
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Oh yeah.

1882
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
You know me.

1883
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Always feeling shame.

1884
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Full of food shame.

1885
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Can I say there is a I was curious what we're not getting that Japan has.

1886
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Oh right.

1887
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
And the big thing is I mean there's there's differences between these menus.

1888
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Actually well there's a few in this restaurant or in their equivalent which is the Japanese

1889
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:42,000
canopio I think is his name there and similar desserts but I'm pretty jealous of the here

1890
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
it's a princess peach cupcake.

1891
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Right.

1892
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,000
It's very rich and super pink and a couple types of frosting.

1893
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:56,000
But in Japan you have Princess Peaches cake which is a multi-layer cake looks pretty it

1894
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,000
might be a multi-person dessert which the other ones are not really unless you're just

1895
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,000
sharing little bites but like it's it is raspberries on top couple layers.

1896
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Oh yeah.

1897
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Yes.

1898
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:14,000
And then there is a cracker note or a cookie note either way some food stuff that where

1899
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:21,000
peach has written a note and it says as follows Dear friends I poured my heart into this cake

1900
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
for you.

1901
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
I hope you enjoy it.

1902
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Yours truly peach intense.

1903
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
I think there's a motion in this.

1904
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
In a game.

1905
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Oh I think that might be a little bit of a surprise.

1906
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
I think that might be.

1907
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
I poured my heart is a quote.

1908
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Well the cake.

1909
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
I think she makes the cake in one of the games.

1910
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Oh geez okay oh so on top of that it's a legendary cake.

1911
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
There it is.

1912
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Yeah beautiful.

1913
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,000
I don't there's not like enough there's no emotional please in the desserts.

1914
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I like the Mount Beanpole cake but nobody is telling me like I worked my fingers to the

1915
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
bone.

1916
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Yeah.

1917
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I am exhausted.

1918
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
I am physically worse for having made this cake for you.

1919
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,000
I hope you enjoy it because I'll never enjoy anything again.

1920
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:05,000
When when do you can you get an American dessert that tugs at your heartstrings.

1921
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Boy I don't know you guys haven't had one Jason.

1922
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I mean if they made like an up.

1923
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Now a hypothetical.

1924
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Oh you're sorry an actual one.

1925
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
When was the last time a dessert brought you to tears.

1926
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Oh that's a great question.

1927
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Every trip to CBS.

1928
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
I got those four dollars.

1929
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Well look.

1930
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
I've been eating candy again.

1931
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:30,000
I had been doing well with eating healthier and now I've been eating goddamn candy.

1932
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Did you hit up the leftover Valentine's Day candy.

1933
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,000
No but there was a movie theater box.

1934
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I got to stop.

1935
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Your CVS coupon has unlocked something.

1936
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
It's unlocked something.

1937
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
I was eating less sugar.

1938
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
They tricked me this week.

1939
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
They didn't send it until Sunday so I had a much smaller window to get it.

1940
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Okay well I have to find.

1941
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Again as we said before it's sliding through the door like Indiana Jones.

1942
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I made it.

1943
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
You made it.

1944
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I have to find spinach that I can buy at CVS or mushrooms.

1945
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Do they sell mushrooms at CVS.

1946
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Don't buy your mushrooms at CVS.

1947
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
How bad do you need this deal.

1948
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
They don't have produce at CVS.

1949
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
They might have canned mushrooms.

1950
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Okay.

1951
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Okay.

1952
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
All right.

1953
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
I've been on the show bragging.

1954
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I got a good price on these canned mushrooms.

1955
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
The real deal on these canned mushrooms.

1956
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
So I think I already said we got the tiramisu and the cupcake.

1957
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
I didn't really love either of these things.

1958
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,000
The cupcake was kind of nasty.

1959
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I really didn't get much fun.

1960
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Fetty taste.

1961
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
There wasn't a lot of flavor.

1962
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Too much going on.

1963
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Too much going on.

1964
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Like clashee for us I'd say.

1965
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
The tiramisu.

1966
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:45,000
I mean the square, the actual square of tiramisu inside the like the shortbread cookies were kind of flavorless, kind of bland.

1967
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:50,000
And the actual tiramisu inside didn't really have a lot of tiramisu flavor.

1968
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Like it didn't have the espresso flavor.

1969
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
I know they're not going to dump rum on it or whatever they usually do.

1970
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
But it just kind of was a dry cake.

1971
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:04,000
It almost felt like it was just like a regular cupcake dressed up to look like that dessert.

1972
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Yeah.

1973
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:13,000
You did not have tiramisu because the I wanted to get that for the table when I ordered.

1974
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:19,000
And there was just this very like hesitant looking down from the person working at the counter like,

1975
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Chef Toad has not prepared the question mark cupcake tiramisu today?

1976
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
That's okay.

1977
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
That is fine.

1978
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
We will do something else.

1979
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
That is fine.

1980
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Which one did we have?

1981
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
We had Mount Beanpole.

1982
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
It's like a multi-layer thing.

1983
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
That was the winner for me.

1984
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
You didn't have that Jason?

1985
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
I didn't have that one.

1986
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
And I regret it because I didn't realize until after the fact.

1987
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
I got confused.

1988
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
It's a little like.

1989
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
That it had a little matcha flavor in it.

1990
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Oh yeah, yeah.

1991
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I didn't know that off hand.

1992
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I wouldn't have known how to taste that.

1993
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
But I read it later.

1994
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,000
I'm like, yeah, it did feel like the more mature flavor or something.

1995
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Nice multi-layer cake cut into little very video game looking little blocks.

1996
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
The presentation is so good.

1997
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Yeah.

1998
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
One big one, one little one.

1999
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
You got a little flag in the top.

2000
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
I'll try to get it when we're back.

2001
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I'll try to get that one.

2002
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,000
I think that's the winner from what I could tell.

2003
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,000
So what did I miss?

2004
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,000
You get to meet Toad in the line.

2005
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
We haven't said there's a little video.

2006
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Oh, right.

2007
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Toad introduces the premise.

2008
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
The Toad is making the food.

2009
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
And I maybe had not heard Toad's voice.

2010
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
And the voice is a tad crazy.

2011
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
If I could attempt to do like how did it?

2012
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Okay, okay.

2013
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
It's sort of Mickey, but then a little bit of like gurgle to it.

2014
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I cook stuff up for you.

2015
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:43,000
This is a place where you can relax.

2016
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:48,000
So that's what Toad has sounded like this entire time.

2017
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
He seems like he's been smoking a little bit.

2018
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
It's like a little raspy.

2019
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Mickey with cigarettes.

2020
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Right.

2021
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
A child with cigarettes.

2022
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Yeah.

2023
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
It's like a child Toad still has been smoking.

2024
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Toad is stressed out.

2025
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
It seems like the weight of the kingdom is on Toad in general.

2026
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
You're going to get me for this.

2027
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
It's a hard life.

2028
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I work for royalty.

2029
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:19,000
It's a great, it's a cool little projection, but they really should change it depending on how busy the restaurant is.

2030
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
It should make him far more stressed out if there's a lot of people in line.

2031
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
And if there's not, he should just be like taking it easy.

2032
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
That's not what they're going to do.

2033
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Yeah, yeah.

2034
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Six Toads called in sick.

2035
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Let me guess you all got annual best discounts.

2036
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I'm picking my pocket.

2037
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Do you know about the margins of running restaurants these days?

2038
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Shut it down.

2039
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
They won't let me sell alcohol.

2040
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:49,000
That's where you make your money.

2041
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Toad, you can't drink on the job anymore.

2042
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
You're not allowed to run the place.

2043
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Whose name is on the outside?

2044
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
You call this Diarmusso?

2045
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,000
It's just a cupcake dressed up to look like eggs.

2046
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Oh yeah, well fuck you.

2047
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
You come in here.

2048
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Fuck me.

2049
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
You come in here and tell me how to run my, whose stool?

2050
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
My stool.

2051
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
This is why you're always being kidnapped.

2052
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:16,000
This raspberry, this raspberry sauce on the plate is expired.

2053
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
It tastes horrible.

2054
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
They come in, they love it, they don't care.

2055
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
They're over the atmosphere.

2056
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
You're a douchebag, you know that?

2057
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
You're a go-kart racer, not a chef.

2058
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
What are you doing?

2059
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I'm anything, we all do everything.

2060
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
I play tennis.

2061
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I've been in the Olympic games with them.

2062
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
What's his fuck, Sonic?

2063
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
This is why your wife left you.

2064
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Did you get out of my stool?

2065
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Did you take it?

2066
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
This is never going to be Taffer's stool.

2067
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
I'll be back tomorrow, if you're lucky.

2068
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Toad's just crying.

2069
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Toad vomits.

2070
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
This is adorable pink vomit.

2071
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Yeah, sparkles.

2072
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Don't tell anyone this is what the raspberry syrup's made of.

2073
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
My puke syrup, I'm gay.

2074
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
The syrup is my puke.

2075
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:17,000
I was a little bummed because I feel like Universal has done a great job on both coasts of kind of upping their food game.

2076
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I think the Jurassic World sort of stuff, and they really did that restaurant with a lot of pulled pork and a variety of things.

2077
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
They had a lot of pork and a Ray Puzz.

2078
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Have you had that?

2079
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,000
We had it at the opening, and then I had it in the park after the fact.

2080
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
They were both pretty good.

2081
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I know it was good when I went and got a plate there.

2082
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
You got to check in years later, though.

2083
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
We should have checked in when we were on the patio.

2084
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:52,000
I was very excited that the additional people that the land is providing caused the long dormant Panda Express location on the lower lot to open.

2085
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:57,000
The rumor is that Toad's Kitchen shares kitchen space with that Panda Express.

2086
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
I 100% believe that.

2087
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Some people were wondering why they didn't get rid of the Panda Express because you could get a little more room, but apparently it's the kitchen.

2088
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Oh, so we have a kitchen already.

2089
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Children's hamburgers made in the Panda Express kitchen did not blow us away.

2090
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Well, there's a takeaway food spot right next to it, like prepared sandwiches and salads and stuff.

2091
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:33,000
I feel like both of those probably just with the people walking by, the sheer number of foot traffic probably brings in God knows how many tens of thousands of dollars a year for the place.

2092
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
You're saying it would not be financially viable.

2093
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,000
I'm saying because that was one of my things.

2094
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Why didn't they just demolish those two restaurants and make the land a little more palatable?

2095
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Sure.

2096
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Panda Express is what makes them the money.

2097
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Panda is where it's at.

2098
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Yeah, they got a different Panda Express pretty close.

2099
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,000
And then the one in Ventura Boulevard, pretty close.

2100
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Oh, that's right. Yeah, that's boy.

2101
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
There's a lot of Panda Express within a couple of miles.

2102
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Guess nowadays we'll never know the pure joy of the Panda Express next to the Jurassic Park restaurant, which was serving Pizza Hut personal pizzas and half the Panda Express menu.

2103
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Really?

2104
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Yeah.

2105
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,000
When I went in 2006 for the first time, we're like, what's this place?

2106
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
You get orange chicken at the Jurassic Park?

2107
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:26,000
You get orange chicken and a personal pizza and then half a block away, you could get a larger Panda Express selection.

2108
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Wow. Magic.

2109
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Magic.

2110
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Those were the days.

2111
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Magic of the movies.

2112
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Really quick, just before we get to the real experience, another thing is that you might find it to be a relaxing environment, although very crowded, but then sometimes airships arrive.

2113
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:57,000
There's airships and they shoot bullet bills towards the toads who are walking around your exterior toad views, but then also into the kitchen.

2114
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
You know, I feel bad.

2115
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
You know, I forget about the conditions in these kitchens.

2116
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Yeah.

2117
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I don't remember that every 20 minutes bullet bills are shooting through.

2118
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,000
I really should cut them some slack.

2119
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Here I am going, I don't like the truffle oil.

2120
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Well, they're made under very perverse.

2121
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Yeah.

2122
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Fire bombing of Dresden happening while you get your little boba drink.

2123
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,000
The little, the lemon squash to boba drink was good.

2124
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Like that was pretty fun and the bobas and there was little stars in there.

2125
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:34,000
There was little, I think like pieces of mango that were star shaped were tasty.

2126
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
But the attack.

2127
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
But you have to know when you see the attack.

2128
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Yeah, I saw the attack and I thought it was cute, but we were really far away.

2129
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
So it didn't really bother us.

2130
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
You thought it was cute.

2131
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
I thought it was cute from the distance.

2132
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
I thought it was a horror.

2133
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,000
It was a thunderstorm at first and then I looked up exactly what was happening.

2134
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,000
I saw it saving Private Ryan but with Toads.

2135
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
That's what it was to me.

2136
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Here's what I was hoping.

2137
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:03,000
And maybe really what I was looking for was like a resolution to the like a very triumphant.

2138
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Yeah.

2139
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Like they have pipes in there and I was like, oh, maybe they'll be like some of the pop through the pipe or like Toad will be like, I'm working on it.

2140
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
And like, or duck cover.

2141
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Like if there was like something like element like that.

2142
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:24,000
But it really was just like, well, you're going to feel like pensive for three minutes and then without sort of warning, you won't feel pensive anymore.

2143
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
That's kind of the vibe in there.

2144
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Yeah.

2145
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Well, and also and then also like the window that you're like we're next to a window, a TV window full of Toads milling about at point five miles per hour.

2146
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:50,000
It was kind of like walking a dopey walk and then the bullet bills come and the airships come and then they walk the same pace, but they have mild frowns instead of smiles.

2147
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Yes. And no one's saying anything.

2148
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
So it really was an odd.

2149
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Yeah.

2150
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,000
But isn't that calming that if they're right, they know what happens all the time.

2151
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Yeah.

2152
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
That's what I want is for one of them to say it happens all the time.

2153
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,000
You live another day in paradise.

2154
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Yeah.

2155
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,000
But it's really we're like, oh, cool show or whatever.

2156
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
And then it starts and then the Toads are wandering.

2157
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Then the pensive music starts and then they're just like still like milling about, but maybe a little bit faster.

2158
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
And then the ship, all the ships.

2159
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Okay.

2160
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
I'm looking around like, okay, what's going to happen in here?

2161
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
And then all of a sudden the ships just go away.

2162
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Yeah.

2163
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
I don't know what I wanted.

2164
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Just letting everybody know we're there like the Chinese spy balloons.

2165
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Yeah, I don't know.

2166
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
We're watching you.

2167
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:41,000
I guess I wanted like some I guess I wanted like we talked about an ice capades segment that had Mr.

2168
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Belvedere playing King Koopa and in it.

2169
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Oh, no, you're sorry.

2170
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Yeah.

2171
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:53,000
And I was just game Mario or Luigi has basically like a cannon of some kind that he shoots and blows up like a Koopa Troopa with

2172
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:58,000
sky high kingdom every villain that comes at him and Koopa is murdered.

2173
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
He's dead definitively.

2174
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:07,000
I guess it's in Universal's interest to keep these stories going as long as possible and not kill Koopa once in the restaurant.

2175
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:15,000
But if it's like not give Luigi a handheld mortar so he can just like, but like if we just shot down the airship, that would be cool in the video.

2176
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
That's true.

2177
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Like at least bring it down somehow and then make us feel good that they're not just still out there lurking.

2178
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
And that'll be the resolution.

2179
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,000
I mean, you don't have to have like, oh, help us throw your food at the screen.

2180
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Like, it doesn't have to be something interactive.

2181
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Just take the food your parents have bought.

2182
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Get the back in line and order dessert.

2183
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Order two of every food item.

2184
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Want to throw it Bowser in his airship.

2185
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
As much as possible.

2186
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
The more expensive food is more consistent.

2187
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:49,000
If you're a pass holder, you get the discount, but not in the shop, but here you get the discount.

2188
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Take your coins if you don't do it.

2189
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Oh, you don't want your coin counts to disappear, do you?

2190
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:01,000
They link your coin to the food and your ability to fight bullet bills with food.

2191
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
So I don't know.

2192
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:07,000
I'm just saying there needed to be some resolution to feel like that show was satisfying in there.

2193
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Yeah, it is not the soundest story.

2194
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
I would say.

2195
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:17,000
And it should be quicker than like like Trader Sam's where it's just like, oh, there's the volcanoes blowing.

2196
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Okay, we're fine.

2197
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Yeah.

2198
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Yeah.

2199
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Well, the thing is, it turns out the adventure was not with the Mario characters.

2200
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:33,000
The adventure was with you, as it is always with me, because things in our time there suddenly round a corner.

2201
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:39,000
We've been through all the steps of this process through the different lines and the check with the cons, the trade concierge.

2202
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
And then we are seated and we're eating.

2203
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,000
And I maybe missed the the lead up that we're waiting for our food.

2204
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
But then I and then I sense the stress rising.

2205
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
And can you explain your situation?

2206
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Yeah, look, I don't know what is proper in the in the age of covid and respiratory diseases when you have a child.

2207
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
So Lindsay and I are being, I would say, cautious.

2208
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Is it overly cautious?

2209
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Probably.

2210
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
I don't know.

2211
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
It's frustrating.

2212
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
We're very young child.

2213
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,000
So we've sort of like, well, let's wait till all the vaccinations have happened.

2214
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
That six month mark, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2215
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
So I don't know really what I was thinking.

2216
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:19,000
But when we went into the totes to cafe, I was like, I was hoping I was going to eat this outside.

2217
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:28,000
And after I saw the reality of the of the Super Nintendo land, it was not really a good place to eat anything or do anything or stand anywhere.

2218
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:34,000
So I also thought, OK, maybe they'll give you the food and you can like grab the food and take it or something.

2219
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Not the case either.

2220
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
They're going to bring you the food.

2221
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
You're going to wait inside.

2222
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
And and I don't know how quickly.

2223
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Well, probably I'm starting to get a sense of the situation.

2224
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
And then we are given silverware.

2225
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Yes.

2226
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,000
We realize, oh, this is oddly not much more for all.

2227
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Yeah.

2228
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
This is plates you don't keep.

2229
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
This is this is real nice.

2230
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,000
I mean, I feel like like like with many things, I feel very stupid.

2231
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:08,000
But I'm like, I guess I should go eat outside so I don't get sick in the toadstool cafe and get my child's.

2232
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
I don't know.

2233
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
I'm asked for every other bit of this.

2234
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:15,000
You have an idea of a fucking pandemic and whatever.

2235
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:19,000
So I'm just like, we got a bunch of food.

2236
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
I ordered the biggest hamburger on the menu.

2237
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
I should have ordered the Mario Adventure.

2238
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:28,000
It's smaller at well, though, at the same time, though, it comes in so many parts.

2239
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Right. Right. That's a bunch of five.

2240
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
At least this is one piece.

2241
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
But then you have fries.

2242
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Yes. You know what?

2243
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Actually, fries are as many pieces.

2244
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Yes, that's true.

2245
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,000
I'm starting to watch you do this calculus.

2246
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Yes. And and I think the same thing comes over both Aaron and I.

2247
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,000
We realize, oh, my God, it's a Mike food stress situation.

2248
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
That is correct. This time we are here.

2249
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
One of the classic happened tropes of podcast.

2250
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
The ride. Yes.

2251
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,000
One is occurring and it usually does not happen in front of me.

2252
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
This is a Liberty Tree Tavern.

2253
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
The family feast.

2254
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Oh, my God.

2255
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
It's a mini monster.

2256
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
A mini. Oh, yes.

2257
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
A mini monster throwing the bobas away.

2258
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Yep. I know.

2259
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
You know how this felt to me?

2260
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:13,000
This felt like in Get Back when you watch McCartney come up with Get Back,

2261
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:19,000
when you're watching the moment, the guy who the guy who's the best at the thing he's doing in the moment of creation.

2262
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:22,000
And for you, that is inventing food stress.

2263
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
That's right. And it's it's happy.

2264
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,000
It's like you're figuring out the baseline right then and there.

2265
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
You saw it happen. And I was there for it.

2266
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
And I'm here for it.

2267
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Thank you. Yeah, it was not planned.

2268
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
But it did develop.

2269
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
It now becomes an escape.

2270
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:44,000
It is now an escape situation because also this is not a place where, oh, there's a bunch of exits everywhere in and out.

2271
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
No problem.

2272
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Everything about it is stressful because you've ordered other desserts.

2273
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,000
We wanted to try other things and like the garlic knots.

2274
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:59,000
And again, even if it was like, oh, casual sort of fit in, oh, you go and come in like Ali, blah, blah, blah, come back in and grab a knot or something.

2275
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:09,000
No, there is one exit and there's a guard to make sure no one sneaks in because of the crazy system that's in place because it's opening a few weeks.

2276
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Now, let me say this.

2277
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:17,000
You described the situation because you went to your you're getting progressively more stressed out about the situation.

2278
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Yes. And then you go and you do a recon pass and you come back and you say there's a guard.

2279
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
There's a guard at the door.

2280
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Later, when we leave the restaurant, we see a board 20 year olds at a podium who could have gotten me in trouble.

2281
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,000
And they also might have been really cool.

2282
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
They might have made fun of you.

2283
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Very true.

2284
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Well, that's when you're dealing with young people.

2285
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
That is a possibility.

2286
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:45,000
But again, but here's now what I here's where is the situation.

2287
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Here's the situation where you get in trouble.

2288
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
It is excuse me, sir.

2289
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Where do you think you're going with the food that you own?

2290
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Yeah, the food that you paid for and therefore are rightfully the owner of Mike.

2291
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,000
I'm so sorry.

2292
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:05,000
I wasn't I couldn't we couldn't make it work where it was the same time because I usually have ziploc bags on me when I go to theme parks.

2293
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Is that true?

2294
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,000
You have a bunch of bags every day and then one or two.

2295
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Wait, wait, wait.

2296
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Ho ho ho.

2297
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Every now and then all the time.

2298
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
No, I know.

2299
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
How many now and thens?

2300
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
How many you got on you right now?

2301
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Um, I might have one or two from my trip.

2302
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Can you find eggs?

2303
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,000
I OK.

2304
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
So theme parks.

2305
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:27,000
This was a Sheridan hack we learned a long time ago.

2306
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
And I usually carry a backpack or something.

2307
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Now, Sheridan tradition, an old Sheridan tradition.

2308
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,000
This was a lot easier when phones were like tiny clamshells.

2309
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:42,000
But you shove your wallet and your phone for a water on a water ride and a ziploc bag and they don't get wet.

2310
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
You know, harder with iPhones.

2311
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Let me ask you this.

2312
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Yeah.

2313
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:56,000
If you used your your plastic bag for a water ride to put a wallet in, would you throw the bag out afterward or would you use it to put like a piece of probably throw it throw it out at the end of the day?

2314
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Well, if I was going on a second water ride for the other water, but you would use it for food.

2315
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
No, I wouldn't use for food storage.

2316
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Thank God.

2317
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
OK, OK.

2318
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Thank God.

2319
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,000
You check for bags.

2320
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,000
So Jason always has plastic bags on him, which I did not know.

2321
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Yeah.

2322
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
So another new thing.

2323
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Jason has bags.

2324
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
He's always with.

2325
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Wow.

2326
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,000
You always got your backpack and your backpack has always had bags.

2327
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Wow.

2328
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:23,000
I would, by the way, would not have used those bags.

2329
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Oh, you're not in the bag.

2330
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
You don't know where the bag is.

2331
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Skittles.

2332
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
That's different.

2333
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,000
You can't put a lot of other food in there.

2334
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
It's already got skittles.

2335
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
You know, he's using those wallet bags.

2336
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
I know he says that.

2337
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,000
But then you get them mixed up like which bag is which.

2338
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
I think he's like, you get some sanitizer.

2339
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
He runs.

2340
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,000
You get in the bathroom, put some soap in there, and suddenly it's a new bag.

2341
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
But not to you.

2342
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
And then he's shoving those.

2343
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Then he's going right to the toppings bar and throwing tomatoes.

2344
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
I think I just have one this time.

2345
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Sorry.

2346
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
One bag.

2347
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Oh, that's pretty good.

2348
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
All right.

2349
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
All right.

2350
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
And probably some from traveling.

2351
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Probably some toiletries or something.

2352
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Uh-huh.

2353
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Well, I want to know what toiletries you have.

2354
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Well, shampoo.

2355
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
You have shampoo in your bag right now?

2356
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,000
No, not in my bag.

2357
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,000
I think I brought it in case I needed one, in case I forgot one.

2358
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
OK.

2359
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Or something leeched.

2360
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
We brought it on vacation.

2361
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Oh, OK.

2362
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Oh, yeah, for Christmas.

2363
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Like Christmas vacation.

2364
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
OK.

2365
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2366
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
But not in Universal Hollywood.

2367
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Let's get back to this.

2368
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
OK.

2369
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:23,000
So now, so again, there is a guard, the scariest guard you could ever have met.

2370
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:28,000
This is where I'm like, you know when like rugrats, when you see what the babies see

2371
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,000
and you see how much scarier everything is?

2372
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Yes.

2373
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Once I saw the guard that you described as a guard, I'm like, OK, so Mike's imagination

2374
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,000
grew the guy up to eight feet.

2375
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
He suddenly has brawny arms.

2376
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,000
It's probably as an Arnold voice now.

2377
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

2378
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Where do you think you're going?

2379
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
You're a puny man.

2380
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Picturing maybe a bomb bomb?

2381
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Oh, well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2382
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Uh-huh.

2383
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
A literal ticking time bomb.

2384
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Yeah.

2385
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Uh-huh.

2386
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
And you don't know.

2387
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
You don't want that thing to go off in front of you.

2388
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
No.

2389
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,000
So yeah, you have an enemy.

2390
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
This is very Mario.

2391
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
There's an enemy guarding the gate.

2392
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
What are you going to do?

2393
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:11,000
So now you're trying to figure out ways to smuggle the food that you paid for out of

2394
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
the Mario Cafe.

2395
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Yes.

2396
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Erin and I are offering suggestions.

2397
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Many.

2398
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
And she said, well, just we got some napkins here.

2399
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
We'd have to ask for more.

2400
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
And we don't want to make the stressed-out wait staff do that.

2401
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:27,000
But we could wrap the burger in a number of napkins.

2402
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Erin said you could put it in your hood.

2403
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Not a bad idea.

2404
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Because now it becomes the food can't be seen.

2405
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
They can't know that you have food coming out of it.

2406
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:39,000
It felt like it was wrong to take the food out of this location.

2407
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Obviously, who cares?

2408
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:44,000
But for some reason, the way it was set up to me felt like a fortress.

2409
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Mike, I saw people with to-go boxes.

2410
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
I saw people with take-out boxes.

2411
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
We'll get there.

2412
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,000
We'll get there.

2413
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,000
We'll get there.

2414
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Because that at least made me feel better.

2415
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
You mean like a restaurant would have?

2416
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Yeah, like a restaurant.

2417
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Oh, Scott, you got it.

2418
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
You know my man.

2419
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
We'll get there.

2420
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,000
We'll get there.

2421
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Because food often has to be transported out of restaurants.

2422
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
And this is not a bank vault.

2423
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:08,000
And I'm aware of some of this, but I don't want to say because again,

2424
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
I'm watching the moment of creation happen.

2425
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
You got to save it for the year.

2426
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
So I'm trying to think of whatever.

2427
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
I believe I had the idea.

2428
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,000
I think that burger would all fit inside your in-95.

2429
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,000
In the mask.

2430
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
I think you open up that baby.

2431
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:25,000
You're pretty low on oxygen, so you got to do that walk as fast as you can.

2432
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:28,000
But you just got burger pressed right up against your face.

2433
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,000
It's like a feedback.

2434
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Yeah.

2435
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Which you could go outside and keep using that way.

2436
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
That could be a fun way to eat a burger.

2437
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
That would have been easier, I think, actually.

2438
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:41,000
But then it gets tough with fries because fries are dangling out of the thing.

2439
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:47,000
But what does not, I want to encourage the hijinks.

2440
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:53,000
But how do you not just say I am eating outside for COVID purposes?

2441
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Doesn't that get you past the guard?

2442
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Yeah.

2443
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Of course it does.

2444
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I didn't say anything to the guard.

2445
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,000
I have to use the bathroom.

2446
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Or like I'm feeling dizzy.

2447
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
I need to just get some air and come back in.

2448
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,000
I have a time sensitive issue with the glow in the dark turtles that need to be ordered.

2449
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,000
I have to make a phone call in a place where there is not a bombing.

2450
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
I have to call San Diego.

2451
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:18,000
You have to believe me when I say I actually didn't think I was going to be stopped.

2452
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Uh-huh.

2453
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,000
But I did.

2454
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
I don't know if it's really if I analyzed what it was was like.

2455
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:29,000
I don't want to have like a baby size arm full of food on the way out in front of the person.

2456
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Because maybe they don't want people to.

2457
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,000
I don't really know exactly when I analyze what I was thinking.

2458
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:42,000
It wasn't that I thought I was going to go to universal jail or that it was like so forbidden to eat out there.

2459
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Are you going to bring some paper plates when we go back to this land?

2460
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
It's a very good question.

2461
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
A very, very good question.

2462
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
I think I kind of know what to do.

2463
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Bring some bags.

2464
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
I guess I got to swing by my house.

2465
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
I'm going to be going to bring my bags.

2466
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,000
I just said to take the bag.

2467
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Maybe bring your own bags.

2468
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,000
He's got dirty bags.

2469
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Yeah.

2470
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
We can also just use that.

2471
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
That's the cheat code for Toad.

2472
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Like, could I get that actually boxed up to go?

2473
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,000
You know, that's the Chewbacca.

2474
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Do you think you could just just tell them?

2475
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Well, that's what we get.

2476
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
We sort of get there is what happened.

2477
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
You went back and explored.

2478
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
So I went around.

2479
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:27,000
There was a couple of booths that were not populated, like felt like birthday booth or like the Fuddruckers Tonight Show booth that existed in the Burbank Fuddruckers.

2480
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Oh, of course.

2481
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
But in the corner of this Toadstool Cafe.

2482
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Is there like a room?

2483
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Is there like a private room or something like that?

2484
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
It was set back.

2485
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:39,000
It was other tables and it didn't feel like it was super special, but there was no one there.

2486
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,000
And I wonder why they weren't seating people there because believe me, it was busy.

2487
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:46,000
So it would make sense that you put somebody back there, but I don't know.

2488
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
So, yeah, I walked around.

2489
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
You did a pass.

2490
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Got the lay of the land.

2491
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Start formulating the escape.

2492
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
OK, first things first.

2493
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
We got to get past those goods.

2494
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
All right.

2495
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
I'll crawl under the table.

2496
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Use the pipes.

2497
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,000
I'll hide.

2498
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Is that running by the fire?

2499
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:10,000
That fire, whatever it is, those long, elongated fire things that come out of the blocks.

2500
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
This is what I've been waiting for my whole life.

2501
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
I played Mario my whole life.

2502
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:22,000
And if I know Mario levels, I can just hit the ceiling and go one of those secret layers of top and I could just over pat overshoot this entire thing.

2503
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
I don't even have to fight the bad guys.

2504
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:28,000
And maybe there'll be war pipes that just take me all the way back up to the upper lot.

2505
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
If I can get a star, I can do that.

2506
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,000
That's it.

2507
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:35,000
And I can like run through and no one will even sort of notice me flips around.

2508
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,000
He's dead.

2509
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Run so fast you end up next to the end ominous.

2510
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Sure.

2511
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Sure.

2512
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,000
In the upper level of the water.

2513
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
He's out.

2514
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,000
He's a lakeside country club.

2515
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Suddenly he's on hole 14.

2516
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:51,000
So, yeah, those are all all the scenarios are going around in my mind.

2517
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,000
And then I sat back down and I said, oh, you know what they have?

2518
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Because I will say this.

2519
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
I didn't think they had to go things.

2520
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
I don't know why.

2521
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:06,000
This is fair because it is a restaurant that is sometimes a formal sit down restaurant and sometimes seemingly missing the basic functionality.

2522
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,000
I really I didn't think that was possible.

2523
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,000
I go, I'm thinking this.

2524
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
I'm like, they don't have like to go thing.

2525
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Like, so what am I going to?

2526
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
So then I go, you know what?

2527
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,000
They do have extra cups.

2528
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:25,000
They have extra cups so I can throw the fries into the extra cup cups.

2529
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Hey, by the way, cups and napkins.

2530
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:31,000
They do have Super Mario or Super Nintendo World exclusive.

2531
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
You know, they got the logo on the cups and napkins.

2532
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,000
That's true.

2533
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,000
A little.

2534
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
You need to break your fries.

2535
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
You also get a souvenir, too.

2536
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:42,000
So I found somebody who was very nice working there.

2537
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
I said, excuse me.

2538
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
I was speaking hushed.

2539
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:50,000
I remember I go, do you have like an extra like an extra cup?

2540
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:55,000
I'm going to take some of the food out and I want to put like the fries like in there.

2541
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:59,000
She goes, oh, well, do you just want like a we have a big cupcake like to go.

2542
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
I go, that would be perfect.

2543
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,000
And I make a big show like, oh, thank you so much.

2544
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,000
This is great.

2545
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
And I truly I was like blown away that they even have it.

2546
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:10,000
And I go, of course they would have it because sometimes you don't want the dessert.

2547
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:16,000
That would be unreasonable to force everybody to eat their big desserts in that area.

2548
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,000
If you when we go together.

2549
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Yes, I will get the dessert to go for you.

2550
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,000
You can wait outside.

2551
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,000
You don't have to come.

2552
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
You don't have to relive this horror story.

2553
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Jason will talk to the guards for we are days.

2554
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Thank you for thank you for doing that.

2555
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,000
I will get you something.

2556
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
I'll get you something to go.

2557
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Well, we'll discuss it before it.

2558
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
We'll figure it out.

2559
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
And I will examine the bag that you're going to use.

2560
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Park.

2561
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Well, you were talking about the pulled pork being delicious.

2562
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,000
So maybe it was pretty good.

2563
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Maybe I will.

2564
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:52,000
I could bring the pulled pork from Jurassic Park into Nintendo land and eat the pulled

2565
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:56,000
pork while I walk around listening to the corn noises.

2566
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Sure, sure.

2567
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:01,000
And I can have a great path to a drastic beer as well.

2568
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Jordan, can you pull up that that burger photo that you had a while ago?

2569
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Because now you know not only the truck, not pull up the truck.

2570
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
That was a bait and switch.

2571
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
I don't want to see Leo.

2572
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
I don't want to hear Leo.

2573
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
OK, so all right.

2574
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Now, Jack, the cigarette is that's great.

2575
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,000
I'll see that all day.

2576
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
But now we know the contact when you pull this up before.

2577
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
We think this is just Mike looking at a burger.

2578
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,000
This is Mike contemplating how to jailbreak this burger.

2579
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,000
That's right.

2580
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
We need to bust this burger out.

2581
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,000
And so we're figuring out the plan here.

2582
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
You get the cut or you get the to go containers.

2583
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,000
So now you got that.

2584
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,000
We can.

2585
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,000
That is enough room to put the fries.

2586
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Did you put the burger in the I just held.

2587
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Well, I put a napkin and held the burger separately.

2588
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:49,000
But then we're thinking, wait a minute, this is no ordinary circumstance where you just

2589
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,000
walk out with the food.

2590
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
We got all these things that you need to try.

2591
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:58,000
People need to know how much you don't like the pink cupcake or unsatisfied by the garlic

2592
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
not. I was.

2593
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Did you try that pink?

2594
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,000
I sure did.

2595
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
I eating it.

2596
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:06,000
I was like, this seems like a thing that Mike is going to order.

2597
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
And I bet he's not going to like it.

2598
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,000
No.

2599
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Well, you did it.

2600
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,000
You tried it.

2601
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,000
But it was kind of a blur.

2602
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Basically was you had done a commendable job fitting fries into that to go.

2603
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Yes. But we're like, wait a minute.

2604
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,000
You have to talk.

2605
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
This is your job.

2606
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Your job is to talk about these desserts and these garlic knots.

2607
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
We got to get them out.

2608
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:31,000
You should also say I put the fries in the cupcake to go container and then I dumped all the ketchup on top of them.

2609
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:35,000
So that's important fry truffle fries, ketchup.

2610
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
And then Jordan, can we go to the photo?

2611
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Mike food, too.

2612
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
So we're like, how much can we pack onto this?

2613
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:45,000
So now what you see is a mount is a macho mount people.

2614
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
You have pink frosting.

2615
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Yeah, we even gave you the crown, the very nice.

2616
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Yeah.

2617
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Then you have a garlic knot that you did dip in the marinara.

2618
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
And this is all on top of ketchup and fries.

2619
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:03,000
And we gave you the flag because like Mario reaching for the top of that leg, you were overcome.

2620
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,000
You're trying to overcome a major challenge concerned about germs.

2621
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
But everyone, everyone get in there.

2622
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Everyone touch that food a little.

2623
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,000
This is a thing.

2624
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I were going to if there was heavy covid in the Toadstool Cafe, mask or no mask.

2625
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
I think you got that covid.

2626
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
This is the most crowded.

2627
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
I think it's the same outside.

2628
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Outside is probably like like, well, that is it is so packed.

2629
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
It is so packed outside of Nintendo land.

2630
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,000
That's a fairly good point.

2631
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:34,000
But I'll say this. I'm coming out of this pandemic less worried about service germs and way more worried about airborne terms.

2632
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Oh, sure. Yeah.

2633
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:40,000
That's fine with eating food that all your friends are filing onto a platter for you.

2634
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Kind of. Yeah.

2635
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:47,000
But after after a well, that's why I say wheels and goggles all day.

2636
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
That's why I say I don't it's silly.

2637
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
I don't know. I feel crazy.

2638
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I feel silly sometimes.

2639
01:53:53,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I don't know what's the right thing to do, but I know that a food pile at the very least is amusing.

2640
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,000
It was a lot of fun.

2641
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Well, you did the right thing to do.

2642
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
The KFC famous bowl.

2643
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Jordan, can we see Mike Food 3, please?

2644
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:14,000
And this is the some results and you opted for holding the burger and not putting it into your mask.

2645
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,000
But look how much you fit it.

2646
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:23,000
This is a meal, not just a burger and fries, but also a sampling of desserts, children's toys, flags and hats up top.

2647
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:27,000
He has not unlocked the advanced player ability.

2648
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
You say, could I have a couple boxes?

2649
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:34,000
He would have to go back to the that's when the guards get suspicious.

2650
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
That's when he's not talking to the guards.

2651
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,000
The hostess is like, maybe the guard should be let in on this.

2652
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Can we get the guards on the walkie?

2653
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Hey, pal, what are you trying to pull here?

2654
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Are you going to eat this food in addition to carrying it out?

2655
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,000
What's your deal?

2656
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:56,000
The food that you paid twenty two dollars for somewhere where we didn't say to eat it several feet away.

2657
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,000
This is it really I'll be it's impressive.

2658
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,000
It looks like I could like palm two basketballs.

2659
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
I'm holding so much so much at once.

2660
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Thank God nobody got the spaghetti and meatballs.

2661
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Oh, my God.

2662
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
These meatballs would have blown this whole thing up.

2663
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
It's all a Bob on that goes sky high.

2664
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Those two meatballs that Jason said were this big or so.

2665
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
I have really small hands.

2666
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
So you're supposed to like in proportion.

2667
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Maybe wouldn't have been able to pull this.

2668
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Oh, I wouldn't be able to do any of this.

2669
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Also, he wouldn't have gotten himself in this situation.

2670
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
This fine mess that he's got himself in.

2671
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:34,000
No, I would just I would have just called it and lied my way through this.

2672
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:37,000
I would just let the everyone else hear the conversation.

2673
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
So he didn't really get too crowded.

2674
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:44,000
So, yeah, so I carried all of this past the guard successfully.

2675
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,000
And what kind of guard are you?

2676
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:51,000
And when and when I went out with food, it might have been happening all day.

2677
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Yes, I went outside and I tried to sit right outside the Toadstool Cafe.

2678
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
No, you cannot do that.

2679
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
That's where the line is forming.

2680
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:07,000
So I got one bite in, and then it was clear that the other people were being loaded right in front of me.

2681
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
No, not good.

2682
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
You go over here, actually stand over here.

2683
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
OK, sounds good.

2684
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding.

2685
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
All right, maybe I not like to be here.

2686
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,000
OK, you did find a spot.

2687
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:27,000
I did eventually find the quietest spot, I think, in Super Nintendo Land, which is there was like a big, a tall planter.

2688
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
I think is where I was.

2689
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
I have a picture of it.

2690
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:36,000
And it was near it was near some things that kids could sit on if they wanted that were big toadstools.

2691
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Well, I got to find that because I'm practically child size.

2692
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
So I should. Yeah.

2693
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Unless it's a very evocative photos for getting meatballs.

2694
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Yes.

2695
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
And Leo the truck.

2696
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Leo the truck.

2697
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
You know, I'll get a better shot.

2698
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:58,000
I have some video of the food pile and sort of going walking through and I'll post that to social media.

2699
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Well, I did an interview.

2700
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Right. Yes.

2701
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
We have an interview to post as well.

2702
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
That'll be on the socials that podcast the ride there.

2703
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
I just saved myself a plug.

2704
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Yeah.

2705
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
And so so you'll see all of that in depth.

2706
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:17,000
That'll really drive a lot of people to go to the social media to see what I think of the different frosting that's been soaked in ketchup.

2707
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:26,000
How does the how did the two types of pink frosting that even Jason didn't like, how did they complement ketchup and truffle?

2708
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,000
I think truffle too.

2709
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:30,000
If there's truffle on fries, they often skip the ketchup.

2710
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Mm hmm.

2711
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Wow.

2712
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
So there you have it.

2713
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
But how is the Jurassic patio?

2714
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
You guys have mentioned that multiple times.

2715
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
After all that, my God.

2716
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Oh, never did I need a Jurassic patio more.

2717
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Never did Erin need a Jurassic.

2718
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Oh, she was she was thrilled.

2719
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Yeah.

2720
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Look, you know, she has no bridge to burn with Universal PR.

2721
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
She'll hey, we're going to complement another universal thing.

2722
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Jurassic patio.

2723
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
That's the that's the king of the kingdom.

2724
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,000
That's you're talking.

2725
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000
What are the drinks at the hut and then carry it upstairs?

2726
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Oh, that's right.

2727
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:02,000
OK.

2728
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Yeah.

2729
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Yeah.

2730
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:08,000
And you and you're going to want to take a sip before you get up there because that's a lot of real.

2731
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Real.

2732
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Yeah.

2733
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:13,000
You do the big boy, which Erin did again.

2734
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Long days of coins and Leo the truck.

2735
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
She deserved that big boy.

2736
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,000
There needs to be.

2737
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:23,000
I think a Jurassic patio in the Super Nintendo Land would fix all the problems.

2738
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
There's upstairs space.

2739
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
There should be a place with layers.

2740
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:32,000
You know where I felt a lot of peace was in that single rider line that kind of takes you out.

2741
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
You kind of veer off to the right.

2742
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:38,000
And then we actually got a chance to like take a couple of photos, look at the whole land.

2743
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Right.

2744
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:49,000
And if they could carve out a little corn, some little like stoop overhang to just kind of like sit, people watch, just watch that thwomp go over and over.

2745
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
And I think maybe you got it more in Japan.

2746
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:55,000
From what I can tell, Japan built up and they built down.

2747
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:59,000
I think that there's like I think you enter the castle on level two.

2748
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Yes, that's right.

2749
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
And then there's terraces that go down.

2750
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,000
And I think that might be where Kenope or Toad is.

2751
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:08,000
And there's more going on on those upper levels.

2752
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,000
We've been on the fact that we didn't get the Yoshi Adventure ride.

2753
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
I see how they didn't have room for it.

2754
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:18,000
But we didn't get our our little the Yoshi Snack spot there in a popcorn place.

2755
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Yeah.

2756
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
And I think some games that we didn't get.

2757
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,000
There is a room with a Bob-omb.

2758
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:29,000
You know, I understand it's limited space there.

2759
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:34,000
But, you know, I still want for more.

2760
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
I don't know.

2761
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:44,000
And now I wonder, now my question is, what do you do if we are to get this Donkey Kong coaster and I want it?

2762
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Where do you go?

2763
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Jordan, can you pull up the photo demolished stages?

2764
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Because this is a little bit of pre Mario action and it kind of shows you the space that you're you're working with.

2765
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:02,000
And yeah, so this is the this is demolished sound stages where Mario is now.

2766
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
You keep going back.

2767
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:07,000
You got sound stages, but now we're moving production out.

2768
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
You go all the way to the right.

2769
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:12,000
That's a big heavy duty office building and parking garage.

2770
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
They're never getting rid of that one.

2771
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:24,000
You can't get rid of the white building a few levels back where that they refurbished for the Conan Tonight show and then demolished blew up the entire plan seven months later.

2772
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,000
You got to keep that.

2773
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
That's television history.

2774
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Where do you go?

2775
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Where do we get more Mario?

2776
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Shoot, I forget the name of the number.

2777
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
I think I'm sure it's like an Alicia Stella rumor.

2778
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
I'm stealing again where it's maybe I said this already.

2779
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Whatever like the voice wherever the voice offices were is the rumor.

2780
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Where they're going to put Donkey Kong, which is around here.

2781
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
I just forget which ones they are.

2782
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:51,000
And now they did they demolish the Phantom of the Opera stage?

2783
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,000
The like haunted.

2784
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Yes, yes.

2785
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,000
That is gone.

2786
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
That's been gone for a long time.

2787
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
You are too stupid.

2788
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
That's that's spooky.

2789
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
That's the thing they tell you is haunted.

2790
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
It's really film the original Phantom of the Opera.

2791
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:11,000
And there was this ornate theater set that was still in there that you can see in the Jason Segel Muppets movie, which I got to go to the set of.

2792
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,000
For funny or die.

2793
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Yes, I met Walter.

2794
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Hate to brag.

2795
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Hate to name drop.

2796
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
But I did get to go in there.

2797
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:20,000
We joke about that.

2798
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
But I feel like there's a lot of Walter stands out there.

2799
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:26,000
I mean, I liked meeting him and I haven't seen the movie yet.

2800
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:29,000
I'm meeting a new Muppet and he's talking to me in character.

2801
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
It actually was pretty fantastic.

2802
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:36,000
But I got I mean, for that bit of history, it is funny they took that out of all the sound stages.

2803
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
It's the one with a ton of history.

2804
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
You know what I found out today?

2805
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Well, a couple of things.

2806
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
You know what was done in that sound stage?

2807
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:47,000
All the interiors of the Bates House and Psycho were all in that same stage.

2808
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Twenty eight.

2809
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:52,000
And any set they built, they'd have to keep that Phantom of the Opera set around, just build around it.

2810
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
So just other things would would use it.

2811
02:01:54,000 --> 02:02:03,000
And an important scene to me, which is the part of Xanadu where the forties band merges with the new wave band.

2812
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,000
You know I love that.

2813
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,000
And they're making the same.

2814
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:10,000
This is like when our minds sync up, when the forties and the eighties meet.

2815
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Yeah, I watched Xanadu over the summer shortly after Olivia Newton-John passed.

2816
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:21,000
I think I was one of the movies, like I booted up a bunch of movies when I had covid.

2817
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:26,000
And I watched like the Heartbreak Kid and Xanadu and very odd selection.

2818
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Very odd.

2819
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:28,000
That's a great movie.

2820
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Double feature to watch.

2821
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Yeah.

2822
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:31,000
With the novel Coronavirus.

2823
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
But yeah, Xanadu was so much fun.

2824
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,000
What a delight.

2825
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:37,000
One of the most crazy weird sequences in it.

2826
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Filmed in that sound station.

2827
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:42,000
And that is now that is literally where the Mario Kart ride building is.

2828
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,000
And I'm upset.

2829
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Glad we got the ride.

2830
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:49,000
But did we have to take out where the Got Some Dancing to Do song?

2831
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,000
That should have been.

2832
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Dancing to do.

2833
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:55,000
The government should have put that under like national park protection.

2834
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Yeah, well, it's you know, I blame every which president?

2835
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,000
I blame Reagan.

2836
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,000
I blame Bush.

2837
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
I blame everyone up through Trump.

2838
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Oh, no, Obama.

2839
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,000
I'm sorry.

2840
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,000
You know what?

2841
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:07,000
It went down on Obama's watch.

2842
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Oh, right.

2843
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:13,000
And look, I prefer him to Trump, but he let that Xanadu stage slide and I'll never forgive

2844
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,000
him.

2845
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Thanks, Obama.

2846
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Thanks, Obama.

2847
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:21,000
But anyway, you're you're you're boxed in and it's a big ride and it's a largely outdoor

2848
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,000
ride.

2849
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,000
They cannot.

2850
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:29,000
If the rumors are true of what the Donkey Kong ride is, they cannot compromise, even

2851
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:35,000
if it's just the ride and no land can not compromise because of how cool it sounds.

2852
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Jordan, can we see the photo Donkey Kong construction?

2853
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:43,000
This kind of shows you the let me show you the circles here.

2854
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Roller coasters at one like if they build that fast and the furious thing built into

2855
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
the hill, they're in different spots.

2856
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Yeah, different spots.

2857
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:51,000
People love them.

2858
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:54,000
They might have to stagger them in the in the photo.

2859
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:00,000
There's a big red oval and that is showing you the entirety of Nintendo World.

2860
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:04,000
The yellow oval is the under construction Mario.

2861
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
I'm sorry, Donkey Kong coaster.

2862
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
This is Epic Universe.

2863
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,000
That's huge.

2864
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,000
That's like more than half of it.

2865
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Yes, it's huge.

2866
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Dwarfs the rest.

2867
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
So they need sizable footage.

2868
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:18,000
It shows you how great it's going to be in Epic Universe in Japan when they get it.

2869
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
But what do we do?

2870
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
And let me say this.

2871
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,000
I think you've done your time.

2872
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Let's demolish that building.

2873
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,000
I don't know if it would fit.

2874
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:26,000
But and everything over there.

2875
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,000
What do we got?

2876
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Starbucks.

2877
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,000
That's out.

2878
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:30,000
It's all out.

2879
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
And now that would split the the rides up.

2880
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:37,000
But I know that's the that's it still feels like Universal Hollywood.

2881
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:40,000
It's impossible to just make it a fun like a unified place.

2882
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
There's still like piecemealing.

2883
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Let's throw that.

2884
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,000
It's not going to.

2885
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,000
I guess it's not going to happen.

2886
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Yeah.

2887
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:50,000
But if you want them next to each other and blue sky, all options.

2888
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Go ahead.

2889
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Go ahead.

2890
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Go ahead.

2891
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
We have had a decade of Transformers.

2892
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Right.

2893
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Maybe it's time to I mean, don't you want the cohesion?

2894
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:04,000
You were just saying you want the rise to be and we're getting next to it wouldn't make

2895
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
sense the other way.

2896
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,000
And that's transform.

2897
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:09,000
That's the old transform getting the rise of the beast.

2898
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,000
The beasts are rising soon.

2899
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Well, if you want to be a rise, you're going to make a new if you want to make a new like

2900
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:18,000
footage for the ride and put the beast one on the other.

2901
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Like footage for the ride and put the Beast Wars characters on the Transformers.

2902
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Right.

2903
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,000
OK, I'm open to that perhaps.

2904
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:26,000
But I look, let's not get crazy here.

2905
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:31,000
OK, Universal needs to we're going to lose the Simpson ride at a certain point.

2906
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Mummy is of course going to go.

2907
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Transformers is going to become our E.T.

2908
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Transformers is going to become the E.T. of Universal Hollywood, the classic attraction

2909
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:45,000
that you take your kids to and the grandparents still love it.

2910
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:49,000
It's maybe it's going to take a few decades, but we cannot lose.

2911
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:53,000
We need a little history as far as Universal Hollywood.

2912
02:05:53,000 --> 02:06:00,000
So when E.T. says your name, that is equivalent to Optimus Prime giving you this giving you

2913
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,000
the intimate moment.

2914
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Yes.

2915
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,000
It's going to like take it out.

2916
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:07,000
It kind of I mean, this ride, this line isn't in the ride, but like E.T.'s I'll Be Right

2917
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Here.

2918
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
It hasn't has that done its time called.

2919
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,000
It's been a long time.

2920
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Isn't the new version your bravery saved the planet?

2921
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Yeah, botanic kiss.

2922
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
It's like a new generation's baton.

2923
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Well, he's the give me another like even candidate out here.

2924
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:27,000
I don't I don't think we have one.

2925
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Right.

2926
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:33,000
I think unless you're willing to reenact your passing the guard adventure daily, it becomes

2927
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
a new Universal stunt show.

2928
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
We don't have we don't have our compelling story.

2929
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Vinnigans super silly funland.

2930
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,000
OK.

2931
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
Oh, the bar where you go to get hammered.

2932
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Hammered.

2933
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
Maybe that's good.

2934
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:49,000
The railroad apartment bar, the bar that's like a walk-in closet.

2935
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,000
That's good.

2936
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,000
But I don't know.

2937
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:54,000
I don't think I think I think we have to keep Transformers.

2938
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Now, maybe they just move Transformers.

2939
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
You know, maybe you pick it up and move it.

2940
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
I don't know.

2941
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,000
You can move a house.

2942
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:02,000
You can move a ride.

2943
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Yeah.

2944
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
With enough gumption you can.

2945
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Yeah.

2946
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Well, like Jason said, cancel the stages.

2947
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:11,000
We hate the Olympics, so we're canceling the stages and anything else that might ever be

2948
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,000
filmed there.

2949
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Right.

2950
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Up Transformers over there.

2951
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Yeah.

2952
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,000
And we get everything we want.

2953
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Fine.

2954
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Pretty far.

2955
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
I mean, you're pretty pretty close to Warner Brothers at that point.

2956
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Barn Boulevard, you know, I I also I'll say this in all seriousness, putting a Donkey

2957
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Kong land that's very connected would at least make it feel less claustrophobic.

2958
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Sure.

2959
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,000
I think maybe not.

2960
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Maybe if it's just a small war.

2961
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:37,000
But I think that there'll be some feeling of like, oh, we can go over here and maybe

2962
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
that's a different vibe than here.

2963
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Isn't there a concept for like a Hyrule thing?

2964
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Hasn't that always been linked?

2965
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,000
I don't know if there's an official.

2966
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:47,000
I don't think there's an official concept, but I mean, there's that's coming for sure

2967
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,000
in some form.

2968
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,000
There's Pikmin.

2969
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,000
I didn't really get a chance.

2970
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,000
There's Pikmin around the land.

2971
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Yes.

2972
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Binoculars.

2973
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Did you do the binoculars?

2974
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:56,000
No, we didn't do them.

2975
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:57,000
They're like augmented reality.

2976
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Yeah, we'll do that.

2977
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,000
And they add stuff.

2978
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Yeah.

2979
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Pikmin.

2980
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:02,000
Could it?

2981
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,000
We didn't really get up to the second floor.

2982
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
It was pretty crowded by that.

2983
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Look, there's never going to be Star Fox land, which is my favorite thing.

2984
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Sure.

2985
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Popular enough.

2986
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:14,000
And there hasn't been a good Star Fox game in many, many years.

2987
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:20,000
So but but they're going to try to keep expanding this and there's going to be more Nintendo.

2988
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:25,000
They'll probably end up being Nintendo in Islands of Adventure and Universal proper,

2989
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:26,000
I think.

2990
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Oh, maybe.

2991
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Probably keep growing once they run out of land at Epic Universe.

2992
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:34,000
What would have been the new like Animal Crossing Splatoon?

2993
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Well, Animal Crossing and Pokemon and Animal Crossing are two major ones.

2994
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Oh, sure.

2995
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
So those and then Zelda probably.

2996
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,000
OK.

2997
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Metroid is still pretty popular.

2998
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Oh, yeah.

2999
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,000
But that could be cool.

3000
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Mm hmm.

3001
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,000
It is.

3002
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Look, it's very Mario centric.

3003
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Right.

3004
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
It's certainly could just be Super Mario World.

3005
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:56,000
I'm almost maybe this is where we can end it.

3006
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:59,000
I'm almost upset that they got to Mario Kart this early.

3007
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Wow.

3008
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:04,000
I always think there should maybe be a maybe have been a proper Mario ride.

3009
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Dark ride.

3010
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Yeah, I thought this is for the next episode will lead us in.

3011
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:13,000
But Mario Kart almost feels in the same way that in the trailer for the Mario movie,

3012
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
they're already doing Mario Kart.

3013
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
And I go, Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3014
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Don't we want 10 sequels here?

3015
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:18,000
You ain't racing yet.

3016
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Don't we want a Mario Kart movie?

3017
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa is what I say.

3018
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Let's slow down.

3019
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:27,000
So you want a movie that is the equivalent of a queue.

3020
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Yes.

3021
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:29,000
With details.

3022
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Take your time.

3023
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Yes.

3024
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Appreciate every detail.

3025
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,000
The first.

3026
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Why are we rushing to a ride?

3027
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:38,000
The first movie ends with Mario and Luigi getting to the Mushroom Kingdom.

3028
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
It ends there.

3029
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Mm hmm.

3030
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Just the first part where they're like plumbers in Brooklyn.

3031
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Well, now we're back to now we're back to Super Mario Bros.

3032
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Live action.

3033
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Essentially, I guess that's what I really after all this, that's really what I want.

3034
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Yeah.

3035
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,000
All right.

3036
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Demolish the land.

3037
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:56,000
I'm a children's Blade Runner.

3038
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
And now we're in business.

3039
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,000
OK.

3040
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,000
You survived podcast the ride.

3041
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:03,000
The first part of our Super Nintendo deep dive.

3042
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:07,000
We will return not next week, but the week after that we're going to take a little late

3043
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:14,000
President's Day and reflect on the sins of Obama who let the zanity stage go.

3044
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
And so we'll be off.

3045
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,000
But then we'll be back with more Nintendo stuff after that.

3046
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Thanks to Jordan Katz for producing this episode.

3047
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:24,000
You can watch this on YouTube on the Forever Dog Channel.

3048
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:30,000
There's bonus episodes on our Patreon podcast, the ride, the second gate and our VIP tier

3049

You will find all of that at Patreon dot com slash podcast the ride.

3051
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Well, a long episode.

3052
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Let's get the hell out of here.

3053
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Yeah.

3054
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:47,000
How are we going to get past this forever dog guards?

3055
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Forever.

3056
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Dog.

3057
02:10:51,000 --> 02:11:02,000
This has been a forever dog production executive produced by Mike Carlson, Jason Sheridan, Scott Gardner, Brett Bohm, Joe Sileo and Alex Ramsey.
