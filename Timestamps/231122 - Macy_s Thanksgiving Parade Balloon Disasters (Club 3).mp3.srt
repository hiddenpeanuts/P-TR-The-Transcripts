1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Club Three.

2
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,640
Welcome to Club Three where your cartoon friends go to die.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,280
I'm Scott joined by Mike and Jason and just imagine big inflatable versions of all of us

4
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:46,800
lunging, lunging of our own might straight into lamp posts and ripping our faces open.

5
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,480
Occasionally I first.

6
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,620
Yeah.

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,480
I was not prepared for how gruesome this episode would be.

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,960
If you kind of view it as these are the characters and this is something that's happening to them,

9
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,640
it really puts a really almost like a metal light on what's happening.

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,560
Of course it's balloons.

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,000
It's but if you just you know if you if you backed or if you were if you were a you know

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,720
a three-year-old and you saw some of this happening.

13
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,600
Oh god.

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,480
Potentially scarring for literally scarring for the characters mentally scarring for anyone

15
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,200
witnessing it.

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,960
It's like and I've said this before because I like this is such a big deal that I watched

17
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,840
Hellraiser in the last few years because it was so scary to me as a kid.

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,000
I keep talking about this like an annoying guy who's just read like his first book of

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,880
poetry or something.

20
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,640
Yeah we're in like eight time or nine time.

21
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,920
Yeah yeah yeah.

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,080
But that's the like the skin tearing is what this reminded me of from Hellraiser.

23
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,920
So like when one of the balloons goes down because it gets caught on something and then

24
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,480
like it's balloon whatever it what is the what is the material a balloon is made of.

25
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,520
Do we know do we look into this.

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not sure.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,920
I think it used to be rubber.

28
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,200
I don't think it is anymore.

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,040
Mylar is like a smaller balloon I assume but yes when it gets ripped I'm like oh my god

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,360
it's like Hellraiser it's like the skin is ripping off and the body horror is coming

31
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:05,920
true.

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,560
At least though you're you're spared in that there is nothing but just air and and white

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,280
reverse of flaps inside.

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,880
If you add blood to any of these scenarios now it's the most horrifying stuff.

35
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,640
Blood or like a skeletal system or like muscles.

36
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,400
Yeah if any of the balloons had muscles then we're really in trouble.

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,120
Yeah oh yeah.

38
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,920
You're seeing half of Barney's screaming face.

39
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,920
Someone getting whipped in the face by like a tendon.

40
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,920
Like it would be like that attack.

41
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,200
Attack on Titan character you know I'm talking about.

42
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,320
Yeah yeah the big ones.

43
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,240
When he's got like the big muscle face.

44
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,320
Yeah yeah yeah.

45
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,800
Yeah potential for grimness.

46
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,400
We'll see how scary these actually are as we dive in.

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,120
It's an interesting poll this month also because ultimately kite disasters lost to balloon

48
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,840
disasters.

49
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,000
Kite tails was in the running and it didn't make it.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,120
It was number three even but it's another thing where facsimiles of characters

51
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,680
severely injure themselves in front of a mass audience.

52
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,120
So something was in the air I guess or something I guess a lot of it wasn't the characters.

53
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,520
The characters are not in the air anymore.

54
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:25,600
From the beginning they were they were pretty upfront about like these are designed they

55
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,240
have to come down somehow you know.

56
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,400
So once they started crashing and people like these things keep crashing they're like oh

57
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,520
we're so sorry that they have to.

58
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,240
That's part of it.

59
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,200
That's part of it.

60
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,480
The crashing though clearly is like the heart of the show.

61
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,840
It's like why you watch or why anyone remembers.

62
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,800
We'll talk about how to maybe hit kites down the road.

63
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,640
If really you could like figure out a really like specific way to satisfy this hitch.

64
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,920
It's like would it be satisfying to watch like the rainy day cavalcade where all the

65
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,520
characters walk down Main Street but a couple of them break their leg while you're going.

66
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,920
Is that sort of the fun of this?

67
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,840
Yes.

68
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,440
Goofy steps weird on a crack and he breaks his leg.

69
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,800
Like it depends on how I think you need some I think you got to exaggerate it a little

70
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,040
more.

71
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,240
It's funny though it's funny.

72
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,360
The leg break can maybe you don't even catch it you know.

73
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,200
Yeah that's true but yeah it's not they're not going to have like a really like severe

74
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,080
thing with a parade to stop.

75
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,080
It'll be funny but yeah a couple characters get severely hurt.

76
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:30,960
Yes.

77
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,920
In a funny way.

78
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,560
Well there I did watch compilation and it was just called parade fails and a lot of

79
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,840
it it wasn't just the balloons they included a lot of like Disney like this float stall

80
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,600
the dragon catches on fire.

81
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,320
Yeah right.

82
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,320
And they did show a clip from Fantasmic where like all the characters on the riverboat.

83
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:00,960
Dopey loses his footing goes through the railing lands on Goofy and then lands on the floor

84
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,120
and Goofy shakes it off and keeps his streamer going and then another.

85
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,520
Never stop streaming always be streaming.

86
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:09,840
Loses his job.

87
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,640
Another costume character goes and checks on Dopey and it's just like.

88
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,560
I guess the human that there are humans inside.

89
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,440
Yeah I guess we could have like drone carried characters breaking their legs that'd be a

90
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:23,920
little less.

91
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,800
There was that patent remember we saw that a couple years ago like for drones carrying

92
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,640
like big puppets down Main Street.

93
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,600
Wow.

94
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,080
Oh yeah.

95
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,560
Remember that.

96
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,520
Yeah I think the current regulations a lot of what I have seen the drones have to be

97
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,320
far away.

98
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,160
You know you can't fly drones over people's heads.

99
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,760
You can't fly drones too close to people so that's why the night time show at Harry Potter

100
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,520
and Hollywood they can launch from where the worlds and like Disneyland Paris I think has

101
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,080
a big.

102
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,120
Let them fly over people's heads.

103
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,320
Let them fly over.

104
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,320
I want a big puppet that wears down Main Street and then can break its leg and we won't

105
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,080
feel bad about the human being inside.

106
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,320
Jack Skellington will break his leg on Main Street every night.

107
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,720
It'd be a good leg to break it's long and yeah you notice it you definitely know I think

108
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,240
he'd bounce back quickly too.

109
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,560
Yeah.

110
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,480
So that's what I want.

111
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:23,520
The the runner up not kite tails but heading into next month the Fox breaking the magician's

112
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,760
code and mass magician specials.

113
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,440
Pretty excited about this.

114
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,080
Yeah.

115
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,280
Suggestion and now it's just a matter of next month is December.

116
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,600
I feel like we need some holiday ideas.

117
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,560
So let's do this.

118
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,280
Submit your holiday ideas or your whatever ideas.

119
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,560
It tends to work when we kind of grab bag it and just whatever you're feeling out there.

120
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,360
If there's a ton of like unbelievable Christmas ideas maybe we'll hold mass magician until

121
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,360
a more secular time.

122
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:51,860
Oh yeah.

123
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,280
But but if not we'll throw them in.

124
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,600
I don't know.

125
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,480
We'll just see what happens.

126
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,600
Put your ideas in the comments but with your likes and we'll see where things go.

127
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:08,080
That was I feel like it's been a long time coming one way or another the mass magician.

128
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,640
Sure.

129
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:08,880
Yes.

130
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,560
I'm excited about that.

131
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,760
I got opinions about that.

132
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,880
I watched those.

133
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,280
You like it comes out a lot comes up a lot.

134
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,160
I'll just preview.

135
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,120
I felt very guilty watching those specials.

136
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,000
Wow.

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,480
Yeah.

138
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,680
You're breaking the code.

139
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,880
I'm breaking the code.

140
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,040
Yeah.

141
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm piece of shit.

142
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,520
And you're supporting that odd guy inside.

143
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,560
I remember the reveal of him just feeling like deflating to use the term of the opposite

144
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,160
like and who is he?

145
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,520
Some strange man.

146
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,000
It was just a strange man.

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,360
We all forget his name now.

148
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,120
Because we were all like is it Copperfield?

149
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,160
Is it Lance Burton?

150
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,640
Could it be?

151
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,480
Of course not.

152
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,200
Of course not.

153
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,040
Not one of the three we know never mind.

154
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,000
I love that Fox era of programming.

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,520
We've talked about Beyond Belief Fact or Fiction hosted by the great John and the Frakes but

156
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,600
also like Alien Autopsy shows.

157
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,040
Animals doing animals attack.

158
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,600
Yes.

159
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,320
There was a whole vibe to those shows that was intriguing and like trashy as well.

160
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,040
I watched Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire Live.

161
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,680
Oh wow.

162
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,840
With Rick Rockwell, semi real estate magnate and star of Return of the Killer.

163
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,520
Not star actor in Return of the Killer Tomatoes.

164
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,560
Darva Conger.

165
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,680
I ate up all this.

166
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,160
When you had no friends in high school the Fox network were your friends.

167
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,320
Darva Conger was your friend.

168
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,200
That was an era.

169
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,080
That was a time.

170
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,040
It really was.

171
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,540
Yeah.

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,080
But let's dig into this and let me read an excellent little suggestion word for word

173
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,680
from Eric Scanlon.

174
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,120
Thank you for submitting this.

175
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:36,960
Next one.

176
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,800
Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade Balloon Disasters.

177
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,320
Kermit, Barney, Mighty Mouse all dead.

178
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,480
Good work Eric.

179
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:46,980
Love it.

180
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,520
It's a little bit of the tone.

181
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,520
Okay.

182
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:57,600
I have some like dry beginning of Macy's Parade kind of history.

183
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,120
But just to do like kind of a streaming show style hard cold open.

184
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,000
Let me just dig in.

185
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,520
Let me just go straight to one of these and you guys might have some of these clips too.

186
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,600
But I'm just going to start at this one.

187
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,800
I think the height of Macy's Parade Disasters.

188
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,880
This here is Sonic the Hedgehog.

189
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,240
Two time balloon.

190
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,360
64 foot tall Sonic the Hedgehog was swept into a street lamp at 58th and Broadway.

191
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,880
As the balloon began deflating it pulled the...

192
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,440
All right.

193
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,720
Well it stopped there but that's fine.

194
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,240
You know it doesn't really work as audio.

195
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,560
Then that is I forgot that's the one you were alluding to Jason.

196
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,680
Yeah that's I first.

197
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,000
That's I first into a street lamp.

198
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I think knocked part of the street lamp off.

199
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,640
Some people lightly injured.

200
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,640
No one in a coma.

201
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,880
No one in a coma from this incident.

202
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,920
Not this one no.

203
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,280
Yeah not this one.

204
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,320
Yeah there's great amateur video.

205
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,280
It's got the big amateur video stamp at the bottom.

206
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,680
Just imagine you're in the closest apartment or office

207
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,320
and this happens with you have the best view on Earth of Sonic the Hedgehog ripping his eye open.

208
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,960
It's a boy it said just on a basic level.

209
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:15,040
I mean the balloons are always exciting to see but then every step of it seeing like

210
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,680
you know right here's the beginning of the puncture and here's like the you know the

211
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,720
tear of the I don't know what we're going to keep wanting to refer to the materials.

212
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,120
I don't know the materials but like seeing it start to give and stretch

213
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,400
and then that moment you can frame by frame this and it's so satisfying seeing this first

214
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,280
weird flaps form and there's something so fascinating about seeing an iconic character

215
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,240
just punctured in the eye.

216
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,280
It's nuts.

217
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,120
Yeah polyurethane is what the polyurethane thing.

218
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,880
Okay great we're going to need to know that.

219
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,520
Yeah for sure.

220
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,520
How often it is that the faces too is really I mean I guess it makes sense.

221
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,680
That's what you would line up with.

222
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,480
Yeah.

223
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,880
Boy is it just like and it's crazy in some of them where it almost feels like this weird

224
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,840
moth to flame like they're being drawn to like they're staring right at the lamp post

225
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,200
and going what is it?

226
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,760
Yeah.

227
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,800
Is that good for me?

228
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,040
Should it be on me?

229
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,560
Yeah there's a Rudolph I think because you see it at smaller cities too like

230
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:28,400
I saw Richmond Virginia and Davenport Iowa and then when they get Macy's parade there's

231
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:36,880
a dozen balloons or more but when it's a smaller city they like get one big balloon

232
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:46,000
and it's a whole thing and Rudolph very slowly hits a stoplight and it seems like he's squeezing

233
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
under it and then it just gets him in the face.

234
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,760
Yeah yeah is it in the nose?

235
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,320
I've seen that one.

236
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,040
I think it's in the nose.

237
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,240
That's fascinating that plays out so slowly and that's a good one I recall as all of them

238
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,160
are and as we will hear I mean there's not video of everything we're going to refer to

239
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:10,000
but it's one of the best aspects for sure is hearing audience of adults and children

240
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,760
because you hear the children like puncture through the audio of it hearing a big group

241
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,520
all cheering for thinking that maybe they'll make it and then being so upset when they don't make it.

242
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,680
It's a Hindenburg that you're allowed to enjoy more because nobody's getting in most cases

243
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,800
nobody's getting hurt.

244
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,920
I was gonna say we were talking about muscles and all this stuff oh imagine they were screaming

245
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,960
but there is screaming like some of them have amazing soundtracks of the audience like fully

246
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,160
following.

247
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,800
But there's some like there's a compilation I have where like there's a guy's like yeah

248
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:57,600
like so excited about it and I swear one guy yells like and man we were here we were here

249
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,840
for a bat once when one of them caves in.

250
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:06,400
Yes like blows up and like there's like a bro energy to the clip of guys like celebrating.

251
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:14,400
This is some toxic this is some limp break stuff you know that's hot the toxic masculinity yeah

252
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:20,160
yeah exactly yes no yeah the toxic masculinity just really feeds these Macy's you know we all

253
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,200
have to examine yeah yeah we were all complicit we didn't realize it yeah yeah what was happening

254
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,720
pop culturally to lead to the cheering of these balloons being destroyed.

255
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:37,600
So there's that one and there's other 90s ones that I'll bring up but just now with now that

256
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:45,760
we've gotten a quick hit of one did you guys look at all into the early days 20s and 30s

257
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:52,080
because the disasters on this parade began real quick right out of the gate this kind of thing

258
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:59,600
was happening because no matter the decade or the year wind has always been very prominent in

259
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,240
New York City in late November sure yes that is not something that's that's that's nothing new

260
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:13,280
with the times and there's really no balloons are ultimately not the most advanced technology

261
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:18,160
I'm sure they're made better now I'm sure there's some you know a digital component to the design

262
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,400
of them but ultimately you got a big dumb thing with 40 people with ropes all just trying to it's

263
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:31,120
like it's like sailboats it's like trying to cross the Atlantic oh and someone told me once like the

264
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,880
you know the the people handling these balloons are like rigorously trained and then some of them

265
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,400
go down to universal Florida because they do a brand at Macy's day parade with balloons

266
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:51,040
around Christmas time and those are real handlers like this is that's a train it's not you're saying

267
00:14:51,040 --> 00:15:00,640
it's not like volunteers just like having fun it's not from lack of trying but there's only so much

268
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:08,240
regular people can do balloons and wind never really change yeah yes well and especially just

269
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,760
because it's like when they started doing it they really didn't have it maybe down pat as far as how

270
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,840
to do things right sure yeah so well in the pain you know I feel like the the 20s and 30s are a

271
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,320
wild era of like nobody knew how to do anything and yeah yeah so there's like I don't know let's

272
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:31,360
fucking try it I don't know so uh I mean the beginning of it all right so uh Macy's Thanksgiving

273
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:39,280
parade starts in 1924 balloons are introduced in 1927 and to your kind of fuck-it point Mike

274
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,800
the reason the balloons came into the picture is because in the first few years

275
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:50,480
they did not have balloons they had live zoo animals and I when I see that all right they

276
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,240
started in 27 I was like oh what happened in 26 and unfortunately well fortunate ultimately

277
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,280
fortunately yeah nothing happened I think it was just that seeing a bunch of live animals scared

278
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:08,400
kids citywide so no more of that so how do we have a big fun component that works for kids

279
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,960
balloons and it was not too long until stuff started happening with the balloons I don't

280
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,800
think they like I don't think there were that many to begin with and they weren't really

281
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:27,200
big IP yet obviously because there wasn't that much big IP at the time 1931 Felix the cat is

282
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:33,280
the first like major uh character Mickey and Donald were not too long after that's the Disney's part

283
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,360
of it really early on but at the very beginning they sort of had to make up their own characters

284
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,800
one of which I was disturbed to see is called terrible Turk oh my god I didn't see this yeah

285
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,640
I don't know I feel that terrible turn I don't know why we're mad at the Turks oh my god um

286
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:54,320
which is just kind of a big rotund guy with a big mustache um and but then also there were

287
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:03,040
pre Felix the cat there were like characters from comics but the this is a little bit real

288
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,160
test of Jason's old timiness uh or either of you're both you might know some old timey it's not a

289
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,600
Felix thing maybe you're talking about but maybe it's a different well I'm referring to okay in

290
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:18,560
1930 here's the here's the balloons they had in 1930 Joe Jinx don't know what that is yeah Barney

291
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:24,080
Google I know I've heard of Barney Google you've heard of Barney Google that is an old comic strip

292
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:31,600
thing debuted in 1919 um from Barney Google and Snuffy Smith yeah yeah I know yeah we know these

293
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,520
guys yeah yeah yeah yeah these guys they got some cats and jammer kids oh yeah yeah oh you're right

294
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,440
you're oh you know what predating that you're right cats and jammer kids in 1829 uh-huh did these guys

295
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,760
do king features snap these guys up they might be in the family I'll look it up um the and then

296
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:56,800
the one that really jumped out at me boob mcnut I don't know boob mcnut boob mcnut uh was it from

297
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:04,160
ran from 1918 to 1934 by mcnaught syndicate different syndicate this is a comic strip by

298

300
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,200
boob mcnut started as a series of one-shot gags which usually ended with boob being tortured to

301
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,760
death for his innocently destructive ways my god rube and then it was about him like meeting uh

302
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:36,400
pearl and making her pearl mcnut but then they soon got divorced pearl mcnut this is a very we

303
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,720
got looking at that depressing sounding well then so then a new character named professor

304
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:50,880
lucifer gorgonzola butts b-u-t-t-z this was the mcu of s not as barney google and snuffy smith

305
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,160
are in the king features syndicate family damn nice damn wow the place that's the only show in

306
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,320
town the best syndicate to be in it's the number one syndicate uh wait a minute oh you know actually

307
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,160
and they still boob mcnut started with oh oddly started with king features syndicate and ma'am

308
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:10,880
maybe now today is with no syndicate oh wow i'm not sure they lost the boob mcnut they lost boob

309
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:18,560
so it's a dark day for us at king we lost boob um so that's that that's the kind of general tenor

310
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,920
of the characters that we're dealing with at this time and this is a story that is attributed to

311
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,920
felix the cat but i think the story i think that's not right i've also seen that it's just

312
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,800
the cat because maybe they weren't doing licensed characters yet so in one of these years might have

313
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:40,400
been 30 or 31 i don't know um basically this was the plan that macy's had in the early days right

314
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:46,720
what do we do with the balloons after do we need to develop some kind of deflating uh uh you know

315
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,560
procedure um no here's what we'll do it's we only got five of them right we got five balloons let's

316
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:58,320
just like give them a little extra helium boost just a little little bit of extra power then we

317
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,840
let them fly and they land somewhere they'll go somewhere and in somewhere presumably in the

318
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:13,600
greater new york uh you know upstate or new jersey area and somebody will find them and if you find

319
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:20,160
our balloons and return them to your nearest macy's we'll give you a hundred bucks in macy bucks

320
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:28,160
and at the time for if you convert it that's 1600 dollars today so that's nothing to sneeze at

321
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,920
that's a lot of you're getting a ton of clothes or bed sets or whatever yeah go check the bird

322
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:42,800
sanctuary something usually land there i want those macy bucks i gotta buy my lady a mink stole

323
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:52,880
oh it's my only shot she's gonna divorce me like pearl mcnut so that seems fine right just let them

324
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,960
go that doesn't seem like that will lead to widespread disaster immediately uh well you'd

325
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:07,600
be wrong to say that because the cat early on um okay so the the cat was just let loose into the

326
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:16,320
sky and then the first person to encounter the cat was a pilot who suddenly had not one but two

327
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:23,280
balloons on his tail and he's like is this a mistake he might have not known about the reward

328
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:29,760
he maybe is just like do i need to help do i need to be a war hero right now so he has like rope

329
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:36,160
and he unfurls the rope and he tries to lasso the cat and for a while he has the cat lassoed and

330
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,560
like what do i do now where do i even not even know it is for the macy's parade he doesn't know

331
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:47,600
what the hell's happening um and then the cat gets away oh well didn't get it um uh and then

332
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:56,960
suddenly the cat shows up in somebody's backyard in west norwood new jersey 27 miles away a lady

333
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,320
looks out the window and sees a silk and rubber cat like oh what's this is that for the macy's

334
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:08,160
parade what's going on oh no it's going into a telephone wire boom explode probably like

335
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:14,240
city's power nagdi is just on fire and imagine the materials back then imagine that on fire

336
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:21,440
imagine the material you could imagine just asbestos actually is that fireproof it's just made of the

337
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:28,720
film from the end of inglorious bastards that just these super flammable film thank god the

338
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,440
cat didn't float into an old movie theater hundreds could have died there unless it was

339
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,400
nazis and then it was good that they died yes there was no one was smart enough like why didn't we

340
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,360
just use black paint why did we have to use that blank film just the way you look at anything any

341
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,520
materials that are used like anything over 50 years ago we're like i'm surprised they didn't

342
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,960
use like the joker gas chemicals from the first batman movie to fill up the balloons

343
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,480
and then when they leaked everyone just started going nuts it's fine as long as nobody goes near

344
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,360
it yeah don't know if the balloons spring a leak everyone around it will lose their minds but and

345
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,840
yeah as long as it doesn't happen they'll be all right the city will be full of rabid maniacs yes

346
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:14,080
it will turn children into essentially like hyena people for the rest of their lives but as long as

347
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:20,560
that doesn't happen look if we end up with a bunch of fish with clownish smiles we sell the fish

348
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:26,560
you know monetize the rot as they say they're curios then sell them to that ripley and his new

349
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:34,400
believe it or not museum yeah so because of all this there's some bad pr cat caught on fire in

350
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,400
new jersey a plane tried to lasso it and macy's was like we're gonna get ahead of it this year

351
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:48,880
listen but they put out a press release or some kind listen up pilots there we will not the the

352
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,880
we're not retiring the program you get your macy's bucks if you find a balloon but it doesn't count

353
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,960
if you're a pilot and you lasso the bullet that's got to be on the ground you pilots don't get your

354
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:08,160
head started so um they get this word out there and they hope that all pilots are made aware of

355
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:13,840
this news this does not work at all there's no internet how do you make every pilot aware of

356
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:21,760
don't go after our balloons so immediately a 21 year old female pilot annette gibson

357
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:29,280
sees a different cat much taller cat named tom cat and it's like oh hey but i think maybe does

358
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:35,200
know about the reward so like oh i'm going for it and just fly straight into it maybe i can wrap

359
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,720
the balloon around the plane and then return it to the ground this is a pilot trainee at this point

360
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,960
she's just like learning for fun she's 21 all right straight into the balloon uh plane immediately

361
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:54,960
goes into a tailspin people are watching people are gasping in horror down it goes luckily during

362
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:02,640
the tailspin she's with her like trainer and they're able to trade seats as they fall and he he pulls

363
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:10,320
it up gets them out they shake loose tom cat and uh and nothing happens um she goes on to become a

364
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:17,440
major pile open like a big like a female pilot you know uh uh event or school or something i

365
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:24,160
think new Amelia Earhart um this is also like batman 80 the 89 movie where batman has to take

366
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:29,600
the balloons and gets them in the bat wing remember he collects the balloons all right and takes them

367
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,760
up in the air and lets them go up there wow well there's batman's in a bad example you can do it

368
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,320
if you have bat technology but if you're somewhere if you're a regular pilot who's just learning

369
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:47,520
he's a trained pilot yeah he is brought down by a big like long gun if you remember joker has a

370
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,480
long gun in that but he's after he gets rid of the balloons macy's was ready to do that they

371
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,920
were gonna like if any of these dirty pilots try to steal our but so anyway and they still don't

372
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:03,440
after that they still don't cancel the plan and they're still just like um balloons washing up

373
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:10,560
on riverbanks including one where uh georgie the drum major landed in long island where he was

374
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:16,960
mobbed and torn to bits 82 people tried to claim the reward money oh my god everybody's ripping

375
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:23,840
up georgie get him tear his eyes up georgie the pupil get me a fine bounty of macy's books

376
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:31,280
i want to buy some pendleton flannel shirts i need to buy some more work shirts good ones

377
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:37,680
yes so this is the starting point we aren't even a decade out and this is what's happening

378
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:43,520
with macy's uh and so they almost it almost like you think it was getting crazy in the 90s when all

379
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:50,800
these balloons are exploding but they had they had nowhere to go but down insanity wise um and then

380
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:57,120
weirdly like okay so after they stop releasing the balloons into the air for cash rewards

381
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,160
things kind of calm down a bit um but then we get into one if you you guys probably looked at some

382
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,440
like list of calls or photo slideshows of this kind of thing and there's one that that eric our

383
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:17,120
listener referred to which is mighty mouse which is kind of a like um it's a powerful almost like

384
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:26,880
war image of like mighty mouse holding one arm up like almost like help me please not so mighty

385
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,360
anymore for black and white from behind it's a it's a powerful image yeah starring image it's

386
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:39,520
yeah and he's because who's more powerful than mighty mouse no one at that time no week like that

387
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:48,640
it's haunting heroes can fall yeah um i'm bad that's the five for fighting song that superman song

388
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:55,840
plays in my head yeah yeah um so i don't know what year this was but this is another hero

389
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:04,960
one where this isn't a full deflate but it's superman and he like he made it through the parade

390
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:11,120
but the like triumphant arms out pose of superman didn't really work out like he's deflated at the

391
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,760
arms so they're just limp it looks like he's like about to take a dive in a pool yeah yeah which i

392
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:24,160
guess is not the worst most disturbing image but it's certainly not the heroic arms out flying

393
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,560
through the sky in such a no no yeah well and if you get the full like i mean look at it from the

394
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:34,240
side because it's it's so limp they have such yeah curvature i mean he looks like he's being

395
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,840
carried like he was just shot in the chest and now somebody's like wow let's get oh yeah like doomsday

396
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,360
has just killed him maybe yeah being carried his corpse is being carried by doomsday yeah new york

397
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:52,000
is hosting superman's funeral today this is getting to the we've been recording for just under a half

398
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:00,880
hour now and enough has been i feel like i watched so many compilations and so many video clips and

399
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:07,920
i was like i didn't see kermit like i didn't see super like there's so i didn't see kermit i know i

400
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:13,040
want to represent all the ones eric mentioned and kermit i don't really recall i might have seen

401
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:23,760
kermit in print there's a very robust macy's fandom site bless these fandom sites always good

402
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:30,240
stuff on there um the i saw in 1987 kermit the frog's right arm was ripped by a tree

403
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:36,560
yeah the pictures i've saw kermit are yeah i didn't see okay he's like i mean just look it up kermit

404
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:41,760
balloon disaster and his his head is just has no air in it oh no so it really looks like he's

405
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,680
melt like kermit is melted by a giant candle or something okay obviously the 90s you know there

406
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:53,760
there is so much television so much cable news and broadcast news the 90s ones are pretty well

407
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:00,800
kermit documented yes kermit at the end of uh of last crusade uh his face is melted off

408
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:07,040
oh he picked the wrong cup he picked the wrong cup he was foolhardy he's being carried by a bunch of

409
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:14,880
people in green they're all in kermit suits so he's like all his minions are like below him

410
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,200
does feel like some weird like you know death of a great leader or something everybody's everybody's

411
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,960
in a cult and they lost their their number one uh did you guys see the popeye thing that happened

412
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:34,000
it's not quite a it's not quite a disaster um but jason did you see this popeye no popeye so it was

413
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,520
like a rainy day okay the way popeyes cap was set up it was a perfect rain collector oh no so

414
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:47,040
popeyes cap was just collecting rain and then he took like a hard right turn and just like a like

415
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,320
a tidal wave hit a bunch of people oh i'm not sure if anyone was hurt because it is pretty like a lot

416
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,160
of water from a high up like uh altitude but oh no that was not that was not a regular disaster

417
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:03,280
but it's a different type of accident wow that's an innovative a new type of disaster right yeah

418
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:09,680
you didn't know was possible kermit is especially upsetting because he looks like he's doubled over

419
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:17,200
in pain yes like his appendix burster he's just vomiting i mean obviously vomiting kermit we we

420
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,480
was well documented from conan but yeah and he just looks like the the bones have been taking out

421
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,440
taken out of his head yeah yeah yeah he's been removed the bone his skull is not in there anymore

422
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,880
yeah what would have to happen to yeah you would say like for your face to have no nothing in it

423
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,880
right what disturbing accident that's like something yeah that would be i don't know if

424
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,240
there's a movie where like a villain takes the skull out of your head but that would be a scary

425
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,560
situation it's a good one yeah is it too is it too upset i was gonna say like that's like you can't

426
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,720
put that in like a marvel it's got to be for everybody no no no that's that's too upset and

427
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,200
it doesn't happen in hellraiser as far as i know there were sequels there's sequels i have not seen

428
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,280
although yeah some of it's too gross so maybe it actually did happen i didn't realize it

429
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:07,840
when you turned away yeah it's hellraiser had a skull sucking machine it's possible yeah

430
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:15,360
goes out right through the ear um here's here's what i'm gonna uh what i i mentioned this fandom

431
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,600
and they they have a list of incidents and accidents that is so overwhelming that you

432
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,200
couldn't possibly get through them all and i don't think a lot of these were even notable enough to

433
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,000
be like a thing and a lot of these didn't make it before the cameras that's a lot of the right

434
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,080
the tragedy is that you know well you know uh the the quick money wasn't in good enough shape

435
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,480
to even like be on the broadcast so many of these are not but as i was going through these here's

436
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:49,760
what i'm gonna i'm gonna read a number of these and just i'm gonna leave out the the term balloon

437
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,120
where possible so that we can just imagine this happening to the character oh cool themselves

438
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:02,800
yeah 1983 mickey mouse's arm was accidentally torn off he later exploded

439
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:15,120
betty boops moon was deflated during the march or moon okay um poor betty this is just a

440
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,320
confounding one the leaves on bugs bunny's carrot were ripped off by trees

441
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:28,480
uh-huh um humpty dumpty had his left hand and left leg deflated by a tree branch near the start of

442
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,280
the root that kind of that just sounds to me like a that's a bad that's a clunky first draft of

443
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:38,560
humpty dumpty right right this isn't quite it it's tiny that up this is a economy of words

444
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,200
uh bart simpson's t-shirt was ripped open by a lamppost

445
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:54,640
he definitely had a cow man uh um the unexpected wind demons caused woody woodpecker's left hand

446
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:01,440
to get torn by a tree and then uh 2002 cheesusaurus rex's right arm was shredded

447
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,520
the cheesusaurus rex wow i missed that one too i love that that was in there what a good yeah what

448
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,960
a good balloon i don't think we've talked about cheesusaurus rex somehow in all of the

449
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:20,560
ip and uh childhood relics jason what do you think about cheesusaurus rex what um brand was was he

450
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,160
for the tv dinners or was he for crackers craft yeah he was craft seems like you don't have much

451
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:30,320
knowledge about cheesusaurus rex well deep dive and you're a podcast the right host

452
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:36,720
well because i was i we were talking talking about rex talking about macy's tell me five things you

453
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:44,560
like about him uh cheese uh noodles okay all right story checks out cheesy okay he's delicious

454
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:52,480
no we're talking about balloons and rex my my brain immediately went to the uh we're back

455
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,160
dinosaur story oh well yeah i saw him too let's talk about we're back this this is one of the in

456
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,200
in one of those years i forgot i feel like there were a number of these accidents in one unlucky

457
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,560
year maybe it was all in the same stretch of time yes the character rex from we're back a

458
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:15,120
dinosaur's tale dinosaur story story i think it wasn't tale it was story i believe it was story

459
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:22,320
i think that's right um the character rex as voiced by john goodman and and i have a clip of this too

460
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,720
again you know you never know uh how good any of these clips are just to listen to but uh why not

461
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:35,680
give it a go well you know and to remind you guys of what happened here let's get a little taste of

462
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,200
rex

463
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:56,000
that's another one where it does it feels like he's doing it to himself in a way yeah yeah he

464
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,480
feels like kind of like a like a dumb cat or something who's like sniffing

465
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:07,440
where he's sniffing and then before you know it yeah well it's just a blank stare what's this

466
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,320
oh boy that is that his entire that entire snout tears up but that's a lot more that's a lot more

467
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,920
insta damage is done than sonic for sure yes there's yeah some of it's slow mo that that one the

468
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,960
rex one is i think would be extra disturbing as a kid because like some of them are just like

469
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,320
there's a tear in the side and it's kind of a slow deflate and as a kid you could kind of like

470
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,360
be like okay but no no rex is hurt badly yeah there's no way around it there's no way around

471
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,280
it there's also like the footage is so interesting because there's so many different like fan not fan

472
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,280
footage but it's a you know home video footage essentially so it feels like an old like disaster

473
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,000
like there's some like very like i don't know like you're watching archival footage of some sort of

474
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,400
like the hidden bird or something you're being pieced together from like we only have a couple

475
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,120
angles and thankfully somebody was here is a brutal film you know it's not like modern disasters

476
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:03,520
where we have like all these different cameras on it and footage it's pretty high quality there are

477
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,640
three angles of sonic seemingly one of these compilations does a little like side by side

478
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,120
yeah so you can pick your but none of them are as good as the one in the in the window yeah that's

479
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:18,880
true um it at times like that with when things like this happen to rex you just have to be thankful

480
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,880
that it was a character who no one has any affection for oh yeah if that had happened to

481
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,560
a more beloved yeah dinosaur like cheesusaurus rex like she's yeah the country would have never

482
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,160
yeah his accident was in 2002 and luckily it was only an arm getting shredded because

483
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,600
new york is shaky in 2002 i don't i think maybe morale wise you throw in the towel if all of

484
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:48,960
cheesusaurus explodes juliani and cheesusaurus rex together a lot of juliani in these clips

485
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:56,640
like you see it's like wow i forgot he had so much hair in the 90s yeah yeah he looks so healthy and

486
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,920
normal he was that he's quoted there's a new york times article about when there was kind of

487
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,960
a an epidemic of these things happening if this is something that could be corrected in the future

488
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,960
we'll find out what happened it's not bad i don't know i don't think we know enough to answer that

489
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:20,320
yet anytime there's an injury like this it makes you feel very very bad an injury well that might

490
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,000
have been one because there's what we don't need to dwell on this there was one where there was a

491
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,440
bad there yeah yeah so which you know is less so you meant the balloon less fun and and uh funny

492
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:36,480
nutcracker i don't know the hat there was a really oh cat in the hat was the bad one um

493
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:43,440
there are some generic ones like a nutcracker pops okay with the funniest is a candy cane and

494
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:50,080
it's just a strip blows up it blows up it deflates it's so funny it deflates so quickly in midair

495
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,120
that might be the one where like bros are like yeah you know we'll know when he's hurt you aren't

496
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:00,240
losing a beloved there's no smile on the candy cane right right right yeah so that that helps

497
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,800
you're you don't feel like you're watching a soul right right a soul escape a body as opposed to

498
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,320
um here's one from that article uh this might have been cat in the hat year um listen to this

499
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,520
this gripping description from new york times uh there was high drama as the balloon handlers and

500
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,120
the police tried to control the airborne chaos as the pink panther lurched about while simultaneously

501
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:30,960
imploding a police inspector shouted somebody give me a knife quick an officer quickly handed

502
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,000
him a five inch long knife and he punched a hole through the feline's tail a move that almost

503
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,360
immediately stabilized the balloon so it was good but i love that these scenarios now involve

504
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:48,560
now involve police officers saying yeah i gotta stab the panther hey uh did anyone ask that cop

505
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:55,040
we had a five inch knife on this person or they just let that slide i got a five inch i got nine

506
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:01,920
inch i got two inch what do you need i got every inch from one to twelve oh okay officer dommer

507
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,640
has lots of knives all right awesome well their non-union union will cover this uh right quick

508
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:15,760
you know the pink pan that was the pink panther yeah yeah mm-hmm i had to stab his tail um and i

509
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,720
think the same article deals with oh wait you know actually just sorry before we move on from

510
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,520
we're back i do want to say you don't want it to happen to any of the dinosaurs but thank god that

511
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:32,880
it was rex as voiced by john goodman and not vorb as voiced by jay Leno oh right right anything

512
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,720
had happened to vorb again morale i don't think we'd be able to we would have said no to the topic

513
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:44,800
like yeah we would have eric you expect us to you expect us to go on mike and discuss the the airborne

514
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:52,240
death of vorb no taste for taste to dig in on vorb vorb is an alien evidently an alien how

515
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:59,520
do we never i mean i was just we're back i started a list because like hoopla or toby have all of

516
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:05,280
the stuff i missed and then like you've presented a whole new one oh who's punching your library

517
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,960
card and they have a really weird collection of movies um but they have you know cool world

518
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:17,680
cat stone dance oh one of them has we're back a dinosaur story and i was like i didn't dig in

519
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,480
all of it i could have i could have see what i missed you know we've all been missing jay leno

520
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:29,200
is vorb the alien who's in the dinosaur movie yeah yes what's the plot of we're back well that's what

521
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,080
he just said um well presumably some dinosaurs are back back to the law they come back in the present

522
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:41,840
day i assume i think because i i believe you know what i read that them being dinosaurs in the parade

523
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:48,160
nodded to the plot of the film in which they try to blend in by disguising themselves as balloons

524
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,480
in the that's the balloon that's the poster yeah they are balloons in the poster that that one year

525
00:41:52,480 --> 00:42:01,360
the year with rex also had a bethoven balloon and easy the atlantic olympics six olympic yes and it

526
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:08,480
was like i think 94 so it was like two years out and they were already hyping isi oh yeah well i

527
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:15,360
like isi yeah i like isi too that summer i was at bush there was an easy wild mouse roller coaster

528
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:22,240
bush gardens really a themed roller coaster themed isi just with some cardboard like this

529
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:29,040
particle burr cutouts of isi i just say i'm sure it got quickly re-themed by 95 roller coaster yeah

530
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:35,680
it was it seems i'm getting an auto fill in for wild isi it was a wild mouse called wild isi yeah

531
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,680
boy this is wild boy you think you've heard every obscurity and then you hear about wild isi wild isi

532
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,840
yeah it's weird also they did the they did a balloon of richard jewel too two years out just

533
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:53,920
spreading awareness of the characters we're gonna learn about in 96 yeah get ready some twists and

534
00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:03,840
turns coming with this uh this security guard character um okay so uh vorb episode coming but

535
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:13,200
for now um let's talk about i think i mean i i guarantee we've talked about this and we've watched

536
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:20,080
the clip presumably on on an earlier second gate about this broader topic uh but we can't not spend

537
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:25,360
a little time talking about barney yeah it's time to discuss barney i am sure that we played the

538
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:29,680
clip and we talked about day in the park with barney um but i'm never going to turn down the

539
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:35,840
opportunity to play it again because this has the best crowd response oh yeah this is wild and he

540
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:43,040
dies in agony yes it is the most so painful it's the most exaggerated you get full body

541
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:49,840
um it's maybe the funniest character that it could happen to yeah because older millennials we had a

542
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:56,640
blood lust for barney experiencing pain and dying we hated barney we wanted barney dead so yeah yeah

543
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,680
you were offended by that

544
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:10,240
he is just the audience is like oh shocked and horrified it is like a hindu park level reaction

545
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,920
he's yeah he's like he goes a wildly swinging into the right side of the street he's got the

546
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:23,280
hole cut into his side and then he's done he's gone he's almost in two there's just back skin

547
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:30,320
keeping him together at that point and that is my favorite vocal uh iteration or you know

548
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:38,960
interjection which is oh oh no so good and the crowd they all yell because they think he's going

549
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:45,920
to like collapse on them initially like he's heading our way so they all and then yeah and

550
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:54,240
then sliced down the middle and then within two minutes he's just he is on the floor and then you

551
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:01,360
guys gotta see this i've never seen this this great like ap photograph of a helicopter angle

552
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:08,400
where he's just flattened on the ground he looks like he got shot with 200 bullets like a big

553
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,600
purple tarp it looks like he jumped off of a building yeah flat like a cartoon character

554
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:22,480
which was beauty killed the bees oh that's depressing poor barney so crazy and then okay

555
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,800
well all right here let me read some quotes from here's some newspaper quotes from uh when when

556
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:33,360
this happened the crash of barney the purple dinosaur beloved by preschoolers and loathed by

557
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:39,360
some parents was heart-stopping for those at the end of its ropes everything turned purple said

558
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:46,960
an onlooker barney attacked us said still stunned isabella faciano of hoboken after it fell police

559
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:52,080
officers rushed to puncture it with knives and relieved the tage again all right get your knives

560
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,640
do you have your seven inch yes the big day do you think like cops in new york are like kind of

561
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,680
excited for macy's because like they're like maybe we get to like stab up a couple balloons today

562
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,080
i forgot thanksgiving was coming next week so i primed a bunch of knives

563
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,520
just getting them sharp in case we need them yeah they get to like the fancy their fanciest knives

564
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:22,000
out from like a qvc knife show like just like long like pirate looking knives and stuff like

565
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,080
fancy knives there's a 40 for the set but it's 50 knives so that's a good bargain that's a good deal

566
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:36,160
i cut through 20 balloons in one morning with this thing the guy at the store told me um yeah i think

567
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:42,720
so i think i mean like you know to be to be able to do a bunch of stabbing and be cheered as a hero

568
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:50,560
yeah yeah and to yeah and to stab such beloved characters truly what is needed right now more

569
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:56,160
than anything is for you to stab barney repeatedly yeah best day of that guy's life

570
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:02,720
what what occurs to me also again if i'm like stepping back and putting the characters into

571
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:09,680
this and imagining the characters doing this oh yeah in all of these cases um i was thinking of

572
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:15,120
a term that i realized i've been saying wrong forever and maybe i'm saying wrong now but uh

573
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:24,320
here's here's what flashed to me is hara kiri this is like the oh the samurai harry kiri i think

574
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:31,360
that's wrong is what i learned oh um as i was sure i think that maybe also uh whatever it is

575
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:41,200
because i've disgraced myself with all these mispronunciations there you go take this sword

576
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:47,200
you know what you gotta do um uh it's almost especially the barney i think you could regard

577
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:53,760
it i just imagine that like because it is you know it's the samurai just like gutting themselves

578
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:59,840
that they're on sort and if you imagine like that that's what but like that this is barney like i

579
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:07,440
know i know what you think of me it's time to commit a ritual suicide on a public stage

580
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:16,000
this is what you did to me all of your mockery your s.l uh sketch with charles barkley this is

581
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:23,680
what it made me feel just is this what you want i will restore honor to my lineage what is this

582
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:31,040
for you baby bup what is the revenge me riff is rift the one with the saxophone the hard squad

583
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:40,800
that was badass barney just carry on your legacy just imagining the barney deflating

584
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,640
and riffs on the side playing the saxophone too playing baker street

585
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,640
turn turn

586
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:56,640
yeah you're going out on a high you're going out on your terms barn you're gonna live forever the

587
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:04,320
video clip of this the same with with rex from we're back imagine him just like oh yeah like

590
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:24,960
goodman animated character that biker from that not good simpsons is going to be more popular than

591
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:31,120
me here's what's happening old rex now you're not gonna have old rex to kick her out anymore

592
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:38,320
yeah there would be somebody really should just like narrate like what they're thinking

593
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,680
characters are thinking as they like plunge themselves into a telephone pole

594
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:51,760
yeah we now cut to joe dimaggio and tress mcneal standing by in case a character needs to have an

595
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:57,600
honorable death it's like i know who you're who you mean but did you say joe dimaggio

596
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:08,320
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

597
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:15,360
what's what's in sonic said why does why is sonic suicidal in 1883 well he you know sonic i think

598
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:21,040
he's just goes too fast he's just not him off a cliff a million times and he that's just part of

599
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,720
him so like like he thought it was a ring over there or something he thought it was like one of

600
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:30,240
the big rings or i'm invincible yeah i got you think i'm scared of a light pole he saw it he

601
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,360
thought he saw a chili dog stand which is of course a very common thing that sonic liked in

602
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:42,160
the cartoons but not in the games he didn't seem to care about chili dogs in the games oh interesting

603
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,880
but in the cartoons and i think in the comic books he liked chili dogs this is how that what

604
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:54,640
in the parade is how weird teeth sonic ended his life oh yeah yeah i saw the comments

605
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:02,560
i'm so sorry my brain just jumped to something and i had to look it up does anyone want to guess

606
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:11,760
the budget and box office if we're back which was the thanksgiving release for 1993 so happy 30 years

607
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,680
100 happy 30th the weekend box office is that where we're getting no overall budget and box

608
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:23,520

626
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:15,280

633
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:09,600
think all some like peak culture uh what what a time um and unfortunately after this era after

634
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:16,160
some very serious accidents occur these do uh dissipate they do start regulating these things

635
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:20,000
a little bit more it doesn't mean that stuff doesn't happen i think in the mid-2000s there

636
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,360
was a big return of wind and a big return of these accidents occurring i didn't i couldn't

637
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:29,920
find the footage of this right and look very hard but there was like there was one it was like a keith

638
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,720
herring balloon i don't know if it was like that that style of character like a big heart or

639
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:41,040
something and it briefly took out the broadcast booth and like ended the nbc broadcast for a minute

640
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:48,560
um maybe the balloon was trying to kill matt lauer maybe it was uh maybe

641
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,880
it was an attempted murder suicide for good i i have answered my own question here are some of

659
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:52,560
remember it occurred but this is like faint in my memory as like an internet thing maybe like 10

660
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:59,680
years or so ago there was like a nighttime inflating event where at the same time they

661
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:06,880
were inflating uncle sam and spider-man and they were being inflated right next to each other and

662
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,960
you wouldn't necessarily call this a disaster might be the opposite this might have been yes of course

663
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:16,400
the best day of both of their lives and here is a photo if you'd like to anyone if you want to take

664
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:21,680
a stab at describing what you're seeing right now i'm gonna let jason say it and i want him to put

665
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:28,880
it in the most blunt way he can uh spider-man's kind of going to town on uncle sam's feet no no

666
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,240
i'd say he's up a little further than the town all right but i don't know if it's on the feet

667
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:39,520
he's in a different neighborhood he's heading for the butthole he's having heading for brown town

668
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:45,840
i want you to put yourself in a place like jason from 2015 how would he describe this in a way

669
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:52,720
oh um spider-man is tossing uncle sam's salad all right that's better yeah that's more sorry

670
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:58,080
it's more classic sorry before i was a broadcaster you're so much more professional

671
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:07,280
you know black box improv theaters you know todry mind um yeah well if look if i you know i'm not so

672
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:12,960
comfortable saying certain terms but i will revive a phrase that we've said on the show yeah a

673
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,880
previous second game i will say that spider-man is eating ash

674
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,920
through the pants though at least it's through he's doing it through uncle sam's pants i mean

675
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:33,280
unless yeah i don't know if he's got some sort of contraption unless he sees his super strength

676
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,240
yeah to tear tear the pants yeah red white and blue shorts open

677
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:46,960
it's close i mean it's close to the human centipede also it's really fully there was a third

678
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:52,560
it was on the end there uh connected to spider-man you know what really makes it just subtle detail

679
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:58,720
is that spider-man's arms are on the ground oh that is crazy position yeah yeah looking forward

680
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:05,680
to this all day yes his arms on the ground means that he's been looking forward to this all day

681
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:14,000
the arms indicate it is night so at 8 a.m spider-man woke up and thought today's the day

682
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:21,280
today's the day i eat uncle sam out hey aunt may i got a big day planned today oh peter why are you

683
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:29,360
so excited well i can't tell you but i just feel like there's a new uncle in my life

684
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:37,600
and i'm very excited about him my spidey senses are tingling and i hope uncle sam i was

685
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:45,040
sorry his uncle's senses will be tingling too i hope you remember take a long shower right before

686
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:45,600
we met up

687
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:55,360
well where else to go from here i mean i said any any final details or any any like

688
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:02,560
hopes for balloon explosions in the future yeah i think obviously they're getting they're getting

689
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:06,720
a little better about all like they learn a little more each year obviously there's been

690
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:13,760
recent balloon disasters but it's like i almost wish they could do it in like more of like the

691
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,640
desert and they could really be lawless with like a parade like they could do a big balloon

692
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:24,320
parade in the desert they could really go wild as far as letting these things loose yeah where all

693
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:33,280
the characters can explode and nobody gets hurt and they can all suck and fuck happy thanksgiving

694
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:37,520
everyone yeah you're doing more a little more adjacent 2015 that jason's comfortable with in

695
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:45,600
the year 2023 with his filth but yes i think that the the lawless desert would be better for

696
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:54,560
for disaster and for uh uh coital interactions between the balloons uh uh maybe it's maybe

697
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:59,520
there's like a kind of a secondary once macy's is done the balloons go to unwind in the desert

698
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:04,960
in a different parade and that's where they can like you know let it all hang out let it all hang

699
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:10,880
out and if one wants to blow up they can if one wants to fillet another balloon they can

700
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:21,200
if jesus restores who am i gonna who am i gonna choose here um if he wants to i'm sorry if he

701
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:29,040
wants to take the quick bunny to completion which equals him blowing up from the top of his top hat

702
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:36,080
that then they in the desert it's okay yeah yeah i just had a couple notes i've got about

703
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:44,320
the nutcracker one is noticeable because it starts it's notable because it starts to falter

704
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:50,880
and then balloon handler runs up and tries to help and it immediately bonks him in the head like it

705
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:58,480
knocks oh no that's our ass over no and then uh kong breaking out of the chains yeah no i don't

706
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:06,080
want your help uh i forgot i i wrote down a cracker too yeah a generic nutcracker just getting

707
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:12,720
like owned by a generic nutcracker is yeah it's very funny and then i wrote down a superman balloon

708
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:20,000
i've heard you'll believe a man can fly but a man can die you wrote that i wrote that down

709
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:26,320
and i forgot i wrote that down that was the catchphrase for the chris for reeves uh movie

710
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:31,600
yeah you'll believe a man can fly of course yeah and now he's dead and now he's dead

711
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:39,680
uh doomsday and wind are his weaknesses yeah did you as a kid as kids i was like i got excited

712
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:44,320
when a character i liked was in the parade oh yeah i would get very excited but it is funny now

713
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:49,840
looking back that how many of these characters were already 40 years old the pink panther like

714
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:54,720
i liked the pink panther but in hindsight what did i like about the pink panther what yeah why

715
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:59,200
opening of the peters one of the peter sellers movies i saw or the cartoon that like was kind

716
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:06,480
of strange yeah i did it like like just on in syndication forever yeah but like i it's funny

717
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:11,040
that they were already doing like it was already like tuned lagoon during these parades where you

718
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:17,200
were like huh why make kids like them yeah so like king feature i wonder because how many king

719
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:21,440
feature syndicate balloons overall were were featured in general and then how many of them

720
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,440
went down this is where they make their money it's mostly balloons i looked up like dagwood

721
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,440
balloon and it doesn't seem like there was ever a dagwood yeah there was a dagwood different

722
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:36,000
balloon but it looks like it was not for the macy's parade um i'm looking up uh who is going to be new

723
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:44,160
this year and um you know let's just i'll throw this list out of the of the newbies and i hope

724
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:49,360
they all have long runs but if any of them explode this year is there a way that you'd like to see

725
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:54,880
them explode yeah um beagle scout snoopy there was a lot of snoopy had a lot of accidents through

726

728
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:16,240

729
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:21,600

730
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:30,000

732
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:46,160
yeah like you really want that kind of calling yeah voice they warned me about this but i

733
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:53,040
didn't believe them i said you could poke my tummy but not with a sharp object on the street

737
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:17,200
i don't think so i think this looks like maybe what you were wondering if they made him hot

738
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,000
well that's what they do to some of these characters they try to make them hot

739
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:27,120
not the doughboy luckily though yeah if you get him shredded then he's got no belly to poke yeah

740
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:32,880
no he they should not give pillsbury doughboy abs if that's what you're saying i do not want this guy

741
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:38,960
going to the gym i don't want any crossfit for the pillsbury dope although now that i say it uh
